A full report will be sent to the Procurator Fiscal.In Southend, Essex, a child was taken to hospital with suspected hypothermia after being spotted clinging to a dingy 300 yards out to sea.In a separate incident on Saturday, a woman died after a crash between a jet ski and a boat on the Menai Strait in North Wales.The Met Office said the heatwave is the most prolonged period of hot August weather for 17 years.Met Office forecaster Craig Snell said: \u0027For England and Wales over the next four days, there is a risk of some very severe weather in places but it is not going to be everywhere.\u0027Away from the thunderstorms, it is still going to be very hot. It is not going to be wall-to-wall sunshine, but it is not going to be a washout each day.\u0027The weather warning means there is a risk of torrential rain, hail, frequent lightning and strong gusty winds in much of England and Wales if intense thunderstorms break out. Downpours could see totals of 1.2in (30mm) to 1.6in (40mm) of rainfall in an hour, with some locations potentially receiving 2.4in (60mm) to 3.1in (80mm) in three hours. The Met Office added that these would be fairly isolated incidents.Regarding today, Mr Snell said: \u0027The warning does not imply that everyone is going to see them (thunderstorms) - a lot of places will remain dry, sunny and hot - but we will see some fairly severe thunderstorms developing over the course of the day.\u0027Western areas may be more at risk of thunderstorms than regions in the east, but anywhere in the warning area could be struck - and most parts will stay dry, he stressed.The sunshine is still set to hit the south east and there will be \u0027a high chance of 36C\u0027 in the region.Friday saw the hottest August day in 17 years, with temperatures hitting 97.5F (36.4C) at Heathrow and Kew Gardens in West London.Mr Snell said: \u0027We started this run of 30C days on Thursday, and Monday will be the fifth day where we will have those temperatures down in the south eastern quarter of the UK.\u0027Scotland and Northern Ireland may have a lesser risk of seeing thunderstorms on Thursday as temperatures start to fall away."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/100085941f6850f256b3292185f94328abb9969f/0_333_3984_2390/master/3984.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e2581daa603e66f6e95ef73e5e15689","title":"the big picture on the road with los angeles alternative schoolie movement","story":"Photographer Dotan Saguy captures an American family’s existence in a former school busMore than 16,000 people in Los Angeles live in cars, vans and buses. Some are part of the “schoolie” movement, families who have bought an old school bus and converted it into a mobile home.Photographer Dotan Saguy met Ismael and Greice Reis and their three children on the first day they arrived in the city in 2019 in their yellow school bus. Ismael and Greice were Mormons, originally from Brazil. The kids were aged two, five and 10. Saguy spent most of the year photographing the family as they tried to survive in LA in their bus. His book Nowhere to Go But Everywhere documents their progress.They had been travelling by then for six months after Ismael had given up his job as a waiter in Delaware. They had set out with a tank full of gas and $400. Casual work had proved hard to find. Their worst stories always began “Our bus broke down”. Once, in Pennsylvania, in the absence of alternatives, Ismael was forced to sit outside a Walmart with a cardboard sign reading: “Hungry, travelling with family, auto problems, please help.” He raised $200 in an hour.Though the family set out with the idea of being missionaries, they had come to doubt their faith. A different kind of philosophy had taken over, one they learned from watching The Lion King: “hakuna matata”, no worries, live for the moment. “I’m totally devoted to it,” Ismael said. “I’m not thinking about how I’m going to pay my bills next month or whether I’m running out of milk. It’s almost like you’re Tarzan swinging on a vine: in order to continue moving, you need to let go and trust the next vine will be there to carry you forward.

The retailer, known for its brightly coloured hoodies and T-shirts emblazoned with Japanese script, said the lending facility, agreed with HSBC and BNPP, would run until January 2023, replacing one that was due to expire the year before. Superdry was already struggling before the pandemic hit. Its co-founder Julian Dunkerton, who started out selling clothes on a Cheltenham market stall, returned to take the helm after leading a boardroom coup last year. The business had floundered in his absence, and he vowed to take the brand back to its design roots. “Together, we are making our way through this unprecedented period, and I’m confident we can reset the brand and deliver on our transformation plans.” Oil producers, car makers, travel companies and financial stocks are all leading the rally in European markets this morning.Those sectors are all sensitive to economic health, so are benefiting from optimism that the pick-up in Chinese producer prices and consumer inflation in July is signalling a recovery.Florian Ielpo, head of macroeconomic research at Unigestion, says China’s improving industrial data is lifting the markets: “China is so much in advance in this process of lockdowns and exiting lockdown, that any good signs for the Chinese economy is essential (for the world economy).”Traders are citing upbeat comments from Saudi Aramco’s CEO Amin Nasser yesterday. He predicted a recovery in oil demand rebounding in Asia as economies gradually open up (a forecast bolstered by today’s recovery in Chinese factory gate prices).Iraq has also lifted prices, by announcing it will cut its oil output by a further 400,000 barrels per day in August and September to compensate for its overproduction in the past three months.France’s economy continued to recover from the Covid-19 lockdown last month, its central reported this morning.“The rebound continued in July, at a more moderate rhythm, in line with the trajectory anticipated last month.”The report confirms what the Bank of France has described as a recovery in the shape of a bird wing, with a sudden jump after the lifting of lockdown measures in May, followed by a steady return toward normal. Asia-Pacific stock markets have already posted gains this morning.The pick-up in Chinese factory gate inflation, and Donald Trump’s move to unilaterally extend jobless benefits, both lifted shares in the region.Lee Hardman of MUFG explains:The main development over the weekend was the decision by President Trump to sign four executive orders to provide more fiscal support for the US economy after the Republicans and Democrats failed to reach a bipartisan agreement. The executive orders include extending enhanced unemployment benefits at $400 per week which is a reduction from recent support at $600 per week.... The fresh stimulus provided by President Trump through executive orders is better than none at all and provides a stop gap solution. Pressure remains though on both the Democrats and Republicans to reach a more substantial and durable compromise solution.Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.Markets are starting the new week on the front foot, on hopes that the global economy is recovering from the shock of Covid-19.That suggests a pick-up in demand for Chinese-made goods, as markets around the globe reopen.These signs of economic revival in China are helping traders to put aside concerns about rising tensions between Washington and Beijing. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says:The data adds to mounting evidence that the economic recovery in China is not only solid, but also gaining momentum, boosting optimism that the world’s second largest economy will offer serious support to the global economic recovery. There’s also lingering relief that last Friday’s US employment report was so upbeat, showing that 1.7m new jobs were created in July. Investors are also mildly encouraged that President Donald Trump has issued executive orders to provide temporary tax relief and stopgap unemployment benefits for Americans hit by the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.Trump is trying to swerve around the deadlock on Capitol Hill over a new package. His plan lacks detail, and comes with strings attached (and may not even be constitutional), but it might end the standoff between the White House and Congress over fresh aid.Otherwise, it could be a quiet August Monday, with the latest US job vacancy data to look forward to..3pm BST: US JOLTS report on job openings - expected to drop to 4.9m from 5.4m"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac34f4cb835b2d598cd969658f28be2f4eec31d5/0_494_4827_2897/master/4827.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e87e93c19213c64a23b6fd7cac22fa98","title":"mistakes identities dismayed readers change","story":"When a picture of Kano was used in place of Wiley, readers asked to know how it happened – and how it can be preventedAt 6am on Wednesday 29 July, an opinion piece by Owen Jones was published on the ’s website. In Tackling racism on social media is just the tip of the iceberg, the writer set out his stall with reference to the grime artist Wiley, whose recent antisemitic posts would eventually lead to him being banned from Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.The article’s main image purported to show Wiley but, as readers would soon point out, was in fact of fellow grime pioneer, songwriter and actor Kano. The picture was changed immediately after the newsdesk was alerted at about 7.45am. The paper’s head of opinion, Jonathan Shainin, followed up by apologising privately to Kano and later that day the  publicly issued an unreserved apology.Kano was, unsurprisingly, deeply upset by the incident.  had confused two black British artists and in the context of Wiley’s repugnant comments. Although all surrounding text made clear that Wiley was the subject, it was a bad error. To compound matters, it was not the first time that Kano’s representatives had cause to complain the BBC News channel and Variety online had made the same mistake with the picture over the previous weekend.Having looked into the matter, I believe it was in fact an honest mistake profoundly regretted. However, the best intentions are no guarantor of outcome, and readers rightly ask to know how the fault occurred and how a recurrence will be prevented.Jones had filed his column at 1.30pm on Tuesday. Three staff were then involved in preparing the piece before the finished version – including headline, caption and a photo – was sent back to an editor for approval about 6.30pm (writers are rarely, if ever, involved once their words are submitted). However, shortly after the piece was signed off, it was suggested that a picture of Wiley would be a better illustration than the one already chosen.A production journalist searched for a replacement image within the ’s picture library, which receives upwards of 30,000 photos a day from staff, contributors and agencies, using the term “Wiley”. Of the first eight images returned, with the most recent at the top, six were of Wiley, one of Emma Barnett, who had condemned the rapper’s comments on her BBC Radio 5 live show, and the eighth was of Kano, taken in 2017 but uploaded on 23 July 2020 following his nomination for this year’s Mercury prize.The description provided by PA, the agency that sent the photo, accurately stated this was Kano, but a secondary mention of Wiley – a featured guest on Kano’s 2016 Mercury-nominated album – had caused it to appear in the top search results. Kano was seen in profile, wearing a cap and with a microphone held close to his face. The misty stage setting looked of a piece with the concert photo of Wiley that sat alongside, creating an illusion of similarity that had already caught out two media organisations and prompted PA, alerted by Kano’s team, to issue a warning email to clients, which, due to technical error, was not sent to the .Careful reading of the agency description, displayed when a photo is selected, would have set a misapprehending journalist straight. Iniduals working on opinion and news pieces possess sound knowledge of core current affairs but are not specialist in every topic – social, political, scientific or cultural – that crosses their desk. The abiding instinct to doubt and check is therefore vital.So is an extra pair of eyes. In this case the production journalist was now working alone from home, swapping out the photo as a last task before finishing for the day. The story was scheduled to publish next morning. No one saw the page again until readers did.This was the second time in a week that the  had used a picture of the wrong person of BAME background. Two days earlier an article about the death of Denise Johnson of Primal Scream had for the first 60 minutes carried a photograph of another black singer. And a day after the KanoWiley mix-up, one of the pictures in a live football blog claimed to show Brentford’s Julian Jeanvier challenging a Swansea player, although Jeanvier never left the subs’ bench. In both cases, fault was assisted by incorrect information supplied by Getty Images, who have apologised for any offence, issued corrections and pledged to improve their captioning processes.Most major media organisations rely on trusted agencies, who are contracted to provide news and pictures, but responsibility for accuracy rests ultimately with the publisher.Since the start of this year, my office has been aware of 17 instances in which a person has been misidentified by the  globally (there may be more that do not reach me). In February, Scotland rugby player Huw Jones was mistaken for teammate Sean Maitland, while a still from the romcom Crazy Rich Asians misidentified actor Sonoya Mizuno as Constance Wu. In March, an obituary of Jack Welch, chairman and chief executive of General Electric, briefly carried a photo of the company’s former vice-chairman, Bob Wright. And in April the national medical director of NHS England, Stephen Powis, was captioned as Patrick Vallance, the UK government’s chief scientific adviser. Six of the 17 involved BAME iniduals. We will keep monitoring this.Mistakes inevitably occur in a fast-paced news environment but mistakes with people’s identities are disrespectful in any circumstance, and hurtful in some. The reflection that has followed these latest incidents will, I believe, prove beneficial. Opinion has modified its sign-off procedure so that editors must recheck pieces when pictures have been changed. Other departments will want to follow suit where this process is not already in place. And the picture desk – which does not choose every image for the many hundreds of stories published daily – has proposed sensible extra layers of verification, especially on sensitive topics or where iniduals are unknown to the person editing the piece. Greater ersity of all kinds among teams handling photos would broaden subject reference points.Extra checks will add time but are all the more important in a home-working environment, where the opportunity for a quick huddle that might prevent such errors has been lost. Speed may still be unavoidable when breaking news and hard deadlines meet, but otherwise it is worth remembering that there is less shame in slowing down than in stumbling.• Elisabeth Ribbans is the  and Observer’s global readers’ editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f45cf1a31b0115466b873d747358e39210d2453/0_360_2625_1575/master/2625.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efa98fb1ef5cec60d4d1a81f2c4dfde4","title":"detectorist in scottish borders uncovers bronze age haul","story":"Sword dated from 900BC among ‘nationally significant’ items found by Mariusz Stepien Metal detectorists, it’s fair to say, have had a good lockdown. Last month it emerged that amateur treasure hunters had unearthed dozens of rare finds in their back gardens while restrictions kept them at home.Now a detectorist in the Scottish Borders has uncovered a haul of bronze age artefacts – including a complete horse harness and preserved leather and wood – in what is described as a “nationally significant” discovery.Among items also pulled from the ground after Mariusz Stepien’s initial find in a field near Peebles was a sword dated from 1000 to 900BC.Stepien had been metal detecting with friends on 21 June when he came across a bronze object buried half a metre underground. As he received such strong signals from the earth around the object, he reported the find to the Treasure Trove unit.The moment of the find was emotional. “I felt from the very beginning that this might be something spectacular and I’ve just discovered a big part of Scottish history. I was over the moon, shaking with happiness,” he said.Archeologists spent 22 days investigating the site, during which Stepien and his friends camped in the field. “We wanted to be a part of the excavation from the beginning to the end,” he said. “Every day there were new objects coming out which changed the context of the find, every day we learned something new.“I’m so pleased that the earth revealed to me something that was hidden for more than 3,000 years.”The archeologists found the sword, still in its scabbard, which had been adorned with straps, buckles and chariot-wheel axle caps, alongside remnants of a decorative “rattle pendant” that would have hung off the horse’s harness – the first to be found in Scotland and only the third in the UK.Treasure Trove, which is overseeing the recovery and assessment of the find, said the soil had preserved the leather and wood found among the items, allowing experts to trace the straps that connected the rings and buckles together to make the harness, something that has “never been seen before in Britain”.The unit’s head, Emily Freeman, said: “This is a nationally significant find – so few bronze age hoards have been excavated in Scotland. It was an amazing opportunity for us to not only recover bronze artefacts, but organic material as well. There is still a lot of work to be done to assess the artefacts and understand why they were deposited.”With detecting in the open off limits between March and May, many amateurs looked closer to home during lockdown, and in July, the Daily  reported that a post-medieval belt hook, a quern and a medieval seal matrix were among some of the treasures uncovered in gardens by detectorists.Peter Reavill, a finds liaison officer from Shropshire, said: “With so many people spending so much more time in their gardens, there have been some really interesting finds. I’ve seen some tobacco pipes, some pieces of pottery and even prehistoric flint tools.”Simon Maslin, a finds liaison officer in Surrey and Hampshire, said he had seen some spectacular finds that had provided insights into local history. He said: “It’s the stuff that appears more humdrum that actually tends to be more archeologically important.”Fionntan Hughes, a schoolboy who received a metal detector for his 10th birthday, found treasure the first day he used his present, unearthing a sword thought to be about 300 years old. Hughes, from Derryloughan in County Tyrone, found the sword buried on land near his home late last month.The latest hoard has been removed from the site near Peebles in a large block of soil and taken to the National Museums Collection Centre in Edinburgh where further excavations and research will take place."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92affcac648deb900f6acbfe2721cfebf04fe3fd/0_2_6016_3609/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7dd587107860917497dec10dcbba5d1c","title":"a level students tell us how youre feeling about getting your results","story":"We’d like to hear from sixth form students about the upcoming results dayThis week, the Scottish Qualifications Authority came under fire after admitting it downgraded nearly a quarter of all the recommended A-level results, heightening existing fears that school leavers’ grades would be negatively impacted by the pandemic across the UK.However, some assessment experts have said that this year’s results, based on a combination of teachers’ recommendations, class ranking and the past performance of their schools, and statistical modelling by examiners, will be fairer than ever.As results day approaches, we’d like to hear from students about how they’re feeling, and what they’re expecting.You can get in touch by filling in the form below.

They casually dish out hugs, wipe tears and help blow snotty noses, all without any hint of anxiety or signs of protection. These people work in children’s nurseries.I found it so strange to see people, as a matter of routine, put aside the messages coming out of press conferences around the world about the risks of being in close contact with others. It’s something they have to do each time they pick up and hug a crying and blubbering child. They don’t reach for masks and gloves, but for the kids instead.Leaving the outside world full of people in masks and gloves dodging each other on buses and in shops, ever vigilant of their own personal buffer zones, and coming into the local authority-funded nursery is like going back in time to when other people weren’t a mortal danger to us all.But they tell me it has to be this way. Without normality and contact and support, the children will suffer. Just as plants need water and sunshine, children need a loving and caring environment. As the Harlow experiment from the 1950s and 60s showed, primate infants will forgo food for care and contact, and whether the people in the nurseries know of this experiment or not, they are all convinced that without care and contact the children will suffer.They are so sure of this that they are willing to place themselves in harm’s way. Of course they take precautions, such as constantly cleaning, but you’re fooling no one when you pick up a blubbing child that then tries to bury itself into your neck.These people’s radiant beliefs are so tangential to those that result in empty clapping outside No 10 that I find it almost hard to find my bearings, until I’m back on the streets and surrounded by sideways glances once more.“I’ll be honest, at first, it was quite frightening. I’m sure we’d all like to stay at home and keep safe, but that’s just not the way the whole world works. I’d imagine the parents that have to go to work too, and how they feel leaving their children. It’s so important for their day at work, that they know that their children are safe and happy at nursery. I’m a mum, and I’m a key worker, and that for me would mean everything.“I imagine that they’re going to work every day frightened – will they get ill, what will happen to their child, how are they going to keep the roof over their heads? And so allI could do is come into work myself and put my best foot forward, thinking if we can make their children’s life a little bit better, it’ll make their day a lot better too. At least they know that their child is safe. And so I just thought, come on, you know? My son’s safe, he’s out of harm’s way. And as long as I keep myself well, I can keep on doing what we’re supposed to be doing.“But I also wanted to show my son a good role model: that through tough times, through uncertain times, I can still get up and be positive, and bring a little bit of positivity to the children here in the nursery too, because they don’t really understand what’s going on. It’s quite frightening for them – the world’s changed all of a sudden in their eyes. So I just thought, I’m a mum, come here to the nursery and let the children’s parents know that they’re in safe hands – that was my everyday get-up-and-go thought.”“Kids require contact because they need the reassurance that that brings. You’ve got to understand that these are very young children, and they’re still very vulnerable. They need to feel like they’re in a secure and safe environment, and so you have to show them that kind of love. It’s just not possible to stand 2 metres away from them, wearing a facemask and gloves. Your face is one of the primary ways in which you communicate with a young child, especially as a lot of the time their language isn’t there yet.“If we’re treating the children differently from how we did before this whole situation – if we were not giving them cuddles, if we were not being attentive to their needs, if we were not in close proximity with them – then they’ll pick up on that, and we’ll have a bigger problem because the children won’t feel safe and secure.“To be honest, it didn’t really bother me being in close proximity with others while everyone else in the country wasn’t, because I know what this job entails. To do it properly, you need to have that tactile environment, and so there’s no point in saying I’m not going to do X, Y and Z. You’ve just got to get on with it.“We’re not doing anything different now, we’re still doing what we were doing in January, in November and last summer, and that is to provide children with a really stimulating, loving and caring environment in which they can flourish. It’s as necessary for a child as sunshine and water is for a plant.”“With Covid, we are much more thorough with the cleaning. Previously we’d clean the toys, tables, door handles and surfaces probably twice a day, but now it’s every 30 minutes. That’s a major, major difference, and it’s taking up much more of our time.“Another is splitting the rooms. So for example, the toddler room now has no more than 10 children, although before it was more like 20. And it’s going to be an ongoing challenge because we’ll need a lot more staff to be in different areas. And even a lot more rooms.“I think everyone needs to understand that with children it’s not possible to social distance. They don’t understand, and you can’t just tell them ‘don’t hug your friend’ or ‘don’t go near your friend’ – that would just create an atmosphere that’s really negative for the children. On the one hand, you’re aiming for everything to be as normal as possible, but at the same time we have a duty to ensure that the environment is safe and that we’re following the guidelines that are set out by the government, though much of that is confused. “The management here are trying their best with the information that they’re being given by the government, but so much of that doesn’t seem to take into consideration that every centre is different, and that they can’t all just adapt and do all of these things that they’re telling us to do. It’s just not possible. For this reason, I think that the way we’re currently working is just not sustainable.“Before we had a much closer type of communication with the parents. They could actually come into the centre’s classroom and directly drop their children into the room, and see them go off and play with their friends, whereas now we just straight away take them from their parents and take them into the room ourselves. And at pickup we have to take the child to the entrance to meet their parents, and if you’re trying to give feedback to, say, five parents, it’s a little bit awkward and rushed, and so the parents might feel like they’re not really as involved in the centre as they were before. They don’t actually know what’s going on behind closed doors, and they don’t see the beneficial changes that we’ve made.“Because of the fear and anxiety of parents, some of the children might not come back to school. It is a worry for me, especially as a practitioner, knowing that some children are going to be left without an education, especially those children who are vulnerable and who need more of a push than other children. To accept that as a reality, is quite disheartening.”“These children’s parents are working on Covid wards, they’re GPs having to do emergency appointments, they’re seeing people face to face, and when they’ve finished their shift they’re coming to us. We open that gate, and what do they want to see? A child with a smiley face, that’s really tired and has had a really great day. The kids pick up on the slightest thing, so if you’re stressed you’ve got to turn it on. You want their journey through Covid to be as positive and happy as it could be.“I do think that there are some people, including myself at times, who have been in quite a fragile state of mind. I’m exhausted, more so than I ever have been, because you’re using your nervous energy. You’ve got worries as well, so you don’t sleep as well as sometimes.“When I get back home I’m exhausted. I use the buses as I don’t drive. And then it’s wash your hands, take your clothes off, have a shower – and I make sure and I’m wiping down everything in my home too, so it’s not just your shift here. But you do feel a sense of achievement, and I do feel that you need to have that, in order to go home, rest, eat some nice food, have a glass of wine and then come back the next day.”“The age group that I work with are too small to understand anything to do with Covid. Some of them don’t even speak yet. And when a baby cries, you can’t just leave them crying over there with you watching. They’re babies, we can’t do that. Even with the older children, when they come for a hug, you can’t just tell them to keep a distance.“It was weird in the beginning because, despite what I said about hugging the children, those children are coming from outside and we don’t know where they have been or whether they’ve had contact with anyone else, and so of course it was worrying to be at work and then go home and see my family, my two children and my husband, after that. But I can’t just tell a child to stay away from me. I can’t do that. They’re too small, they don’t understand that and they aren’t gonna get it.“In the classroom, we’ve had to remove everything like rugs, soft toys, blankets, Lego, books – everything. And the toys which we have kept on our floor, we have to spray them every single day to wash them and make them ready for the next day. So we make sure we spray everything, which is a lot more work, and you have to do it every day for them because they do touch it, in fact everybody touches it, or maybe they put in their mouths. So I make sure it’s nice and clean for them as well. They need it done for them.”“At first the pandemic was scary, but we have to face it. I think that if it’s meant to be, it’s meant to be. You can’t lock the door and stay away from it. And if you accept it, it’s not difficult. Then you don’t feel like you’re scared or vulnerable.“The first two weeks, I didn’t go out as I was off from work. And then, when I did go out, my eyes were hurting from the sun as it was so bright. And so from that day I said I’m not going to stay inside all the time because it’s not good – not for your brain, for your body, or for everything else.“Some children here are coming from other nurseries, and that transition for them is very difficult. You need to make them both come here and be happy, all at the same time. It’s easy to put pressure on yourself, but when you do, the children get pressure as well. So first, the adults have to become calm, to get nice and smooth, and then the children will be too.“Without contact, it’s no good for them. It’s no good because children, when they play, they talk and move, and their brain and emotions develop. When they communicate with friends, they pick up speech. When they move, they become strong. So we just have to be calm, and then do as normal.”“This is the foundational stage for the child, one where they start to develop, and if they miss something there can be under-development. It’s important that they create a bond with people, with significant others, and with the people next to them. And if you are distant, you cannot create this bond. Instead you will disconnect with the child.“Children like to play, and if I say to them ‘no, no, don’t come to me,’ the child can look at me confused and ask ‘why don’t you want me? Yesterday you were playing with me, but today you won’t play with me?’ It’s very important for them to have continuous care and continuing provision, both educationally and emotionally, and if you’re far away from them, you lose this connection.“Without this, a child might start to cry, become very quiet or withdraw. If this happens at this age it could have a detrimental effect on the child, educationally and emotionally. But I think, in my personal opinion, the effect is more emotional, because at this stage the child needs this emotional support, and this attachment, to develop a better foundation.”“I’ve been at this nursery for 30 years, and in that time I would say this is the biggest challenge I’ve had to face, because it’s unlike anything we’ve ever known before. Friday was the announcement you’re going to close, and Monday we were back open just for vulnerable children and the children of key workers, all from different places.“So the phone started ringing and the referrals started to come in. I think the challenges were: how do these children adjust to new environments? What could we do to make sure that they had a good transition, to reassure parents from home, and send out messages and activities to them? We were really, really busy, with a small skeleton team. Myself and Fiona, the deputy manager, have worked really closely with Nick from Haringey council, and that’s been really instrumental in terms of advice and support.“I don’t think we have come up for air yet. Every day brings a different challenge. You come in and something’s changed, for example more calls for places for children whose families are key workers.“Previously we were offering places to 130 families, and now we’re accommodating 77 families, which is a lot of children in this environment. We’re working at a high percentage. But there are families staying at home who are not now having that face-to-face contact, and are not having their issues resolved quickly. Like before, a parent would come up and say: ‘Can I speak to you for a minute?’ And I would always make time. I’d have a little conversation, share a few techniques, and within two or three weeks that stress is over. But now it’s very different, which is a worry.“In general, looking at the national picture, I’m very worried, and not just educationally. By only staying home, children’s socialising and wellbeing is compromised.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69a30b16c378c75e6676425a7979f02693daad4e/0_501_3543_2125/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6df9da531bf5992f62cb0f3a64530538","title":"blue marlin sportfishing conservation","story":"The majestic fish inspired Ernest Hemingway but as numbers falter alternatives to landing the ocean giants are finding favourAs a child, I strolled the docks during the Big Rock tournament in Morehead City, North Carolina. Fishermen strung huge marlins up by their tails. Bills down, the marlins’ flashing silver bodies drained to a dull blue-gray. Awestruck, people posed for photos with the dead fish, as they do today.To reel one in, according to Dr Ellen Peel, executive director of the Billfish Foundation, “is almost like ballet. It takes a lot of orchestration and choreography. Everyone has their job. It’s a fascinating team sport to watch.”A blue marlin fishing tournament is a spectacle to behold, and potentially a windfall. This year Michael Jordan and his crew – on his $8m, 80ft convertible Viking sportfishing yacht Catch 23 – brought in a 442.3lb marlin, good enough for fifth place in the Big Rock Tournament, which paid out over $3.3m in prize money in 2020.Male marlins generally stop growing at 250-300lb, so sportfishing tournaments usually bring in large female fish. “The bigger they are – the more eggs they’re going to produce,” says scientist Dr John Graves. “Focusing on the biggest females is probably not the best thing to do for the future of the species.”Atlantic blue marlin, who are highly migratory and aggressive predators, are one of the largest species of bony fishes, beginning as microscopic larvae and reaching lengths of more than 16ft. Revered by Ernest Hemingway – who chased the fish for decades from outposts in Cuba and Key West, Florida – the blue marlin’s legendary spirit was immortalized in The Old Man and the Sea.I ask Graves why people continue to sportfish a vulnerable species.“Blue marlin fishing is like watching paint dry for most of the day – but when it happens, it’s very exciting,” he tells me. “White marlin and sailfish don’t come in with the same attitude. When a blue marlin comes in and crashes on the bait – there’s a hole in the water. They’re so aggressive. They go ballistic. Lots of jumps, lots of greyhounding. They put out an awful lot of energy in doing it. With a big fish, it’s quite a spectacle. Plus, the fact that they can get so big makes them a desired target.“In most tournaments,” Graves says, “the vast number of marlin are released. If the fish isn’t larger than 400lb, it isn’t going to win. If you bring in a smaller fish, it doesn’t look good for you or your boat.” But given the prize money structure at many tournaments, fish do come in, and fishermen hope to land one of the six-figure payouts.“A dead billfish on the dock – in any country – brings very little value to anyone except those in poor nations who need it for protein,” Peel says. “We recognize that these tournaments bring a lot of money to coastal communities. But it’s also about human dynamics and how we respond to money.”The historic Albatross Fleet of Hatteras, North Carolina, epitomizes tradition. In 1937, Ernie Foster’s father designed the first boat built for the purpose of offshore charter fishing in the state.“The first marlin were caught near the Carolina coast in 1939 – but the winds of war were upon us,” says Foster, a genteel retired school teacher in his 70s. “There was no publicity for it. But in 1951 my father caught a 475lb marlin. Dare county’s publicity agent sent the picture to sports pages all over the country. That immediately turned Hatteras into the place where you wanted to go to catch a Blue Marlin – other than the Bahamas and Puerto Rico.“In 1962, I was a mate working for my uncle. We caught the world’s record for the blue marlin at the time – 810lb.” That fish now hangs near the Hatteras library as a public monument.But as much as the Foster family did to bring marlin sportfishing to North Carolina, they also helped promote an important catch-and-release ethos.“In the summer of 1958, Dr Jack and Ellie Cleveland came to Hatteras on their honeymoon from Connecticut,” Foster says. “They were fishing with my uncle Captain Bill and caught a marlin. When they got him up to the boat, they did what people thought was the craziest thing they had ever heard of. They told my uncle to release the fish. And that was the first blue marlin ever released off this coast.“The reaction was fairly uniform,” Foster says. “Derisive comments and snide remarks. Now it’s the other way around. Now you have to justify bringing in the fish.”Foster, who chose teaching so that he could fish in the summers and carry on his father’s business on Hatteras, remains under the spell of marlins. “They’re powerful. When a marlin explodes on the bait and takes off jumping – there’s nothing else like it in the fishing world,” he says. “Their stripes are a vibrant blue. Their pectoral fins are a real bright blue as well. When they come in lit up – you’ll pay attention.”The fishery is overseen nationally by Noaa, and internationally by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). These organizations manage the fishery with an eye toward maximum sustainable yield – not conservation. In the mid-90s, Graves says there was little support for measures to help billfish. Most countries were focused on commercial target species, such as tuna and swordfish.The first measures to protect marlin were introduced in 2000, to reduce accidental bycatch in commercial fishing gear (such as trawls and longlines) and request landing reports. Countries are now required to release all live animals.The US is limited to a total recreational catch of 250 combined blue marlin, white marlin and roundscale spearfish each year. Dr Peel estimates that about 77 blue marlin were landed in fishing tournaments last year.“Does it make a difference in the stocks? Probably not,” she says. “But it’s about sportfishing integrity, and a demonstration that we’re committed to doing what we can to help conserve the species.”She admires tournaments where marlin aren’t brought in to the docks but the excitement of the catch is shown on the jumbotron or social media. “You catch the fish, but then they should be properly resuscitated. You slow the boat down, keep the fish at the side, and move forward slowly so that oxygen continues moving over the fish’s gills. The fish has a better chance of living. You want to leave a feisty fish in the ocean.”One thing a photographer, scientist and a sport fishermen agree on: an excited blue marlin is a phenomenal thing to witness in the wild.“It was 1996,” he says. “I was ing and shooting 12 miles off the coast of Nassau, around the US navy’s buoy near New Providence Island. I was out there – maybe 20-30ft deep – to photograph mahi mahi and silky sharks.“I love that blue water pelagic zone. You never know what you’ll see. Suddenly, I look down and see this blue marlin racing up from the depth. It was definitely agitated – hunting or pursuing something. The marlin saw me – with that big eye – and did a jackknife. He was flashing a little bit. It was the stuff of dreams.”Skerry has photographed hundreds of species, but says, “These large, enigmatic billfish that ply the deep ocean are some of the animals that most stir my soul. We really don’t know much about their lives. That morphology! The bill. The giant eye that makes them the king of the deep. They can see in low light. They’re such magnificent creatures.”“They are the ultimate fish,” fisherman Ernie Foster says, somewhat wistful. “If you told me I could see one more fish caught in my life, it would be an excited blue marlin.”“Fish,” Hemingway once wrote, “I love you and respect you very much. But I will kill you dead before this day ends.”If the blue marlin is to survive the forthcoming radical changes to its ocean environment – and wasteful deaths in commercial fishing line – sport fishermen may need to forgo killing a fish they love in order to help save it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd2a07feb67a48f6cbaa89707462b14f659dc0c2/0_137_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f518b3f035e8d7555e5fca058812472","title":"we love fashion fixes for the week ahead in pictures","story":"Mother Denim launch new Aura collection, plus beach towels made from recycled plastic bottles, and slippers built to last"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de69b7fe4d21e3163fe05edec761bccc5aeffd59/178_125_2940_1764/master/2940.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=610b8ea0c04414357d563a3e16058052","title":"liverpool xg jurgen klopp","story":"Jürgen Klopp’s side coasted to the title yet were the league’s second-best team according to the popular metric. Are Liverpool baffling the boffins – or are we missing the point?There was just the faintest whiff of schadenfreude about it. A table had been published showing how the Premier League would have finished if it were decided by expected goals. “Look,” a colleague said, “according to xG Manchester City should have won the title by 13 points.” In fact, over the past two seasons, Liverpool should have had 39 points fewer. It pained the colleague to say it, but might Jürgen Klopp have exposed the limits of nerdery?Seeking to show whether a given shot is a good chance, whether it should have gone in, xG is one of many metrics used in football analytics. It is, however, the first to move into the mainstream. It is featured (after the corner count) on Match of the Day, it pops up in analysis articles and is widespread on Twitter. It has also become a focal point in the debate about how far the magic of football can be distilled into numerical form. So when an xG league table looks so far off the real thing, people start asking questions.It also provides a good excuse to talk with Ted Knutson, one of the most respected ambassadors for football analytics. An American and a former gambling professional, Knutson is best known for his work establishing Brentford’s analytics-based approach. It was a tough week for him in that regard (of which more later) but his explanation of Liverpool’s second-placed finish in the xG table is conciliatory towards those who don’t trust the data.“You can put the difference down to having really great talent,” he says. “Having a great goalkeeper like Alisson will help you give up fewer goals. Part of it is a little bit of luck. But I think there’s stuff Liverpool do that’s not in the expected goals model.“I’m not going to be specific about that but at a certain point when you have had the second and fourth-best Premier League seasons ever and the expected goals models don’t really reflect that, maybe you’ve got some stuff going on that is beyond the model.“Liverpool, as good as they are, they don’t have that. So they have learned over the last few years to be able to manage games. Once they get that second goal, especially, they defend well but probably don’t spend so much time exhausting themselves on the pressing side of it.“I think those two things are reflected in that table. Liverpool do not always put their foot on the gas. But it’s also a little bit how the data and the models don’t reflect some of the edges that they have found and been able to exploit.”Since xG went large – it first appeared on Match of the Day in 2017-18 – Knutson says there has been a more welcoming approach to analytics within club boardrooms. Knutson’s company, Statsbomb, consults with a number of clubs in the Premier League and several on the continent, including Paris St-Germain.One club characterised by a lack of mistakes, before their goalkeeper David Raya went walkabout in the play-off final at least, is Brentford. With promotion so narrowly missed, however, there will be questions over whether Thomas Frank’s eye-catching side can come again.“I think the hardest thing for teams to do in football is rebuild, we have seen this over and over again,” Knutson says. “Brentford have sold stars since they first came up to the Championship but they still manage to keep getting better and keep aggregating value."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efdcdbdd5f78ddc1c50213729cfb72be0c660b1b/0_46_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8c16d8f923a37e5a52d30e97e3eb44c","title":"solskjr hoping anthony martial can stay on target against fc copenhagen","story":"Ole Gunner Solskjær has praised Anthony Martial for building up his physique in extra gym sessions that have transformed him into a “powerhouse” centre-forward.The Frenchman’s goal in Wednesday’s 2-1 Europa League win over Lask was his 23rd of the season, putting him one ahead of Marcus Rashford’s tally in what is a career-best campaign.Martial’s play has been accentuated by a more robust presence and he is now often able to shrug off defenders when running in on goal. It was put to Solskjær that Martial has become a powerhouse No 9. “Definitely. Anthony has made huge strides this season in many aspects of his game,” the manager said.“I like him scoring, him being in between the posts, scoring the simple goals – we know he can do worldies, like he’s done a few times. He’s in the gym a lot working on his fitness and strength. The staff have done a fantastic job with him. Physically, he is at the best level of his career and I’m just looking forward to seeing him improve. There’s more to come from him.”With Mason Greenwood also scoring 17 times Solskjær’s three forwards have contributed a total 62 goals. The Norwegian believes competition between them only raises standards. “Scoring goals is always good for strikers, seeing others score goals – it gives you as well a little bit of an edge because you don’t want to be behind them,” Solskjær said.“But you also play for the team and the three of them have been backing each other up. For me I hope they will continue their development as it will make for exciting times for United in the next few years.”For Monday’s straight knockout Europa League quarter-final against FC Copenhagen in Cologne, Solskjær has a selection dilemma regarding whether to retain Sergio Romero, who he often selects for cup competitions, or choose David de Gea, his regular No 1.“Sergio has shown how important he has been for us and for me, David is always performing. It is difficult, yeah. But it’s a nice problem to have.”Copenhagen were last Danish champions in 2018-19 and in Ståle Solbakken have a manager who is a compatriot of Solskjaer’s, the two knowing each other since their playing days in Norway. In two tenures at Copenhagen Solbakken has claimed eight Danish titles.Solskjær is clear that no pressure has been relieved by his team’s third-place Premier League finish. “I don’t think so because we went into this season knowing the Europa League is a great chance for us – to try and get a trophy but also to groom a few of the youngsters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91f67ad05b2c76bcdd6313acdcb7c6075129e603/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60c5ac3c69daa76f799013165b85436b","title":"im 21 and ive never been kissed six people on big experiences they havent had","story":"We all remember our first kiss… but what if it hasn’t happened yet? And what about swimming in the ocean, riding a bike or going to the cinema? Amelia Tait talks to six people about things they haven’t doneI’m a very introverted, shy person. I don’t like to be hugged or touched. I think it has to do with my parents – they’re not touchy-feely and I’ve never seen them show each other any physical affection. My mum didn’t say “I love you” to me until I went to college. I was so shocked I forgot to say it back.I hung around with a lot of Christian girls in high school and they were adamant about not dating anyone. I didn’t drink or go to parties and none of my friends had boyfriends. Since getting to college, I’ve been on dates with guys, but I’ve dodged kissing. A year ago I was on a date with a guy and we were at his place watching a movie and he put his arm around me – I immediately said I had to go. It freaked me out so much that I haven’t been on a date since.I don’t really know why it scares me, but when it comes to fight or flight, I’m flight all the way. I think it’s anxiety – I don’t like going to the grocery store by myself or things like that. I wish I could just get my first kiss over and done with, but I can’t let it be some random guy. I’m excited to find the right person, but I think movies make relationships look too perfect. In real life, they can be pretty toxic. I don’t want that for myself.I don’t go out of my way to tell people I’ve never been kissed, but all my close friends know. Everybody thinks it’s fine. Up until a couple of months ago my best friend who I met in college hadn’t been kissed either. I was happy when she got a boyfriend they’re perfect for each other. It doesn’t bother me, because it’s not my time – everything happens for a reason.For now, I’m playing it by ear. I believe in the butterfly effect – once you do something, it sets you up for a different track in life. I don’t want to put too much pressure on myself – I know it’s eventually going to happen.I come from a family of bookworms. I remember a lot of Saturday afternoons spent with my brother and parents going in and out of bookshops when I was a child. For me, it didn’t spark any interest. Mum used to sit next to my bed and try to encourage me to read the Harry Potters, but I just wasn’t engaged.When I was 13 I read the whole of Anne Frank’s diary, but I didn’t read my GCSE English book, Lord of the Flies. I actually went to university and read English language and linguistics. I had to read, but I wouldn’t read a complete book I’d only read enough to get through the course.I work in the food industry now and I’ve tried choosing novels and nonfiction related to food and cooking, but even those don’t engage me. I’ve taken the same cookery science book on holiday for the past six years, but still haven’t finished it. I’d rather sit still and look at a view than read a book.That’s just how it is – some people don’t bake, some people don’t paint. I don’t read. When I was growing up it might have stalled my vocabulary a little, but there are other means of learning things. Other people may think I’m missing out, but I know no differently. I don’t feel as if I’ve deprived myself. I had a decent education and I don’t feel like it’s hindered me at all.My main interest is cooking – I feel the same escapism in the kitchen that I imagine a lot of other people find in reading a book. I love being outside, walking, sitting in the garden, painting, drawing and photography. It’s not like I’ve lost the ability to read, but I’d definitely rather spend time baking a cake than picking up a book.I’ve never left the UK. Never. I’ve never even had a passport. I’ve not even travelled much inside the UK – many, many years ago we went to Wales when I was a teenager, but I haven’t been on holiday since. In my adult life I haven’t done any travelling at all.The main reason is because I don’t have anyone to go with – I don’t have a wife or kids or anything like that. If you’ve never travelled before, it’s quite a big thing to do on your own. I don’t feel as if I can just hop on to a plane to the Middle East, because I’ve never done it before. And as I’ve never done it, it’s not something I’ve ever really missed. In my mid-20s I started to realise I was unusual, because that’s when people were going on gap years. I’ve worked since the age of 16 and never went to uni, so I’ve never had that “me time” to go and travel.I work in the civil service and don’t do a lot with my annual leave – in the past, I’ve not taken some of my holiday days and I’ve just let them expire. It’s probably not the healthiest way of doing things, but I’ve gone to work because I haven’t had anything else to do or anywhere else to be. A few times, I’ve allowed other people to take time off in my place. I’ll always work at Christmas, because I know there are people with families who want the time off.When people hear I haven’t been abroad, they’re very surprised and find it a bit weird. There are loads of places I’d like to go, but it’s not a huge priority. If I meet somebody and it gets serious, then I’ll definitely go away then. I’d like to go to France, Germany, America – and would love to see the Northern Lights. But while I’m on my own, I can’t envisage myself jetting off to the other side of the world.People generally don’t believe that I’ve never been to the cinema – it seems kind of unreal. I’ve seen pictures of cinemas online, but I haven’t actually been inside one. As a child I just never really had the opportunity my family was interested in other social stuff. We went to lots of museums.People think that because I don’t go to the cinema, I don’t watch movies, but I do. I don’t feel like I’m missing out because to me, watching a movie is a personal experience. If I’m in the cinema, I might not react to a movie the way other people react to it – I feel as if it would take away from the iniduality of the experience.I also really like watching movies with subtitles and I don’t think they have them in cinemas. I can’t really keep up with a movie’s plot and characters unless I’m reading along, just because I’ve always watched things that way.When I was about 12, I first realised it was weird that I’d never been to the cinema. I felt unique – it was something different from everyone else. Still, once the coronavirus situation changes then hopefully I’ll go as life is too short and I should experience it. I’ll probably see a sci-fi film or something like that. I’m excited for the large screen because it will be completely different from anything I’ve ever experienced – the closest thing I’ve done is go to a football game.One Tuesday in June in 1956, I fell down playing cowboys and indians in the school playing fields. I was eight years old, and I broke my arm so badly that I was in hospital for two weeks. For the next 18 months after that, I was in and out of hospital having physiotherapy. Because of that I never got on a bike. I was scared of breaking my arm again, it was that bad. I was always nervous playing football, too.I don’t feel like I’ve missed out, though. Around here lots of people ride bikes, but it’s not for me – I like playing chess. After I passed my driving test I was able to drive all over the country, and I go everywhere by car. The fact I can’t ride a bike doesn’t come up in conversation, people never ask that sort of thing. There’s no chance of me ever trying now – I’ve got severe arthritis and last year I had a hip replacement. I use a breathing machine at night. I’m falling to pieces.I also never learned to swim. I hated the water, it made me cough and splutter. They used to take my class at school and I stayed behind and did schoolwork – I just didn’t want to go. As a kid I wasn’t interested, but when I got older and was in my early 20s, I did feel like I was missing out. I used to sit on the side watching as people splashed about with their girlfriends in the water. I missed out on a lot of fun.I’ve always been really fascinated by the ocean, ever since I was a little girl. When I was five, I had a game for the Wii called Endless Ocean and it was like a swimming simulator – you would learn about different marine animals, like dolphins. I was amazed by it and I always wanted to go to the ocean.But my parents just don’t travel – I’ve only been out of the country once and that was for a school trip to New York City. My dad is out of the picture and my mum works as a youth worker 9-5, so we’ve never had enough money saved to leave home or go to the coast. We live fairly close to a lake, so in the summer we go there and nowhere else.I was around 10 when I realised my experiences were strange – I remember listening to my friends talking about going to Florida for vacation and saying it was weird I’d never seen the sea. Nowadays I have friends who’ve moved to the coast and they say they don’t even like the ocean, which sounds crazy to me.Seeing the sea is a goal that I strive towards. I want to see it by the time I’m 25 – I want to get a job first and save up some money to move out, and then I want to go on a big trip. My friends say I should just get it over with and go to Nova Scotia, but I don’t want to settle for a random coast – I’m expecting warm weather, cool water, nice sand. It’s going to be magical.It’s frustrating when people don’t understand that there are so many people who don’t have the opportunity to travel – they take it for granted. I know people who complain about going on vacation. They don’t appreciate the opportunities they have.

We’ve had fewer options since lockdown, so I’m not surprised so many people have taken it up.”The Canal \u0026amp River Trust, the Outdoor Swimming Society and the Angling Trust are all reporting a surge in interest.“The recent boom has been driven by the accessibility of the sport, gyms being closed for so long, the desire to do something socially with friends and the sun shining,” said co-founder John Hibbard.Jenny Spencer of British Canoeing said: “Literally, from the day lockdown was eased a little bit and we were allowed outdoors, paddle sports just took off. People had spent a long time being cooped up indoors, and some were getting fed up with running and cycling.”A big proportion of new paddlers are families, and almost four in 10 are female. Growth has been mainly among those aged between 30 to 60, said Spencer.Thousands of miles of waterways in the UK mean most of the population is within reach of a river or a canal. “It’s peaceful and calming. People like having a new perspective on their surroundings,” she said.And it helps that social distancing is built into paddle sports.Jonathan Sullivan, 40, had been “toying with the idea for years” but had never got round to venturing out on the Trent and numerous canals around his home in Long Eaton, Derbyshire.Then lockdown happened. Sullivan and his wife, Michala, juggled working at home with caring for and home-schooling their two children, six-year-old William and Niamh, almost five.“We ran out of ways to entertain them. There wasn’t much to do, or many places to visit,” Sullivan said.They invested in a three-person inflatable kayak and a paddleboard. “It’s been a lot of fun exploring the waterways.” The family has gone wild swimming and taken picnics on paddling trips. “It’s a great way to spend time together.”Sullivan has also used paddling as a way to de-stress after long days at his computer. “I go on my own in the evening. It’s exercise, relaxation and fresh air all rolled into one.”A licence is required to paddle on waterways maintained by the Environment Agency and the Canal \u0026amp River Trust, and the Norfolk Broads. In Scotland, there is a “right to roam” over land and water.Two members of the House of Lords – Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, the former Paralympian athlete, and Liberal Democrat peer Lord Addington – have proposed amendments to the agriculture bill, currently going through parliament, to allow the public better rights of access to rivers.Grey-Thompson said water activities helped people’s mental health and gave them a greater connection with nature. “There is something very calming about being near water – the sound of it, on a summer’s day, there is nothing that is more perfect,” she said in a recent podcast."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b36c710f7eebf37b373849a1815774a34f12df1e/0_278_2716_1629/master/2716.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=8224e5df4b2abcfca5c869247d80e7be","title":"house sale london location regents park bargain 185m john nash","story":"Developer seeks to cash out of investment in John Nash-designed terrace with views of Regent’s ParkDevelopers have stuck an asking price of £185m on a house overlooking Regent’s Park in central London in what would be the UK’s second most-expensive home purchase.The property firm Zenprop is targeting foreign billionaires as potential buyers of 1-18 York Terrace East as it seeks to cash out of a 2016 investment.The Grade I-listed building was completed in 1826 under designs by John Nash, the Regency architect whose other works include Buckingham Palace, Regent Street and the Royal Pavilion in Brighton.If it were bought by an inidual it would represent the second most expensive house ever sold in the UK, despite the weakness in the luxury housing market caused by the pandemic. The Chinese property tycoon Cheung Chung-kiu agreed in January to buy a 45-room mansion overlooking Hyde Park in London for more than £200m.The York Terrace East property, with 117,000 square feet of floorspace, previously served as government offices and then student accommodation, after bomb damage during the second world war.Stephen Lindsay, an agent at Savills who is working on the property, said: “Nothing on this scale in such a prime London location has ever come up for sale.”Derrick Beare, chief executive of Zenprop, said the building was bought four years ago for less than the current £185m listing price, despite previous reports that the company paid £200m. “We would have made a very healthy profit, but because of Brexit and the pandemic, prices are not what they were,” Beare said.Beare said the property was “priced attractively for what it is” and described it as “one of the most amazing buildings I’ve ever seen”. He thought London would continue to be seen as safe for buyers. “People love to buy real estate here. I don’t think that is going to change.”Planning officials rejected a previous application for the building to be turned into townhouses because they would be too large, planning documents show.One super-rich inidual had considered buying the property to install one large dwelling in the terrace’s central block, with other houses either side, Beare said. However, the potential buyer put plans on hold because of Brexit and the pandemic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aef842585554bb060b6e3477afb57ad6c01419e1/0_132_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9c93c5364980250007e982e8aeb8afe","title":"i hoped a cv writing site would be just the job","story":"But TopCV came bottom as I had to write-off its effortsI went to work in Spain two-and-a-half years ago, but because of Covid I was made redundant and I’m now looking for a new job.After visiting a few websites,  I came across TopCV which offered to review my CV and improve it.

And, perhaps, those days are in the rearview mirror now anyway.On the drive back from Manchester late on Saturday evening I passed Edgbaston and for a good few years now the side of the stadium has been adorned with a huge photo of the Brummie BothamSutton Coldfield Sobers (delete as per taste – both if you have any).Chat to league players in the area who encountered Walmley in the Birmingham Premier League 15 years ago and they recall a dedicated, fresh-faced kid among the men who batted top four, sliced and diced with the new ball – “you could hear the seam whizzing down” a former opponent said on Sunday – and was destined to soar.Speak to the Warwickshire players, support staff or members and you’ll only get the image of a selfless and talented professional. The operations manager, Keith Cook, has seen hundreds of players come and go during the 47 years at Edgbaston that earned him a British Empire Medal last year and places him in his all-time Bears XI.“Without a doubt he’d be in there,” says Cook. “He’s a match-winner but a fantastic human being as well. The world would be a better place with more Woakesys around.”And then there are his England colleagues. Before last year’s World Cup, for example, a video circulated online in which teammates were asked to sum up Woakes. Words like “perfect”, “pure” and “classy” abound – so too a few nods to the impeccable hair – while Eoin Morgan and Jos Buttler reference the unflappable temperament.Jason Roy sounds envious of “the best cover drive you have ever seen” and though seemingly devoid of ego off the field – my league cricketer friend describes a player only interested in what he is up to when paths cross these days – England’s one-day opener notes “an element of get out of my face” when Woakes is in the heat of battle.Over four days in Manchester these attributes – not least the shot Roy covets – all came to the fore, with top-order wickets, 103 runs over two innings and ice in his veins during a run chase that saw him seize the initiative with Jos Buttler and deliver on a plan to stay a touch leg side, use his eye and be proactive.It was not the first Test match where his all-round game has aligned. Pakistan received a dose on their summer here in 2016, while his maiden Test century against India was a match in which he knocked over Virat Kohli. But perhaps, belatedly, it was the performance that hammered home what a valuable red-ball cricketer England have here (something Morgan’s white-ball set-up realised a good while back).Because there is still a question to be asked as to how the Test brains trust view him at times, beyond talk of “Mr Dependable”. A generous assessment of Woakes bowling just five overs in Pakistan’s second innings, during which he dispatched Azhar Ali and Babar Azam, is that Joe Root was saving his energy for the impending job of batting at No 7.The tourists were rolled regardless but it still looked slightly odd, so too when, having tested front pads and both edges more than anyone, the captain asked him to deploy a bumper plan on day two despite Jofra Archer being similarly fresh.Michael Vaughan, who by Saturday evening announced he was intending to set up a Chris Woakes appreciation society, questioned on TMS 24 hours earlier how much he demands the ball. Root will know the answer but, either way, he is the one charged with spotting who the force is currently with, not just who is badgering him the most.Then for all this praise, some will bark, what about his overseas bowling average? And yes it’s true that 51 is more than twice the 22 at home that, among English seamers with more than his 85 wickets, is bettered only by Alec Bedser and Fred Trueman.But think back to his showing in Hamilton in the winter – a true heartbreaker of a pitch for the bowlers – or Johannesburg. There is evidence of a corner being turned with the Kookaburra, after advice from consultant Darren Gough to smash the surface harder for more movement. He is 31 now and, believe it or not, players can get better.Woakes didn’t start the summer, to far less noise than Stuart Broad’s omission, yet with two Tests to go it is hard not to wonder if it is time Root harnessed the wave he is riding more.The news of Ben Stokes leaving the camp increases Woakes’ all-round value but he can still be afforded greater access to the new ball and the clutch moments. Rather than just admiring the form horse, England should empower him further."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30aea0f2d061f8167d328b2406fe3b45b6cb2d1b/0_32_2912_1747/master/2912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07b69c8de51338f1daef64a1bded97d5","title":"edinburgh festival fringe television comedy","story":"Lily Savage, The League of Gentlemen, Fleabag and a host of telly sensations started out on tiny stages at the extravaganza. In its absence, who will be next?Paul O’Grady’s first night at the Edinburgh fringe did not go according to plan. He made his festival debut in 1991 as Lily Savage, the chain-smoking, peroxide tram-wreck from Birkenhead, and found himself sharing a dressing room: “I was in with Stomp, an actor doing a play about Dylan Thomas and another one doing Tommy Cooper,” he says. “Oh, and a juggling act.”Pandemonium ensued during the fire-eating segment of O’Grady’s midnight show at the Assembly Rooms. “A stripper up north had taught me to fire-eat,” he explains. “But I set off all the alarms and the place had to be evacuated – every act, every room, all the audiences out into the street. I wanted to crawl under a rock. I was mortified.” In fact, it was the best thing that could have happened. “There I was in full drag, and someone asked me to pose with the fireman. The photos were on the front page of all the papers and the place was jam-packed after that.”Lily Savage made that year’s shortlist for the Perrier, the star-making prize that had been won in 1981, its inaugural year, by a Cambridge Footlights team that included Emma Thompson, Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie. Though O’Grady lost to Frank Skinner, he ended up, like other nominees that year (Jack Dee, Eddie Izzard), with a dazzling stage and TV career.It was hardly the first time the fringe had served as a springboard for television but O’Grady’s journey is one of those rarer occasions where a character or concept travels from Edinburgh to the small screen more or less intact. Like The League of Gentlemen (who won the Perrier in 1997, beating Graham Norton and Johnny Vegas), The Mighty Boosh, Flight of the Conchords and, most recently, Fleabag, Lily Savage owes a chunk of her success to Edinburgh.O’Grady thinks the festival was crucial in giving Lily, and him, the seal of approval. “It wasn’t that I didn’t have faith in myself before then. I just thought I was a square peg in a round hole.” Jeremy Dyson believes the fringe was vital to the League of Gentlemen, too. “Edinburgh made us,” he says. “Absolutely no question. We went up in 1996, our first year, with no one knowing who we were. Then we had that magical thing of getting a good review in the Scotsman on our second day, which was enough to generate an audience. We were in a little 60-seater venue, so it was quite easy after that for us to get on the “sold out” board, which always looks great. At the end of that three-and-a-half weeks we had a phenomenal amount of interest and that was the seed of the BBC deal that took us through the next decade.” By the time of their Perrier win the following year, the group, also featuring Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith, had already recorded their first BBC radio pilot.Steve Marmion, who was artistic director of Soho theatre when it supported Drywrite’s original production of Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Fleabag, had a slightly different experience of taking a soon-to-be-hit show to the fringe. “Fleabag was a hot ticket and sold out early in its run,” he says. “Everyone apparently discovered it, everyone thought it was brilliant, and yet, if you look at those reviews first time around, it only got three stars from numerous places. When we put it on again after the TV show, it got five stars off everyone. But it was the same show! The world had changed, not Fleabag.”Of course, there’s more to Edinburgh than what happens on stage. There is the constant promotion – O’Grady says he was dispatched to go shopping in character as Lily on Princes Street one Saturday afternoon to plug the show – not to mention the variable accommodation and raucous nightlife. “The place I stayed in had a huge front room full of chairs and this big round table,” says O’Grady. “I was convinced it was used as a spiritualist’s. It was down Broughton Street near a smashing pub and a brilliant chippy. I lived on fish suppers I came back with hardened arteries and teenage acne. After the show, we’d go to CC Blooms, which had fabulous lock-ins. I’d go in at night with sunglasses on because I knew I’d be staggering out in daylight. I lived the life of a vampire.”For their first year, the four League members were squeezed into three bedrooms. “There was a rota so that the same two people didn’t have to share a bed every night,” says Dyson. “For the second year, we had a bedroom each. We’d scaled the dizzy heights by then.”The transfer to television was swift. The first series of The League of Gentlemen was on air less than 18 months after the Perrier win, while Lily Savage became a TV fixture, with a presenting stint on The Big Breakfast as well as an ITV special watched by more than 11 million viewers, within five years of her fringe debut. Not bad considering her creator had a blase approach to TV. “There was a lot of schmoozing, agents taking producers to dinner,” says O’Grady. “I’d be dragged around and introduced. ‘This is so-and-so from the BBC.’ ‘Oh, ’ello.’ Blah-blah-blah, move on. I sailed through it because I thought, ‘There’s no point.’ I was convinced I’d never get on telly as Lily anyway.”Marmion regards television as part of the ecosystem of Edinburgh. “If there’s plenty of commissioning money around, you’ll find a lot of executives up there. Theatre was always my endgame, but for a lot of people at the fringe it’s a route to TV. For standups particularly, it’s the place to be seen and booked on Mock the Week.”The absence of the fringe this year isn’t just a blow to performers and audiences it also means that one of the most reliable breeding grounds for television of the future has vanished, albeit temporarily. Without the fringe, two recent shows would not now be in that development process. Natasha Marshall wrote her autobiographical one-woman show Half Breed, about growing up as the only person of mixed-race parentage in a Wiltshire village, with the intention of bringing it to television. “I know some people party hard at Edinburgh, but I couldn’t do that,” she says. “I needed the show to be as good as it could be. Right from the start, I wanted it to transfer to TV. It was never just ‘maybe’ for me.”Following her successful fringe run in 2017, Channel 4 commissioned a 15-minute pilot of Half Breed as part of its Comedy Blaps strand. Though it wasn’t picked up for a series, Marshall is now shopping the idea around. “It’s a strong female comedy, it’s West Country and – hello! – the West Country is doing amazing things right now, what with the statue of Edward Colston being pulled down. OK, I’m from a village on the outskirts, but I’m going to claim that as mine! We’ve had Michaela Coel, we’ve had Fleabag, and I think there’s space for a female mixed-race voice.”Charly Clive and Ellen Robertson, who perform as the duo Britney, are in the process of developing a TV version of their own sparky, autobiographical fringe comedy, also called Britney, which focuses on Clive’s brain tumour diagnosis. “The fringe was so valuable for seeing what worked and what didn’t,” says Robertson. It was those early fringe shows, for example, that prompted them to include regular onstage reminders that everything in Britney really happened. “Early on, we had people saying afterwards, ‘Wait, was that … true?’ We’d forgotten to say it was.” Not that there were many audience members to begin with. “On our first night, no one turned up,” says Robertson. “Our lovely tech guy came out before the show and said to us, ‘Just to let you know, um, no one’s here but let’s just treat it like a dress rehearsal.’ In the end, six of our friends arrived late.”Ten days in, with positive word of mouth behind it, Britney began to sell out. Now, with encouragement from the playwright Mike Bartlett, who saw the show when Clive and Robertson performed it at a post-Edinburgh homecoming show at a village hall in Oxfordshire, a pilot is in the works produced by Drama Republic, the company responsible for Black Earth Rising and Bartlett’s Doctor Foster.The pair’s affection for the fringe is palpable. “Edinburgh is hugely important to Britney,” says Clive. “Ever since we became friends we’d always said we were going to do a show there. It was our holy grail. And it opened us up to this community of fellow comedians and oddballs. It feels like a summer camp for people who are good at doing voices. Going to the fringe is comparable to the first day of school. You’re worried you won’t find your people.

He had boyhood dreams of becoming an actor, wrote first-rate dramatic criticism and aspired to be as successful a playwright as novelist. But his hopes were shattered at the first night in 1895 of his play Guy Domville, which was roundly booed by the gallery. I would still argue that he was a natural dramatist and that, among his later works, The High Bid eminently deserves revival.The play had a tortuous history. It began as a one-act piece, Summersoft, created for Ellen Terry but never staged. In 1898, James turned it into a short story, Covering End. That came to the attention of the actor-manager Johnston Forbes-Robertson, who commissioned James to rewrite it as a three-act play. Driven by what he called “the lust of a little possible gold”, James complied, but the loot was not forthcoming. After its premiere at the Edinburgh Lyceum in 1908 and five matinee performances in London, the play quietly expired until it was successfully revived by Bernard Miles at the Mermaid in 1967 and, less happily, in the West End in 1970 with Eartha Kitt in the key role of an American widow, Mrs Gracedew, in love with the English past.It remains a seriously fascinating play that, as one commentator says, combines a melodramatic set-up with Jamesian sophistication. As so often, everything hinges on a large country house: one that is inherited by a Captain Yule but which is heavily mortgaged to a voracious businessman, Prodmore. A dubious bargain, however, is proposed by Prodmore: he will cancel the debts if Yule marries Prodmore’s daughter and, forsaking his socialist principles, stands as the local Tory MP. At which point Mrs Gracedew, an American visitor enthralled by the house and its history, intervenes. Unaware of the marital aspect of the deal, she urges Yule to accept Prodmore’s offer: that changes, however, when she realises that the preservation of the past involves a sacrifice in the present.All the classic Jamesian ingredients are here: property, money, class and the eternal conflict between the old world and the new. Back in 1878, James wrote a brilliant short story, An International Episode, in which a bookish Bostonian shows a far greater reverence for England’s history than a languid, castle-owning aristo. Something similar happens here, with Mrs Gracedew gushing over the house’s antiquity in a way that perplexes its owner. The text is studded with elaborate stage directions that are best ignored. But what you have is a play with a strong plot, an acute moral dilemma and rich dialogue typified by Captain Yule’s inquiry to the house’s white-haired retainer, “I mean to whom do you beautifully belong?” If ever the theatre returns, it would be good to see someone putting in an offer for The High Bid."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e4df575b9ff938bc3c9bece137922dcf83628d3/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80aa1c7f25edc05fa31d4f014249334e","title":"hottest front room seats the best theatre and dance to watch online","story":"From live-streams of new plays to classics from the archive, here are some of the top shows online now or coming soonLin-Manuel Miranda’s phenomenal, Pulitzer prize-winning musical about the “10-dollar founding father without a father” was filmed over three nights in New York in 2016 with the original Broadway cast.

Trend-charting magazine articles have left them stuck between the Boomers, desperately clinging to the last vestiges of a disappearing status quo, and the Millennials, ushering in a brave and confusing new world with the help of the ascendant Gen Z. As dominant forces in the mainstream, they’ve accordingly enjoyed the spoils of the nostalgia market, with Disney cranking out live-action remakes of 90s favorites for twenty-to-thirtysomethings while Rolling Stone and other legacy publications continue to prop up the musical tastes of people in their 60s. Will no one think of the eye-rollers, the alt-rock pioneers, the disaffected masses that slagged consumerist ambitions decades before the first meme joking about the utter brokenness of capitalism?That may soon change, however, based on a handful of recent announcements from the TV industry. A mini-revival of seminal Gen-X animation has been slated for the immediate future, ostensibly catering to a demographic raised to view this sort of thing as a crass corporate cash-grab. Last year saw MTV unveil plans for the new cartoon Jodie, a spinoff focusing on a secondary character from the zeitgeist-seizing comedy Daria, itself a spinoff from the adventures of wonder-idiots Beavis and Butthead. The sniggering twosome will also get another shot at the small screen, as Comedy Central announced just last month that creator Mike Judge will bring his most famed creations back for a new series loosing them on the world of 2020. And the network made similar headlines again earlier this week when it revealed that Ren and Stimpy, those hyperactive icons of grotesque Saturday morning dadaism, would also mount a comeback after nearly 30 years off the air.Jodie eventually jumped MTV’s ship for Comedy Central as well, concentrating what now seems like a concerted effort around a single programming slate. In theory, animated intellectual property should be fertile for rebooting the faces of Daria, Beavis and the like won’t age, and the voices of the actors portraying them behind the scenes generally don’t either. In the event that they have, it’s easy enough for a network to find a dead auditory ringer for a replacement. But retrofitting these properties to a new era, which have spent so long identified with their own, could prove problematic.“It seemed like the time was right to get stupid again,” came the quote from Judge attached to the Beavis and Butthead press release, a stirring declaration of intent. The beatific dumbness of the characters made them folk heroes to a generation marked by disillusionment and healthy cynicism, a pair of holy fools whose belief system didn’t have to extend far past rocking out and cracking wise. Daria Morgendorffer, the over-everything Gen-X-er, was the only one in their world who really seemed to understand what they were about. When Daria got a program of her own, she would lob the occasional feminist critique, while still remaining committed to her core ironic detachment. Ren and Stimpy, meanwhile, leaned into a juvenile nihilism with giddy violence and innuendo that pushed the envelope on kid-friendly host Nickelodeon.As these shows return, they’ll have to contend with a greatly altered entertainment landscape that may not be as hospitable to their distinct sensibilities. Many greeted the news of Ren and Stimpy’s return with anything from dread to revulsion, due to the recent revelation that the series creator John Kricfalusi had sexually harassed two underage women during the 90s. As if to speak directly to this point, the Variety item breaking the news about the Ren and Stimpy reboot notes that Kricfalusi will be in no way involved with the series’ production, and that he will receive no financial remuneration from it. Even so, the series was so integrally informed by his sense of humor that any reboot cannot be fully free of his influence.The outline for Jodie in Deadline’s report makes a more perceptible overture to timeliness: “Jodie will satirize workplace culture, Gen Z struggles, the artifice of social media and more. With themes of empowerment across gender and racial lines, explorations of privilege, and a wicked sense of humor, Jodie marks the first adult animated sitcom to center around an African American female lead in nearly two decades.” The agreeably progressive ethic aside, this spirit of feelgood go-getter copywriting would activate the real Daria’s gag reflex.That’s as clean an omen of the impending friction as one could expect, a sign that these characters may be less than compatible with our present moment of earnest cause-championing and overdue awarenesses.

I’m Martin Farrer and these are top stories you need to know about this Monday.Jimmy Lai, a prominent Hong Kong media tycoon and pro-democracy advocate, has been arrested over suspected collusion with foreign forces under the new national security law. The 71-year-old founder of news outlet Apple Daily was detained on Monday and is the highest-profile person to be held under the controversial law. Police were executing a search warrant on the newsroom floor of Apple Daily’s offices, according to Lai’s senior aide. A live stream of the raid showed dozens of police at the Apple Daily headquarters. Staff filmed plain-clothed and uniformed officers walking through the newsroom, rifling through piles of paper on desks and demanding to ses the ID cards of reporters. Lai, who was one of seven taken into custody, has had repeated run-ins with the territory’s authorities over the years thanks to his outspoken views about maintaining independence from Beijing. There’s also this video of him being arrested.Rape target – The government plans to reverse the record decline in rape prosecutions by imposing targets on police and prosecutors. The prime minister’s crime and justice taskforce is planning to set targets for police to refer more high-quality rape cases to the Crown Prosecution Service and for the CPS to prosecute and bring more rape cases to trial. The CPS is likely to oppose the change for impinging on its independence.Belarus protests – Violent street clashes broke out between police and protesters in cities all over Belarus last night after the country’s long-time leader Alexander Lukashenko claimed a landslide in the presidential election despite a campaign marked by huge rallies in favour of the opposition. Riot police used rubber bullets, flash grenades, teargas and water cannon to confront demonstrators who gathered in the capital Minsk soon after polls closed yesterday. Dozens were arrested and one expert said it was the biggest show of defiance since Lukashenko took power 26 years ago. The opposition leader, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, went into hiding before the poll after nine campaign staff were arrested.Covid travel warning – Ministers have rejected calls for routine testing in schools in England to try to prevent the spread of Covid-19 when pupils start going back to classrooms in September. Schools in Scotland begin returning from tomorrow, giving Boris Johnson a close-up view of how the process could be managed when he goes north of the border next weekend for a two-week break with his fiancee and baby.

Neighbors and local businesses could donate food – homemade, store-bought, or leftover from a day’s sales – and anyone who needed food could take some.The fridge helps feed people in the middle of a pandemic and mass unemployment – in a year where as many as 54m Americans could need food aid.There are no strings attached and no questions asked, says Pita.At least 15 other community fridges have been set up in the five New York boroughs and New Jersey. Los Angeles and Oakland both have networks of community fridges up and running, and grassroots efforts to start community fridges in Houston, Minneapolis, San Francisco, and Miami are taking off.The idea of community fridges – and more broadly, of free food for all who need it – has been around for decades. More than 50 years ago, the Black Panther Party distributed free breakfast to children out of a local church in the Bronx a radical program for its time that paved the way for the US government to follow suit in 1975.Today “there’s so many people that are involved as fridge-keepers,” says Adela Wagner, 30, who helps with a community fridge in the Crown Heights neighborhood in Brooklyn. They range from those who donate food – bakeries, community gardens, farmers markets and more – to neighbors who keep an eye on it throughout the day. “Most of them are not given credit,” Wagner says.This is their story.Tatiana Smith, 38, Jersey City, New Jersey: ‘I’ll host the fridge at my house’When Tatiana Smith saw a community fridge go up in Brooklyn, followed by others in the Bronx and Harlem, she said, “I want to do that for Jersey.” The doula and software product designer started scouting potential locations for a fridge, but initial conversations with local restaurants and businesses were slow. She thought if worse comes to worst, “I’ll host it at my house.” So she did.A hot pink fridge with bright blue trim now sits outside her home, with the words “FREE FOOD” and “COMIDA GRATIS” along the top. Neighbors help her watch the fridge, and people come looking for food at all hours of the day. “If you’re getting off work at 3am, that’s when you can have a meal,” Smith says, noting many Black and brown people may work multiple jobs with odd hours.Smith says she isn’t surprised when the food is gone within hours of her posting it on Instagram. “Unemployment benefits are ending, and you have people with mortgages to pay,” she says. “It’s a snowball effect.”Smith says she never turns away donations unless they’re going bad, but she asks people to think about the fridge as an extension of their own. “If you wouldn’t eat that, what makes you think that other people would?”Smith is working on developing longer-term partnerships with nearby restaurants, who she says have been enthusiastic about donating leftover food. To her, community fridges are an attempt at redirecting the abundance that already exists to families who need it. “There is no reason for anyone to go hungry. There is more than enough food.”Mohaommad Alawdi, 57, the Bronx, New York: ‘I feel bad when people see the fridge is empty’Mohaommed Alawdi is a familiar face around the community fridge on 242nd Street in the Bronx. “Seven days a week, you see me there,” the cab driver says. Over time, he has become one of the fridge’s biggest supporters like the barbers who work nearby and look out for hot food donations, Alawdi helps keep the fridge safe for everyone.“I feel bad, I’ll be honest with you,” he says. “I feel bad when I leave the area, when I come back and see some people go to the fridge and they see the fridge is empty.” Alawdi says he runs to the nearby supermarket and buys fruits and vegetables when that happens. Throughout the week, the fridge showcases contributions from all the people who care for it: chicken, lamb, fish, burgers, sandwiches, home-cooked meals.Sometimes, when Alawdi sees someone start to take too much food from the fridge, he reminds them to think of the next person who will come looking for food. “I’m not a tough guy,” he says, “but I am fair.”Alawdi says he has gone so far as to give people money when the fridge is empty, and reminds them that, in the morning, the fridge will be restocked. Scott Gerke, 35, Brooklyn, New York: ‘I was afraid to open it’Scott Gerke lives out of his van full-time, but that’s a relatively new development. When the pandemic hit, the 35-year-old, who made a living as a wedding DJ for 10 years, decided to leave Key West and travel up the eastern coast of the US. “I wasn’t going to wait for someone to open my world back up so I could work again,” Gerke says.Soon Gerke ended up in the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn, directly across the street from a community fridge painted electric green. He spent a week eyeing it before he walked across the street with the intention of taking something. “I was afraid to open it because I thought, ‘Maybe I’m not there yet.’ But I totally was.”That night, he remembers, there were different kinds of lettuce, kale, green beans, rice, and tomato sauce. For the next three weeks, Gerke fed himself from the fridge – and because he had been sharing videos of his “journey” since leaving Key West, he documented his experience on Instagram. “I just told the world, ‘Hey, this is real life’,” Gerke says. Like many Americans, Gerke doesn’t know how he’ll survive financially without work. “I do have a little bit of anxiety every time I go to the grocery store now, which sucks,” he says. The fridge gave him, at least for a time, a respite from that.Chéz Jean, 30, the Bronx, New York: ‘I want the fridges to go everywhere’“There’s no one person who is like, the head of the fridges,” says Chéz Jean. “There’s no hierarchy at all,” they add, with a laugh.Jean has dedicated much of their life to feeding their community. When they were 14, Jean learned about freeganism and discovered which restaurants and grocery stores regularly threw away fresh food and produce: Trader Joe’s, Whole Foods. They recall noshing on cucumber rolls and sushi with new friends. And when they weren’t dumpster ing for themselves, Jean rescued food to donate to homeless shelters.So for Jean, who tends to the fridge in Kingsbridge, in the Bronx,  community fridge are rooted in the same big-picture ideas that animate their freegan lifestyle: reducing food waste, fighting climate change, rejecting the concept that nutritious food should cost money – any money. Jean delights in bringing in vegetables that may be unfamiliar to their neighbors: Swiss chard, purple carrots. But, they say, “When it comes to food, you can’t say no to food donations.”There are now at least three fridges up and running in the Bronx, and Jean says more are to come. They’ve been involved in the anarchist collective In Our Hearts, which has been sharing information online on how to start a community fridge. Jean estimates there’s now more than 17 community fridges in New York.“I want the fridges to go everywhere,” Jean says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdaa3608fcb0312c7c59123439cb3768c975b2ee/0_42_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=51ef39af611fd86fb5241decb8de3980","title":"coronavirus live news us infections pass 500000 as greece sees highest ever daily cases","story":"Australian state of Victoria records 19 deaths US cases pass 5m UK daily infections pass 1,000 for first time since JuneIndonesia has also reported its daily tally of new coronavirus cases and deaths.

The country’s total number of coronavirus cases remains as the fourth largest number in the world. The official death toll also rose to 15,001 on Monday after authorities said in their daily coronavirus report that 70 people had died in the last 24 hours.Australia has recorded its biggest daily rise in Covid-19 deaths, although a slowdown in new cases has given hope to officials that a second wave in the state of Victoria may have peaked.Nineteen people had died from the virus, all in Victoria, in the past 24 hours, a national daily record.

Leader Kim Jong-un declared an emergency last month and imposed a lockdown in Kaesong, near the border with South Korea, after a man who defected to the South in 2017 returned to the city showing coronavirus symptoms. In recent days, heavy rain and flooding have also sparked concern about crop damage and food supplies in the isolated county.The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has built an extensive network of North Korean volunteers to help residents in all nine provinces to avoid the virus and reduce damage from floods and landslides, spokesman Antony Balmain told Reuters.“Hundreds of homes have been damaged and large areas of rice fields have been submerged due to heavy rain and some flash flooding,” Balmain said.In Kaesong, which was grappling with both the lockdown and floods, IFRC volunteers were providing 2,100 families most at risk with relief items including tarpaulins, kitchen sets, quilts, hygiene kits and water containers.North Korea has not confirmed any coronavirus cases but has enforced strict quarantine measures. South Korea has said there is no evidence the returning defector was infected.The IFRC last month provided North Korea with kits designed to run up to 10,000 coronavirus tests, alongside infrared thermometers, surgical masks, gowns and protective gear.I’m Amy Walker, taking over from my colleague Helen Sullivan in Australia. I’ll be running the global blog from the UK for the next few hours.That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan for today. Thanks for following along. Before I go – here is a piece I wrote about finally being reunited with my husband, five months after I kissed him goodbye and boarded a flight from Beirut to Sydney:More on the call to regularly test teachers and schoolchildren, from PA media:Schools minister Nick Gibb did not support the call, saying: “All the advice we’ve had is the measures that we’re putting in place, the hierarchy of controls about hygiene and so on and bubbles within schools, is the most effective method of reducing the risk of transmission of the virus.”Mr Johnson, who has spoken of a “moral duty” to reopen schools, is expected to focus on the minimal risk getting children back in class presents to their health and the potential dangers of keeping them away.But National Education Union deputy general secretary Avis Gilmore called for ministers to “be clear” about support if a second wave of the virus strikes.“Robust track, trace and test alongside health and safety checks in schools and colleges are necessary,” she said.Boris Johnson is facing widespread calls to boost coronavirus testing and tracing in order to safely reopen schools to all pupils without imposing further restrictions on businesses or social lives, PA media reports. The Prime Minister said it is the “national priority” to get children back in class in England next month, but he has been warned by scientific advisers that “trade-offs” may be necessary to keep transmission down.Teachers, scientists, opposition politicians and the children’s commissioner for England Anne Longfield have all called for improvements to testing before pupils return.Ms Longfield welcomed Mr Johnson’s commitment to make children the priority after previously accusing ministers of treating them as “an afterthought”.But she said regular testing of pupils and teachers, perhaps as frequently as weekly, could be needed even if they do not exhibit symptoms to keep transmission rates down.“I think it needs to be as regular as it needs to be, to ensure that the infection is caught and identified as quickly as possible and then the tracking system can move on from that,” she told Times Radio.Here are the key developments from the last few hours: Consumer borrowing from UK banks will fall at the fastest rate on record in 2020, amid the recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic, forecasts suggest.A fall at that speed would represent the steepest slowdown in lending to consumers in at least a generation, since records began in 1993: The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 436 to 216,327, data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases showed on Monday.The reported death toll rose by one to 9,197, the tally showed.In Australia, the aged care regulator has been accused of a “catastrophic communications failure” causing a “potentially deadly delay”, amid revelations it took four days for the body to inform the government about a Covid-19 outbreak at Melbourne’s St Basil’s aged care home.The admission from the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commissioner, Janet Anderson, was revealed on Monday morning, as her organisation and the Department of Health was simultaneously questioned during a hearing of the aged care royal commission for failing to prepare a Covid-19 response plan for the aged care sector.At least 11 deaths and 163 infections have been associated with the St Basil’s outbreak. The revelation that it took four days for the ACQSC to alert the health department was made in a letter Anderson sent to the Senate select committee on Covid-19 on Friday: Hi, Helen Sullivan here.

Please do get in touch with news from your part of the world if we’ve missed it.You can find me on Twitter @helenrsullivan or send an email to helen.sullivan@the.Here is more on the latest China figures, from the AP: New locally transmitted cases of coronavirus in China fell to just 14 over the past 24 hours, the National Health Commission reported Monday. The low figure was offset, however, by 35 cases brought into the country by Chinese travellers from overseas arriving in seven different cities and provinces across the country.All the cases of local transmission were in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, whose main city Urumqi is the centre of China’s latest outbreak. Tightened restrictions on travel, widespread testing and a lockdown on some residential communities appear to have been effective in bringing down numbers of new infections in Urumqi, while a separate outbreak in the northeastern city of Dalian seems to have run its course.Chinese hospitals are currently treating 802 people for COVID-19, 41 of them in serious condition, while another 290 people are under observation while being isolated for showing signs of having the virus or for testing positive without displaying symptoms. China has reported a total of 4,634 fatalities from the disease among 84,668 cases.Hong Kong reported another 72 cases and five deaths as it continues to battle a new wave of infections with tightened rules on indoor dining and obligatory mask wearing in public settings. The semi-autonomous southern Chinese city has reported 52 deaths among 4,079 total cases.US Health Secretary Alex Azar is in Taipei for a three-day visit to promote shared democratic values and the island’s success in taming the coronavirus, AFP reports. His trip comes as relations between the United States and China are in tumult, with the two sides clashing over a wide range of trade, military and security issues, as well as the pandemic.China, which insists Taiwan is its own territory and vows to one day reclaim it, has described Azar’s visit as a threat to “peace and stability”.On Monday morning, Azar met President Tsai Ing-wen, who advocates the island being recognised as a sovereign nation and is loathed by China’s leaders.“Taiwan’s response to Covid-19 has been among the most successful in the world, and that is a tribute to the open, transparent, democratic nature of Taiwan’s society and culture,” Azar told Tsai.Tsai thanked the US for supporting its bid to be part of the World Health Organization, a body Beijing keeps the island frozen out of.“Political considerations should never take precedence over the rights to health,” Tsai said, calling Beijing’s refusal to let Taiwan join “highly regrettable”.Azar brushed off China’s criticism when asked about Beijing’s anger over his visit.“The message that I bring from the US government is one of reaffirming the deep partnership the United States has with Taiwan in terms of security, commerce, health care and shared common values of democracy, economic freedom and liberty,” he told reporters before his meeting with Tsai.Azar has previously been critical of Beijing’s response to the coronavirus, which began in central China, as well as the WHO."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06b429db2b9cd0b2cb087cf3a3f68951bda5fd08/0_25_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d09d1bb15299e0384b194261e1f548e","title":"uk coronavirus live news covid 19 latest updates schools","story":"Gavin Williamson says plans for school reopening guided by evidence of little transmission Earlier we referred to Gavin Williamson citing a PHE report saying that there was little risk of transmission in schools.

He told BBC Breakfast: “Every local flare-up is different in some places not reopening schools would be part of a plan, in other sorts of outbreaks that may not be necessary.“It’s down to the local circumstances, down to the team on the ground. and they will then advise Welsh ministers.”On school reopenings, Whately said that “the risks to children from Covid are very low, so absolutely it’ll be safe for children to be back in schools, and our national priority is to get to children back in school this autumn”.Asked about the one week on, one week off suggestion, she said: “Our priority is to make sure that children are fully back in school come the autumn.”Asked if schools should stay open in the event of a local lockdown, she said: “Yes, that is the approach, so, for instance, in places like Leicester and Greater Manchester, and areas where we have local restrictions going on, absolutely schools should be still going back. It is essential that children get back into school this autumn term.”In response to the Royal College of Nursing’s comments that the government’s pledge to fund 2,000 new nursing apprenticeships a year falls far short of what’s required and that scrapping tuition fees for nurses who want to study at university (rather than the apprenticeship “earn and learn” route), Helen Whately told the BBC that over 5,000 new places would be created this autumn, in part because of an increased interest in the profession.She said there would be a grant of “at least £5,000” a year for nursing students plus extra support for child care and travel costs and said “there is a material package of financial support for nursing students”.She again quotes the government’s goal of “50,000 more nurses” by 202425. You can read Full Fact’s examination of that claim here, with a reminder that only 31,000 of the total will be newly trained or recruited. Ahead of this week’s A-level results in England, and after hugely controversial results in Scotland already, Dr Martin Steven, chair of governors of an inner city comprehensive and former head of St Paul’s School in London, said he predicted a “furore” over the use of a “standardisation model” which could see some high-achieving pupils have their results downgraded based on their school’s outcomes in previous years.He told the Today programme that “an army of unemployed examiners” should be sent to look at specific pieces of work by appealing students to help address the problem. And he said there should be selective resits offering examinations on the topics schools had been taught about, as well as more emphasis on standardised tests, mock results, and inspection reports, which are all currently excluded from Ofqual’s inspection process.Dr Tony Breslin, former chief examiner for GCSEs, said that the system “does risk discriminating against outlying students” - either iniduals or cohorts that are unusually high-achieving. But he added: “This kind of standardisation goes on on the same scale every year, but it doesn’t go on in public view.”But Steven said it had “never been used to this extent” with an “undue emphasis on a school’s historical record” and that results would be decided “far too much on the ‘computer says no’ principle.”On BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Prof Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and a member of Sage, said “reopening schools is one of the least risky things we can do”.He told the BBC: “It’s very clear for them the benefits and risks, the balance is for them to be back at school. For broader society, look, I think it’s also clear that reopening schools is one of the least risky things we can do.“Anything we do that reopens society will add a small or a larger amount to the overall population reproductive number and for schools we believe that it’s a relatively minor player, it would add little to the overall population R.”On proposals for a ‘one week on, one week off’ school rota, he said: “It actually appears to make very little difference to the overall risk, the overall population R in fact, if you get the mitigations right … then actually the rota systems appear to make very little difference and make little difference to the risk to teachers.”Covid-19 isn’t the only virus that can be combatted by social distancing, and one byproduct of the lockdown has been to reduce the incidence of a variety of other conditions, my colleague Haroon Siddique reports.Flu, colds, bronchitis and a number of other viruses all appear to be in lower circulation than usual this summer, according to the research by the Royal College of GPs.You can read his piece below.Meanwhile, care minister Helen Whateley is on Sky, Radio 4 and others this morning promoting the government’s £172m plan to fund 2,000 new nursing apprenticeships annually for the next four years.The pledge reflects the government’s election promise to have “50,000 more nurses” by the end of this parliament. (You might remember some controversy over that claim after Boris Johnson admitted that only 31,000 of the total would actually be new nurses, with much of the rest being accounted for by people who the government thought would have otherwise left the profession.)The Royal College of Nursing says Monday’s pledge does not go far enough, saying the apprenticeship plan “falls short of the wider investment needed to educate enough registered nurses for the future, ensuring health and care services have the staff needed”.Asked on Sky whether paying nurses more would be another way to increase the attraction of the job, Whateley said: “Of course I’m aware of this and like everybody in the whole country so grateful to doctors and nurses... at the frontline during the pandemic.” But she said that nurses’ pay would not be up for review until next year because of the pay cycle they were on.Good morning, and welcome to the UK coronavirus live blog. I’m Archie Bland, at the helm for the next few hours. You can reach me at archie.bland@the or on Twitter.We begin with education secretary Gavin Williamson, who has said that the government’s plan to accelerate school reopening has been guided by advice that coronavirus is unlikely to spread in the classroom.In a statement, Williamson said that the “latest research … one of the largest studies on the coronavirus in schools in the world” – believed to be a reference to a Public Health England report looking at 20,000 pupils and teachers in 100 schools across England at the end of the summer term – has shown that makes it clear “there is little evidence that the virus is transmitted at school”.Despite that claim, my colleague Peter Walker reports that unions have warned that the government has no “plan B” if cases do start rising. He writes:However, there are concerns from unions that there is no “plan B” for schools if cases do start rising rapidly. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, told the  that part-time teaching such as “week-on, week-off” rotas could be needed in some instances.Anne Longfield, the children’s commissioner, says testing should be available if schools are to reopen:I’m not an expert in testing, but I would say that regular means weekly. It needs to be as regular as it needs to be to ensure the infection is caught and identified as soon as possible, and then the tracking system can move on from that.Schools minister Nick Gibb rejected that call, saying there would not be “routine testing without symptoms. The advice that we have is that it’s better to test when people actually show symptoms.”Boris Johnson will be visiting a classroom this morning to emphasise the message that it’s safe for schools to reopen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95b487f6298ae93d44202b825f8a670866569fed/0_126_1242_745/master/1242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f518095e322503bde96d36abf69c4f3b","title":"four young artists reveal how they express their unique voice in pictures","story":"As part of  Labs’ collaboration with Levi’s and young people with something to say, Gen Z illustrators and photographers discuss what informs their work‘We need a more erse understanding of the world’“I use my art to celebrate the lips, noses, hair and skin colour of women from black and mixed-race communities who have become stigmatised and criticised by society,” says illustrator Vicki Jones. “I believe everyone is beautiful and worthy of greater acceptance. I want other black and mixed-race people to see someone who looks like them, and for our white allies to see people who aren’t like them. It gives us all a more erse understanding of how the world is.”‘We have to question body image issues’“I had a problematic relationship with food and body image, and so did most of my friends,” says photographer Fanny Beckman. “Did you know that more lives are lost to eating disorders than any other mental health condition? Women of My Generation is a multimedia project which combines photography and a podcast to question beauty standards, and dismantle our body image issues. I want to prove that it is, beyond doubt, possible to feel confident regardless of body size, sexuality, ethnicity or socioeconomic background.”‘Look closer, and a new level opens up’“My illustration style is lowbrow, cartoony, so it might not strike you that there’s meaning beyond the skateboarding-style graphics,” says illustrator Chris Martin. “But I’m hoping to communicate bigger issues in my drawing. As with the Cambridge Analytica scandal, there are unseen forces at work. Forces we don’t see straight away, but which create a deeper tension. There’s always another level to what we first think we see.”This is what confidence looks like“I use my voice to empower women and celebrate the ersity I see in my home city, London,” says photographer Milli Ahern. “I use bright saturated colours to project strength and confidence – a confidence that I didn’t feel myself, growing up. I was bullied about my appearance as a teenager. But that experience actually gave me strength as it led to me learning about photography, which allowed me to find my voice and highlight the beauty in ersity. Everyone needs to be seen and heard.”At the heart of the Your Voice. Your Way campaign is a zine, paid for by Levi’s, celebrating voices outside the mainstream. Created jointly by the four incredible artists showcased here and four talented writers, it proves the power of expressing yourself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f8ef8771d704bcada862904664df8501847e82e/0_0_1335_801/master/1335.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=227ac5f420b32dbae7c8172587057313","title":"a platform for the unheard the brand the zine and what it all means","story":"For the young creatives involved, deciding to apply to be part of a project to create a zine in collaboration with  Labs was easy. But why did Levi’s want to get involved?“Your Voice. Your Way is a celebration of imagination and identity,” says Yasmin Sinfield, brand marketing manager for Levi’s. But why does a brand best known for its denim care about amplifying unheard voices?“We believe we have a responsibility to support erse voices and make a stand against injustice – not just at this pivotal moment in history, but consistently,” she says.“As a brand Levi’s has a strong heritage of amplifying marginalised voices, and this zine has been in development for over a year. We’re committed to giving unheard voices a platform.”Levi’s, says Yasmin, has four core values: integrity, courage, empathy and originality. They serve as a reminder for the company to focus on what matters and to keep having important conversations. But what does that actually mean? And how does amplifying young voices contribute to those important conversations?“We’re doing our best to champion erse voices from the younger generation,” says Yasmin. This campaign wasn’t created to serve a financial purpose, but as a means to connect with, and rouse the voices of, this generation. Over the years, Levi’s has demonstrated its commitment to investing a portion of its annual earnings into communities. Take the Levi’s Music Project, for example, which connected global artists such as Alicia Keys and Skepta to young people to help them “champion their voice through music”.Levi’s also helped young LGBTQ+ photographers raise their voices, partnering with LGBTQ+ museum Queer Britain in celebration of Pride 2019 in the UK. The collaboration kicked off with a curated photography exhibition in London’s Covent Garden called Chosen Family. Levi’s truly believes that this zine is vital and authentic. From the company’s beginnings in 1853, it set out to enable people to express their iniduality. Now, Levi’s wants to work with us to empower our generation.Being courageous is about far more than building your own confidence. By raising your voice, you could inspire countless others. In this zine, Levi’s provides a platform for young voices because, says Yasmin: “Small changes spun together can create something much bigger that makes a real difference.”This zine isn’t the first Your Voice. Your Way project. Last year, the focus was on musicians from the Levi’s Music Project who had all faced barriers to achieving their dreams, but had transformed their lives by having courage in their own convictions.Musicians can make themselves heard when they perform, but there are so many people who don’t have a platform. “In a world where it seems like everyone’s talking over each other, it can be hard for young people to use their voices in their own way, because they don’t know where or how to do so,” says Yasmin.Levi’s thinks brands can provide a place to start, to platform emerging creatives and commit to listening to young voices. The partnership between Levi’s and  Labs has enabled us to set up and support a network of talented young creatives, bringing us together with mentors who will continue to encourage us.If you invented blue jeans, you have a good idea of what it means to be original. Levi’s had a practical purpose: its jeans were first created in 1873 to satisfy a need from workers who needed durable trousers those jeans evolved into one of the world’s most iconic fashion items. Now, our needs are more nuanced than durable workwear. Levi’s hopes Your Voice. Your Way will provide a “blank canvas for self expression”.When they told us we could create this zine our way, they meant it. We’ve had support but, ultimately, we called the shots. By giving us the opportunity to choose what stories to cover, we’ve had real creative freedom. We took the challenge to share our inidualism."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e66095eef528002831fac4e99023fe4cd7c16d3d/0_0_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cb5a9af8f4ac55c3e0eaa2de5753670","title":"gen z on challenging stereotypes i only saw muslim women on arabic channels","story":"Writer Ayat Mohamed is 18 and, like all of us, she’s an inidual with many aspects.

Moreover, those wishing to embrace the electric vehicle invariably find it is totally impractical in rural areas where mileage is inevitably higher than in urban areas, especially for those with busy families.As the country seeks to put one million EVs on Irish roads by the end of the decade, Connolly is well-positioned to know what reality is on the ground. He sells Volkswagen, Mercedes, Seat, Audi and Hyundai brands – which offer some EV and plug-in hybrid models – and add up to 40 per cent of market share.The problem is the range for EVs is not there yet for those driving long distances, while “customers are very confused there are a lot of mixed messages”.This is illustrated by a typical recent sales inquiry from a motorist with a sizeable family – a two-car household including a larger vehicle – seeking to trade in a 2009 Volkswagen Sharan (paying €700-€800 in car tax). He was inquiring about electric options the cheapest is the ID.3 Volkswagen which comes in at €40,000 plus without subsidies. On been told that, “his face dropped”, Connolly says. “The dilemma is people are expecting a full range of EVs. We don’t have them.” With few models available, supplies are limited. They sell close to zero EVs, and hybrids in “low double-digit numbers”, and there is no market in second-hand electric cars.What he is hearing from Germany, the heart of European car manufacturing, is the range issue will soon be solved, but mainstream electric models in volume will not be available until 2027-2028.A multi-faceted solution is needed in Ireland in the meantime, Connolly believes. Top of his wishlist is getting rid of 10-year plus cars, so four to five-year-old vehicles dominate the second-hand market, achieving 50 per cent reduction in carbon emissions.A one-size-fits-all solution does not work, he insists. Current policy, in effect, means every vehicle sold from now on should be electric. Yet an EV is not suitable for him at present as he drives 60,000km a year and chooses to live in a remote area, but it’s suitable for his mother who drives 6,000km a year and lives closer to an urban setting.In seven to eight years’ time, however, things will be very different, he predicts. “Euro 7VII” engine standards will be fully in place, requiring next to zero emissions in all new vehicles. This is happening without taking clear, necessary steps to a transition everyone accepts must happen, while difficulties are compounded by a motor tax regime that promotes “safer and greener cars”. Connolly stresses the EV route is the way to go “unless new technology emerges”. The hydrogen fuel option is a possibility. He believes there will be zero-emission cars to suit everybody’s needs, “and you don’t have to compromise on the environment side”. Mindful of new close to zero emissions exhaust systems in the offing, Connolly endorses the approach of the Irish Car Carbon Reduction Alliance, especially its view that “replacement of the car fleet with newer ICE models should not be discouraged prematurely”. “With the supply of EVs outside Ireland’s control, it is vital that we address the mitigating factors that are within our ability to control,” says its spokesman, Denis Murphy. Furthermore, as national new car sales figures demonstrate, showing a continuing decline in registrations, motorists in Ireland are sticking with their current older cars, which have higher carbon emissions. “Our taxation system is actually facilitating rather than reducing carbon emissions. New cars in 2021 with ICEs will emit 28 per cent less CO2 than the average car currently on Irish roads, so for every car we replace with a newer cleaner car, we can achieve significant reductions by 2025.”"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoring"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

File photograph: Valerie MaconAFP via Getty ImagesThe State’s incidence of Covid-19 appears set to surpass that of the UK for the first time since the pandemic started, new figures show.The 14-day incidence of the disease in the Republic has increased sevenfold in the space of three weeks, to reach 15.8 cases per 100,000 of population, according to an update from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control yesterday.This compares to a figure of 15.9 in the UK, which a month ago had an incidence almost eight times that of Ireland. Since then, case numbers in the UK have been steady, although yesterday they exceeded 1,000 for the first time since June.Covid-19 is now being detected at a higher rate in the State than in Germany and Slovenia and a number of other EU countries not on the Government’s green list.The figures highlight the dramatic increase in the number of cases in recent weeks, driven largely by outbreaks in food processing plants in the midlands.Kildare Chilling in Kildare town, which has registered 150 cases, and O’Brien Fine Foods in Timahoe, with 86 cases, have suspended production, while Irish Dog Foods in Naas, where 53 cases have been reported, has shelved plans to reopen today.A fourth plant, Carroll’s Cuisine in Tullamore, Co Offaly, which has nine cases, remains open but is undergoing a deep-clean and yesterday tested a further 210 staff.The Department of Health has asked the HSE to begin testing all staff working in meat processing facilities nationwide. The HSE is meanwhile finalising plans to test asylum seekers in all direct provision centres nationwide, fortnightly. Covid-19 clusters have been reported in a number of direct provision centres in recent weeks, some of them linked to staff working at meat plants.Testing is also restarting from today for healthcare workers in nursing homes, starting initially with staff in the three counties under local restrictions, counties Kildare, Laois and Offaly.Another 68 confirmed cases of Covid-19 were disclosed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) yesterday evening 174 new cases had been reported by NPHET on Saturday. One new Covid-19-related death was reported over the weekend.New planMeanwhile, it has emerged that the Government may draw up a new plan to deal with pandemic contingencies such as a second serious wave of coronavirus or localised outbreaks.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said NPHET has produced a view for the Government to consider.

Photograph: Aengus McMahonPAAcademics are recruiting 300 people for a study seeking to establish if Ireland’s sea-swimmers and surfers are more prone to spreading potentially lethal superbugs.Research shows antibiotic resistant bacteria is present in Irish coastal waters, lakes and rivers, mainly from sewage, waste water and manure running off from farms during heavy rainfall.However, because bathing waters are routinely tested for some bacteria but not for antibiotic resistant bacteria, the extent of the problem is not fully known.Dr Liam Burke, a microbiologist at NUI Galway who is working on the new study, says a team of investigators will examine whether those taking a regular dip are contributing to outbreaks of superbugs like Carbapenemase Producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE).“We know there are some bugs in the sea and we just want to see whether people are at risk of picking them up and whether they are carrying them in their gut,” he told The .“If people are carrying them in their gut, they are likely to be spreading these bugs around in their homes and workplaces. The threat is if the bugs get to vulnerable people — it is a little bit like the Covid situation.”CPE is the newest in a long line of bacteria that are extremely difficult to kill with antibiotics.It lives harmlessly in the gut of healthy people but can be deadly if it gets into the bloodstream or bladder, which is most likely to happen to those with weaker immune systems, including the sick, the very young and the very old.Superbugs can transfer easily from healthy people to vulnerable people.Dr Burke said such superbugs are causing “real problems in hospitals” and outbreaks — mainly in hospital wards — has been increasing in Ireland and worldwide in recent years.Two years ago there were two outbreaks of the CPE superbug in Cork University Hospital.“We want to understand how these bugs get into human populations and we want to see if sea swimming and swimming in natural waters is a way that they can get into human populations,” said Dr Burke.The study, funded by the Environmental Protection Agency, will involve two cohorts: a group of 150 sea swimmers, surfers and people who regularly bathe in the sea, lakes or rivers and a second group of 150 people who rarely take to the water.Recruits will be sent a kit in the post in which to return free-of-charge a tiny faecal sample and short survey. Anyone aged 18 or over who lives on the island of Ireland can sign up to take part on the website.The research team hopes their findings will help improve policy on environmental monitoring of antibiotic resistance and the release of effluent and other sources containing superbugs into natural waters."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Buyers may want to go green, but for those travelling long distances the range is smallGarda\u0026iacute appeal for witnesses after man suffered serious injuries and later diedMembers of police force targetted while helping to remove internment bonfireInvestigators will examine whether those taking regular dip contribute to outbreaks of bugs like CPEStephen Corrigan identified through DNA sample given by late mother after relatives foundMany Irish MEPs have stayed in Ireland and worked remotely during the pandemicNew report outlines deaths of young people known to child protection systemCalls to Childline service tripled during coronavirus lockdownGovernment may draw up a new roadmap to deal with coronavirus contingenciesApplicants must have spent at least three years living in Ireland before applyingReaders\u0026rsquo Queries: With Gaelic games called off this year, GAAGO has offered extensionsFrom the hotels to local shopping centre \u0026ndash people in midlands hub react to restrictionsPublic health officials say serial testing of at-risk groups would be done on voluntary basisBrazil is also due to be targeted as part of State\u0026rsquos so-called red list of Covid-19 hotspots\u0026lsquoDespite all our efforts, unfortunately we can\u0026rsquot control outside circumstances\u0026rsquoOnline passenger locator form being developed by HSE due to launch this monthDeath toll from Covid-19 in the Republic now stands at 1,772 and 26,712 confirmed casesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4325978.1596996129!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"meath creche awaits test results after two cases of covid 19","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn Daoine Óga Community Childcare Centre in Navan: results of testing on all seven staff and most of the children have returned negative but results for the remaining children are awaited.Staff and parents at a Co Meath creche are awaiting test results after two staff members proved positive for Covid-19 earlier this week.The results at An Daoine Óga Community Childcare Centre in Navan have been described by its chief executive Marie Daly as “extremely devastating”, especially after an investment of €10,000 in protective personal equipment (PPE) and other Covid-19 measures at the facility.Children at the facility had been ided into pods of up to eight, with two staff members in each.One of the eight rooms at the centre was immediately closed after a staff member complained of a sore throat and subsequently tested positive for the illness last Wednesday.The second staff member in the same pod of eight children, aged between one and two years of age, has tested negative.However, because a “floating” staff member was working between two units, management closed a second room containing seven children aged between two and three years old.That member tested negative but her co-worker in the pod was confirmed to have the virus.Neither of the two staff who tested positive were in contact with each other either inside or outside of work.Since then, results of testing on all seven staff and most of the children have returned negative but results for the remaining children are awaited.“All our staff’s temperatures are taken three times every day and none of the two staff who tested positive had a temperature,” said Ms Daly.“The first employee complained of a sore throat and the second had a runny nose and aches and pains.“We immediately shut the first room down when the case was confirmed last Wednesday, and all the parents and the relevant statutory bodies were informed.”PodsShe said that since reopening in June, all rooms were ided into pods of up to eight children with two members of staff per pod.

A new £650 million Brexit support and peace and reconciliation package for Northern Ireland was announced by British Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove who was visiting the North on Friday.The funding comprises £300 million of support for the European Union’s Peace Plus programme and £355 million to assist traders in the North deal with the complications of Brexit. Of the £355 million the package involves £200 million towards a new free-to-use Trader Support Service that will assist with import, safety and security declarations on behalf of traders.The other £155 million, according to Mr Gove’s office, will fund the development of new technology to ensure the new processes can be fully digital and streamlined.Mr Gove’s department said the “new service will be available to businesses bringing in goods from Great Britain or the rest of the world, providing guidance as well as dealing with their requirements for moving goods into Northern Ireland”. The £300 million confirmed by Mr Gove for the Peace Plus programme will help “to support peace, prosperity and reconciliation projects on the island of Ireland”.Mr Gove who, accompanied by Northern Secretary Brandon Lewis, was visiting Northern Ireland on Friday, said the £650 million investment underlined the British government’s “absolute commitment to the people and businesses of Northern Ireland as we move towards the end of the transition period”.“Our new free-to-use Trader Support Service will provide vital support and guidance to traders, while our £300 million investment in reconciliation projects will help to preserve the huge gains from the peace process and the Belfast Agreement,” he said. “As we continue to engage with businesses, and our discussions with the EU proceed, we will update these resources to ensure that traders are ready for the end of the transition period,” added Mr Gove.Mr Lewis said the Trader Support Service “will ensure that businesses of all sizes can have import processes dealt with on their behalf, at no cost”."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Lai has been a prominent democracy activist and an ardent critic of BeijingAuthorities warn against complacency as other countries battle a resurgenceCrack in hull of Japanese-owned ship is spilling oil into country\u0026rsquos famed blue lagoonsAttitudes still shaped by legacy code of conduct that dictates women must be submissive and patientAircraft with 190 passengers and crew on board overshoots runway in heavy rain in CalicutAbe avoids reference to nuclear treaty during scaled-back ceremony due to coronavirus\u0026lsquoWhat frightened me the most was how we got used to the piles of dead bodies\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash survivorIndia\u0026rsquos supreme court handed site to Hindus last year in culmination of complex disputeChina says attempts by Washington to engage more closely with Taipei \u0026lsquodoomed to fail\u0026rsquoCountry\u0026rsquos move closer to China set to be confirmed after unusually subdued pollThree men stuck on tiny Pikelot Island after boat ran out of fuel spotted by military aircraftAustralian state to deploy military, impose hefty fines to enforce Covid-19 isolationNorth Korea subject to UN sanctions since 2006 over nuclear and ballistic missile programsAt least 29 killed in terror group\u0026rsquos assault on prison in eastern city of JalalabadPolice officers and government officials suspended following deaths in Punjab stateInfections surge in Latin America while China reports highest total since MarchPro-democracy opposition, which was seeking a majority, says move politically motivatedCountry records first Covid death after finding virus lurking in tourist city of DanangInternational lawmakers condemn move as \u0026lsquounacceptable obstructions of democratic process\u0026rsquoAustralian state reports daily record of 723 new infections as PM calls for patienceStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"IMF willing to redouble efforts but said all Lebanon\u0026rsquos institutions need to show willingness to reformPolice fire tear gas near parliament as donors pledge \u0026lsquomajor resources\u0026rsquo after explosionPort officials globally have a tough time preventing the abandonment of ships or seafarersTwenty-five years after the Balkan conflict\u0026rsquos worst atrocity the Bosnian town remains idedDemonstrations stretch far beyond prime minister\u0026rsquos official residence in Jerusalem\u0026lsquoWe have no trust in our government . . .

Photograph: Diego Ibarra SanchezThe New York TimesAn emergency donor conference on Sunday for blast-stricken Lebanon raised pledges worth nearly €253 million for immediate humanitarian relief, the French presidency said.Those commitments would not be conditional on political or institutional reform, president Emmanuel Macron’s office said. There were also pledges made for longer-term support that would depend on changes brought in by the authorities, the Elysee Palace said.World powers promised not to fail the Lebanese people as the capital, Beirut, recovers from the massive explosion of more than 2,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate that killed 158 people, injured more than 6,000 and destroyed swathes of the city last Tuesday. Lebanon was already mired in political and financial crisis before the blast.Transparency demanded But foreign countries demanded transparency over how the aid is used, wary of writing blank cheques to a government viewed by its own people as deeply corrupt. Some are concerned about the influence of Iran through the Shia group Hezbollah. The “assistance should be timely, sufficient and consistent with the needs of the Lebanese people ... and directly delivered to the Lebanese population, with utmost efficiency and transparency,” the final communiqué stated.Mr Macron, who visited Beirut on Thursday, hosted the conference by video-link and in his opening remarks urged participating nations to put aside their differences and support the Lebanese people.The international response should be co-ordinated by the United Nations in Lebanon, he added.The offer of assistance included support for an impartial, credible and independent inquiry into the blast. Public anger over the explosion has prompted some Lebanese to call for a revolt to topple their political leaders.“Our role is to be by their side,” Mr Macron said from his summer retreat on the French Riviera.President Donald Trump told the conference the United States was ready to continue providing aid to help the Lebanese, the White House said.Mr Trump later said the United States would send additional planes loaded with medical supplies, food and water and would give substantial aid to Lebanon, though he declined to give a dollar figure.“We haven’t given a number, but it will be substantial. On a humanitarian basis, we have to do it,” Mr Trump told reporters in Morristown, New Jersey.The International Monetary Fund said it was willing to redouble efforts to help Lebanon after the devastating blast, but said all of the country’s institutions needed to show willingness to carry out reforms.In a statement to the conference, the IMF’s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, laid out reforms expected, including steps to restore the solvency of public finances and the soundness of the financial system, and temporary safeguards to avoid continued capital outflows.The explosion gutted entire neighbourhoods, leaving 250,000 people homeless, razing businesses and destroying critical grain supplies.Rebuilding Beirut will likely run into the billions of dollars. Economists forecast the blast could wipe up to 25 per cent off of the country’s GDP.Lebanon’s environment minister resigned from prime minister Hassan Diab’s government on Sunday, saying the government had lost a number of opportunities to reform, a statement said.

According to Lebanese  reports, officials are investigating whether the  recent major blast in Beirut was caused by  ammonium-nitrate that allegedly originated from the  vessel.  Photograph: EPATony VrailasHidden behind the tragedy of Tuesday’s deadly explosion in Beirut is the more pervasive travesty of the abandonment of ships, seafarers and cargo, and unless the global public reckons with this deeper problem a next disaster is all but inevitable.While Lebanese investigators say that nearby fireworks likely ignited the 2,750 tons of explosive ammonium-nitrate, the true causes of this explosion stem from slower-moving and less dramatic factors: anaemic enforcement by shady flag registries that are supposed to hold shipowners accountable, tightened immigration controls that routinely trap stranded crews on decrepit ships, lax rules and a maritime bureaucracy designed more to protect anonymity and secrecy of ship owners than to enable oversight and transparency of the industry.These are the factors that make it so easy for vessel owners and operators to walk away from their responsibilities usually with impunity, and sometimes with life-or-death consequences for the crew that gets left behind.The broader story begins on the barely-seaworthy, Russian-owned ship flagged to Moldova called the Rhosus that in 2013 was transporting tons of the volatile and odourless crystalline substance when Lebanese port authorities deemed the vessel unsafe to continue its journey.Refusing to answer urgent calls from the crew or port authorities, the ship’s owner, a Russian man named Igor Grechushkin, was soon confronted with heavy fines, including roughly $100,000 in back wages and port fees. In response Grechushkin did what many shipowners do. He cut his losses, declared bankruptcy, and quietly disappeared, abandoning his workers, the dilapidated ship and its deadly cargo.That Grechushkin could disavow his duties so easily is a consequence of the labyrinthine elements of maritime law and administration, and the distinctly transient and trans-national nature of the industry. Lebanese authorities were hard pressed to arrest Grechushkin or seize his property since he lived not in Lebanon but in Cyprus, and his shipping company, Teto Shipping Ltd, was registered on the Marshall Islands.No moneyMeanwhile, the men left onboard the Rhosus found themselves in a bind that is surprisingly common for seafarers around the world. Lacking clean water, fuel, or food, not to mention phone service, legal help or the ability to speak the local language, these men had no money to get home nor even the immigration papers allowing them to disembark.While warning anyone who would listen about the dangers of the Rhosus’s cargo, several of the stranded crew waited a full year before they were able to go home with help from the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF), which is the largest global seafarers union.On any given day hundreds of ships and thousands of seafarers are in the same situation. Port officials like those in Beirut have little power to repatriate abandoned crews or ships when they are left behind. Usually cargo gets sent to its rightful owner because it travels with insurance, but the men who work on board are rarely as lucky.A database created by the ITF and international labour section of the UN indicates that nearly 5,000 seafarers were abandoned on their vessels in nearly 400 separate incidents between 2004 and 2018. Over the past six years while reporting on crimes at sea, I’ve stumbled across hundreds of these dire predicaments.Take for instance the 16 men stuck on the Zoya 1, a supertanker that in April 2018 had been trapped off the coast of the UAE for more than a year and were owed more than four months’ salary. Languishing on board a ship overrun with vermin, the men slowly fell apart, physically and mentally. Unable to disembark, several of the men who were unable to swim tried to take their own lives by jumping overboard. In a photo taken at the time, crew members held signs that said, “We are helpless. We did not commit any crime.” The crew was repatriated in June 2018.Covid-19 has made matters worse, stranding roughly 400,000 mariners at sea and in ports. “The ITF has been receiving emails from hundreds of seafarers daily, expressing their concern about contracts being extended under duress,” said Stephen Cotton, general secretary of the ITF.In the port of Beirut, for example, not far from the warehouse that exploded, an oil tanker called the Captain Nagdaliyev was abandoned with 13 seafarers on board. Stuck for nearly a year, these men have been without wages, water or food, and they barely escaped with their lives when the warehouse blew apart sections of their ship.Even when crews make it home, their cargo presents risks. Case in point: the full oil tanker called the FSO Safer, which was abandoned in one of the world’s busiest shipping routes last year along the coast of Yemen. Hit by a rocket-propelled grenade, this floating bomb could cause massive environmental damage, impede marine traffic and kill hundreds, according to marine safety experts.Similarly, environmentalists and union officials have warned of a possible disaster tied to an abandoned ship 21km off the coast of the Philippines in Manila Bay. A crew of 15 have been stuck on the Spanish tanker MV Celanova since February 2nd. Loaded with liquid petroleum gas, the tanker lacks enough fuel to keep the cargo refrigerated and port officials warn there is imminent risk of fire.Strict rulesInternationally there are strict rules mandating that ammonium-nitrate should not be stored near fuels or sources of heat. In the US regulations over ammonium-nitrate were tightened significantly after the Oklahoma City bombing of a federal building in which 168 people died.There is no shortage of blame to share for what happened in Beirut. Local corruption and ineptitude within the Lebanese government likely played a role. Customs authorities repeatedly tried to get permission from local judges to allow them to seize so they could export the ammonium-nitrate or to hand it over to the Lebanese army rather than store it dangerously in the port warehouse. Their urgent letters went unanswered for years.Port officials globally have a tough time preventing the abandonment of ships or seafarers partly because of the opaque way that the shipping industry polices itself. For centuries the world’s merchant fleets flew the flag of the country of their home port. That country was responsible for ensuring the proper treatment of the crew and safety of the vessel. This began to change in the early 20th century with the emergence of “open registries”, also called “flags of convenience”.The company collecting fees for the right to fly a certain flag is also responsible for policing its customers, ensuring they abide by safety, labour, and environmental rules, and conducting investigations when things go wrong. But in practice flags of convenience create a perverse incentive for ship operators to shop around for the most lax registries with the lowest prices and fewest regulations.The Rhosus, for instance, was flagged to Moldova, which at least since 2013 has been on a black list that is run by Paris MoU, an international naval organisation that monitors and regulates maritime traffic in European waters. The organisation labelled Moldovan-flagged ships as “medium to high risk” due to the number of times their ships have been inspected or detained in the past three years.Crimes of neglectThe media is also complicit. Dramatic disasters such as the deadly Beirut explosion reflect acute problems and typically grab press attention. Slow-motion tragedies and bureaucratic crimes of neglect such as those that preceded the Beirut explosion rarely get covered, even though the ruinous impact is often as severe.When abandoned seafarers do make it home they usually face crushing debt due to the unpaid wages and the money they borrowed to get this job at sea. Their maritime licences expired, they are often also blacklisted by the local employment agencies that control access to jobs.In 2017, partly motivated by bad press and union pressure, the shipping industry came together in an unprecedented fashion and tried to confront the tendency to abandon seafarers. The industry imposed a new rule requiring shipowners to carry insurance to cover the costs of sailors marooned in port. Unfortunately most of the smaller and older vessels that are most likely to strand mariners are not, under this new rule, the ones required to carry such insurance.Ian Urbina, a former investigative reporter for the New York Times, is the director of the Outlaw Ocean Project, a non-profit journalism organisation based in Washington DC that focuses on reporting about environmental and human rights crimes at seaStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"germans dont worship health service better","story":"In judging our Covid-19 performance, we naturally compare it with that of other countries. The most telling comparison is with nations whose predicament is closest to ours. Enormous countries, such as China, Brazil and the US, are not closely comparable. Nor are much poorer countries, or more thinly populated ones.The natural comparisons are Western European, and even here, there are important differences. The Scandinavian countries, with their small, well-extended populations, are not so close to the British experience, although we should learn from their medical systems. The nearest comparisons, surely, are quite densely populated neighbours with roughly similar populations and GDP, urban concentrations and large international airports. That means France, Italy, Germany and, perhaps, Spain.The eventual Covid-19 post-mortem will no doubt unearth mistakes that are uniquely British, but if you look at the story so far, you will see that neither Britain, France, Italy, or Spain has done markedly better than one another. In deaths per million of the population – a more meaningful comparator than total numbers – we, at 684, are the worst of these four but the others are bad too (Italy 582, France 462. Plucky little Belgium, by the way, seems to be the world’s worst, at 851). The only one in a different league is Germany, at 110.Why might this be? First, Germany had the “luck” to get an early case of the coronavirus. A female business traveller from Shanghai arrived on January 16 and fell ill with the virus. She was treated at the Munich Schwabing Hospital. A consequent cluster of 16 cases was identified. On February 13, at the country’s Science Media Centre, a huge press conference reported the scientific findings in detail. The press release warned that “every day the spread is not controlled, the likelihood that the epidemic will develop into a pandemic increases”.But the mere fact of a disease being identified does not mean the authorities know what to do about it. The Germans did. I am no expert on Germany, but here are a few factors.Expertise. The Munich hospital has a special unit for highly contagious life-threatening infections. Its chief physician spoke at the press conference. So did the professor who had developed one of the first tests for Covid-19, as did the president of the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin, the government’s public health institute. Lockdown was quicker than in Britain, but less draconian and more targeted.Testing (mainly for flu) is a more established part of life in Germany than in Britain. It has gone on apace throughout Covid. Also, where the NHS closed down, the normal German health system kept going. Patients with Covid were not, as they were here, told to stay at home unaided. They were constantly monitored. If their oxygen levels dropped too low, they were admitted to hospital. The needs of care homes were not ignored. No patient was sent to a care home unless it could provide 14 days’ quarantine.Media. Far more German journalists are well acquainted with science than are their British counterparts. They give the public clearer facts and fewer scare stories.Dispersal. Unlike Britain, Germany is a country of many different centres, with associated airports – Berlin, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt and so on, rather than London, London and more London. So there was less danger of a sudden explosion of the plague.A related fact is that the country is federal. Sixteen states, rather than the central government, are responsible for most aspects of health care. This sometimes slows things down, but it also means that, compared with Britain, there is more local “buy-in”, more local players who get going, rather than waiting upon a distant bureaucracy.This creates a good spread of service across Germany. There were plenty of labs for testing, for example, in plenty of places. There was no appalling rush. When Britain finally got round to test and trace, the Government commissioned Serco to run it from a single call centre in Scotland. As the former health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, points out, you are more likely to comply with tracing from a knowledgeable employee of your county council than a call from a student hundreds of miles away. In Germany, the “corona-detectors” are a respected body of local experts.Good politics. Many in Britain have grown rather fed up with the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, what with her ambiguous speeches and her hostility to Brexit. Her star has gradually waned even at home. Nevertheless, she is a scientist by training and an experienced, steady person. She can command respect in the crisis, precisely because she is not, in any detailed sense, in charge of Covid policy. Rather than having to pretend she has all the answers, she can exercise moral authority.Mrs Merkel is in this enviable position because – astonishing to British eyes – she runs a country in which health care is not usually high on the list of political controversies. In Britain, the health secretary – currently Matt Hancock – has to run all hospitals and the fifth largest workforce in the world. At the same time, he has to spend days in the House of Commons being assailed by accusations that he is trying to “sell off” the NHS and similar nonsense. The German health minister (an able man called Jens Spahn) has infinitely less power, but – no offence to Mr Hancock – can do more practical good. His role has not been to try to run a vast, unmanageable empire, but simply to oil the wheels of a system which already works, by putting in more government money – covering the costs of testing, and paying for ICU beds to be kept available.Why is Germany free of what Mr Hunt calls “the political poison” of our system? Not because Germans don’t care about health – they actually spend a higher proportion of their GDP on it than we do, and they have better health outcomes. It is because they have never bought the doctrine that a particular health care system is sacred.The origins of good health care for ordinary Germans lie in mutual funds in the 19th century, set up to help pay for funerals. These developed into much more sophisticated, competing systems of health insurance, underwritten by the state, but not run by it. Employer and employee both contribute. An unemployed person has his health care paid for in his unemployment insurance. Almost no German citizen falls through the net.The providers are also various. Government-run hospitals are outnumbered by privately run ones and others run by charities (many, for instance by the Order of St John). Because the money follows the patient, the providers have good incentives to provide. Indeed, the problem in Germany is too many hospital beds.In Britain, the health service is an object of high emotion. Behind the praise often lies a fear that it is precarious. In Germany, there is little emotional commitment to the service – rather as, here, there is little intense feeling for Sainsbury’s or Waitrose. Instead of high emotion, there is a high level of confidence. This may help explain why so many more Germans than British have returned to work, although Covid numbers jump upwards from time to time. Psychologically and medically, the German way is better for the national health than is the thing we call the National Health Service.Do you agree that the German health service is better than the NHS?

It’s the team which everyone – apart from the natives themselves, naturally – wants to get beaten. This has been especially true in the liberal US press, which has taken time off from berating Donald Trump to publish lengthy pieces on the supposed failure of the Swedish approach. “The Swedish government didn’t enforce social distancing,” began the Washington Monthly, for example, in May when Sweden briefly had the world’s highest death rate from the disease. “It’s now paying the price – in lives and GDP.”Even neighbouring Nordic countries – normally peas in a pod – have taken against Sweden. When Denmark and Norway re-opened their borders to the world they initially left out Sweden. Sweden’s chief epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, who has acquired a rock star image among some of his countrymen, is seen as a maverick by many abroad.It’s not hard to see why politicians, officials and many others around the world need Sweden to fail and to fail spectacularly. If the Scandinavian country is not seen to suffer for its failure to lock down its population and close down much of its economy then citizens in other countries are going to start asking awkward questions.For a while it looked as if Sweden might well fail spectacularly. While other, locked-down countries saw their rates of new infection plummet and gradually unlocked, infections in Sweden remained stubbornly high. Economic projections suggested that Sweden was going to suffer a deep recession anyway. All those needless deaths, it seemed, and Swedes were still going to lose their jobs.Then came July, and a reminder that lockdown is no long-term solution to a pandemic. Infection rates began to creep up in countries which had locked down – first Spain, then Germany, France, Belgium. Some have been going to into selective second lockdowns. All they had really done by incarcerating their populations for weeks is sweep the virus under the carpet for another day. Sweden, by contrast, has as yet seen no second wave.Meanwhile, the Swedish economy has surprised on the upside. Last week, its economy was revealed to have shrunk by 8.6 per cent in the second quarter – cataclysmic by normal standards, of course, yet in the circumstances it counts as a triumph. GDP across the Eurozone shrank by 12 per cent, with Spain’s economy plunging by 18 per cent quarter on quarter. Britain’s GDP figures won’t be out until next Wednesday, but we will be doing very well if we don’t out-shrink Spain. At one point the Office of Budgetary Responsibility was penciling in a 35 per cent plunge for the UK in the second quarter.      There was no way that Sweden, with many of its neighbours’ economies closed, was going to escape without a sharp contraction. Volvo, for example, suffered a 38 per cent fall in sales as showrooms across Europe were closed. Nevertheless, there is an intriguing possibility that Sweden could be just about the only developed country to manage to get through the Covid-19 crisis without technically suffering a recession – defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth.Alone in Europe, it managed to grow its economy by 0.4 percent in the first quarter. One after another, Swedish companies have produced results which have exceeded expectations. There have been few bankruptcies. What’s more, having kept factories and other workplaces open throughout the crisis, the Swedes have an advantage in the recovery. They don’t have a workforce which has lost the habit of working, which enjoyed weeks off in the spring sunshine and is now reluctant to return.But was it worth all those deaths? The case against Sweden rests on comparisons with its neighbours, Denmark and Norway. On that basis, Sweden looks to have come off badly – its 571 deaths per million residents seems reckless compared with that of Denmark (106) or Norway (47). But then are Denmark and Norway the right comparators?Sweden has much more significant urban areas compared with Norway, and it has a high number people who take skiing holidays in the Alps – which seems to have been the seat, or one of the main seats, of Covid-19 in Europe. Significantly, Sweden has a lower death rate than many European countries which did go into full lockdown, such as Italy (582), Spain (610), the UK (683) and Belgium (850).But even if Sweden has suffered a relatively high number of deaths to date, that is not the end of the story. As John Giesecke, Sweden’s former chief epidemiologist and adviser to the World Health Organisation (WHO), argued in April we won’t really be able to judge how different countries have performed until the crisis has reached some kind of conclusion, either through a vaccine or the natural decline of the virus. His belief is that, eventually, comparable countries will have similar death rates, but the misery – both health and economic – will be spread out far longer in some than others.Were an effective vaccine to become available this autumn, then the suppression strategy proposed in Professor Neil Ferguson’s paper of March 16 and followed by most developed countries, will seem wise. But just how long are governments prepared to suppress their economies? The longer a vaccine takes to arrive – and there is no guarantee that a vaccine will ever be approved, even if early trials have been promising – then the more that the Swedish approach will seem appealing.The disappointing news from Sweden’s point of view is that antibody tests suggest that the country is still far from achieving herd immunity. The country’s Public Health Agency revealed in June that even in Stockholm, the worst-affected place in the country, only 10 percent of the population had antibodies – way short of the 60 to 80 percent which our own chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, suggested would be needed for herd immunity.Not all scientists are agreed on this, however. Last week, modelling in a yet-to-be published paper by an international group of scientists led by Gabriella Gomes of Strathclyde University claimed that the 60 percent is only applicable where herd immunity is gained through a vaccine programme given randomly to a population. If a virus is allowed to spread naturally, on the other hand, it will affect the more susceptible people first (people who either have fewer natural defences or who have more contacts).Once this group has been infected, the virus finds it much harder to spread and herd immunity will be reached at a much lower level – when between 10 and 20 percent of the population have been infected. If that is right, Sweden might be far closer to herd immunity than previously believed.      In the meantime, Sweden finds itself with unfamiliar friends and unfamiliar enemies. Thanks to its generous welfare policies it is more often a country praised on the left and condemned by economic liberals. Now it is now the other way around. Ultimately Sweden might just end up pleasing both groups – if, thanks to a less-damaged economy, it emerges as the only country able to avoid deep welfare cuts.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"rather sound like minnie mouse helium have rp accent","story":"In my young life, I wanted to change quite a few things about myself. I was a blonde who wanted to be a brunette. I was a West Country schoolgirl who wanted to be a famous writer. I’ve achieved them all with some level of success. But one thing I’ve never wanted to do was change my voice. If you’ve ever heard me speak (look me up on Desert Island Discs if you haven’t) you might find this peculiar. I do not, to put it mildly, have a voice much found in public life. It’s been compared to a rustic child (though I come from Bristol, a big city, everyone talks like a farmer there), Minnie Mouse on helium and – my favourite – an evil toy cat.There’s a tradition of humbly-born media women changing their accents, from Joan Bakewell to Caitlin Moran. It’s creepy how men aren’t expected to do so to the same extent as some wit (me) once said “Men are the sum of their parts whereas women are some of their parts.” But not me – I love my voice. I never get upset about what people say about me but one of the few times I’ve been livid and thought seriously about suing was when Will Self wrote of me some years back: “Burchill is meant to have a complex about her girlish voice and her Wurzelesque accent, but while we were chatting it dropped at least an octave and regional began to slide towards received.”Despising it as I do as the mark of either the upper-class boor or the lower-class castrate, I was surprised that Received Pronunciation was voted the most attractive accent this week in a survey by the online dating website eharmony. Respondents were asked to listen to a sentence read by speakers with twenty varying accents and rate each on how much they associated them with ten different character traits.Received Pronunciation was found to be strongly associated with intelligence, sophistication and charm – really, has no one been following the recent trajectories of Princes Andrew and Harry, and of every other over-privileged clown who frequently has to extract the plum in his mouth in order to fit his foot in?Equally bafflingly it was followed by the New Zealand accent two places above the Australian accent – is there a difference? (My NZ friend says yes: “We laugh in the bath, they lef in the bef. We say six six six is the number of the beast they say it’s a night-long roll in the hay.”) Or has the plague made those who live in the wide open spaces of New Zealand seem suddenly desirable?Similarly, I can’t help thinking that three of the worst four accents are influenced by current affairs. Images of Cornish natives daubing rude graffiti telling unwanted tourists to go home have obliterated the swashbuckling sex appeal of Poldark.While French and Spanish accents being only slightly less loathed is surely a Brexit thing once considered the most seductive of tongues, we now associate them with pen-pushing spoil-sports telling us we can’t have bendy bananas.I’m not a normal person by any means and my taste in accents is predictably off-message. I like some conventionally attractive lilts, such as Welsh and Geordie, but also Brummie, apparently the fourth most loathed. I’m not alone a bar in Tel Aviv advertised for staff in a Birmingham local newspaper awhile back.I like all the accents one isn’t meant to – the Mancunian and the Scouser and the guttural Northern Irish. I suppose I like the accents I think of as working-class if they aren’t, that means the speaker had privilege and therefore can never be a truly self-made success, and thus is not a first-rate person in my invertedly snobbish eyes. Brutal, but true.And as a Brexiteer, I’m keen on voices that sound like they come from Somewhere the bourgeoise of Bristol or Brighton tend to sound just the same as they do in Barnes. Until we hear Radio 4 newsreaders with Bristolian and Brummie accents, the BBC’s drive for more regional voices will remain a bastion of empty-headed virtue-signalling. As they pursue the admirable goal of racial ersity, they should be promoting the voices of the working class, too.“Nation shall speak peace unto nation” – but only if you can dumb down to RP.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 10th august 2020","story":"A demonstrator waves the Lebanese flag in front of riot police during a protest in BeirutPolitics latest news: Minister attacks \u0026#39unacceptable\u0026#39 rise in migrant crossing ahead of crunch talksCoronavirus latest news: Rota system for schools \u0026#39makes very little difference\u0026#39, says Sage scientistTravel latest: Malta poised for quarantine restrictions as cases riseClashes after Belarusian strongman president claims 80 per cent of election voteComment: The art of storage is the next hip food trend we badly needBelarus\u0026#39 authoritarian leader projected to win elections by landslide as protests eruptA third of medics still do not have the PPE they need, survey finds Comment: Seattle\u0026#39s experiment to abolish the police is a disasterGovernment plans to boost nurse numbers with £172m recruitment driveUS health secretary Alex Azar praises Taiwan president Tsai Ing-wen in \u0026#39breakthrough\u0026#39 meetingCod and monkfish could disappear from British menus due to climate change, warns studyA river search in the west of Scotland ends after missing child\u0026#39s body foundBoris Johnson plans to set new targets for police in a bid to improve record-low rape prosecutionsMetal detectorist unearths a Bronze Age sword and horse harness in the Scottish bordersIncreasing numbers of women over 50 forced into retirement because of coronavirusChildren more lonely, tired and stressed due to lockdown, study findsLab grown meat should be funded by the Government to help beat obesity, think tank saysBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/07/28/16/rishi-sunak.jpg","title":"jobs unemployment rishi sunak job retention scheme furlough cipd labour market outlook bdo economic","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.The chancellor said he didn’t want to give furloughed workers ‘false hope’\u0026nbspby extending his job retention scheme but it\u0026nbspcould be the that the economy is simply too weak to cope in its absence, writes\u0026nbspJames Moore\u0026nbspIf two sets of data out this morning are right, the pressure on chancellor Rishi Sunak to perform a volte face and extend his job retention scheme, and prevent a bitter economic wind blowing through Britain in the autumn, is only going to mount.

Most adults are consuming between 200 and 300 more calories a day than is recommendedRose Lasko-Skinner, researcher at Demos and author of the new report, said: “Boris Johnson’s strategy to crackdown on obesity is a welcome step in the right direction. But it doesn’t go far enough in tackling root causes of obesity — many of which lie in our food sector, rather than with retailers.“Our research shows there is an opportunity for the government to be even bolder, and pioneers for a new era of food innovation.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

According to its survey, the main drivers of people choosing unhealthy food include taste, cost and ease.A majority of people, almost 60 per cent, would back a requirement on all grocery shops to stock healthy foods. Just under half, 45 per cent, of people would support standardised packaging on unhealthy foods similar to cigarette packaging.The report also recommends ministers back more research on lab-grown meat and meat alternatives as well as subsidising foods that are already low in price, such as tins of tomatoes, carrots and frozen vegetables to make healthy options much cheaper.It also calls for more support by local councils and government to help fast food outlets switch to healthier options rather than seeking to close them outright.Obese people may be told to stay home if second coronavirus wave hitsCalorie counting puts people with eating disorders in dangerJunk food isn’t the only enemy, it’s products pretending to be healthyThe government’s recent strategy suggested a bank on advertising junk food on TV and online before 9pm and restricting two for one style deals. It also aims to introduce calorie labelling in large restaurants.A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: “We recently launched a world-leading obesity strategy to make the healthy choice the easy choice for families and help reduce obesity rates. It builds on existing progress, including the voluntary sugar reduction programme and wider reformulation programme with industry which resulted in a 2.9 per cent reduction in average sugar across retail products in its first two years.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is the largest daily increase since late June.

The restrictions for the city were announced on Friday and came into force that midnight. Greater Manchester, as well as parts of East Lancashire and West Yorkshire, were hit with the same rules the week before.

Swindon is now the fourth worst affected area in the UK when measured as a proportion of population, having seen a 200 per cent increase in new cases over the last seven days.It has nearly as many new cases per person as Leicester, which was the first place to see tougher local restrictions put in place after the nationwide lockdown lifted.The UK as a whole remains a long way off its peak levels from April and May, when daily new cases frequently reached above 5,000.Yet local spikes could see the recent upwards trend continue if not brought under control, as has been the case in other countries like France and Spain.Having endured a big surge in cases during the early stages of the pandemic, London has since seen its number of daily cases drop at an even greater rate than the rest of the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The Home Office spent more than £1m on deporting hundreds of people at the height of the lockdown, despite government instructions warning against all non-essential travel, The Independent can reveal.New figures show 285 iniduals were removed to Albania, Romania, Lithuania and Poland on seven charter flights between 1 April and 30 June 2020, along with 374 escorts, at a cost to the taxpayer of £1,105,931.One of the deportees was a Polish woman who had lived in the UK for 10 years and was removed on the basis of a shoplifting conviction for which she spent six months in jail, forcing her to leave her 11-year-old son behind.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe data, obtained through a freedom of information request by campaign group No Deportations, show there were three flights chartered to Romania, two to Albania and one to both Poland and Lithuania. The deportees were made up of 268 men and 17 women.They departed from the UK at a time when the government had issued stay-at-home instructions stating that people should not fly unless it was essential, and when international air travel had dropped by 95 per cent.Home Office restarts removals of asylum seekers despite Covid-19 fearsGovernment ‘too slow’ to rescue Brits stranded by pandemic – reportHome Office charters new deportation flight despite Covid-19 warningThe Independent understands that no Covid-19 testing was undertaken for those on the flights. The Home Office said those being returned were seen by a healthcare professional prior to departure, and that anyone exhibiting symptoms would be removed from the flight and placed into protective isolation.Labour MP Diane Abbott said the fact that the government was deporting people in the middle of a global pandemic was a “scandal”, adding: “It seems that maintaining draconian immigration practices was more important to the government than public health.”Celia Clarke, director of Bail for Immigration Detainees, said: “At a time when we were all urged to stay at home to save lives and protect the NHS, the Home Office quietly continued to detain and remove people.”She said the sums involved were “staggering”, pointing out that it was in addition to the £8.2m paid out in the last year in compensation to people detained unlawfully.The new figures will prompt further anger when considered alongside the alleged failure by the UK government to charter a sufficient number of flights to repatriate Britons stranded abroad by the coronavirus pandemic.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We only remove people when it is safe to do so and public health guidance is adhered to on all removal flights.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Baroness Lawrence, Sir Keir Starmer’s race relations adviser, pointed to new analysis by Labour which suggests that inner city areas with much higher than average black, Asian and minority ethnic populations have among the highest rates of furloughed staff. Workers in these areas could be at a higher risk of redundancy later this year, the party warns. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesData from the House of Commons library shows that nine of the sixteen parliamentary constituencies with the highest take-up rate of the furlough scheme also have much higher than average black, Asian and minority ethnic populations.  They include Tottenham, in London, where the figures show half of the population is from a Bame community and 39 per cent of those eligible have been furloughed. Baroness Lawrence said: “This pandemic has already had a disproportionate impact on the health of black, Asian and minority ethnic people in this country, and now there is mounting evidence that they will be hit hardest by the economic impact too. “The government must support black, Asian and ethnic minority communities by introducing a targeted extension of the furlough scheme for the hardest-hit sectors. “If we are going to effectively address the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 we must eradicate the systemic inequalities that it thrives on.”  In April Sir Keir appointed Baroness Lawrence as his race relations adviser and asked her to lead a review into the effect of the coronavirus on black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. The Labour peer, whose son Stephen Lawrence was killed as he waited at a bus stop in 1993, is expected to publish her report later this year.

In Minsk, which saw the worst violence, water cannon, stun grenades and rounds of rubber bullets were deployed against protesters. In two instances, a police van drove into crowds. At least four people ended up in intensive care, with one man reportedly in critical condition. In other cities across the country, officers reportedly laid down arms and crossed to the side of protesters. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe unity opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who claimed victory in the face of the scarcely credible 9.9 per cent assigned to her by the official preliminary results, called on police and army officers to stop the violence. “I want to ask them to remember that they are part of the nation too,” she said. Hours before voting ended, Belarus had all but declared a state of emergency. Footage of soldiers and military equipment entering the capital was widely shared by locals.By 6pm local time (3pm GMT), most of the capital’s central squares and government buildings had been cordoned off. Transport systems were shut down. Roads in and out of the capital were also closed. The regime’s obvious nervousness extended to widespread efforts to control the internet. Major disruptions to mobile networks were reported from the morning, with connections practically grinding to a halt at around 10pm local time. Proxy servers, used widely in these parts to get around censorship, became unreliable.Belarus’s upcoming election spells out two very different futuresUnidentified forces want ‘massacre’ in Belarus, says LukashenkoBelarus charges opposition politicians with assisting Russian plotJournalists and other independent observers appeared to be a target. At around 2pm local time, three reporters from the Russian liberal outlet TV Dozhd were handcuffed, held to the ground, and arrested. Just before midnight, AP photographer Mstyslav Chernov was admitted to hospital with suspected concussion after being beaten by riot police while in their custody. Sunday’s events came at the end of an unexpectedly panicked campaign for Belarus’s longtime leader – one that saw opposition candidates jailed, protesters snatched from the streets, the president claim a scarcely believable Russian-backed plot, and where the opposition candidate was forced into hiding on the eve of voting.Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, 37, was never supposed to mount a serious challenge, only entering the race after President Lukashenko jailed her husband, and presidential hopeful, Sergei Tikhanovsky. Famously dismissive of women in politics, Mr Lukashenko seemed to believe the housewife and former translator didn’t have a chance. No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailBut her invigorating, earnest campaign surprised Belarus and it wrong-footed Mr Lukashenko. Few expected Ms Tikhanovskaya to reach an agreement with the campaign teams of other banned opposition candidates – but she managed to do so in just 15 minutes. Few believed she could lead a clear campaign – but she did so with simple promises to deliver fresh elections, walk back authoritarian changes to the constitution, and free political prisoners.Flanked by Veronika Tsepkalo, the wife of Valery Tsepkalo, another barred candidate, and Maria Kolesnikova, campaign manager for jailed Viktor Barbariko, Ms Tikhanovskaya’s opposition campaign took on unmistakably feminist, modern slant. It also brought over 200,000 people to the streets in support – an astonishing achievement in Belarus, a police state of just 9 million people, and where dissent often leads to jail.Underestimating Ms Tikhanovskaya was not the only mistake the usually clever and adroit Mr Lukashenko made in the run-up to the elections. His electoral rating was hit hard by a perceived cavalier approach to the Covid-19 epidemic: he claimed the virus was avoidable with vodka, trips to the sauna and work in the potato fields. His management of the country’s increasingly desperate economic position – and its rapidly unwinding model of Soviet planning with Russian subsidies – also provoked much anger. The extraordinary campaign to unseat Belarusian ‘dictator’ LukashenkoGiven the fact independent polling is illegal in Belarus, it was never entirely clear quite how vulnerable “Europe’s last dictator” actually became to Ms Tikhanovskaya’s challenge. But results from a handful of more reliable Minsk polling stations appeared to support the opposition claim that Ms Tikhanovskaya had, in fact, won — and convincingly.Unprecedented numbers of voters appeared to answer Ms Tikhanovskaya’s call to turn out late on Sunday — and the logic this would make falsifications more difficult. But Lidia Yermoshina, a key Lukashenko ally and chief vote counter as the head of Belarus\u0027s election committee, described the huge queues as “provocations” by the opposition. In an earlier interview on state TV, she described the opposition as a “totalitarian sect”.Independent exit polls conducted outside polling stations in foreign embassies also painted a starkly contrasting picture to the official figures. According to these surveys, Mr Lukashenko received just 6.25 per cent, compared to Ms Tikhanovskaya with 79.69 per cent. Ahead of the end of voting, Mr Lukashenko dismissed his rivals as being “unworthy of repression”. But he also seemed to make ominous warnings for those intending to protest. “All our structures and special services are ready and waiting,” he said. “There is no reason for our country to be plunged into chaos or civil war. I guarantee you that.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He said: “Where is the evidence  Why has the prosecution not revealed it There won’t be a trial for my client for Madeleine McCann. I am certain.”Follow our live blog for all the latest news and updates.Madeleine McCann investigators in Germany want to re-test a saliva sample from the Portugal flat where she vanished to seeit matches main suspect Christian B, it’s been reported.In June, The Sun reported how a scrap of blue material in the vaults of a Portuguese forensic lab could provide the vital link between Christian B and Madeleine McCann.Detectives hope advances in DNA testing may yet provide a full profile for comparison with the -year-old convicted paedophile and rapist.The material comes from the bedspread draped over the bed Madeleine was sleeping on when she was abducted from her family’s holiday apartment.Tests uncovered a microscopic a DNA profile initially identied as semen, but later confirmed to be saliva.And according to Sky News, German authorities are now keen to re-examine a sample from the Praia da Luz holiday apartment where Madeleine vanished from in .Sky News claimed Portuguese tests on the sample apparently found no DNA match to Christian B.Authorities in Germany believe their scientists should do their own tests.But Portuguese police may not send the sample due to legal restrictions in sending samples abroad for testing and recent criticism of them from Germany, Sky reported.Asked about the report about the saliva sample, Braunschweig state prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters, who is leading the Madeleine investigation, said in June: #That information is not mine.#I dont know where it comes from. I cant confirm anything.#Prime suspect Christian B is to remain in jail as his appeal against a rape conviction has failed, a German politician has said.The paedophile is currently appealing to the European Court of Justice after being convicted of raping a -year-old American woman.But Ulrich Watermann says the court has already made a decision that the conviction is lawful, ultimately keeping Christian B behind bars, the Mirror reports.Waterman is a Social Democratic Party of Germany politician in Lower Saxony and prosecutors there are leading the case against Christian B.A court in Braunschweig, Lower Saxony, is also handling the rape appeal.Christian B is currently on jail for drugs offences but is soon eligible for parole meaning thathis rape conviction had been overturned he could have walked free.DNA from a rape case allegedly linked to Madeleine McCann suspect Christian B was destroyed on the orders of Portuguese prosecutors.Irish rape victim Hazel Behan waived her right last anonymity in June to say she believes a masked man who targeted her in her Algarve apartment could have been the German sex offender.She went public about her horric  attack after discovering Christian B was convicted late last year of the September  rape of an elderly American woman in Praia da Luz, Portugal.Met Police told her they were taking her case very seriously and were contacting Portuguese counterparts after taking her statement.But, it later emerged that biological material collected from the crime scene was destroyed.The extraordinary decision was laid bare in court papers relating to Ms Behan’s rape in Praia da Rocha # which is a -minute drive east of Praia da Luz.The former holiday rep suffered a terrying five-hour ordeal during which she was abducted, gagged, threatened with a machete and raped.But, potentially key evidence was thrown away after the case was mothballed in March .Cops shelved the investigation as the attack happened during Euro , when there were more people in the area, and they decided it was a #one-off#.Case files in Ms Behans case describe her rapist as an English speaker who could be “German, Belgian or Dutch.”They add: “As they are in a bad condition it is improbable thatthis re-investigation was reopened the material could be subjected to counterproof analysis.”For the full story, see HERE.The lawyer for Christian B has said he doesnt recognise the person portrayed in the media and that his client is a calm and friendly person.Friedrich Fulscher, currently representing the -year-old, said: “I dont recognise the person the media describes.“I am able to describe him as a very calm and friendly person when I talk to him in prison.”Christian B is currently serving time in a German jail following a conviction for a  rape that took place in Praia da Luz, the resort from which Madeleine McCann disappeared in .A Brit woman whose parents hosted Christian B as a lodger has said his eyes #chilled her to the bone#. Angie Dawes, then , said the -year-old stayed with her family after suddenly arriving in their remote Portuguese village. “I met him at my parents’ house. Even though he was polite, on every occasion he was weird,# she said.“He was memorable to look at. The blond hair with striking blue eyes.“But he would just stare at me in a sleazy way for a minute or two without saying a word and not release his gaze.“It was bizarre and made me feel very uncomfortable. His eyes chilled me to the bone.”Phone records that prosecutors say place Christian B near the apartment from which Madeleine McCann vanished dont incriminate him in the case, his lawyer has said. Prosecutors have said that a pre-paid mobile phone owned by Christian B #pinged# a phone mast close to the McCanns apartment around the time Madeleine disappeared. Investigators continue to search for evidence that Christian B was on the -minute call and of who he was talking to. Representing the -year-old, lawyer Friedrich Fulsche said: #You cant say because of the fact that this cell phone was logged to this tower that he was standing near to the apartment of Madeleine MCaCanns disappearance. #He could have been  kilometres away.#Christian B wont ever co-operate with Madeleine McCann investigators, his lawyer has said.Speaking to the Sydney Morning Herald, Friedrich Fulsche said it was not for his client to defend himself, but for prosecutors to establish his guilt.“Before our client starts to co-operate with the prosecutors office, you could order holy water as a long drink in hell,” he said.“That is not unusual. It is very normal not to talk to the police when you are suspected of committing a crime.“The prosecutors office has to prove that a suspect has committed a crime, and not the suspect prove that he hasnt.”Prosecutors in Germany have welcomed a ruling by Europes highest court that has dashed Christian Bs hope of an early release from jail. The -year-old is currently serving a jail term in Germany for the rape of a woman in Portugal in .He stood trial for the crime after being extradited from Italy, and is currently appealing his conviction on the grounds that he was initially extradited to face unrelated drug trafficking charges. The European Court of Justice this week told him the appeal is unlikely to succeed because he left Portugal voluntarily.Speaking to the PA, German prosecutor Julia Meyer said: #The advocate general shares our opinion.#We are pleased and wait for the decision of the court the next few weeks.#German police knew about an allotment previously used by Christian B for two years before searching it, the suspects lawyer has claimed. Investigators last week conducted an excavation of a plot in Hanover and a basement structure beneath.Representing Christian B, Friedrich Fulsche said: “I am very surprised they have started a search there now and not much earlier.“I was very surprised because the police had known for over two years that the garden was used by my client.”He speculated that the timing of the search had been an attempt to sway opinion against Christian B ahead of a then-upcoming ruling by the European Court of Justice concerning his extradition to Germany.Footage shows Christian B behind the wheel of a VW campervan just weeks before Madeleine McCanns disappearance. The -year-old is thought to have been living in a camper in Portugals Praia da Luz around the time Madeleine vanished from the resort on May  . In the footage, he can be seen laughing as he is filmed by three German travellers he had offered to drive from Portugal to Spain.The clip has been dated to March  .Watch the clip and read the full story here.Madeleine McCann suspect Christian B has “nothing to hide”, his lawyer has said.Police in Germany have said they have firm evidence, including mobile phone data, linking the -year-old to Madeleine’s disappearance.Lawyer Friedrich Fulscher said: “Where is the evidence “Why has the prosecution not revealed it “There won’t be a trial for my client for Madeleine McCann. I am certain.”He added that,the case does ever go to trial, his client would face the court “serenely and calmly”. “He has nothing to hide,” he said. Christian B allegedly boasted to a pal about performing a sex act in front of a room full of sleeping British girls.The convicted sex offender told a close friend that he crept into a holiday home in Portugal naked and started masturbating.He only fled when one of the teens woke up and began to alert her friends, its claimed.The friend broke his silence about the alleged incident after seeing this week’s police searches in Germany, the Mirror reports.He said: “The strangest thing he ever told me was about breaking into a room where four teenagers from Britain were sleeping on the sofa and floor.“He was naked and had left his clothes outside and he was masturbating.#When one woke up and tried to wake the others up he panicked and ran out.“He said he ran naked through the town. He told it like a funny story.”The new owner of Christian Bs old home has said she fears she is living over a body. The woman, a -year-old tour guide, has reportedly called on police to search the property, which sits on the edge of an allotment plot in the city of Braunschweig.Christian B lived at the house for the three years up to , and the woman reportedly contacted police after he was identied in a television report last month.Speaking to the Sunday People, the woman said: “I am worried he may have buried a body here.“I want the police to dig the ground and check.”A top forensic expert has said that #every contact leaves a trace# and that she is optimistic the Madeleine McCann case will be solved. Professor Angela Gallop CBE is a world-renowned scientist whose work has helped to solve numerous cold cases.Speaking to the Sun Online, she said: “There have been so many cases where it has looked so hopeless at the start, but where we have been able to dig out something which has led to a resolution.“I’ve always been interested in this case – after all this time it would be extremely tough.“But one thing I’ve found with some of these really dficult crimes is that you never say never about anything.“I’m an optimist by nature and an optimist now because of my teams’ success in helping to solve so many of these complex cold cases.“[The concept] that every contact leaves a trace I now know to be absolutely true. The dficulty is usually in finding the traces in the first place.”A German traveller who hitched a lt from Portugal to Spain with Christian B has said its scary to think who he was. The man, known only as Tomas, is one of three travellers who features in footage shot in Christian Bs campervan during a trip on March  .The trip took place around  months after Christian B committed a rape of a -year-old woman, a crime for which he was convicted in December last year. “He seemed like any other ordinary young man. He was cheerful and joked a lot and [was] happy to give us a ride in his VW van,# said Tomas.“He didnt mind us filming him and taking his pictures. He was happy to pose and must have known we could never suspect what a terrible man he really was.#It is scary to know now that he was a rapist of an elderly woman and targeted children. We couldnt have known that he was such a monster in truth.#The lawyer representing Christian B has called on prosecutors to disclose the evidence they say links his client to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. Police in Germany have said they have firm evidence linking the -year-old to the case, though have withheld some of it. They have said previously that mobile phone data has placed Christian B near the McCanns apartment on the night Madeleine vanished. Lawyer Friedrich Fulscher said: “Where is the evidence #Why has the prosecution not revealed it #There won’t be a trial for my client for Madeleine McCann. I am certain.”The suspect modied his VW camper van to be able to hide a child, it is feared.The paedophile lived in the vehicle above a basement at an allotment in Hanover around the time three-year-old Madeleine disappeared.He once boasted he could have used his VW campervan to transport children.Dein Ghafou, who owned a garage complex Hanover used by Christian B, told police: “I told them he had been working on a ­Volkswagen Camper here and he would lt the roof up and then make it smaller again,” he told the Mirror.“He was always cutting the roof, raising it and then lowering it. He came and went here.”Neighbours of Christian B at the allotment said he lived in the VW LT camper van in  and .The lawyer of Madeleine McCann prime suspect Christian B has blasted as “an act of pure desperation” searches of his client’s former allotmentFriedrich Fülscher goaded cops and prosecutors in their bid to the nail -year-old paedo for killing Madeleine saying they’ve “backed the wrong horse”.Fülscher insisted the search of old allotment plot in Hanover this week, which uncovered a secret cellar beneath the earth, was an elaborate show to revive interest in the investigation. “The site has been known by prosecutors for years,” he said.“It is an act of pure desperation by them to appear to be working on it now. “It seems the public prosecutors office are finding it hard to admit they have backed the wrong horse.”Madeleine would now be  years old.She was born May , , and went missing a little more than a week before her fourth birthday.Authorities are also hopeful that social media could help find Madeleine, using her distinctive eyes to examine photographs on Facebook.The prime suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann will never co-operate with the police, his lawyer says.Convicted rapist and child abuser Christian Bs lawyer Friedrich Fulscher said his client would not help cops trying to find out what happened to the missing three-year-old.“Before our client starts to co-operate with the prosecutors office, you could order holy water as a long drink in hell,” Mr Fulscher told the Sydney Morning Herald.“That is not unusual. It is very normal not to talk to the police when you are suspected of committing a crime.“The prosecutors office has to prove that a suspect has committed a crime, and not the suspect prove that he hasnt.”A mum has claimed the Madeleine McCann suspect Christian B exposed himself to her daughter while trying to chat to her.Paedophile Christian B, , was caught with his trousers down under a slide in San Bartolomeu de Messines,  miles from Praia da Luz, Portugal, where Madeleine disappeared when she was aged three.The German national was arrested in  after he committed a sex act in front of four youngsters.Christian B was extradited to Germany and is currently behind bars for drug offences.A top forensic expert said Madeleine McCann’s disappearance WILL one day be solved.Professor Angela Gallop, a world-renowned scientist whose work has helped to solve numerous cold cases, said the riddle would finally be solved because “contact always leaves a trace”.Speaking to the Sun Online, Prof Gallop CBE explained: “There have been so many cases where it has looked so hopeless at the start, but where we have been able to dig out something which has led to a resolution.”Read the full story here.Several years ago, on the th anniversary of Madeleine McCann’s abduction, her anguished family thanked supporters for giving them hope in a heartbreaking letter.Kate and Gerry McCann addressed the message to “our dear friends” in Praia da Luz, Portugal.The poignant letter written in  said: “We miss her every second.“Despite the evil and hurt that has come our way, we have been very fortunate, having witnessed and experienced goodness and kindness in great abundance during this long and dficult period of stolen time.“We are especially grateful to our friends and supporters in Luz for being strong enough and brave enough to keep Madeleine and our family in your prayers and in your hearts.“Your love and compassion has given us fortitude over the years and sustained our hope in immeasurable amounts.“There will never be too many times to thank you… and so thank you for everything… but above all, for not giving up on Madeleine.“With our love and our very best wishes, Kate, Gerry, Madeleine, Sean and Amelie – and all our family.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But also because he was only  years old and had been married to his beautul we Lissie for just a month.It was heartbreaking to see the photos of the pair overflowing with love and happiness at their wedding — while knowing his le had been needlessly ended.Our hearts went out to Lissie, who no doubt is still trying to make sense of the tragedy. So too his mother and father. For any parent, such a loss is unthinkable. Nobody should have to bury their child.It is against the natural order of things, especially when your beloved son or daughter has been murdered.That kind of pain will never go away. It becomes the defining moment of a parent’s le.Who would blame someone in that position for opting out of le ­altogether and sinking into inertia and depression  To me, that even seems the most likely response.Instead, his mum Debbie Adlam has hit the campaign trail, arguing for longer sentences for anyone who kills a policeman.PC Harper’s killers were convicted of manslaughter but cleared of ­murder.Henry Long, , who drove the getaway car, was jailed for  years. His accomplices Albert ­Bowers and Jessie Cole, both , were each given  years.Unduly lenient sentences, to my mind — and probably yours too.On Wednesday, Lissie began a campaign to bring in “Andrew’s Law”, in memory of her late husband. She wants anyone who kills a police officer, firefighter, nurse, doctor or paramedic to be jailed for le — meaning a minimum of  years.Mrs Adlam, who has been robbed of growing old happily with her beloved son in her le, has joined the campaign.“We got to the end of our trial and we didn’t feel like justice had been done,” she said. “We felt like we had been punched.“We didn’t walk away feeling that we had done Andrew proud.”That is the nub of the matter. She wants to do right by her late son. And I imagine she will not rest until she feels she has done that.It is only when tragedy strikes that many people realise how strong and determined they can be.Nothing can bring back PC Harper. ButAndrew’s Law comes to pass, acting as a deterrent to other criminals, at least one positive will have come from an otherwise senseless death.The need for justice is a stronger force than most of us can comprehend. I think of Stephen Lawrence’s mother Doreen, whose le changed overnight when her son was ­murdered in a racist attack in .She campaigned tirelessly for reforms to the police service and founded the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust.She forged positive change from the tragic murder of her son, ­showing the strength of her feeling and the scale of her loss.I think also of Michael and Sara Payne who also campaigned with great determination after the murder of their eight-year-old daughter Sarah.As a result, parents and ­carers can now formally ask the police for information about a person who has contact with a childthey fear that person poses a threat.Then there is the Jodie Chesney Foundation, set up by Peter Chesney to tackle kne crime after his daughter was murdered last year.When faced with unimaginable loss, some people respond by taking action to change things.They are gripped with the strength to move mountains — and get the law changed.We salute their courage and their determination to find light amid the terrible darkness of their loss.How sad it is seeing footage of Keeley Bunker dancing with her trusted friend Wesley Streete, who walked her home that evening . . . then went on to murder her.Keeley was a beautul young woman, just  when she died and with her whole le ahead of her.But her “friend” chose to end that le.It is tragic seeing any le wasted – and for what  Streete’s own gratication.Let us hope he is haunted by his actions and choices for the rest of his le.Wonderful news this week as the parents of poor Charlie Gard – who died of a rare genetic condition three years ago – gave birth to a healthy baby boy.As Connie Yates said: “The world feels a whole lot more beautul this morning”.I am so happy for them after the tragedy of losing Charlie, and what a beautul baby.Congratulations.WARNINGS this week that menopausal women could be unfairly denied entry to pubs and restaurantstheir hot flushes are confused in temperature checks for Covid symptoms.Take note: No one in their right mind should keep a menopausal woman from her chilled white wine . . .It feels a bit like a sword of Damocles is hanging over the nation at the moment, with yet more job cuts announced this week – at LGH Hotels, Pizza Express and Wetherspoons.Thousands more workers are living in fear of redundancy. It is a scary prospect. But don’t panic.The best defence is preparation. Find ways to be positive. That means not taking it personally.The ROLE is redundant, not you. So don’t view redundancy as a reflection of your ability or your worth.Know your rights and get the best settlement you can. A proper redundancy process comes with a consultation period, which will give you time to weigh up your options.My advice is to engage in that process. Ask for written clarication of any offer andyou are unhappy in any way, there are plenty of employment lawyers you can talk to. Or free help is available from Acas.Sort out your finances. Work out how much money you need for day-to-day living and,you can, keep some back for emergencies. Cut out spending on non-essentials and work out how to manage everything from mortgage payments to credit card debt.You might have to tighten your belt for a bit but that’s not the end of the word. For many people, redundancy is a chance to consider what they might do dferently.That is easier said than done but try to see it as an opportunity – to go freelance, start a business, become a consultant, get another job or re-enter education – rather than an ending.I love a romantic gesture as much as anyone.But the -year-old man who spelled out “Marry Me” using  tea lights made me wonderhe might have found another way.The candles set fire to the living room and seriously damaged the flat he shared with his girlfriend.But she still said yes!And at least she knows what she is getting herself into.It is always hard seeing photos of people enjoying a holiday in the sun when you are working.And this year, more than ever, I’ve been consumed with envy of the lucky souls who somehow got away despite all the travel restrictions.Having seen multiple beachtastic photos of Coleen and Wayne Rooney, who jetted off to the Caribbean what seems like weeks ago, is it wrong of me to admit I’ll be quite pleased when the holiday season is over We need a word for the irritated envy of others’ amazing holidays.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Labour councillors and MPs shake their heads about the dangers of opening while never reflecting on the risk of keeping schools closed.Even Labour’s new leader Sir Keir Starmer is worried about safety . . .  and his own children attended school during lockdown.The risks to children from Covid- are next to non-existent. Teachers are more likely to be hit by a bus than contract coronavirus from kids.Butthe risks of the schools opening in September are minimal, the cost of schools staying shut is beyond measure.Already, a generation of kids have seen their education become another victim of coronavirus.Some , of them could not sit their GCSEs in spring. And , could not sit their A levels.The years below them, due to sit those le-changing exams next spring, have lost six months of their education they will never recover.A report by the National Foundation for Educational Research said  per cent of state-school children had between none and one online lesson a day during the long months of lockdown.The most disadvantaged children have suffered the most.The schools are due to open in just  days and the vast majority of parents — almost  per cent — want them to start as planned.But even as Gavin Williamson was making his bold promise to throw open the school gates, Business ­Secretary Alok Sharma was mewing that school closures would be ­considered on a “case by case” basis, while Schools minister Nick Gibb bleats he can’t “decree” that every pupil will be back at their desk in September. These timid Tories must start showing some spine.With the schools closed, parents cannotto work. Already unemployment is soaring. Already there are hard times ahead.If parents and their children stay at home during the autumn months, this country will be on its knees for years.The A-level results will be announced this Thursday and the class of  will finally discover the damage that Covid- has done to their dreams.For the first time ever, A-level grades will be estimated, and there are countless families across the country holding their breath, me included.But for the millions of children meant to be in school, the future is even more uncertain.If their schools do not open in September it will be a craven act of surrender to extremist teaching unions.And a national tragedy that ­effectively chucks an entire generation on the scrapheap.IT is  years since Cameron Diaz made her movie debut opposite Jim Carrey in The Mask and six years since her last film.Cameron says retiring from the movies has brought her the peace she has always craved.And, of course, having an estimated £million in the bank usually has a calming effect.The thieving simpletons responsible for his death will all be free before they turn .The police get endless stick these days. But PC Andrew Harper was the best of us.Andrew had been married to his childhood sweetheart Lissie for just four weeks when he was dragged to his death after becoming entangled in a tow rope dangling from the back of a car being used to steal a quad bike.Driver Henry Long, , got  years. Albert Bowers and Jessie Cole, both , got  years. Not once have they shown even a flicker of remorse. But the law allows a third of a term off sentences for murder and manslaughter.Now Andrew’s widow Lissie has launched a campaign for “Andrew’s Law”, which will mean a full le term for killing  workers.“I wish to ensure any widows of the future will not have to experience the same miscarriage of justice,” says Lissie, . “I pledge to my late husband to never stop until I have made the dference this country needs.”I know that every reader of this paper will wish Lissie well.The sentences handed down to Long, Bowers and Cole might be what we would expect for manslaughter convictions.But God knows it does not feel very much like justice.“NO one here gets out alive,” sang The Doors’ Jim Morrison.Jim could have been thinking of Public Health England, the quango of clowns charged with protecting the nation’s health and wellbeing.PHE has developed a unique way of counting our corona- virus dead. If you catch Covid-, PHE claims you as a virus victim evenyou recover and die many months later of something .Who does their maths, Diane Abbott PHE’s madcap counting system means all , cases of coronavirus in England will eventually be added to the UK’s Covid- death toll – because we all have to go some time.PHE receives £million of your money a year to produce this garbage.The explosion has left more than  dead, , hurt and , homeless.Israa Seblani, , is the bride who was posing for wedding photos at the very moment the Lebanese capital was devastated by the huge blast.A doctor herself, Israa helped the wounded before seeking safety.

It is contrary to international law that these desperate souls are not claiming asylum in the first safe country they reach.But as they continue to arrive here on a daily basis, you have to say they look happy to have reached this country from the war-torn wastelands of, er, France.Perhaps the UK is not quite the racist hellhole it is frequently cracked up to be.THE Government is mocked for launching its wildly popular Eat Out To Help Out scheme while, at the same time, Boris is posing in gyms and waging his private war on obesity.

Le Xpress reports that the smell of fuel oil is so overwhelming that it has terried Intendant Laval Bangard, , who was born on the island.The fisherman told the publication that he had never seen an ecological disaster of this magnitude.Some  sea booms were deployed to contain the spill, but they were not enough.Our country doesnt have the skills and expertise to refloat stranded ships, the PM said on Friday. Environment Minister Kavydass Ramano said a salvage team of  members were working to secure and stabilise the ship - but had to be evacuated due to the cracks in the ship hull.A technical team is assessing the situation and has a technical plan to start pumping out the fuel at the earliest opportunity, he added. Bad weather has made it impossible to act, and I worry what could happen Sunday when the weather deteriorates, he said.Heavy winds are expected to push the oil slick even farther along the mainlands shore.Thousands of students, environmental activists and residents of Mauritius were working around the clock on Sunday, trying to reduce the damage.“This is no longer a threat to our environment, it is a full-blown ecological disaster that has affected one of the most environmentally important parts of Mauritius, the Mahebourg Lagoon,” said Sunil Dowarkasing, an environmental consultant and former MP.“The people of Mauritius, thousands and thousands, have come out to try to prevent as much damage as possible,” added Dowarkasing.He said people have created long floating oil booms to try to slow the spread into the lagoon and onto the coast. The hastily made fabric booms are stuffed with sugar cane leaves and straw and kept afloat with plastic bottles, he said. People are also using empty oil drums to scoop up as much oil as possible from shallower waters.“We are working flat out. It’s a major challenge, because the oil is not only floating in the lagoon, it’s already washing up on the shore.“The booms are really working in many spots,” said Dowarkasing.Greenpeace Africa warned that hundreds of tonnes of diesel and oil has leaked into the water. Thousands of species around the pristine lagoons of Blue Bay, Pointe dEsny and Mahebourg are at risk of drowning in a sea of pollution, said Greenpeaces climate and energy manager, Happy Khambule.The country also has appealed to the United Nations for urgent aid, including experts in containing oil spills and environmental protection.A police inquiry has been opened into possible negligence, the government said.Neither Mitsui OSK Lines nor Nagashiki Shipping, the ships owner, could confirm the cost of damages from the oil spill. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Cops received a tip-off from an informant on July  that Schultz said he and some of his friends were waiting for schools to open to commit a massacre, reports ABC.The teen is alleged to have bragged they were plotting to kill as many as they can and kill themselves just like Columbine.Eric Harris, , and Dylan Klebold,  murdered  students and one teacher when they stormed their school in Columbine, Colorado, in April, .Robin and Schultz are alleged to have bought themselves black trench coats similar to those worn by Harris and Klebold, reports WSBT.Both also had tattoos of guns with quotes from Klebold and Harris and listened to music about the massacre.They had discussed a suicide pact on Facebook and talked about killing a bunch of human scum. Court documents claim they also gave themselves the same nicknames used by Harris and Klebold - and sent each other pictures of the two killers.It is alleged they planned to carry out the bloodbath when schools ed next month as most classes have been closed since March.Detectives reportedly viewed Schultz and Robins Facebook profiles and obtained search warrants to view their private conversations.Police are said to have discovered multiple messages planning out massacres at Rochester High School and Caston High School in Rochester, Indiana. Robin allegedly said he wanted everyone there dead, according to a probable cause affidavit. He allegedly wrote he would kill a security guard before roaming the halls killing people before heading into classrooms.Robin allegedly even estimated how long it would take a SWAT team to arrive at each Rochester and Caston schools. Police claim Robin revealed he had an itch to shoot up a school, claiming he had once sat outside Rochester Middle School for  minutes with an AR when he was in eighth grade.He wrote that he planned to kill  or more people, with  magazines packed in a duffel bag, and then himself before reportedly deciding it was too risky.Meanwhile, it is alleged Schultz wrote to one unnamed friend that “we are gonna do it i wanna shoot up a school with him”.He added: “I want him to stay out of trouble till we can shoot up the place.Police allegedly found a June  conversation revealed more details about the plan - including a potential suicide pact.Robin is reported to have said im killing myself after I kill a bunch of people and but im killing myself after I kill a bunch of people.Allegedly, Schultz said: I does exist donny just like no matter what im doin the same for u bc u guys are my family we had bad childhoods and we will always stick together u guys fr mean everything to me.In another conversation on Facebook, Robin is alleged to have said he had a gun locked in my dads safe and later discussed shooting up an airport, festivals or Black churches.Police also alleged Schultz had multiple conversations on Facebook about either trying to buy illegal narcotics or others asking for his help selling illegal narcotics.Robin also alleged had a friend buy him a hat for the band KMFDM , whose lyrics were posted by Harris before the Columbine massacre. The friend said: Cant believe Im buying you a school shooter hat butit makes you happy.Robin is said to have replied its not a school shooter hat, its a band hat.Fulton County Prosecutor Michael Marrs said: So I mean, anytime anyone’s obsessed with Columbine, yes, it’s a fine line between free speech and when you cross the line, but I think in this case, clearly what they had done was going to interfere with the occupancy of a school.He added: Anything like this, were going to take extremely seriously because I think history has shown us that sadly, these kind of things do get carried out. And were not going to take it lightly.Marrs added more information about the case would be released in the coming weeks.Charges of  conspiracy to commit murder and intimidation were filed against the pair on July .Schultz is being held at the Fulton County Jail and Robin, still a minor, is being held in a juvenile detention center but will be transferred when he turns  later this month.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Skin has since formed around the organs.Laurel can eat, drink and go to the toilet like any other toddler, but her parents need to make sure no injuries come to her exomphalos.The little tot has even grown to love her tummy.Mum Kelly, a volunteer supporting parents in neonatal care, said: She loves her tummy so much.She rubs it in the bath when I take the dressing off to wash her and says ah tummy.Its very cute, and she couldnt be prouder of it. But I do worry about how shell react when its not there anymore.Early in all pregnancies, the intestine develops inside the umbilical cord and then usually moves inside the abdomen a few weeks later.In exomphalos, the intestines - and in this case the stomach, liver and bowel - remain inside the umbilical cord but outside the abdomen.Kelly said: I dont know how we remained positive throughout my pregnancy with Laurel.It really looked asshe wouldnt survive birth - but Sean and I never gave up hope and she has done us so proud.Her pouch of organs on her tummy is a part of her and she doesnt let it get her down.Laurel is a true inspiration and amazes us every day.Doctors also determined the baby had a spinal deformity - and the pair were offered a termination.Kelly said she was shocked they were offered an abortion at her -week scan.She said: We couldnt quite believe what we were hearing when they offered us an abortion.People kept saying: Its OK, you can try again - but I didnt want another baby.I was so in love with this baby and we knew we would do everything we could for her. Exomphalos is when when the babys abdominal wall does not form during pregnancy.Early in all pregnancies, the intestine develops inside the umbilical cord and then usually moves inside the abdomen a few weeks later.In exomphalos, the intestines remain inside the umbilical cord but outside the abdomen.The abdominal cavity often does not develop properly and remains small in size.The continued on with the pregnancy and went for scans every two weeks - and because the presence of exomphalos signal an  per cent chance of other birth abnormalities the mum underwent further tests.Those tests highlighted their unborn child also had a hole in the heart.Three weeks before Laurel’s birth, doctors also discovered the exomphalos had doubled in size – prompting doctors to give the devastating news that the baby would not survive childbirth.Kelly said: Although I knew it was very real and incredibly scary, part of me always thought: This wont happen to me, I wont let it.Surgeons performed a classic caesarean - meaning they cut vertically on Kellys stomach as opposed to horizontally.She said: When we heard her cry out I couldnt believe it. Both Sean and I just burst into tears.We knew it was far from the end of it - but to hear her cry was a huge relief and from that moment we knew she was a fighter.Laurel was born weighing a healthy lb oz, and put straight on a ventilator before being transferred to NICU.She was able to come home after three-and-a-half months.Laurel will soon have the operation to have her organs internalised at the beginning of  and she will have to learn how to breathe again. Laurel will undergo the operation at Kings College Hospital, London.Kelly said: It is a scary thought, and there are definitely concerns.But Laurel has already been through so much, and I am sure she will continue to take everything in her stride.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Party is calling for more support for workers and businesses in areas placed under stricter rules to combat local coronavirus outbreaks.Labour said a £ million underspend in the Government’s Covid- grants programme for businesses in local lockdown areas should be used to safeguard jobs rather than “clawed back” by ministers. The party estimated that this funding could support an additional , businesses in areas with local restrictions. Lockdowns have been reintroduced in Preston, Greater Manchester, east Lancashire and parts of West Yorkshire due to local outbreaks. Scotlandaposs First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also imposed localised restrictions in Aberdeen after an outbreak linked to the cityaposs bars. Shadow Business Minister Lucy Powell said: Itaposs a week since local restrictions were put in place in Greater Manchester, and West Yorkshire, yet there has been zero extra support for struggling businesses caught up in this public health crisis. Weaposre seeing a wave of redundancies across the high street, threatening jobs and livelihoods, which could lead to ghost towns, as businesses are forced to shut up shop. Unless ministers take action to provide extra help to firms, that wave will turn into a tsunami leading to lasting damage, and the loss of many thousands of jobs, weakening our economy and our ability to recover from the crisis.

But Mr Williamson failed to say when the study, which looked at  educational sites, will be published. A Whitehall source was unable to say whether it would be published before schools are meant to reopen their doors in September. Public Health England was unable immediately to comment on when the report might be released. It comes as the latest figures show Covid- cases rose by , - the largest daily increase in six weeks - amid fears that Britain is on the brink of a second wave. A school union chief today warned schools are losing patience with the demand to have all pupils back in school full-time, with no back-up plan. Mr Williamson said getting all pupils back into school full-time in England is a national priority - while Boris Johnson called it a moral duty. But Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said pupils may need to come in on a week on, week off rota. He told the Daily : If you want to limit the number of children on site or travelling to and from school, a big part of that is using rotas and the obvious way to do it is aposweek on, week offapos.  The existence of the study was revealed yesterday by The Sunday Times, which said it was one of the largest in the world on coronavirus in schools. It is being carried out by Public Health England and is said to involve around , pupils and teachers in  schools across England. They were tested to monitor the spread of the disease up to the end of the summer term, according to reports. Usually the government refuses to comment on incomplete or leaked reports. Yet Gavin Williamson yesterday took the extremely rare step of issuing a statement to the media about the study - despite the fact itaposs not been released yet.  He said: The latest research which is expected to be published later this year - one of the largest studies on the coronavirus in schools in the world - makes it clear there is little evidence that the virus is transmitted at school. “There is also growing confidence among parents about their children ing. This is down to the hard work of school staff across the country who are putting in place a range of protective measures to prepare to welcome back all pupils at the start of term.” Professor Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and a member of Sage, said studies had suggested children were very minor players in the transmission overall of the virus. He told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: There are five studies from around the world from New South Wales, from Australia, Singapore, from Ireland, from Germany, and from France, and in each of those there appears to be very, very little transmission in schools.  We know that children can and do transmit this virus, of course they do, but theyaposre very minor players in the transmission overall, particularly younger children. Itaposs increasingly clear that older children - teenagers probably - transmit as much as adults, but schools themselves play very little role. He added: Thereaposs increasing evidence in the UK and the Government is doing a number of studies which have showed apparently very little transmission and very little infection when schools were open in England. Speaking to BBC Breakfast today, Care Minister Helen Whately insisted “absolutely it’ll be safe. She said: “The evidence that we have is on the one hand of very low transmission and also that the risks to children from Covid are very low. So absolutely it’ll be safe for children to be back in schools, and our national priority is to get to children back in school this autumn.”"},{"url":null,"title":"shadow housing minister faces eviction","story":"NewsShadow Housing Minister faces eviction amid plan to turn office into matchbox flatsEXCLUSIVE Mike Amesbury could be turfed out of his s office block in Runcorn as Boris Johnsons controversial planning reforms are extended across the countryShareByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  AUG News\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"What is really going on in politics  Get our daily email briefing straight to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Weaver Vale MP Mike Amesbury could be turfed out of the s office block in Runcorn, Cheshire, as Boris Johnsonaposs controversial planning rules are extended across the country. Developers plan to turn the block into  flats - seven of which will be smaller than the Governmentaposs recommended minimum space standards. A previous application for  flats, which would have seen a third smaller than the minimum standard, was withdrawn in December after local outcry. But under new apospermitted developmentapos rules being rolled out as part of Mr Johnsonaposs aposProject Speedapos, developers are allowed to convert office blocks into flats without applying for full planning permission. Councils are only allowed to object to the proposals on a very limited number of grounds. The Prime Minister said the new rules would make it easier to build better homes where people wanted to live. But Mr Amesbury is formally objecting to the plan. He warned the developeraposs proposal doesnapost mention any plan to replace the building’s s single-glazed windows or efforts to remove any asbestos that may exist in the building. And he said proposals for just  parking spaces are insufficient. Mr Amesbury said: “It’s bad enough that the current rules allow developers to turn ancient, run-down office blocks into cheap flats but under the Government’s new Developer’s Charter, these appalling conversions will become the norm. [Communities Secretary] Robert Jenrick claims the planning system doesn’t work but the truth is that most applications are approved. This is about the Tories giving a leg up to their developer friends, pure and simple - at the expense of local communities.”  He added: I will fight these plans tooth and nail butthe Government passes these changes into law, there is nothing to stop The Tories’ rich developer mates from doing what they like here in Runcorn or anywhere . I fear we are now facing a new era of slum housing in this country. “People in Runcorn and across the country are begging for the Government to put their street before Downing Street: they need good quality housing, not matchbox flats in converted s office blocks.

But the three-star Newquay business has a good reason for the price surge - they actually donapost want anyone to take it.The Kilbirnie, a -bed hotel in the town, advertised a “superior double room with a sea view” on Booking for the huge sum, reports Cornwall Live.It would have set you back over £, on Saturday night - but on the plus side, you could have made a saving on Trivago … of £. Just when you might be thinking they’re trying to make a quick buck out of all the tourists desperate for a post-lockdown break in the sun, click on Expedia and the same room is just £. In a bizarre twist, the hotel is advertising the room at such an exorbitant price to STOP people staying. And the room itself isn’t available anyway – the Kilbirnie is fully booked. Hotel manager Gary Ricketts explained that a glitch in a booking system has meant rooms have been sold to guests via online vendors which aren’t actually available, so this is a move to ensure there are no more disappointed customers. He explained: “Three dferent customers booked rooms through Booking last week and expected to stay here, but we were fully booked. “This is a way of combating that – it’s crazy, no one’s going to pay £, to stay for the night. It’s true that our rates are at a premium, as are everyone’s, but we know no one’s going to pay that amount £ maybe but not £,. “It’s to combat the fact we don’t have any rooms and yet they might appear on the site.” Gary added: “People are seeing these rooms on booking sites and expecting to come to Cornwall but there’s very little availabilityanything everywhere is full. “They’re saying there’s an issue with the system. It’s an issue either on our side or their side. No one can find out what the problem is. “I know of at least two other hotels in Newquay alone that have had this problem. “I’d rather deal with the problem of someone wanting to pay that than someone coming down, expecting to have a room and we haven’t got one. If someone wants to pay over £, they can stay at my house!” He said it wasn’t as simple as just removing the listing as a room at their hotel might still appear available because of the system error.

He was the highest-paid performer in the world and the first Brit to sell a million records. Not bad for a lad who worked in a coal mine aged . Arguably Scotland’s greatest ever performer, Harry – born  years ago this week – became a friend of Hollywood stars and royalty, and the first popular entertainer to get a knighthood. But his success was blighted by tragedy when his only son, John, died in  fighting in the First World War. After John’s death, he threw himself into the war effort, raising money for wounded soldiers, and helping to enlist men. And he started the tradition of entertaining the troops at the front, for which he was knighted in . Among Sir Harry’s most popular songs were Roamin’ in the Gloamin, A Wee Deoch-an-Doris and the perennial favourite, I Love a Lassie. Churchill said: “By his inspiring songs and valiant le, [he] rendered measureless service to the Scottish race and to the British Empire.” Sir Harry once said: “Happiness is one of the few things in this world that doubles every time you share it with someone .” He was born Henry McLennan Lauder on August ,  in Portobello, Edinburgh, to mum Isabella and dad John, a skilled potter. Both his parents were from well-connected and well-off families and Harry, the eldest of seven, grew up in relative affluence. In , the family moved to Derbyshire, where John got a job designing porcelain. But shortly after the relocation, he died of pneumonia. Isabella moved the children back to her family in Arbroath in Angus, using John’s £ le insurance to help pay for the journey. Harry, then aged , had to work at a flax mill to help support the family and pay for his education. A couple of years later, they moved in with Harry’s uncle’s family in Hamilton, South Lanarkshire. The three eldest boys became coal miners, an experience Harry said he was “proud” of. He once said of the mines: “I was entombed once for six long hours. It seemed like six years. There were no visible means of getting out.” But there was some light amid the struggle. Harry fell in love with Ann Vallance, the daughter of a colliery manager and the pair wed in June .  As a child, Harry found he had a knack for singing and started performing at school and entering competitions. His first professional appearance came in , and shortly afterwards he joined a concert party that toured Scotland. By the turn of the century, he’d made it to London. Variety magazine said of his first performance in the capital: “In , a Scotch coal miner stood on the street opposite the Tivoli Music Hall. “He had taken a week off to visit London to seek a vaudeville engagement. Before the week was out the miner was booked for  consecutive weeks.” Aged , he had made it. His famous character – kilted, bandy-legged, sentimental, with an eye for a bonnie lass and a wee dram and carrying a knobbly stick – made Scottish culture, or caricature, known the world over. In , Harry undertook the first of  tours of the United States. He made the first of his  recordings in  for The Gramophone Company. Radio was another lucrative medium for Sir Harry – he was once paid £, for one broadcast featuring three of his songs. By the time First World War broke out, Sir Harry was an international star. He sang for the troops, raised funds for the war and soldiers’ charities and formed the Harry Lauder Recruiting Pipe Band which toured Scotland and England. Reports say he convinced more than , men to enlist.  But then tragedy struck when John – a Captain in the th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders – was killed in action in , in Pozieres, northern France. Sir Harry was told John was shot by a German sniper. Devastated, Harry wrote it had felt like “everything had come to an end” and “the board of le was black and blank”. Anne convinced Harry he should go back on stage, as those who worked on his show relied on him. Three days later, he was back performing. He broke down when he sang The Laddies Who Fought and Won, about boys coming home from the conflict. Archie Foley, a Harry Lauder historian said: “As the curtains closed, he fainted.” During this  tour, he went to the French war cemetery where John was buried. He wrote: “As I lay there on that brown mound, all that he had been, and all that he had meant to me and to his mother came rushing back, opening anew my wounds of grief.

Laurel Phizacklea, two, wasnapost expected to survive birth because of a cruel condition which occurs when the babyaposs abdominal wall does not form during pregnancy. Her parents, Kelly, , and Sean, , were offered a termination at their -week scan when doctors diagnosed their unborn child with a major exomphalos. But Laurelaposs parents decided to give her a chance and the tot defied medics predictions when she was born at Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge in June . Most babies with the condition have the organs reinserted into their body at birth, but due to the unusually large size of Laurelaposs exomphalos, doctors warned she wouldnapost be able to have them internalised until she is three years old. Laurel was left with a protruding bump from her tiny tummy - which her parents have to wrap in bandages to support her external organs, in case the weight of them were to pull anything  out of her body. Skin has formed around the organs, and Laurel can eat, drink and go to the toilet like any other toddler - but her parents have to keep an eye on their aposdaredevilapos tot, as any injuries to the exomphalos would be irreparable. The mound doesnapost bother the little girl, who loves to cradle her exomphalos when her bandages are removed for bath time, often stroking it and saying aposah tummyapos.  Kelly, a volunteer supporting parents in neonatal care, from Cambridge, Kent, said: I donapost know how we remained positive throughout my pregnancy with Laurel. It really looked asshe wouldnapost survive birth - but Sean and I never gave up hope and she has done us so proud. Her pouch of organs on her tummy is a part of her and she doesnapost let it get her down. Laurel is a true inspiration and amazes us every day. Laurel and Sean, a car dismantler, were over the moon when they discovered they were expecting their first child in October . The couple excitedly attended their -week scan to get their first glimpse of their baby - but were blindsided by the news that something was wrong. They said that our babyaposs organs were on the outside of the body, Kelly said. I couldnapost believe that was even possible. Doctors explained that the coupleaposs unborn child had exomphalos - a type of abdominal wall defect which occurs when a childaposs abdomen does not develop fully while in the womb. Early in all pregnancies, the intestine develops inside the umbilical cord and then usually moves inside the abdomen a few weeks later. In exomphalos, the intestines - and in this case the stomach, liver and bowel - remain inside the umbilical cord but outside the abdomen. Doctors also determined that Kelly and Seanaposs baby had a spinal deformity - and the pair were offered a termination. We couldnapost quite believe what we were hearing when they offered us an abortion, Kelly said. People kept saying: aposItaposs OK, you can try againapos - but I didnapost want another baby. I was so in love with this baby and we knew we would do everything we could for her. Amazingly, after just three-and-a-half-months in Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, Laurel was able tohome. We knew sheaposd need the big operation further down the line, but just having her home was so special, Kelly said.  We quickly realised she was an adventurous baby, so knew weaposd need to keep an eye on her so she wouldnapost damage her exomphalos. Surgeons warned the couple thatLaurel damages her external organs, thereaposs nothing they can do - so the family are patiently waiting until Laurel turns three and can have her organs internalised. If inserted into the body too soon, and when her frame is too small, the diaphragm wouldnapost be able to cope with the sudden lack of space with which to operate. As it is, Laurel will have to aposlearn how to breathe againapos when she undergoes the operation at the beginning of .

Arts and crafts and growing their own fruit and veg also made the top five.Interestingly, the exclusive Daily Mirror and Very survey showed that gardening was far lower down the list for kids younger than , with exercise in second place after cooking and baking.Boys were more likely to have spent more time playing a musical instrument and doing DIY. And for many, the group activities have brought them together as a family. Describing the positives of lockdown, one parent wrote: Being able to help more with the kids home schooling as normally I am in work. Building a veg garden and growing our own veg has been a fun thing for all of us.  And I feel we have all grown closer as a family. Meanwhile, other families used the opportunity to exercise and to improve their fitness. Some even opted to do this all together, either through group work outs or by making it a competition. One parent said: Getting myself fitter by running more on my treadmill. The rest of family doing it as well, so we are fitter as a family physically and mentally. Some made the most of their one trip out of the house for exercise by going out for a walk with loved ones. One wrote: Going for a walk with my daughter and spotting all the wildle and breathing cleaner air.Another added: Going out for walks and discovering areas around where I live that I never knew were there. While everyone has obviously faced their own challenges in lockdown, some people have found itaposs also brought some advantages, Veryaposs research found. Parents of younger kids are more likely to have found the lockdown fun compared to those with teenage children, but an incredible amount say the restrictions have brought them closer as a family.

Childrenaposs Commissioner for England Anne Longfield had said regular testing of pupils and teachers, perhaps as frequently as weekly, could be needed eventhey do not exhibit symptoms to keep transmission rates down. But Mr Gibb did not support the call, saying: All the advice weaposve had is the measures that weaposre putting in place, the hierarchy of controls about hygiene and so on and bubbles within schools, is the most effective method of reducing the risk of transmission of the virus. He said: “Not routine testing without symptoms. The advice that we have is that it’s better to test when people actually show symptoms.” Boris Johnson, who has spoken of a moral duty to reopen schools, is expected to focus on the minimal risk getting children back in class presents to their health and the potential dangers of keeping them away. Yesterday the number of new infections in the UK rose back above , for the first time since June after spikes in several towns and areas in the north of England.

He told BBC Radio #xs Today programme: #xCThere are five studies from around the world from New South Wales, from Australia, Singapore, from Ireland, from Germany, and from France, and in each of those there appears to be very, very little transmission in schools. #xCWe know that children can and do transmit this virus, of course they do, but they#xre very minor players in the transmission overall, particularly younger children. #xCIt#xs increasingly clear that older children - teenagers probably - transmit as much as adults, but schools themselves play very little role. #xCThey#xre a closed setting but actually we see very few outbreaks in schools, large outbreaks, and actually there#xs very little transmission from child to child or child to adult, actually much of the transmission in schools is from adults bringing it in, particularly staff. #xCThere#xs increasing evidence in the UK and the Government is doing a number of studies which have showed apparently very little transmission and very little infection when schools were open in England.#xD :Care Minister calls it a “national priority” to get children back to school in autumnCare Minister Helen Whately has said it is a #xCnational priority#xD to get children back to school in autumn.

Now, in an exclusive interview, Ulrich Watermann, , the parliamentary groupaposs spokesman on domestic policy for the Social Party of Germanyin Lower Saxony, says the European Court of Justicehas already made a decision which will ultimately keep Brueckner behind bars.The Mirror previously reported on how the ECJaposs Advocate General advised that Brueckneraposs seven-year sentence for rape should stand. The Advocate Generalaposs recommendation is non-binding although it is usually a strong indication of a subsequent decision. Watermann has now claimed the ECJ has followed the advice, with the official ruling set to be announced later this week.Brueckner’s defence team has appealed a seven-year sentence he received for the rape of a -year-old American woman in . Watermann, however, says the ECJ has already decided that the rape conviction was lawful, meaning Brueckner will be kept in prison for seven years to serve this sentence.“To the best of my knowledge the decision has already been made relating to a conviction of a rape of an American woman, and this was conviction was found to be in accordance with European law. Therefore, he [Brueckner] will remain in jail not only for the drugs, but also for the rape. Lawyers defending Brueckner had appealed against the rape conviction which he was handed in December  at the regional court of Braunschweig, Lower Saxony.  German police had extradited Brueckner to Germany via a European arrest warrant in  in connection with an earlier sex offence against a minor. His lawyers then claimed it was against the rules for German prosecutor to later try Brueckner for rape, as this was not the crime he was officially extradited for.   When the case was taken to the German supreme court, the Federal Court of Justice , the court decided to seek further clarication from the ECJ on the laws governing European arrest warrants.   Here Brueckner’s defence team had claimed the European arrest warrant’s principle of speciality protected a person being extradited one crime then having to stand trial for another.  Last week, however, a preliminary opinion by the ECJ’s advocate general, Michal Bobek, found that Brueckner had been lawfully tried for rape.   Bobek’s ruling is not binding, as the ECJ now has to officially announce its own ruling. But Ulrich Watermann says this has already been made behind closed doors.He said this means the public prosecution office in Braunschweig, which is leading the Maddie investigation, no now longer needs to find a reason to keep Brueckner in prison.   “This means they can calmly continue the investigation, which has been started so intensively. I hope that the case will be solved so that Maddie’s parents can close a terrible chapter, but despite this the pain will remain.”   “I hope that there will also be a conviction, as a deterrent to prevent other such crimes from taking place.”  Lower Saxony and the neighbouring state of North-Rhine Westphalia both became the focus of recent media attention when German cyber police units uncovered large paedophile networks.   At the end of June, some , suspects were investigated in Bergisch Gladbach, and just weeks earlier  suspects had been arrested in Remscheid in connection with a nationwide child sex abuse ring.   Following the scandal in Bergisch Gladbach, the ministry of justice in North Rhine Westphalia said “We want to drag perpetrators and supporters of child abuse out of the anonymity of the internet.” For Watermann, however, politicians need to go much further.   “There should be a thorough and intensive consultation on how we can find means to drain this swamp, to make it as dficult as possible, or to stop such violence against children being committed altogether.”  We have to realize that -we do not put child protection before data protection - we have no chance to investigate such cases.”  Meanwhile Watermann says the Maddie case has provided the impulse to push for a reform of Germany’s legal framework to fight child abuse on the internet.   He claims that the German constitution, written in , must now be revised to reflect the digital age, and make the protection of children more important than data protection.  “The Maddie case has provided the impulse for a nationwide debate about rethinking our entire approach to protecting children. There have been ious changes made to our laws already, including banning sex dolls – and I’m for all of this, but we cannot just have superficial soundbites, we need a deeper, more major, thorough reform, and we need to amend our constitution.”  “Today there is sometimes almost a lawless situation online whereby paedophiles thrive and hide online. This must change so that whatever you do online is punished asit was offline.”  Lower Saxony and the neighbouring state of North-Rhine Westphalia both became the focus of recent media attention when German cyber police units uncovered giant paedophile networks.   At the end of June, some , suspects were investigated in Bergisch Gladbach, and just weeks earlier  suspects had been arrested in Remscheide in connection with a nationwide child sex abuse ring.   Following the scandal in Bergisch Gladbach, the ministry of justice in North Rhine Westphalia said “We want to drag perpetrators and supporters of child abuse out of the anonymity of the internet.” For Watermann, however, politicians need to go much further.   “There should be a thorough and intensive consultation on how we can find means to drain this swamp, to make it as dficult as possible, or to stop such violence against children being committed.”  “In the past paedophile networks would all meet at one location, such as a camping site, and commit their horric acts there, but now in the digital age they don’t need to take these risks. They can just meet online. Our constitution needs to reflect this.”  “We need to catch-up quickly, not have laws which are relevant for the past. It is important police can all physical evidence, but also everything that is available in the digital world. We need to discuss how this material can also be used in the future. We have to realize thatwe put child protection before data protection then we have no chance to identy such cases.”  Germany has the strictest data protections regulations in the EU, and for years, in Germany, the inidual’s right to have his or her data protected has widely been viewed as almost sacrosanct.   Much of this is a side-effect of having lived under two violently oppressive regimes. Under the Third Reich, the Nazi’s used intensive and horric surveillance of the German population to identy and persecute Jews, gypsies, communists, homosexuals and other minorities.   After the defeat of Nazism in , Germany made a concerted effort to limit the amount of personal data which authorities were allowed to gather, and develop laws around this.   The world’s very first data protection law was passed in  in Hessen, part of the former West Germany. Just seven years later came the Federal Data Protection Act, which aimed to protect West German citizens against abuse in the “storage, transmission, modication and deletion” of private data.  "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle guided harry public","story":"NewsMeghan Markle has guided Harry on public journey to wokeness, says new book authorThe authors of hotly-anticipated new book Finding Freedom claim Prince Harry was deeply affected by witnessing we Meghan Markle face an onslaught of racismShareByTalia ShadwellReporter:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG NewsMeghan Markle and Prince Harry have started a new le with baby Archie in the United States \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The author of Finding Freedom says the Duchess of Sussex guided her husband on his public journey to become aware of issues like racism. The couple moved to the US with baby Archie after their bombshell announcement they planned to split from the royal family and start a new, independent le. They originally shted to Canada with baby Archie, but moved to a luxury mansion in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles amid the coronavirus pandemic to be closer to American Meghanaposs mum. The forthcoming tell-all book charting the lead-up to Megxit by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand claims a series of rts with senior royals and courtiers drove a wedge between the Sussexes and the Royal Family. It includes allegations of an icy relationship between Meghan and sister-in-law Kate Middleton. It also claims that the couple clashed with the aposold guardapos among traditionally-minded royal circles, who were said to have openly resented waiting on the former Suits star. Mr Scobie told NPR that Meghan had been instrumental in helping her royal husband to rethink the way he saw the world, saying: I think Harryaposs journey to wokeness has been very public. Weaposve sort of seen him learning and educating himself along the way. But... this experience of witnessing Meghan face racist remarks and commentary would have been the first time that he ever saw someone in his le or someone that he was particularly close to affected by it in certain way. The book co-author continued: We talk about some of the more obvious examples in some of the media coverage. But I think the things that have flown under the radar are some of the sort of othering of Meghan that weaposve seen. Weaposve sort of seen it repeatedly that sheaposs not one of us. And now, what do they mean by not one of us  And I think there are things like that which Harryaposs really had to become more attuned to and learn to see when it happens in front of him.

Mariusz Stepien was searching a field near Peebles with friends on June  when he found a bronze object buried half a metre underground. The group camped in the field and built a shelter to protect the find from the elements while archaeologists spent  days investigating. Among the items found were a complete horse harness - preserved by the soil - and a sword which have been dated as being from  to  BC. Mr Stepien said: I thought Iaposve never seen anything like this before and felt from the very beginning that this might be something spectacular and Iaposve just discovered a big part of Scottish history. I was over the moon, actually shaking with happiness. We wanted to be a part of the excavation from the beginning to the end. I will never forget those  days spent in the field. Every day there were new objects coming out which changed the context of the find, every day we learned something new.  Iaposm so pleased that the earth revealed to me something that was hidden for more than  years. I still canapost believe it happened. As he was getting strong signals from the earth around the initial object, Mr Stepien contacted the Treasure Trove Unit to report his find.  They also found decorated straps, buckles, rings, ornaments and chariot wheel axle caps. Evidence of a decorative rattle pendant from the harness was also discovered - the first one to be found in Scotland and only the third in the UK. The hoard has been moved from the site in a large block of soil and taken to the National Museums Collection Centre in Edinburgh.

She had a normal diet until the split and particularly enjoyed full English breakfasts. She added: “I went through a tough breakup and I stopped eating anything at all, Iaposd just have a can of Monster for breakfast.  There were a few other things I ate but only really small amounts. I lost two and a half stone in three months. I was around five stone then eventually I moved onto chicken nuggets. I just wish I could eat more and a bigger iety. Iaposd love to be chubby, it looks great. My partner suggested going on holiday next year and it terries me.”  Michaela is thankful her partner, John Docherty, , has supported her throughout her condition. However, she is concerned about her young kids and that she may lose her sight, a common prognosis of ARFID. The mother continued: “The thought of my babies growing up without me because of my food phobia is terrying. If I lose my sight, I know that Iaposll have the best people who love me and help me adjust. My biggest fear is that Iaposll go downhill and lose weight again to a point that I canapostfrom. Before, there wasnapost anything I didnapost like and Iaposd eat pretty much anything. Iaposd eat three slices of bacon, two eggs, four sausages, two pieces of fried toast, three hash browns and beans in one sitting.  I could really put some food away. Iaposm trying really hard to add new foods into my diet now. John spends most of the day asking meI fancy this or that, he will travel quite far sometimes when I want something but canapost find any, he will hunt that thing down.” In fact, Michaela considers her spouse her superhero for his time and patience. Without John I wouldnapost be here. He is constantly trying to encourage me and make me feel good about myself, telling me Iaposm doing really well evenIaposve only eaten three or four strawberries,” she added.  He is always keeping an eye on my moods, he notices when Iaposm slipping with food and will then up his attempts to get me eating again. What he does goes above what any sort of paid carer would do for me. He cooks for me pretty much most of the time because I canapost stand to smell my food too much before eating it as it can make me feel really sick. Heaposs stood with me for hours at a time trying to think of something I will eat, he goes to the ends of the earth to help me.

The monarch, , and Prince Philip, , arrived in Scotland the day before a lockdown was imposed in Aberdeen city centre. She headed out for a walk in the sunshine as she wore a gilet over a red top and donned a traditional tartan skirt after over five months isolating at Windsor Castle. Following a conversation with what appears to be an aide at the estate, the Queen then took her beloved Corgis for a walk. Sophie Wessex, Edward and their children joined them as the family enjoyed the exceptional weather. It was decided they would not attend church this weekend in a bid to stop people gathering outside. Her Majesty will not be required to wear a face covering for her traditional summer break despite concerns due to the coronavirus pandemic. Before their arrival, courtiers spent weeks planning how to ensure the castle remained safe. Due to the very small number of staff – dubbed the HMS Bubble – that are in close contact with both the Queen and Prince Philip, masks are not needed. The Sunday Times reports that aides are low in number at Balmoral.  Vice-Admiral Tony Johnstone-Burt, Sir Edward Young, the Queen’s private secretary, and her trusted pages Paul Whybrew and William Henderson are on site serving the Royal family. Major Nana Kofi Twumasi-Ankrah, the Queenaposs equerry, will also join head groom Terry Pendry, personal assistant Angela Kelly and four other aides at the castle. In order to enable the Queen to ride her beloved fell ponies, only one groom is allowed access to the animals.

Unfortunately Jason was busy, but Asda flung open their doors exclusively for the Tipton Twins. And they did it in style wearing unicorn face masks... and headed straight for the drinks section. Britain’s oldest identical twins, they have shopped in the supermarket since it opened more than  years ago and were applauded by staff when they ed to the store. Bosses at the supermarket giant opened their doors at am yesterday to give the ladies – unable to go throughout the pandemic – the run of their favourite shop. The twins were so keen toto the store, they even agreed to self isolate for seven days to protect others at their residential complex. “They spoilt me rotten,” Doris said. “I’ve had my whisky and lemonade. I used to get a bottle every Tuesday. It was lovely to put my shoes on after being in slippers for six months. I might not put my slippers on again.” Lils pointed out they put the Daily Mirror in their trolley and said: “We love it because our photo was in it right next to Jason Statham in a towel.  “It wouldn’t take me long to rip that towel off. We love Asda because the people that work there are all lovely. We always have a giggle with the staff. We want to come back tomorrow “We used to go every Tuesday morning on the ring and ride, we’d do our shop then enjoy a bacon butty and a natter in the cafe. I was dying to go back shopping – nearly as much as I want to meet Jason Statham.” The pair won fans online when arguing over who likes the actor, , the most after revealing they watched every Fast and Furious film.  Lils does have a favourite member of staff, adding: “I love the woman on the chickens she’s a cheeky bugger. She was off today but sent her love.” Doris added: “It’s worth doing the seven days in isolation for this. It’s special getting your own things and not relying on someone . They don’t check the dates.” The twins who made GMB host Piers Morgan blush by telling him the secret to a long le is “plenty of sex” have , followers on social media.  Lil’s granddaughter, Kerry Clarke, , said: “It was just lovely, the experience they had today money couldn’t buy. It was so special.

Zoe Cain - who is a mental health support worker in her day job - approached the Happiness Project on Instagram asking how she could help out. She claims after coming forward to offer her support, she was sent the saucy snap instead. The organisation, set up by Joshua Martin Hudson in , states it uses social media to help those battling mental illness. It posts daily positivity messages to its , Facebook followers and also on Instagram. Zoe was open about her own struggles with mental health issues to the Happiness Project, and thought she could lend her expertise. However she was left revolted when she was sent a topless photo of a manaposs chest from the groupaposs account, and told she could sell it as a picture on her OnlyFans account. The -year-old model runs a page under the name Blonde Gypsy Witch on the website - which allows people to charge fans for often explicit pictures and videos.

When Zoe asked whether that was professional, the man responded: I was only having a laugh. Zoe was fuming, and blocked the account in case she received more topless pictures. I reached out in a professional manner, and he sent that out of the blue, she blasted. My modelling has nothing to do with this side of my work. Zoe believesanything her OnlyFans work could be seen as empowering. What I do as an extracurricular activity doesnapost define me, she said.

Itaposs left teachers and school bosses desperately looking for solutions on how to follow restrictions while educating pupils.

The social media  deemed this a violation of its rules against sharing misinformation about the  coronavirus.The clip came from an interview with Fox  Friends earlier that day. The Centers for Disease Control and Preventionhas said that while adults make up most of the known Covid- cases to date, some children and infants have been sick with the disease and they can also transmit it to others. During a briefing at the White House on the same day, Trump repeated his claim that the virus had little impact on children. Children handle it very well, he told reporters.

The huge rodents, also known as nutrias, have taken over Krauss Baker Park in Texas. A picture of at least of dozen of the swamp rats in the park has circulated on social media, with experts urging the public not to feed them. Local park authorities say the animals can spread parasites to bodies of water that could lead to human infectionsthe water is used for drinking or recreation.  Urban Wildle Biologist Rachel Richter told KSAT : The reason for the thriving population of nutria in Krauss Baker Park is that people are feeding them at this location.People generally mean well when they offer food to animals, but they don’t realize that they’re doing far more harm than good. Feeding wildle is a huge problem that has negative impacts on our local ecosystems and often leads to human-wildle conflict in our communities. The swamp rats can eat up to three pounds every day - or % of their body weight.A colony of them is said to have formed in the area last year, but there are fears more could arrive. On female nutria could produce two to three litters each year, with up to  offspring each time. Looking like beavers, swamp rats have brown fur, long tails and orange teeth. Richter added: They are harmful to humans because they degrade water quality in water bodies that might be used for recreation or drinking water.

And theyaposre not the only ones who accidentally made this mistake, a leather store in New Zealand also features aposhuruhuruapos branding. This blunder has been called out by TV personality Te Hamua Nikora, who is Māori.In a video shared to his Facebook page, he said: Some people call it appreciation, I call it appropriation. Itaposs that entitlement disease theyaposve got. Stop it. Use your own language.The video went viral, being watched over , times.Thousands of people also commented on the post, with many finding the companyaposs error amusing. One person said: This is fricken gold. Iaposm not even Maori and I know what it means. Another wrote: I canapost even. Others branded the man a legend for making the video.  Following the controversy, the breweryaposs co-founder Mike Patriquin has said the company will be re-branding the drink.Speaking to  CBC, he said: We acknowledge that we did not consider the commonplace use of the term huruhuru... and that consultation with a Māori representative would have been a better reference than online dictionaries.We wish to make especially clear that it was not our intent to infringe upon, appropriate or offend the Māori culture or people in any way to those who feel disrespected, we apologise. We also do not think pubic hair is shameful, though we admit it may not go well with beer. Ercan Karakoch, the owner of the leather store has since claimed that when he chose the name for his business, he sought approval through the Intellectual Property Officeof a Māori advisory committee.

They said I was too small after youth team level.“Usually it’s a case of, ‘He’s too small,’ being an easy excuse but I was about ft  when I was !“I was gone then, thinking my career was done before it had even started but luckily enough I got picked up by Dundee.“It went quite quick from there. I played a few U-s games, established myself and had a good season.“When they were short of players for the reserves I’d come up and join them sitting on the bench.“Luckily enough I managed to come on for a couple of games, done well and just managed to build my way up.“Next minute there was a few injuries in the first team and boys not wanting to play and I was making my full debut at Brechin away.“I was like here we go, Brechin away for my debut. I remember walking into the changing-room thinking to myself, ‘I’m buzzing,’ but looking back now I question why!“It was fantastic, though, and my career has took off since then.”One man who McDonald feels should take particular credit for his success is ex-Dee gaffer Alex Rae.Former Rangers midfielder Rae replaced Alan Kernaghan in the Dens dugout in  as player-manager and McDonald initially feared for his midfield position.He added: “I knew straight away I was done but he’s the manager at the end of the day so I was still young and ready to accept it.“He came in and he was at it. He put himself straight into a reserve game and, to be fair to him, he was absolutely brilliant.“He was a player and absolutely battered us. He was the biggest signing for Dundee when I was there.“It was such a high-profile player and manager to have besides all the Italians.“When he came in it was a bit of a wake-up call because he raised the standard as such.“He was quite hard on people but it was what the club needed at the time.“He was hard on me because he could see I had potential to go on to another levelI wanted to.“He was the same with Robbo , DickerandSwankie – the lot of them.“He helped me, to be fair, because he was a centre midfielder he helped me massively.“He was smashing people in training on a daily basis. Normally managers want you to take care in training a little bit but he was wanting you to go in hard.“If you were pulling out of a tackle, he was hammering you so it got feisty at times but he loved that everyone was playing hard for their places.“He brought that mentality to the club.”McDonald began to establish himself in Rae’s side, rejecting interest from Celtic and Everton, before moving to Burnley for £,.He was a standout in Scotland’s second tier but not at any point did he find it easy.McDonald said: “After a couple of goals you do gain a bit of confidence and then there’s the media hype and that.“It did start to feel easier as time went on. The more I played, the more I got into it and felt more comfortable.“I’d never at the time say it was easy when you’re going to places like Airdrie away and they’re absolutely battering you.”Of the transfer interest, he added: “I’d see so many people and heard so many stories of people going to Celtic and being a number.“They had a -man squad, some incredible players right the way through their set-up, such strength and depth throughout the whole club.“I had a chat with my agent and family and said I don’t think I fancy going there at all.“I knew there was a couple of clubs interested down south still. That was the swaying point and I thought I needed to give it a blast and go there.“I had the choice of Burnley and Everton and went to Burnley. I don’t know how that one worked out to be honest.“It was Owen Coyle who sold it in the end. He was incredible.”PODCAST: Twa Teams, One Street – United back in the big time and Danny Mullen in at Dundee\" title\"#PODCAST: Twa Teams, One Street – United back in the big time and Danny Mullen in at Dundee# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp podcast-twa-teams-one-street-united-back-in-the-big-time-and-danny-mullen-in-at-dundee embed # secretMFquPRpdMj\" data-secret\"MFquPRpdMj\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

But that’s OK.Yes, Hemmings is almost definitely a better goal-scorer and probably a greater all-round player than his replacements but he doesn’t want to be with the Dark Blues and Danny Mullen and Alex Jakubiak do.Having watched them extensively at St Mirren in recent times, their commitment to the cause, I believe, will be immediately evident to Dundee fans.Mullen, in particular, is a passionate sort.He performs best when riled and up against it, his energy seemingly endless and with a phenomenal work-rate to boot.Prolic he is not but he is good for a goal, and no stranger to a wonder strike.The -year-old former Livingston man loves being in the final third, gets his team up the park and is surprisingly good in the air despite not being the tallest frontman.Of course, a lot of this is known to Dees, with Mullen scoring three times against them in their   relegation season.The nippy forward also bagged a crucial goal against city rivals Dundee United in the Premiership Play-off Final that term, proving he can be a man for the big occasion.A lot of Buddies fans were disappointed to see Mullen let go but their loss is the Dark Blues’ gain.He could make all the dference in getting Dundee back into the top flight.Jakubiak, too, was a favourite among the Paisley faithful and a serious target for boss Jim Goodwin.His wage demands proved too much for St Mirren so it is curious to see him at the Dee.His quality is without question, however, and paired with Mullen they may just fill Hemmings’ void.They might not have made the best start to the season but Motherwell should be the benchmark for Dundee United.Going by last term’s standings, outwith the Old Firm, ’Well are the Premiership’s top side.Despite their opening day - defeat at Ross County on Monday night, Stephen Robinson’s side hold a title United should be aiming for – the best of the rest.Third is the most anyone in Scottish football can realistically hope for with the big two from Glasgow about.And why not the Tangerines  They are one of Scottish football’s biggest and most historic clubs after all.Hearts would usually lay a claim to being Scotland’s third power but, with the Jambos now in the Championship, it’s open for a few others.Aberdeen and Hibs would be the other obvious candidates but the Steelmen have shown what can be achieved on a smaller budget.Whatever the result is at Fir Park today, the Terrors shouldhome inspired to lay claim to ’Well’s unofficial crown.The myth of English football exceptionalism persists.This week it was the wholly unexceptional Jamie O’Hara bumming up the Premier League while laying into our game at the same time.The former Tottenham midfielder claimed relegated Bournemouth would be a bigger job than European football with Rangers for Steven Gerrard.Utter nonsense.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary.

There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle. This proposal, like many others, was defeated in the House of Lords.Instead, provision was made at Dalmally for a waiting room, the #Duke’s Room#, at Dalmally Station where visitors arriving by train could await the arrival of a carriage in comfort.This is just one of innumerable fascinating stories stored within the Argyll Papers, the family and estate archive of the Campbell family, dukes of Argyll.The Friends of the Argyll Papers was established to support the development of the archive and to promote its use and enjoyment by a wide audience.It has been described as one of the most important private archives in Britain, offering a rich resource for Scottish and British history from the th to the st centuries.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

There are fabulous woodlands, beaches and picnic spots everywhere. And you don’t have to just go walking. Cycling has become ever more popular during lockdown and swimming in rivers and lakes is another wonderful way to get the blood pumping and improve your health. A survey taken at the start of lockdown revealed that one in four of us admitted that we were more active than before lockdown.This increased to one in three as lockdown continued, with combatting lockdown weight gain and helping mental health given as the top reasons many people are turning to some form of physical exercise. There is so much to choose from to keep you active from dusk to dawn.From aerial assault courses to horse riding treks, there are a massive range of outdoor family activities and endless possibilities for days out packed with family-friendly outdoor activities.No matter where you are, lakes and waterways make for not only incredibly scenic views but also cover a whole range of activities.The United Kingdom’s  National Parks also contain some of the nation’s most beautul and inspiring landscapes.You’ll find some of the best walking, cycling and horse riding locations and a whole host of other adventure activities in the spectacular parks.Add nearly  Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and you’ll find you’re spoilt for choice when it comes to exploring our famous countryside and keeping fit.NOTE: Please keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have dferent guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism.So do please make sure you check the respective official sources for information before you travel.Whether you are heading for the hills, planning a coastal stroll or fancy splashing about in the sea or a lake, make sure you take time to check out what you need to do to stay safe.Visit visitbritain know-before-you-go to learn more about heading outdoors safely.Walking in Scotland means mighty mountains to conquer, plenty of forest paths or coastal walks to meander along, charming villages to discover, and exciting city routes to explore.Whether you’d like to enjoy a walking holiday, or simply an afternoon’s amble, you’re definitely in the right place when you are in Scotland.  What are you waiting for It’s time to explore one of Scotland’s best assets – the great outdoors Scotland’s Great Trails, such as the West Highland Way, the Great Glen Way, Fe Coastal Path and the Southern Upland Way are among the best walking routes in the world for experienced hikers and take you through some outstanding scenery.

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation.Scotland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer.Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go.The national tourist organisations of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence.Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel.  If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing.  Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport.  Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond.The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful.They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff.Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing.“We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.  Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping.“You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked.  They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place.  Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.·         Wales is open for camping from  July.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place. The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

However, such a complex undertaking inevitably takes time.#The £ million that has been spent to date has been vital in reducing incidents like this and also ensuring that they get cleared as quickly as possible and that is the work that will be going on today.  That needs to take place as quickly, but also as safely, as possible.#Meanwhile I will be working with the Transport Secretary in order to urge whatever acceleration of the design and planning process for a replacement can take place and I would welcome support in that from any other quarter including opposition parties.#All traffic is currently being erted via the standard ersion route via the A, A, A and A.  The ersion route is being patrolled and monitored to check for any issues and ensure traffic is kept moving.  Temporary traffic lights are currently in place on the A at Inveruglas after yesterday’s heavy rain affected a retaining wall, causing some damage to the road.  Traffic Scotland are also providing additional advanced warning signs for road users to inform them of the closure at the Rest and Be Thankful so motorists can plan an alternative route in advance.Western Ferries have also added additional sailings on their usual Gourock to Dunoon route to help accommodate motorists.Eddie Ross, BEAR Scotland’s North West Representative said: #Further assessments need to be completed by geotechnical specialists of the hillside and both roads to check for any further concerns, and until these checks and the clear-up is complete the A and OMR will remain closed.In the meantime, Argyll remains open for business and we encourage road users to follow the ersion route in place for motorists.  Western Ferries are also running additional sailings for their Gourock to Dunoon crossing to accommodate road users.Please check Traffic Scotland for most up to date travel information.#Real-time journey information is available on www.traffiscotland.org, twitter at @trafficscotland or the mobile site my.trafficscotland.org."},{"url":null,"title":"assessment and clear up operation continues at rest and be thankful","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more #

Work has continued since then to raise money to complete the project.With the cost of the original scheme estimated at £ million, the charity decided to scale back its ambitions and make it a phased project that could be added to as funding allowed.The first priority was to remove buildings containing asbestos on the newly-purchased site, at an estimated cost of £,.More than half of this sum was granted by the A#Chruach wind farm fund, provided by Ventient Energy, but the balance was still to be found and with the building warrant to remove the buildings running out in October time was getting short.That was when A and C Building Contractors Ltd, Kenneth James Construction Ltd and M Kerr Roofing stepped in to save the day.Andy Morrison and Craig Owen, of A and C Building Contractors Ltd, approached MAYDS centre manager Fiona Kalache to find out what was happening with the buildings and how the project was progressing. They decided to contact the other firms and they all agreed to help the charity by completeing the first phase of the project for the amount of money currently available.Andy and Craig explained: #MAYDS really helped us out when we were putting together our business plan and setting up so we wanted to say #thank you# and repay the favour. We are happy to be helping a local charity, especially when it is going to create something good for the community and youngsters in the area.#Kenny MacLeod added: #It is great to see something happening for young people and for Lochgilphead. Often it seems like lots of things are happening around Lochgilphead but never in the town itself, so this is an important development that will be really beneficial.#Fiona Kalache offered her thanks to the construction companies: #This is a huge relief as we have been struggling for some time to get funding for the full costs. The main thing was to get the buildings down before our building warrant ran out, giving us a clear site to start construction of the skate park.#These builders have gone out of their way to support us by doing work in kind and reducing costs so that we can now move forward with our planned development. We are so grateful to them for stepping in to support the young people of Mid Argyll and finally allowing their vision to progress. Thanks also have to go to A#Chruach wind farm. It has funded a signicant part of the costs quoted and have continued to support us throughout.#This will make a big dference to the lives of young people in the area. Many of them currently travel through to Dumbarton to access the type of facilities we hope to offer. We plan to use the back end of the site for basketball hoops and other play equipment and hope to attract children from all over Argyll, creating a fun, safe space for young people.#Once the site is cleared, security fencing and lighting will be installed. Then work will start on putting the steel skate park jumps and ramps in place. MAYDS would welcome any help to raise money to meet the cost of this work.MAYDS works with young people up to the age of  across Mid Argyll and Islay, offering training, support, youth clubs, drop-ins, cyber cafe, trips and much more. People receiving help include young carers, young parents, young people with disabilities and young people looking to engage in fun activities or access training courses.The skate park project has received support from Lochgilphead Community Council and from Mid Argyll members of Argyll and Bute Council.Betty Rhodick, Lochgilphead Community Council member on the A#Chruach wind farm fund , commented: #I am delighted to see things progressing.

This will make the air feel cool as the ice evaporates.Avoid things that can cause humidityA hot shower, the washing machine and the dishwasher all produce steam which can cause humidity and make a

ldquofully back at school by September.She told BBC Breakfast: ldquoSchools are safe and there are extra measures that schools are being advised by Public Health England to take for instance, to have

Amanda had been diagnosed in November  and given  weeks to live.David and Trevor are raising money for Pancreatic Cancer UK after Trevor was diagnosed with an aggressive form of the condition in November last year,  months after Amanda.His diagnosis is terminal and he has received  chemotherapy sessions.Trevor was also given  weeks to live but chose to go through treatment to extend his le.He is receiving more treatment in September.This is not the first time that the pair have embarked on a tour like this and it was this previous trip that inspired them to go again.In Christmas , David received a present to go on a motorbike ride and the following February he left with Trevor to go on a -day tour around Europe.However, they were on their trip during the Beast from the East snowstorm of early , which saw them ride through snow in mainland Europe.David, who owns a couple of coffee shops in London, said: ldquoWe went through the Swiss Alps, France and Italy and people were following us through France and beeping their horns at us, so we said thatwe ever do this again that we must do it for charity.The pair then set up their own website, called the Hairless Bikers www.hairlessbikers, inspired by lsquoHairy Bikersrsquo David Myers and Si King with their own twist, as both David and Trevor are bald.The pair were planning their next trip until Amandarsquos terminal diagnosis, with David saying the news came ldquoall of a sudden.After Amandarsquos death, David spent time dealing and coming to terms with his loss and then Trevor received his diagnosis.And when the coronavirus pandemic started earlier this year, it added to an already dficult year.The pair were waiting for Trevor to finish his chemotherapy before starting the tour, with Trevor phoning David last month and askinghe wanted to go.David told the Courier before he set off: ldquoWersquove always said we will do it but now itrsquos all go.ldquoTrevor phoned me last weekend and said: lsquoLetrsquos just do it.rsquo If we donrsquot do it now then itrsquos never going to happen.ldquoWe thought about all of the news going on at the moment andanything happens or we need to come back we are just in Europe so can easily catch a plane home.Ahead of the trip, David said he was ldquovery excited, adding he was just going to focus on riding and see what happened.He added: ldquoWe wonrsquot stop laughing, wersquoll be like little kids.An initial target of pound was raised, with more than pound, raised in a few days.David saidan average of pound a day could be raised ldquothat will be brilliant.Donate at www.facebook donate  "},{"url":null,"title":"column-tory-disarray-not-reassuring","story":"It cannot be reassuring for the Scottish Tories that their leader has only been in the position since February and has now left the party in disarray.It is clear the party do not hold Scottish Parliament seats in a high regard, given that it is looking likely that the next leader will be Douglas Ross, who is not even currently an MSP.Scottish Parliament seats require a member who is willing to commit time and effort to their constituency, they are not simply a stepping stone for jumping into a leadership bid.If you compare the Toriesrsquo leadership with that of Nicola Sturgeon over the last few months, with her clear and consistent messaging throughout the Covid- crisis, it is easy to see why polls for the SNP and independence are through the roof.I know that many are looking forward to enjoying the Eat Out to Help Out scheme, which will offer discounts of up to  per cent at restaurants and cafeacutes throughout August.I welcome this help for local businesses, and I am sure that this will benefit them in their restarts following lockdown.I would like to stress, however, that guidelines should always be followed within these establishments.That means that you should be socially distancing from those who are not from your household or extended household, and you should maintain good hygiene by regularly washing your hands for  seconds, as well as not touching your face.To keep yourself safe, it is important to use businesses that are taking these measures seriously and putting safety precautions in place to protect their customers.This week I will be hosting the first meeting of the Esk River Improvement Group.I look forward to working with them to make progress towards cleaning up the Esk."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-mist-midges-memories","story":"Oh and I forgot to mention the midges, which add a particularly Highland flavour to any camping trip up north.Such was our experience last weekend after we managed to find a campsite that was open. We managed just one overnight stay in Glen Nevis.It has always been a favourite glen of mine.Its beauty challenges the majestic Glencoe, but its landscape is gentler and less rugged, and the upper reaches of the glen take you back in time, to the majesty of the ancient Caledonian forest.In the days when I was a tour guide, I always thought that mist and rain were an essential part of a trip to the Highlands.People would refer to hot and sunny weather as good weather, but Irsquod always say that in the Highlands mist and rain can be good weather too.On such days, the weather would add the veil of mystery and unpredictability that makes the landscape so intriguing.Hardly ever was the approach to Glencoe the same because of the weather it changes the landscape in ways the imagination could never predict.Swirling mists which dress the peaks, layers of low lying cloud which suddenly break to allow sparkling rays of sunshine itrsquos spine-tinglingly magical.On days of so called good weather, when the skies were a cloudless blue, I always felt there was something missing in the experience.I know all this might sound like patter from VisitScotland attempting to persuade rain drenched tourists that they are lucky to have experienced the true mystery of our country but for me it has always been true.Of course, days of endless pelting rain are no fun and can spoil a holiday, but for me, some mist and rain, in moderation, makes a Highland holiday all the more memorable.Such was our experience last weekend, with two days that seemed to be in dferent seasons.When we arrived we were lucky to be able to put up the tent just in time, before the rain got heavy.Itrsquos always an awkward moment for me putting up our tent in full view of other campers, as we struggle to remember which pole goes where and try not to look like we need assistance.It couldrsquove been easy to be despondent at the weather. Dark brooding clouds shrouded the sides of Ben Nevis, bringing rain that threatened to dampen everything but I refused to let it dampen our spirits.I recited the famous quote: ldquoIn Scotland there is no such thing as bad weather just bad clothing.We had a hearty camp stove meal and then set off for our walk in the Nevis Gorge.Itrsquos a well kent walk now, but when I was first taken many years ago before the internet it was a relatively unknown secret. I still remember the sense of awe as I heard the roar of the river below, and the sight of the distant waterfall An Steall as we emerged from the gorge.Our trick was to go on our walk when it was raining, and after teatime so we had the place almost to ourselves, well apart from the midges.Our midge repellent was gold dust, and Irsquove always found the trick in avoiding midges is to keep moving, which we did, except for once, and we momentarily paid the price.It was a walk in the childhood footsteps of my younger self, where my young children were re-pacing along the route also taken by their older siblings years ago.It was about saying ldquohere is a place important to me, part of who I am itrsquos yours now,you want it to be.Yet not saying it with words, but by making memories that I hope will last as long as mine have.The rain and mist was all part of it, and yes even the midges. As often happens, the weather began to clear as we headed back.The sun broke through and the clouds developed a sparkling yellow tint. The mountains appeared, like giants awoken and rising to their true height.Sunshine briefly warmed our faces and it seemed a gt from the gods for our endurance.The kids danced and sang the song ldquoI can see clearly now the rain has gone as they saw a rainbow.I knew the rain hadnrsquot really gone so we didnrsquot dally.We made it back to the car, tired with sore legs, but before the next dark cloud arrived.That evening we recounted our experiences in the tent, and I told stories about the Jacobites and the old Highland way of le, and the connection to the Battle of Prestonpans on our own doorstep.The kids listened, partly because we were camping and they had no screens, so no choice but Irsquod like to believe partly also because we were in a land where stories and legends are steeped in the soil and they now felt a small part of them.It lashed with rain all night. But its rage had ended by morning and the new day welcomed us with sunshine.New adventures beckoned, with other memories to impart, on what was to become our sunny day.Loch Oich, rich in family memory and where the ashes of both my parents were scattered.Then Loch Ness, a fitting end to a pilgrimage, especially for my monster daft wee boy, and his sisters who love the mystery of the story.Such was our short ldquostaycation this summer.Wersquod followed what I have always called The Road of Legends which is the title of my yet to be published novel, an abridged version of which will be serialised on this page very soon."},{"url":null,"title":"column-tourist-home-help-love-area","story":"I WAS on holiday a couple of weeks ago and on one of the days I went to the local amenity site.There I found lots of people who, like myself, were pretending that clearing out the house was the next best thing to being in some far-off beauty spot.A few days later, I went out on an early morning cycle.As I came out from Musselburgh Lagoons towards the mouth of the Esk, I saw the magnicent sight of all the seabirds, the swans and the geese gathered at that point where river meets sea.It occurred to me then that my best holiday this year could be to live in my own place as though I were a tourist.In my own hometown, I can still be awed by unexpected beauty, delighted by the simple things that sometimes familiarity overlooks.I can take time to appreciate things that normally the hurry and the care of le make miss.Maybe being a tourist at home will help me love Musselburgh and East Lothian more.As a Christian, I know that my faith is not about denying the dficulty and pain that surrounds us.People of faith look to see the possibility of Godrsquos love reaching out to them, and from them to others, when le is hardest.Living with faith is about seeing the world in a way that expects to find hope.I know that recent months have been hard for people in so many ways.But I also have heard so many people say that they have seen more clearly what is important to them and the people they love because they have needed to slow down, to live more simply, to keep closer to home.Perhaps we have an invitation to reflect on the things that we have seen in a new way over the past months, things that we have appreciated and enjoyed.Perhaps we can all find hope in a promise we make to ourselves: we will enjoy the good things we have seen around us in new ways, and to hold onto the positive changes we have made in these hard times, even when our livesto lsquonormalrsquo."},{"url":null,"title":"new-long-term-parking-essential-say-north-berwick-traders","story":"As part of East Lothianrsquos Council Spaces for People programme to help prevent the spread of coronavirus, bollards and planters have been placed along both sides of the road, widening the pavements and removing some parking spaces, allowing pedestrians to maintain social distancing.Nearby car parks, such as Kirk Ports and The Glebe, have been turned into  or -minute stays with nounder the scheme.David Turnbull, from Turnbullrsquos Home Hardware on High Street, said North Berwick needed more long-term parking for tourists and visitors who were likely to stay for longer than  minutes.He said: ldquoThere is now an excess of short-term and a shortage of long-term parking and, whether people were for or against the putting green [Elcho Green car park], it was a way of solving long-term parking.Council plans to construct a temporary car park at Elcho Green were put on hold after more than , people signed a petition against it.David said: ldquo[Without long-stay parking, fewer] visitors and residents are going to come [to the town centre].

Boots has increased in-store measures to ensure all customers feel at ease when going for a vaccination.For example, customers will be asked to read key information online and where possible attend their appointment on their own to avoid any crowding in the pharmacy area.Customers will also be asked to adhere to social distancing measures in waiting areas, sanitise their hands and continue to wear a face-covering throughout their appointment.It is also advised that customers bring their own pen to complete any essential paperwork and they will be asked not to speak to the pharmacist during the actual vaccination to minimise the risk of droplet spreading.If the consultation room is small, the pharmacist may ask to keep the door open during the appointment.Whatpharmacy services are

Recognition value within his own party may even be a moot point .Yet the -year-old north east native apparently believes he has what it takes to lead the Scottish Tories to victory in next Mayrsquos Holyrood election and achieve what his biggest supporter, Baroness Davidson of Lundin Links, failed to do: become First Minister.Despite no public profile to speak of and very little time to build one, Mr Rossrsquos approach over the last few days has certainly been bold. Ruthless, even, in way he and the party swept Jackson Carlaw aside.You get the feeling his campaign team hope for a Barack Obama-style recognition trajectory: at the beginning of  few knew who Obama was by the end of that year he was US President. If Mr Rossrsquos first approach to voters is anything to go by, however, the political figure we may be soon be comparing him to is Jo Swinson. Team Ross would be well-advised to learn lessons from the former Lib-Dem leaderrsquos disastrous  general election campaign, not least how poorly she communicated with voters in Scotland.Itrsquos early days, obviously, and Mr Ross hasnrsquot even been elected party leader yet, though this looks like a coronation rather than a competition. But the piece Mr Ross wrote for a newspaper yesterday, setting out his stall, was ill-conceived to say the least. Indeed, the sort of undecided voter his party desperately needs to pick up over the next few months may have found themselves themselves wincing, even chuckling, at some of the tone-deaf rhetoric.Herersquos an example. Near the beginning of the Sunday Times article Mr Ross states that ldquoa decade and more of nationalist government has left Scotland a ided country. Many readers, even those who donrsquot support the SNP, may immediately find themselves thinking about the how a decade of Tory government at Westminster has indeed left Scotland ided. Between the haves and the have nots. Between the working and the working poor. Between those who benefit from employment rights and those left at the mercy of the so-called gig-economy. Between those who rely on deliberately-underfunded public services and those who donrsquot have to.ldquoItrsquos the nature of nationalism to ide, Mr Ross goes on, seemingly without a hint of irony. The Little England narrative peddled by Boris Johnson and his cronies delivered Brexit at the ballot box, a isive and disastrous outcome that the vast majority of Scots remain economically, socially and ideologically opposed to.Letrsquos see how a no deal Brexit on  December - an outcome engineered and encouraged by a game-playing Prime Minister roundly despised and distrusted in Scotland - works out for Mr Rossrsquos Holyrood campaign. Such a result would undoubtedly heap even more misery upon Scottish businesses already on the brink after what will, by the end of the year, be -months of Covid--related downturn.Mr Ross is apparently a keen supporter of Boris JohnsonMaybe he truly believes he can influence Mr Johnson on Brexit policy where Ruth Davidson, David Mundell and Jackson Carlaw failed.But there lies the fundamental, inescapable rub for Scottish Tories. It doesnrsquot matter who leads them. They are shackled to a UK party that appears to revel in acting against the best interests of Scotland.Those most committed to the Union will still cast their votes for the party next May. They have nowhere  to go.But polls over the last few months have detected a sht. The size of this steadfastly pro-Union group looks like it is decreasing, largely due to Brexit. Younger voters remain overwhelmingly in support of independence.In a bid to counter this, Mr Ross refers throughout the aforementioned article to patriotism, a term associated with the sort of brash Brexiteers most in Scotland canrsquot stand, and is surely no less problematic than ldquonationalism.The architects of his campaign - among them Michael Gove - have little choice but to focus on ldquosaving the Union. But how do you even begin to do this when your own party works against you at every turn  That remains the enduring, unanswerable question for whoever leads the Scottish Tories."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-sunday-letters-readers-talking-week","story":"Were the bill to become law, much would hinge on the definition of what was ldquolikely to ensue after an inidual had expressed an opinion to which A.

No corroboration would be needed for group B to justy the complaint and resultant charges against group A, but immediately on doing so, it would be acting in a way that could \"stir up hatred\" against group A.

Seventy-five years ago I walked out of Changi prison weighing only six stone, and since that time I have remembered comrades who never came home, but I also know that I am alive today because those terrible weapons of war were used.I have recalled those events every day since, they never leave me, and I do have a sense of guilt that I still enjoy le whilst people in Japan remember with sorrow family members they have lost.Eleven years ago I went back to the River Kwai to pay respects to those pals who are buried in Kanchanaburi Cemetery andit was very pleasing to find Japanese tourists there doing likewise. I also say \"never again\".Jack Ransom , Largs.DAVID Pratts article discussing the Cold War legacy of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki did not mention the part played by the United Kingdom Government in the further development of these nuclear weapons.The UKrsquos development of nuclear weapons involved testing these weapons in Australia and on the small North Pacic island of Kiritimafrom  to . This has resulted in long-term suffering to the native Australian population and to the native inhabitants of Kiritima. There were also around , British servicemen involved in these tests. Many of these servicemen died at an early age, from a multitude of rare and unexplained illnesses, a large number of their wives had miscarriages, often multiple, and many of their descendants are now suffering from ious unexplained illnesses.For years successive governments have denied that these deaths and illnesses were in anyway linked to the servicemenrsquos presence at these tests. At present the British Nuclear Veterans Association is campaigning for the Government to award a medal to the men involved in these tests. We wait, but time is running out, as we the veterans grow older.Colin Moir, Peterhead.UNIVERSITIESrsquo WRONG ATTITUDEYOUR investigation into the university funding situationseems to have turned up a number of issues that we are forced to confrontwe are to arrive at a satisfactory resolution to them.The Glasgow University principal was concerned about the loss of soft power from decreased Chinese students as a reason to justy dependence on the Chinese state. That adequately demonstrates firmer power in action within that relationship.A cost to Scottish students that was not mentioned was the increased housing costs. Large numbers of well-funded international students have driven up the price for local accommodation and has pushed many Scottish students to live further away from their place of study, particularly for the less well-off. An extra hour of daily commuting is a large cost over four or more years.We were told that our universities let out a collective sigh of relief that they will not have to refocus on Stemsubjects, health workers or teachers. This is the wrong attitude and is looking at education costs without consideration of value. Give the universities the money but only for areas of greatest consequence. Train more doctors, dentists, scientists and engineers here in Scotland.Tom Walker, Loanhead.LETrsquoS KEEP FIGHTING TOGETHERI HAVE noticed that during this coronavirus pandemic ndash currently ongoing contrary to popular belief ndash that the usual snipers from both sides of the independence debate continue to have a sneaky shot when the opportunity arises.

They are a marriage made in heaven because they are experienced, intelligent, articulate, get on well together and their sense of fun and banter reflects that. Few BBC Scotland programmes get a bigger audience. It was the jewel in their crown.What on earth have they done  Gone is the highly articulate Michael Stewart, who has played at the highest level and speaks with authority. Were they leaned on Some critics have suggested this is the familiar London-based tick-box political correctness, given Sportscene is inflicting Shelley Kerr, Leanne Crichton and Julie Fleeting on us. For some time now they have failed on the likes of Saturday Sportscene Results where the likes of David Currie have rescued them repeatedly. On Championship Sportscene they are rescued by Steven Thomson. They detract from both programmes. Both presenters have had to resort to questions where the reply was framed by the question.Yes they are intelligent, articulate and friendly but they are experts on the womens game. They do not have the background knowledge of the mens game outwith the big five clubs, so the expertise and spontaneity are jettisoned to the detriment of the programme.They do have some excellent guests like Marvin Bartley and James McFadden, who merge their knowledge of the game with a great ability to poke fun at themselves, but neither is a pundit.This has been a great disappointment. I am not alone in these views.

There are other nine-year-olds in that old school picture of mine and I remember them well. One of them, Alex, is standing next to me, scowling out from beneath his fringe. Much later, when he was grown up, Alex became a heroin addict and was hit by a car while he was high and killed instantly, aged . I only found out years later, when someone mentioned it to me, casually. Did I know Alex was dead Therersquos change for you: a bit of my childhood broken off. Alex and I had a dficult relationship. He could be bit of a bully to be honest, but he was only nine and so was I, and one day, when wersquod got into a fight in the playground, I suddenly got the better of him for once and pinned him down and said, ldquoWhat you going to do now, eh  and that was that the fighting stopped and we became friends. Sort of.I find another picture. . The year before the school photo was taken. Oldmeldrum Highland Games in Aberdeenshire, warm, sunny, happy, and there in the middle of the photo, driving towards us in an open-top Rolls Royce ndash in Aberdeenshire! in the s! ndash is the actress Diana Dors ndash in Aberdeenshire! in the s! I didnrsquot know it then of course, but the reason Diana Dors was at Oldmeldrum Highland Games was because her career had hit the skids and she was opening country fetes for cash. I thought it was exciting. She probably felt dead inside. But therersquos change for you: she was a film star once.I put the pictures in a pile and sort through some books that need organising and therersquos a copy of Michael Palinrsquos diaries from the s and s, my childhood.

Therersquos an entry from November  thatrsquos like a Monty Python sketch: Michael is in a book shop in Edinburgh and an irate lady mistakes him for the shopkeeper and tells him she feels cheated because the book about angling she bought for her nephew has two pages stuck together. Maybe the woman was Terry Jones in a dress doing the Spam voice. These pages are stuck together! Itrsquos a scam, scam, scam!But itrsquos the other entries in Palinrsquos diaries ndash interesting, anxious little snippets from the past ndash that really hang around in my brain. He mentions Scottish politics and says that he hopes that, one day, Scotland will be independent. December st : ldquoI would like to see Wales and Scotland as independent nations and I think itrsquos going to happen as people gets less and less satisfaction from being part of a big international wodge.He also rages against the Tories. April st, : ldquoSensitivity, tolerance, understanding and conciliation is a spirit utterly alien to the Thatcher-inspired politics of the s, he writes. And where in the diaries, despite all his success in comedy and films, he worries that he might not be good enough.None of that has changed, has it  Wersquore still angry. We still worry. At one point, Palin notices how much his face has aged ndash and thatrsquos a change that certainly cannot be resisted ndash but the Tories are still the Tories and worries are still worries and, reading the diaries, I feel the connection from now to then and the sense of what hasnrsquot altered at all. There they were: all those people in , including Michael Palin, complaining about the state of things and wanting reform, and herersquos , with lots of people complaining about the state of things and wanting reform. Itrsquos the thing that doesnrsquot change, ever: the desire for change.And now that Irsquom back in the s and s, rummaging about in the years that have gone, I remember something  about that picture of me at school in Torry, Aberdeen, in . t was the year I created a school magazine. I appointed myself editorand chief writerand commissioned myself to write a review of The Krankies at the Capitol theatre and a story about a pair of magic skis. My writing was cobbled together and amateurish and childish andsome people say it still is. You see: nothing changes.So, I tidy the pictures away, and put Palinrsquos diaries up on the shelf, but the photograph from  ndash the one of me next to my teacher and Alex, the boy who died ndash is staying out on my desk.

Occasionally, he likes to get up and demand a cuddle, but mostly hersquos just enjoying the nap and the fact that therersquos nothing much to do today.Ali says she could not have survived lockdown without Clyde. The young dog got her through the worst period of her le, she says, and then when things were looking a bit better, lockdown hit and he got her through that too. Being on your own for weeks on end is disconcerting, says Ali, but it helped to have the dog at her feet. You canrsquot be truly alonetherersquos a dog around.Ali isnrsquot the only one who feels that way. The Battersea Cat and Dog Home has been doing some research recently into how our relationship with pets has been affected by the lockdown conditions and the conclusion is that, for many of us, the negative effects have been eased by having a dog or cat about the place. Many pet-owners report that their anxiety about the situation has been eased or reduced by their pet.This is certainly true for Ali Ramsay. The -year-old from Glasgow used to be a Flight Lieutenant in the RAF and was totally immersed in the military le. ldquoIt was my work le, my social le, my fitness le ndash I played volleyball for the RAF, she says. ldquoIt was everything.Then she was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, a long-term condition that causes chronic pain, and she was medically discharged from the service. It was the beginning of a long dark period in her le.ldquoI didnrsquot want to leave the RAF, she says. ldquoI had  more years of career ahead of me and I wanted that career, but because of my condition, I was medically discharged. It wasnrsquot a choice. I had no career, no purpose. And then I had tribunals just to get my disability pension so I had financial worries. I would have lost my houseit wasnrsquot for my family and forces charities helping me out. So I was in a bit of a dire state.It got so bad that at one point, she says, she considered suicide ndash she was depressed because of the pain and had lost all the enjoyment in her le. But thatrsquos when she contacted the Scottish charity Bravehound which matches dogs with veterans to improve the quality of their lives. Suddenly, there was some purpose back in Alirsquos le and it was brought about by a chocolate Labrador called Clyde.ldquoI needed the dog sooner rather than later, says Ali, ldquoor I wouldrsquove found myself not being here. I was going through hard times and I needed the dog to live. The dference between ending my le and living was having a dog. It gave me something to live for, and a project, and a focus. He was the dference between having somebody  to care for when I didnrsquot care about myself.The positive effects of Clyde have also been amplied by the lockdown. Before the restrictions were imposed, Ali was attending regular training sessions with Clyde and meetings with other veterans and then, suddenly, it all stopped. No more meetings. No more socialising, although the training sessions have continued on Zoom.ldquoI was in my home  , says Ali, ldquoand the only thing to get me out was walking Clyde. And although everyone was socially distanced, even saying hello to another dog walker, I had some human connection. Also, having Clyde around the house got me through it. I would talk to him ndash although hersquos a dog, hersquos another being and I was able to talk to him and interact with him all the time. Hersquos either lying beside me at my feet or on the bed. And he loves cuddles.Fiona MacDonald, the founder of the charity that matched Ali and Clyde, says she has seen similar effects with many other people during lockdown.ldquoDogs are more important now than ever, she says. ldquoIn the current climate when wersquore being asked to stay at home and are feeling isolated, theyrsquore helping people leave the house, stay active and prevent them from feeling alone. The unwavering companionship of a dog can do amazing things for people ndash they literally save peoplersquos lives.However, itrsquos not all positive. For a start, Bravehound, like other charities, is facing a shortfall in funding because of the financial impact of coronavirus and is calling on people to sponsor puppies. There are also concerns about the effect lockdown may have on pets and other animals: the Dogs Trust, for example, says it has seen an increase in the number of animals being abandoned.Lockdown seems to be having two effects. First, itrsquos led to an increase in the number wanting to adopt or take on a pet ndash Google searches for ldquobuy a puppy were up more than % during lockdown ndash which in principle is a good thing. But therersquos also a worry that the easing of lockdown will bring up a new reality and problems for some owners and that there will be an increase in the number of dogs being abandoned or handed into places such as the Dog Trust.Susan Tonner, the manager of the Dog Trustrsquos centre in West Calder, has said one of the reasons people may be struggling to cope with their pet during lockdown is the financial and economic stress that the crisis has caused, but it can also be the change in circumstances: suddenly, the change in routine causes behavioural changes in the dog and the owner is unable to cope.Mike Flynn, the Scottish SPCA chief superintendent, tells me the effect of the public health crisis on pets is a concern, but that he remains hopeful. ldquoWe believe Scotland is a nation of animal lovers, he says, ldquoand wersquore hopeful that we wonrsquot see an upsurge in pets coming into our rescue and rehoming centres that were purchased or adopted during lockdown.ldquoHowever, wersquod urge anyone thinking about taking on an animal to remember that they are a long-term commitment. Once the restrictions end, people willto work, school and socialising as normal and could find that an animal may not fit into their le as easily as before. We appreciate these are uncertain times for many people but abandoning an animal is never acceptable under any circumstances.Another potential problem is that an increased demand for pets may also lead to potential owners buying from unscrupulous owners and breeders. The Dogs Trust, Cats Protection and other organisations and public figures including Paul OrsquoGrady, recently published an open letter calling on the public to#research animal breeders and sellers thoroughly#online before buying a pet.Christine Middlemiss, the UK Governmentrsquos Chief Veterinary Officer, says prospective owners needed to beware of the kind of seller who breeds animals purely for profit and has zero concern for their welfare.ldquoThe devastating consequences include crippling vet bills and, in the worst cases, animals#having to be put down, said Ms Middlemiss. ldquoItrsquos vitally#important#that people not only research the breed of animal they want but also the person selling it to them.And even for those animals who do not get sick or who are not abandoned, the end of lockdown could be tricky. For months now, many dogs have had their owners around the house day in, day out, which is the way dogs like it . But now that the restrictions are being eased, people are starting to go out more and some are going back into the office, and that can cause extra stress for dogs.Ben Evans, a dog trainer and advisor to Burns Pet Nutrition, says owners should take action now to acclimatise their dogs to the new reality and prevent them from developing separation anxiety or behavioural problems.ldquoOwners need to normalise the fact that being alone is not a big deal by doing plenty of it in short bursts, he says. ldquoStart off with just - seconds, gradually building this up to minutes and eventually a couple of hours. Leaving and ing should be relatively uneventful as animated greetings or goodbyes can build up anticipation or anxiety.ldquoItrsquos also important to desensitise dogs to any signs that indicate you are about to leave. Try picking up and putting down car keys throughout the day, opening and closing doors without leaving, picking up and moving shoes and bags, or putting on a coat and walking around with it before removing it. All these steps will help to prevent these possible triggers from causing anxiety.Fortunately, Clyde isnrsquot one of the dogs whorsquos going to be facing a separation from his owner and Ali says shersquos feeling positive about the prospect of coming out of lockdown. One of the things both owner and dog have missed during the period of the restrictions is a swim: both of them used to be regulars at a hydrotherapy pool ndash it helped to ease Alirsquos physical pain and Clyde loved it too ndash and she hopes that they will be able to get back to the pool soon.Ali is also getting out on longer and longer walks with Clyde. ldquoI donrsquot necessarily enjoy walking because of the pain, she says ndash she sometimes uses a stick and sometimes has to use a wheelchair. ldquoYou donrsquot go walking on your own when yoursquore in pain but Irsquoll put it up with it more because he needs the walk and he distracts me from the pain. Clyde is one of my coping mechanisms. Even stroking him or cuddling him is a distraction. It releases all the happy chemicals and lowers my heart rate and blood pressure.For Ali, the fact that Clyde has helped make lockdown bearable ndash as well as everything  he does for her ndash has made her appreciate him even more. As she talks, Clyde is still lying fast asleep at her feet. Ali says her relationship with him is deeper than itrsquos ever been. He makes her happy. He has eased the pain. He saved her le.To find out more about Bravehound and sponsor a puppy, visit bravehound.

Exams having been cancelled, thanks to the pandemic, Scottish school teachers were given the delicate task of imagining what their charges might have achieved had the tests taken place. Teachers in some of the most deprived areas gave what could only be called optimistic estimates of their students likely attainment in the Highers ndash about % higher than in previous years.The Scottish Qualications Authority, SQA, which is supposed to ensure fair play in assessment, took one look at this unprecedented grade inflation and said: Youre not on. Schools were estimating examination success wildly out of step with their own recent performance.:Iain Macwhirter: Heres how a New Union could keep us living apart togetherSo the SQA moderators took an axe to the results to make them look a bit more credible. The results in the poorer postcodes went down by %, which still left grades inflated over previous years. In the more affluent schools, where estimated grades were around % above par, they adjusted scores by %.Thats an oversimplication, but in a sense it doesnt matter. What it looked like was the SQA brutally crushing the hopes and dreams of poor students while only marginally reducing the scores of pupils in the posher colleges.Assessment by algorithm is always going to be a poor fit with reality. So, Shaun did well in his prelims, but he might have coasted the rest of the year whereas Siobhan got such a shock that she worked her derriere off for the next six months. Why are they both being cut down I mean, arent teachers themselves the best judge of performance  Why didnt the SQA just suck it up, accept that this was an exceptional year and that Covid  engendered a study revolution in less advantaged neighbourhoods.:Iain Macwhirter: Sturgeon should bring Salmond in from the cold ndash hersquos just too dangerousThats what the educational experts on Twitter argued, including the outspoken educational pundit, James McEnany. They complained that most of the , pupils who had their futures stolen were from working class neighbourhoods and that this confirmed education is biased to the rich.The consultant, Sir Keir Bloomer, who helped devise the Curriculum for Excellence, disagreed insisting that the adjustment process was ldquojustied and necessary. And the First Minister agreed. She said bluntly that the estimates submitted by teachers were simply ldquonot credible. Accepting grade inflation on that scale would bring the entire standardised assessment into disrepute.This was Nicola Sturgeon trying to be wise before the event. Sure, the estimates were doing wonders for the attainment gap. She couldve gone into the May Holyrood elections saying that she had delivered the greatest narrowing of the educational class gap in history. But the First Minister is much too canny.Students who narrowly failed last year would be furious for a start. The very people now berating her for crushing the hopes and dreams of the less well off would be attacking her for undermining the credibility of Scottish education. Ms Sturgeon would have been accused of closing the attainment gap by fraud.The More or Less programme on BBC Radio would be calling it the most shocking misuse of statistics since the UK government claimed that it was conducting , Covid  tests a day, when all it was doing was sending out kits.But the ldquoclassist accusations wont go away. A hundred or so young people gathered in George Square holding banners saying ldquoTrust our Teachers and ldquoI am not my postcode. Sturgeon is being called the ldquograde snatcher, echoing the claim that Mrs Thatcher was the ldquomilk snatcher.Part of the problem is that the SQA seems incapable of giving a coherent and convincing explanation of its methodology. Tens of thousands of appeals are expected against what parents regard as an arbitrary and unfair process that took no account of real pupil attainment.The Deputy First Minister, John Swinney, is in for a torrid time. Indeed, he has been having a torrid time for as long as I can remember. There has been persistent grumbling about the Curriculum for Excellence which seems anything but. The PISA international performance scores have gone south. Standardised testing of primary one children led to accusations of child abuse. Progress on the attainment gap has been glacially slow.Mr Swinney held out against the teachers % pay demand just long enough for teachers to threaten a strike, at which point he gave in and awarded them an eye-popping .% over three years. Nice work.Last month, parents across Scotland revolted at pandemic plans to give children as little as one day a week of ldquoblended learning. That forced an embarrassing U-turn as Mr Swinney promised full-time, full-fat education from this month onwards.:Iain Macwhirter: Does Nicola Sturgeon still want independence  Some in the SNP arent so sureBut the Educational Institute for Scotland says that only a fth of their members are confident itrsquos safe to reopen the schools. Its still not clear what is going to happen this week. Will teachers turn up  Will parents send their children We appear to be seeing,not the second wave of Covid, then the long tail of the first wave. Lockdown is in the air again. Its conceivable that children couldto school just long enough to exchange infections before being sent home again.Its not Mr Swinneys fault of course. This is a pandemic after all. Teachers unions have the Scottish Government over a barrel ndash and they know it. Parents are incensed as only parents can be when they feel their offspring are being treated unfairly.But it might be time to put poor John Swinney out of his misery. The Deputy First Minister has been a sterling defender of the First Minister, the ultimate safe pair of hands. But those hands arent looking so safe any more. He is beginning to look like a work horse that has taken more beating than it can stand.A fresh face,such a thing exists in the  year old Scottish Government, in charge of the education brief might help get the government over this hurdle. In the last SQA exams crisis in  the then Labour education minister, Sam Galbraith, had to step down after being mauled by, er, one Nicola Sturgeon.The SNP is streets ahead in the polls and that is unlikely to change any time soon, given the dire state of the opposition parties in Scotland. But there are a lot more parents in Scotland than there are teachers. It would only take a few thousand parental votes to go astray in May to deprive Nicola Sturgeon of that absolute majority she needs for an independence referendum.This is a full scale crisis, possibly Nicola Sturgeons worst yet. Young people are up in arms. The teaching profession is in a state of perennial discontent. The very credibility of standardised assessment may be in doubt. She will have to get a grip or face an unmoderated ldquofail in May.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Opponents fear that some sections of the original structure could disappear and be lost.Controversy surrounds the plan which is supported by central government in France, but opposed by the Mayorrsquos office.If the re-development takes place, it will be hoped to have the work completed in time for the  Olympics.When the Paisley-based architectural reclamation company got wind of the scheme, they wrote to the Gare du Nordrsquos operations director to declare an interest in relocating any of the old ironwork, back to Scotland.ldquoWe have simply asked for our details to be kept on file so that we can at least make attempts to bring anything of importance that might become available back to the city where it was produced, said Glasgow Salvage partner Scott.ldquoThese spectacular pillars and roof supports are extraordinarily beautul andany of it is threatened with demolition or is scheduled to be scrapped, we want to be in with a shout, and have provided a strong declaration of interest to that effect.ldquoWhen any items as fine as this become available, they really should be brought back to Glasgow, as it is such an important part of the cityrsquos proud engineering heritage.ldquoEvenwe just got a chance to bring a few pieces back to the city where they were made, that would be terric.Paris city hall has pledged to fight a central government commitment to the redevelopment of Gare du Nord, Europersquos busiest railway station. Opponents have labelled the proposal a potential urban disaster.Deputy Mayor Emmanuel Greacutegoire, responsible for overseeing all urban development, has promised to look at all political and legal options to stop the scheme in its tracks.He has described the current plans as ldquoabsurd.Central government created the backlash when plans were unveiled to in effect triple the footprint with anambitious plan to create commercial space and increase the area available to rail travellers, with , square metres for shopping, offices and leisure facilities and around , square metres more allocate d to the arrivals and departures halls.The railway station is currently used by around , passengers each day. It is predicted that number could rise to , by .A government statement recently issued maintained that the revamped complex should be ldquoa new setting for urban le, combining commerce, sport, culture and work, and that development should be underway ldquoas soon as possible.The proposed timetable would aim to bring the project to completion for the  Rugby World Cup and  Olympics and Paralympics.ldquoWe are not opposed to the stationrsquos renovation, which is necessary, Greacutegoire said, ldquobut the Gare du Nord should be a railway station before all , not a shopping centre first.In a recent open letter to Le Monde, the award-winning French architect Jean Nouvel, together with historians and town planners, claimed the renovation plan to create a glass structure with tens of thousands of square metres of shops, walkways, split-levels and escalators was ill thought out and would deform the historic structure.ldquoThis project is unacceptable and we demand a rethink from floor to rafters, they said, adding that it would be ldquoindecent to send travellers up and down ldquoa mess of walkways, lts and escalators, forcing them past shops to reach their s.They said that the vast areas of the ldquobeautul train hall would be ldquodenatured and warned that creating a giant shopping centre would pose a risk of killing off the commercial activities of smaller local traders.Speaking from their yard in Paisley, Stuart Haughey said it had been the warning about structural changes to the original layout that had first alerted them to the possibility of some of the old ironwork detail becoming potentially surplus and available.ldquoAs others have said, we too feel it would be vandalism to remove any of the original structural skeleton of the building which is such an integral part of its design and charm, but we would primarily be interested in saving any important architectural pieces for future generations to be able to see the accomplishments of the past.ldquoClearly, the cost of transportation back to Scotland will be a major consideration. ldquoThese are truly massive pieces, he said.ldquoThere are several haulage firms sending goods from here to Paris on a weekly basis, and always looking for aload. Irsquom sure something could be worked out.ldquo...and, then, of course, therersquos the rail network!ldquoMaybe we could try to organise some kind of special freight deal with SNCF and Eurostar and hope they are familiar with our historical links in the past through the Auld Alliance.In the letter which was sent off this week, the brothers state: ldquoWe specialise in reclamation of quality architectural salvage and would be very interested in bringing any artefacts back to the city in which they were so well made all those years ago.ldquoWhile appreciating that discussions on design and layout of the refurbished railway station and proposed shopping mall are at an early stage, we simply ask that you retain our contact details so that, in the event of any of the old structure being disposed of as part of these plans, we would at least be given the opportunity to make efforts to have those relocated to Glasgow, possibly as a combined effort with others involved, and in consultation first with Glasgow City Council."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11672294.jpg?type=article-full","title":"calum-murray-pathway-sustainable-future-clear","story":"ldquoWe are seeing real interest, particularly from businesses who have already done a good deal to lower their carbon footprint and who now want to find meaningful ways of offsetting the rest of their carbon output, he says.Murray points out that things have moved on hugely from Scotlandrsquos initial mass reforestation efforts in the mid-s to s. Those efforts were driven almost solely with an eye to commercial s and led to a general perception that these woods were dark, forbidding deserts as far as wildle and flora were concerned.For some years now new forest plantings by Tilhill Forestry and other forestry companies have focused on creating woodlands that encourage bioersity as well as providing commercial s that consistently outperform global stock markets.ldquoToday, there is a well understood need for the planting of new forests to create a balance between commercial requirements and the need to create forests that enhance the natural environment, Murray comments.One of the benefits of companies turning to forestry as a way of offsetting their residual carbon footprint, is that it makes money available for schemes that perhaps would not be commercially viable without additional financial support.ldquoThere are some great government grants for tree planting, but we often find customers struggling with potential projects in marginal land that just fall short of being commercially viable. This is where the investment from carbon-offsetting schemes can lt the whole project, leading to the planting of many hectares of forests that otherwise would not happened, he comments.Tilhill and other established forestry companies act as brokers to connect companies with a requirement for carbon offsetting, with landlords who have schemes that could be viable, given additional sources of investment.As Murray notes, commercial forestry does not just lock up carbon for the forty years or so that the trees are maturing. When the wood is turned into building timber, the carbon in the timber continues to be locked away for many decades thereafter.ldquoThe whole forestry industry has learned the lessons from the mistakes of the past. I walk through commercial woodlands every day and they are alive with deer and a wide iety of birdle, as well as a range of wild flowers.Many commercial forestry projects these days also include a iety of deciduous tree plantings in order to create a balance. When it comes to locking up carbon, Murray points out that it doesnrsquot matter whether the driving idea behind the creation of the forest is commercial, or a desire to restore some of Scotlandrsquos indigenous woodland. Both take carbon out of the atmosphere. However, fast growing commercial woodlands comprised largely of Sitka Spruce will lock up more carbon faster than deciduous woodlands, which mature at a much slower rate.ldquoIt is dficult to overstate the importance of commercial forestry to Scotlandrsquos rural communities.ldquoIt brings much needed jobs to rural areas at all phases in the le of a forest, from the initial planting, through the letime maintenance of the forest and in the harvesting, he says.Murray adds that as well as the wider societal and environmental values that woodland brings, through the positive impact it has on carbon sequestration, reforestation also improves an arearsquos water quality and helps with both flood mitigation and bioersity.ldquoWe are seeing a real uptick in investors who are attracted both by the idea that investing in forests helps to preserve the environment for their children and grandchildren, and by the recognition that s from forestry tend not to be correlated with the ups and downs in the mainstream equities and bonds markets, he says.The combined appeal of a goodon their investment along with the idea that they are helping to combat climate change, is stoking investor interest in the sector. ldquoForestry particularly favours those seeking long term capital gains and increasingly it will favour lsquoheritage investorsrsquo, those for whom ecological and climate change mitigation concerns rate as high or higher than concerns over the scale of monetary s, he notes.One of the positive stories over the past year was that Scotland finally managed to achieve the Scottish Governmentrsquos planting targets. ldquoThe Scottish Government has set an annual planting target of , hectares of new forest. Last year we actually achieved in excess of , hectares of new plantings, Murray says.The governmentrsquos target is set to rise to , hectares a year by . However, Murray points out that to meet the Scottish Governmentrsquos plans to go carbon neutral by , we should already be planting , hectares a year across the UK. England, which is still doing very little new planting, needs to take a leaf out of Scotlandrsquos book and get busy planting, he says.Tilhill Forestry is currently running a project called ldquo#PlantTreesAplentyIn. This is a campaign launched by Tilhill to encourage farmers, landowners and companies to plant trees on their unproductive land.As Murray explains, as part of this campaign Tilhill can help landowners and farmers decide what trees to plant and where to plant them. Todayrsquos new woodlands offer opportunities for wildle, recreation and will play a part in mitigating climate change.Planting a well-planned woodland on land that is marginal for agricultural use can help to provide shelter for cattle and sheep, as well as providing the farmer with a decent pension on retirement.This article appeared in The Heralds Earth Overshoot Day series, under the topic of Nature and how we boost our ecosystems.For more information on the#PlantTreesAplentyIn please visitwww.tilhillTo participate in The Heralds Earth Overshoot Day coverage on the nd August please contact Stephen McTaggart on  or by email atstephen.mctaggart@heraldandtimes"},{"url":null,"title":"remarkable-ancient-coin-hoard-found-school-grounds","story":"But a famous Scottish boarding school, which has educated three generations of the Monarchy, has discovered it has even longer Royal links than it believed.For coins dating back to the th Century along with bullets, Victorian plant labels and even a time capsule have been discovered by metal detectorists at Gordonstoun School.The finds chronicle the fascinating history of Gordonstoun, which was once a grand estate owned by Scottish nobility before it was converted into one of the worldrsquos most famous boarding schools.The items were found by Lee Marchi and John Campbell who work in maintenance and IT services at the school and are keen metal detectorists in their spare time.Mr Marchi said:ldquoWe have a lot better lsquofind ratersquo than you would normally have because nobody has ever detected here before. The second time we went out together we found a solid silver Edward I coin dating from  ndash . This might date back to the time when there was a market close to the old Ogstoun Cross.Mr Campbell said:ldquoThe very first time we went out detecting together we found a time capsule outside St Michaelrsquos Kirk which sits in the grounds of the school. ldquoIt was only thirteen years old but nobody knew it was there: it must have been buried by a couple of former students. That was just in our lunch-hour during the tattieholidays. We realised there was a lot waiting to be found.Since then the two friends have found a coin from Charles II reign in the rsquos, a George III shilling from , a florin from  as well as a throwing disc which could date from the time when Prince Philip attended the school. Mr Campbell described the moment they unearthed the old throwing disc, which dates back to possibly the s.ldquoWe were in front of the main school building and got a hit. We dug down to the stone foundations of the original drive but the target was below that. ldquoOur hole was getting bigger and bigger until we spotted a substantial brass ring. At first, we were worried in case it was a grenade or a bomb but then we realised it was the brass edge of a vintage throwing disc. These had a brass surround and centre with wood in the middle and was probably thrown by a pupil in the rsquos or rsquos. What we donrsquot know is how it ended up under a layer of heavy stones.The pair have also found bullets and shell casings on the North Lawn ndash an area which would have been used as a sports field by both Prince Philip and Prince Charles when they attended the school. These munitions date from WW when the school was requisitioned for use as barracks by the army. The pair have also found a silver George V sixpence from .ldquoThat was only an inch and a half under the surface, said Mr Campbell. ldquoIt would have been a devastating amount to lose for the person who dropped it.The archaeology under the ground at Gordonstoun is so rich because it has been protected by high levels of security around the school.ldquoEven though wersquore employees, we had to seek permission from the bursar before we could start detecting, said Mr Marchi. ldquoShe said that was fine as long as we found something valuable enough to pay for a new school master plan! All our finds are of a very low value so far but we love finding things that tell a story.The schoolrsquos archivist is now helping the pair by sending them historic pictures of the grounds and gardens which they use to identy new hotspots to try but, despite the excitement of it all, it has to take second place to the day job.ldquoThe only problem is that I get nothing done when I go to see the archivist because I get so absorbed in the old maps, so Irsquom trying to stay away! said Mr Marchi.The Principal of Gordonstoun, Lisa Kerr said:ldquoGordonstoun has a fascinating history and itrsquos so interesting to see what has lain undisturbed just under the surface of the ground for centuries.

Before Jackson Carlaw resigned  ldquoNo, no, no, after.Pushed on whether it had been a carve up, she said: ldquoIrsquom terribly sorry, I donrsquot know what  to say apart from lsquoJackson Carlaw resigned, Douglas has put his hat into the ring, I think hersquos the best person for the job, Irsquom backing him and doing all I can to help.But even a masterful non-denial denial is never as good as the truth.Mr Ross has the same improbable chronology on his campaign website.ldquoMy first act on Thursday evening after Jackson Carlaw honourably announced his resignation was to speak to Ruth Davidson and ask her to support me in my plans.His first act  For such a le-changing decision, you would think hersquod talk to his family first, especially as the father of a one-year-old.Although therersquos also that Freudian slip at the end about ldquomy plans, which suggests his leadership bid wasnrsquot exactly spontaneous.Mr Ross didnrsquot clary things yesterday, when he was asked what he and Ms Davidson had discussed.It was, he said, a ldquoprivate meeting.The iron secrecy seems a bit odd for a social visit, so presumably weightier matters were indeed on the agenda.ldquoWhat I have said is that I asked Ruth, and she agreed, to lead FMQsI become leader only after Jackson resigned, he said, which again leaves a lot unanswered.Ms Davidson also has form on stitch-ups. When she ran for Scottish Tory leader in  it was a bitter affair, with her three rivals, including Mr Carlaw, complaining she was being unfairly helped by party HQ.The partyrsquos spindoctor at the time, Ramsay Jones, who was supposed to be neutral in the race, was found to have been at her house on the night of a campaign meeting. She denied hersquod been part of it, but later admitted the pair ldquoprobably did get on to the campaign at some point. Mr Jones was suspended, and left to work in Downing Street. Hersquos now a CBE.Ms Davidsonrsquos campaign manager was the MP John Lamont, who was also Mr Rossrsquos campaign manager.Hersquos a fast worker. Five Douglas Ross for Leader websites were registered within an hour of Mr Carlaw announcing his departure. Suspicious or just devilishly efficient In fact, there is a smoking gun. Well, some smoking metadata. Mr Rossrsquos campaign website carries a lsquoDouglas Ross for Leaderrsquo logo, and embedded in that logo, for those who know how to find it, is an electronic timestamp which shows it was created just before Mr Carlawrsquos resignation statement. Now that is uncommonly fast work.Well, so what, you may think. Politicians will be politicians.But other Holyrood stories this week showed why the Ross-Davidson flannel could have wider signicance.The inquiry into the Alex Salmond affair will be one of the biggest things on Ms Davidsonrsquos plate when she s to FMQs. It will be her job to prosecute the case for the Tories and wound Ms Sturgeon and the SNP ahead of the election.This week, we learned the FM withheld details of a relevant meeting about Mr Salmond from MSPs last year, and the Scottish Government also withheld reams of evidence from the inquiry on legal grounds.The Scottish Tories are now demanding full transparency.It will not be easy for Ms Davidson.Always remember that Ms Sturgeon was a lawyer before Holyrood.Her words are precisely chosen.I doubt very much that she directly misled MSPs with a bald lie.However it does look asMSPs have been misled by omission, with the First Minister telling them bits of the truth, but not the whole truth, and then letting a  impression take hold and doing nothing to correct it.But anyone planning to attack her on transparency grounds, with these high stakes, needs to be spotless, the very model of transparency.Questions over Ms Davidson and Mr Rossrsquos candour, and the series of extreme coincidences leading up to Mr Carlawrsquos departure, offer Ms Sturgeon a glimpse of a way out.lsquoWhy should I take lectures from this humbug with her record  Who is she to judge me rsquo she may say.Besides insulting our intelligence, Ms Davidson has already hamstrung herself in the contest to come."},{"url":null,"title":"pictures-fairytale-home-sale-stirling-1-5m","story":"The arts and crafts style house sits on three acres of land, and is within walking distance of the heart of Bridge of Allan and Stirling University.With their leaded windows, timber beams and intricate fireplaces, arts and crafts houses such as this one look like they would belong in a fairytale kingdom ndash but arts and crafts houses are a distinctive part of Scotlandrsquos architectural landscape thanks to architects like Charles Rennie Mackintosh and William Leiper.They are rare th-century properties with romantic decorations borrowed from medieval and folk traditions, and William Morrisrsquos idea to ldquohave nothing in your house that you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautul was taken into the heartof William Leiper.Leiper, whose designs include the Templeton Carpet Factory at Glasgow Green, Partick Burgh Hall, Dowanhill Church and the Banqueting Hall of Glasgow City Chambers, was one of Scotlandrsquos finest architects in the late th century.:Fight the litter menace and help keep Scotland stunningAnd erected in , Uplandswas one of his last residential projects.The remaining traditional features of this -bedroomed property include Inglenook fireplaces, leaded windows with exposed stone-mullioned walls, an impressive stone archway at the entrance, cathedral doors, and wooden beams adorning the ceilings throughout the property.:Recognising the depth of female artistic talentAlong with other modern touches, previous owners have also built a home cinema, wine cellar and three-car garage which will be awaiting eventual buyers.You can find out more about the property up for sale on the Halliday Homes website."},{"url":null,"title":"conversation-new-zealand-eliminated-covid-19","story":"On Sunday, New Zealand marked  days without community transmission of COVID-.From the first known case imported into New Zealand on February  to the last case of community transmission detected on May , elimination took  days.New Zealand relied on three types of measures to get rid of the virus:Collectively, these measures have achieved low case numbers and deaths compared with high-income countries in Europe and North America that pursued a suppression strategy.New Zealand is one of a small number of jurisdictions ndash including mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Vietnam, Mongolia, Australia and Fiji ndash pursuing COVID- containment or elimination. Most have had new outbreaks. The exceptions are Taiwan, Mongolia, Fiji and New Zealand.Australia adopted very similar responses to the pandemic and it is important to note that most states and territories are in the same position as New Zealand. But Victoria and, to a lesser extent, New South Wales are seeing a signicant resurgence.The key dference is that New Zealand committed relatively early to a clearly articulated elimination strategy and pursued it aggressively. An intense lockdown proved highly effective at rapidly extinguishing the virus.This dference can be seen graphically in this stringency index published by Oxford Universityrsquos Our World in Data.There are key lessons from New Zealandrsquos COVID- experience.Total all-cause deaths also dropped during the lockdown. This observation suggests it did not have severe negative effects on health, although it will almost certainly have some negative long-term effects.We have gained a much better understanding of COVID- over the past eight months. Without effective control measures, it is likely to continue to spread globally for many months to years, ultimately infecting billions and killing millions. The proportion of infected people who die appears to be slightly below %.This infection also causes serious long-term consequences for some survivors. The largest uncertainties involve immunity to this virus, whether it can develop from exposure to infection or vaccines, andit is long-lasting. The potential for treatment with antivirals and other therapeutics is also still uncertain.This knowledge reinforces the huge benefits of sustaining elimination. We know thatNew Zealand were to experience widespread COVID- transmission, the impact on M#ori and Pasika populations could be catastrophic.We have previously described critical measures to get us through this period, including the use of fabric face masks, improving contact tracing with suitable digital tools, applying a science-based approach to border management, and the need for a dedicated national public health agency.Maintaining elimination depends on adopting a highly strategic approach to risk management. This approach involves choosing an optimal mix of interventions and using resources in the most efficient way to keep the risk of COVID- outbreaks at a consistently low level. Several measures can contribute to this goal over the next few months, while also allowing incremental increases in international travel:New Zealand cannot change the reality of the global COVID- pandemic. But it can leverage possible benefits.We should conduct an official inquiry into the COVID- response so we learn everything we possibly can to improve our response capacity for future events.We also need to establish a specialised national public health agency to manage serious threats to public health and provide critical mass to advance public health generally. Such an agency appears to have been a key factor in the success of Taiwan, which avoided a costly lockdown entirely.Business as usual should not be an option for the recovery phase.

Nationalists usually argue that Scotland would be better off economically and socially because of independence, but it actually doesnrsquot matter because independence is their top priority. Their thinking is: the economy and equality are important, but not as important as independence.This is the way, to be honest, that a lot of nationalists think, but they usually keep quiet about it because they know left-leaning voters would not be impressed. Lots of voters actually put equality as their top priority rather than the constitution and some of them voted Yes in  because they thought independence would improve equality and some voted No because they worried it would make inequality worse ndash I talked to lots of voters who think along these lines when I was on the ground with the Yes campaign in . Theyrsquore the opposite of nationalists: equality comes first, not independence. For nationalists, itrsquos the other way round.It is this kind of context that makes Mr Smithrsquos email so interesting, and embarrassing. What he said was that changes were needed to the SNPrsquos national executive committee because so much of the partys oxygen was taken up, in his words, by peripheral issues like reform of the law on gender. The BAME, womenrsquos and disabled conveners and others should lose their places on the NEC, he said, and become part of a separate forum instead. ldquoEqualities are close to my heart, said Mr Smith, ldquobut not as close as independence.:Nicola Sturgeon admits party disputes pose risk to SNP successIt is that last phrase thatrsquos the killer and itrsquos a bit unpleasant to see it written down in such stark terms ndash unpleasant but not surprising. In , Nicola Sturgeon wrote a piece for The Sunday Herald in which she said the case for self-government transcended the issues of Brexit, of oil, of national wealth and balance sheets, and of passing political fads and trends. The comment may have been less nakedly honest than Mr Smithrsquos, but it amounts to the same thing: independence matters more than everything , even ndash and this is the extraordinary bit ndash national wealth.But letrsquos not over-egg the comparison between Ms Sturgeon and Mr Smith because therersquos a big dference between them and it demonstrates why the First Minister is doing so well during the pandemic. Scottish independence transcends every other issue for her ndash she said so in The Sunday Herald ndash but as First Minister she also knows that the public health problem has to be the priority. In times of crisis, she said at the start of all this, the issues that ide us seem less important.This approach by the First Minister has not gone down well with some supporters of independence ndash the ones that take the ldquoIndependence First principle literally, or want new pro-Yes parties, or are aching for theof Alex Salmond, like Aslan from Over-The-Sea. We also shouldnrsquot be too lenient on the First Minister ndash pupils and parents caught up in the SQA debacle, for example, might disagree that she has put independence to one side to concentrate on domestic matters.However, for another constituency of voters, Ms Sturgeonrsquos approach is playing very effectively and probably explains why her party, and its cause, is doing well in the polls. Scotlandrsquos first SNP government, from , knew it was more important to look responsible than pick fights with London and it was relaxed about passing motions which allowed Westminster to enact laws on which there was common ground and it played well with voters. The same is happening now: Ms Sturgeon knows itrsquos important to look responsible in a time of crisis and itrsquos playing well with voters.The fact that the First Minister has handled the crisis in this way reflects well on her the way in which shersquos getting it right is also demonstrated by the way in which Alyn Smith got it wrong in his email. Mr Smith said equality was close to his heart but not as close as independence whereas the First Minister has backed off on the pronouncements about independence because she knows it would sound wrong during the coronavirus crisis.All of this has led the First Minister to a pretty clear interpretation of whatrsquos been happening for her party, as well as a strategy for the future. ldquoRight now, she says, ldquothe majority of the people in the country we serve are worried about their health and theyre worried about their ability to pay their bills. Opinion polls would suggest they massively trust the SNP to lead them through that crisis. If they ever thought the SNP was turning away from that priority and focusing on its own agendas and engaging in in-fighting Im sure they would pass a verdict on that.\":Lord McConnell in stark SQA warning to Nicola Sturgeon and John SwinneyI think itrsquos hard to disagree with that analysis, but it creates two problems for Ms Sturgeon. First, there are many in her party who disagree with her and think the focus should always be on the agenda of independence first and the disquiet is likely to get louder the longer the First Minister ldquofocuses on what matters to people rather than independence.However, the second problem is potentially more serious. The dissenters in her party ndash troublesome as they are ndash will ultimately, always, support independence, whereas the voters impressed by the First Ministerrsquos handling of coronavirus may be more fickle. At the height of a crisis, theyrsquove liked the First Ministerrsquos tactics and style, but as coronavirus drops down the agenda and independence s to the top of it, they may not be quite so happy. The First Minister and leader of the campaign for independence has been guided by her head rather than her heart.

There is still a lot of work to be done to assess the artefacts and understand why they were deposited.ldquoWe could not have achieved this without the responsible actions of the finder or the support of the landowners.ldquoThe finder was quick to action when they realised that they had found an in-situ hoard, which resulted in the Treasure Trove Unit and National Museums Scotland being on site within days of discovery.Queenrsquos and Lord Treasurerrsquos Remembrancer , David Harvie, said: ldquoThis Bronze Age hoard is highly signicant and promises to give us a new insight into Scotlandrsquos history.\""},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"August ,  at : amIn day two of our Ready, Set, Show! online horse competition, we have a match-up between two magnicent Clydesdales, which won at the County Show ten years apart.

The village of Dounby is only slightly older.The story begins with Hosen Market, which was held three times a year at Geoth, north-east of the present village. According to my grandmother, Johina Leith, nee Kirkness, who was born at nearby Newhouse in , and wrote some notes on Dounby, the market began at Hosen in Birsay but drted across the parish boundary to Magz o’Geoth’s ale-house.Grandma was told that, after Magz gave up her ale-house, JosephMackay, who had built the Smithfield Inn, was responsible for the market’s next move.“It would be good for business to have the market near the ale house, so Josie marshalled public opinion into taking up a public subscription to buy a stance nearby with proper title deeds. According to George Wylie, in his book, Showyard on the Heather, , the subscription to buy the land was raised in . But Josie and the market had arrived on that spot almost simultaneously, four years earlier.The West Mainland Agricultural Society was formed in . Two years later, they advertised a Cattle Tryst at Dounby, “for the dispersal of the Best Fat and Grazing Stock of the district.New roads and steamships meant that farmers could export and Dounby Farm, between the main Harray and Birsay road and the new junction road through Sandwick, was the obvious place to sell animals.  is also the year that Josie bought land at the junction from Magnus Smith, owner of Dounby Farm, and built his inn. He married Margaret Davie from Firth in  and by the following year, according to the Orcadian, inn and market were thriving.“The market stance at Dounby, it is believed, is the best in the mainland… It is central and easy of access from all quarters, being held at the intersection of two roads. There is a good and commodious inn on the ground, conducted in a superior manner by Mr and Mrs Mackay, where a iety of refreshments can be had and a rest enjoyed. Sometime in the s, Josie built the larger Smithfield, which held the inn, the Post Office and one or two other businesses over the years. Grandma thought that it was probably the Post Office who fixed the name of Dounby Farm onto the village. It was certainly settled by , when the Dounby Public School opened.The first Dounby Show was held on a field loaned by William Hourie, tenant of Dounby Farm and was a great success. There were over  entries and more than  spectators. I was amazed to find that my g-g-grandfather, Robert Leask of Coldomo, Stenness was one of the prize-winners. It must have been quite an operation to get the animals to the Show then. Grandma had fond memories of the days before cattle trucks.“At one time it was interesting to watch the animals come up from Dounby, past the corner and then turn for Harray, Birsay or Evie, each with their tickets on. At the dinner in the Smithfield Hotel on the evening of the first Show, it was suggested that there should be a Flower and Produce Show and it was held in the Dounby School just six weeks later. After that first year, the two shows were on the same day and the crowds flocked to Dounby.The stock show was held on Dounby Farm until the Society bought five acres of uncultivated land from James Flett of Curcabreck in  and built a wall around it.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

rate of infection, a leading expert has said.Professor Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and a member of the Governmentrsquos Sage scientic advisory group, told BBC Radio rsquos Today programme on Monday that ldquoreopening schools is one of the least risky things we can do.His comments were echoed by Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, who said there was little evidence of transmission in schools.However, teachers, scientists, opposition politicians and the childrenrsquos commissioner for England Anne Longfield have all called for improvements to testing before pupils .Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said it is the ldquonational priority to get children back in class in England next month, but he has been warned by scientic advisers that ldquotrade-offs may be necessary to keep transmission down.Ms Longfield welcomed Mr Johnsonrsquos commitment to make children the priority after previously accusing ministers of treating them as ldquoan afterthought.But she said regular testing of pupils and teachers, perhaps as frequently as weekly, could be needed eventhey do not exhibit symptoms to keep transmission rates down. vw,vw,px, px\"Childrenrsquos commissioner for England Anne Longfield Prof Viner said that while children can and do transmit this virus they are ldquovery minor players in the transmission overall.He added: ldquoWe cannot be in a risk-free society and this is about the risk balance.ldquoWhat is the risk balance equation and I think thatrsquos separate for children and young people themselves.ldquoItrsquos very clear for them the benefits and risks, the balance is for them to be back at school.ldquoFor broader society, look, I think itrsquos also clear that reopening schools is one of the least risky things we can do.ldquoAnything we do that reopens society will add a small or a larger amount to the overall population reproductive number and for schools we believe that itrsquos a relatively minor player, it would add little to the overall population R.In a statement Mr Williamson said the Government will continue to be guided by the ldquobest scientic and medical advice.He added: ldquoThe education and care of our children is a national priority. vw,vw,px, px\"Daily confirmed cases of Covid- in the UK ldquoWe have always been and will continue to be guided by the best scientic and medical advice.ldquoThe latest research which is expected to be published later this year ndash one of the largest studies on the coronavirus in schools in the world ndash makes it clear there is little evidence that the virus is transmitted at school.But Greater Manchesterrsquos Mayor Andy Burnham said that the Test and Trace programme had to be better to give parents the confidence to send their children back to school.Speaking on BBC Breakfast on Monday he called on the Government to give more resources to local councils to trace people the national call centres were unable to reach and to also allow people to self-isolate on full pay.Mr Burnham added: ldquoSo many people are struggling to self-isolate because they just canrsquot afford it. vw,vw,px, px\"The PM wants schools to remain open wherever possible in the event of future local lockdowns ldquoWe are saying to the Government: you have got to give all employees in the country the ability to self-isolate on full pay, and itrsquos only that approach that will get Test and Trace system working properly.Mr Burnham compared the request to self-isolate to jury service and said people should be supported to do it.He added: ldquoItrsquos a simple request we are making, a bit like when you are called up to serve on a jury, when you get a request from the Government to go and be a juror.ldquoThis also is a request from the Government when yoursquore being asked to self-isolate, so letrsquos give everybody the ability to follow that request.ldquoTest and Trace will start working much betterwe do that. vw,vw,px, px\"Global Covid- cases and deaths The Association of School and College Leaders said teachers might teach students on a week-on, week-off basisthere was a resurgence of coronavirus and schools were forced to limit the number of pupils attending, with the onus on parents to home-school in the alternate weeks.The unionrsquos general secretary Geoff Barton said schools were ldquolosing patience with the Governmentrsquos demand to have all children back in school next month while framing no back-up planthis was not possible.ldquoIf you want to limit the number of children on site or travelling to and from school, a big part of that is using rotas and the obvious way to do it is lsquoweek on, week off lsquo, Mr Barton told The Daily .However, care minister Helen Whately said the Governmentrsquos priority was to have children ldquofully back at school by September.She told BBC Breakfast: ldquoSchools are safe and there are extra measures that schools are being advised by Public Health England to take for instance, to have staggered start and finish times, staggered breaks, to teach children in bubbles, and teachers can enforce, encourage hand washing, hand sanitising, so all the steps that will make schools even safer for our children to be back.Askedschools should stay open in the event of a local lockdown, she said: ldquoYes, that is the approach, so, for instance, in places like Leicester and Greater Manchester, and areas where we have local restrictions going on, absolutely schools should be still going back. It is essential that children get back into school this autumn term.The latest tensions over Covid-rsquos impact on education come as a European study suggested reopening schools was not a major danger in community transmission of the disease.The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control studied  countries, including the UK, and concluded: ldquoThere is conflicting published evidence on the impact of school closure re-opening on community transmission levels, although the evidence from contact tracing in schools, and observational data from a number of EU countries suggest that re-opening schools has not been associated with signicant increases in community transmission.copy -.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C.

Following permission from the Mid and East Antrim Council, the park has just acquired a beautully sculpted horse made entirely from horse shoes.

He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier.

Read More Coronavirus: Everything you need to know about face masks Anyone who does not cover up, without a reasonable excuse, could face a fine of up to £, with the Executive insisting that responsibility for enforcement lies with police.However, the PSNI has said officers will not lead enforcement, and will encourage people “to make the right choices”.The Police Federation , the body that represents rank-and-file officers, also expressed caution, saying officers will rely on “gentle persuasion”.PFNI chairman Mark Lindsay said while officers will be the “final bulwark” in enforcing the rules, retailers also have a “major part to play” in making the regulations “workable and effective”.Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd said yesterday that his officers will respond to any report made in relation to the enforcement of masks “appropriately and proportionately”.The PSNI had previously said the “primary responsibility” of compliance lies with businesses.Retail NI, however, insists that it is not up to traders or store staff to ensure customers comply with the rules.In a joint statement, the Stormont Executive said: ““It is expected that businesses will encourage and promote compliance — to help protect customers and staff. We are grateful to retailers for their constructive work on promoting the benefits of face coverings “We are confident most people will comply, but those who do not wear a face covering without a reasonable excuse risk being issued with a fixed penalty notice by the police.”Meanwhile, the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientic Adviser have called for the public to abide by the new regulations and wear face coverings in shops and other indoor settings.In a joint statement, Dr Michael McBride and Prof Ian Young said: “Don’t be a droplet spreader. And when you are not wearing a face covering, cover your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze.”Mr Lindsay said that while he expects most people to wear masks or face coverings, it cannot be left entirely with the PSNI to monitor compliance.“It is not solely an issue for police officers. Yes, officers will be the final bulwark in enforcement, but retailers will also have a major part to play in making this mandatory instruction workable and effective,” he said. “The vast majority of people will comply because they know the stakes couldn’t be higher. However, it is an impossibility to have a police officer outside every shop in every city and every town to ensure there is full compliance.”He said society must play its role in following the new rule.“The mandatory wearing of face masks is designed to stop the spread of this dreadful killer virus. It is for society to do all we can collectively to contain and, ultimately, subdue coronavirus,” Mr Lindsay added.“Common sense and gentle persuasion will be infinitely more preferable than anything . “We should all remember why this order is being introduced and for all our sakes. I would appeal to the general public to help statutory agencies and retailers combat the virus.” Policing Board member and Alliance MLA John Blair said it would be a “huge drain” on PSNI resourcesofficers were called to assist retailers dealing with dficult customers.“I think the best thing ispeople can try and achieve a sensible balance with this,” he said. “Thatpeople who aren’t complying are asked to comply on sight, as it were, then there may be a reason to ask the PSNI to assist. However, we have to be mindful this would be a huge drain on resources.”He urged representatives of the retail and businesses sectors to engage with the PSNI further on the matter.“All of us have been reminded recently with selective lockdowns in ious locations that the pandemic is still a serious public health threat,” he said.“And all of us, in whatever work we do, or whatever recreation we do, have a part to play in resisting the further spread of the pandemic.”Retail NI chief executive Glyn Roberts said yesterday that shoppers are inidually responsible for adhering to the rules.“We have produced posters for our members to display in their stores, which encourages shoppers to comply with this law,” he said. “Retailers and their staff are not required to police or enforce the wearing of face coverings and it will be the inidual responsibility of shoppers to comply with this law.“We hope shoppers will show understanding and respect to each other and remind them that a signicant number of people with a medical condition are exempt from wearing face covers.”Mr Todd said: “As previously stated, enforcement of face masks is not specically ‘an arrestable offence’ — however those who choose to breach the health regulations may be subject to a fine. “We will continue to support compliance with the government regulations by engaging, explaining and encouraging people to make the right choices. We will only enforce where necessary.”  Belfast   Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fc .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bf-cde-dc-e-eecd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fc .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bf-cde-dc-e-eecd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fc .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bf-cde-dc-e-eecd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fc .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bf-cde-dc-e-eecd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fc .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bf-cde-dc-e-eecd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern Ireland PremiumCoronavirus: Everything you need to know about face masks With face masks set to become mandatory in shops and other enclosed public spaces in Northern Ireland on Monday we give the rundown on everything you need to know.Most ReadGerry Adams set up Loughgall ambush, claims new bookNew IRA boss Thomas Mellon ordered Derry mayhem after teen arrestEast Belfast GAA bombs suspect: I#ll have to flee my homeBangor hotel gives ecstasy sex attacker his old job back#Cough up £, or we#ll kill you next time#: Crime gang in le-and-death ultimatum to shot drug dealer,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have seen a rise in the number of confirmed Covid- cases, the R number increasing and a delay in the reopening of non-food serving pubs.These developments underline the stark reality that the coronavirus is not fading away. It is here for the long term and remains highly infectious. It needs no second invitation to spread.The people of Northern Ireland have done really well in terms of following public advice during this pandemic. Many younger people put their lives on hold to protect their parents and grandparents. Many people at most risk shielded for many months and many people saw their livelihoods suffer. Great sacrices have been made and many lives have been saved as a result.But there have been worrying signs that fatigue has led to carelessness and that some complacency might be creeping in.We remain deeply concerned that Covid- cases could peak sharply here in the autumn or winter. Whether this happens or not is up to us all. The virus doesn#t have a plan - its spread depends on our actions.The consequences for many iniduals and for our health service could be extremely serious - not least because health and social care provision is always especially fragile during winter.However, we should not be defeatist about the months ahead.As ever, the challenge involves plotting a sensible course between complacency and panic.With a sustained collective effort across society, we can stay on top of the situation. We can keep protecting ourselves and others, especially those most vulnerable to the virus.We now know much more about Covid-. We have built up our testing and contact tracing infrastructure and we have some more effective treatments. This remains a vicious virus which can be lethal for many and we need to protect them.As ever, everyone at all levels of the health and social care system will do their best to keep the population as safe as possible. They will not be found wanting. Now that the clapping has stopped, please continue to protect our health service and staff by doing the right thing.Every citizen has to play their part. That means following five key steps:Watch your distance: Keeping your distance remains essential when you are out and about. Remember, the virus doesn#t spread itself. People spread it.Wash hands well and frequently: This is particularly important after touching hard surfaces.Wear face coverings in enclosed spaces and where social distancing is dficult: This is now legally required for certain indoor settings, including shops. Don#t be a droplet spreader. And when you are not wearing a face covering, cover your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze.Co-operate with the Test, Trace and Protect programme in terms of getting tested and self-isolating when required.Download the StopCOVID NI proximity app to support contact tracing and help break chains of transmission.Given what we have been through as a society this year already, these five steps are surely not beyond us all.Watch, wash, wear. We really must do it to get through it. This is a responsibility on all of us.Dr Michael McBride is Chief Medical Officer and Professor Ian Young is Chief Scientic AdviserBelfast Most ReadGerry Adams set up Loughgall ambush, claims new bookNew IRA boss Thomas Mellon ordered Derry mayhem after teen arrestEast Belfast GAA bombs suspect: I#ll have to flee my homeBangor hotel gives ecstasy sex attacker his old job backLaw society investigating leading NI solicitors’ firm,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Nine months later on September ,  the first edition hit the streets — five days before a new rival paper, the Evening Press, was due to be launched. It also coincided with the day the French lost the Battle of Sedan and Napoleon III was captured.The first edition featured a story of a fire in a cabinet warehouse on Great Patrick Street, an inquest into the death of a young man who died after becoming entangled in machinery at an Ormeau Road brick manufacturer, and the installation of two of the four lampposts at the corner of the pavement around Albert Memorial Clock.ExpandExpandExpandExpandExpandExpandExpandExpandExpandExpandExpandExpandExpandExpandExpandExpandExpandExpandExpandExpand   \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming eb .ece AUTOCROP w BELFAST%%street%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming eb .ece AUTOCROP w BELFAST%%street%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming eb .ece AUTOCROP w BELFAST%%street%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming eb .ece AUTOCROP w BELFAST%%street%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming eb .ece AUTOCROP w BELFAST%%street%.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"     \"ExpandExpandExpandExpandExpandExpandExpandExpandExpandExpand  \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ab .ece AUTOCROP w BELFAST%%street%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ab .ece AUTOCROP w BELFAST%%street%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ab .ece AUTOCROP w BELFAST%%street%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ab .ece AUTOCROP w BELFAST%%street%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ab .ece AUTOCROP w BELFAST%%street%.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"    \"ExpandExpandExpandExpandExpand.

We also had a wedding on one occasion for a lady who sadly didn#t live very long afterwards but it was a lovely moment.Now, after volunteering and providing refreshments for patients for a remarkable  years between them, the pair, who have become firm friends, say the time has now come for them to hang up their aprons.Liz added: We talked about it at the end of last year and came to a truce that because we had been together for so long that when one went so would the other.We both enjoyed our time here and the feeling of being useful but we wanted to leave while we were still fit.

It warned that further acts of trespass intimidation at the company shall lead it to seek court orders to restrain him from unlawful trespass.The company has also separately responded to a demand from five Quinn children that a % shareholding in Quinn Industrial Holdings be transferred to them.Our clients believe that this is simply part of the ongoing process of harassment and miscommunication being visited on them. In light of this, the correspondence was duly reported to the authorities, namely the gardai and the PSNI, as part of this course of harassment and miscommunication, the letter states.The firm claimed the children#s attempt at legal action was fatally flawed and said it had referred their correspondence to the Garda and the PSNI.Sean Junior, Colette, Aoe, Brenda and Ciara Quinn instructed lawyers to demand the shares from several directors, including Kevin Lunney, Liam McCaffrey, Dara O#Reilly and John McCartin.The company has declined to comment. Mr Quinn said he had nothing to say when contacted. Sean Quinn has made a separate statement to gardai about financial practices at QIH. He has denied wrongdoing and denied involvement in the campaign of intimidation against the company.Belfast Most ReadGerry Adams set up Loughgall ambush, claims new bookNew IRA boss Thomas Mellon ordered Derry mayhem after teen arrestEast Belfast GAA bombs suspect: I#ll have to flee my homeBangor hotel gives ecstasy sex attacker his old job back#Cough up £, or we#ll kill you next time#: Crime gang in le-and-death ultimatum to shot drug dealer,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The solution will be found not on the basis of victory for either, but on the basis of agreement and a partnership between both. The real ision of Ireland is not a line drawn on the map, but in the minds and hearts of its people.” It is hard to describe John Hume as anything but a Hero. His building of a lasting and sustainable peace in Ireland is why he shall be immortalised in history. John could be compared with the greats of Irish Nationalism like O’Connell and Parnell, but the truth of the matter is that John was in a league of his own. googletag.cmd.push  As part of the post-conflict generation, we have John to thank for ensuring that we were able to grow up in a society without violence in our streets, we have John to thank for the fact we can walk any street in Derry with no fear, we have John to thank for guaranteeing that peace would prevail and that the gun would no longer have a place in Irish politics. I find it hard to imagine how Ireland would look today without the influence of John Hume. John’s gt to people all across Ireland and people my age was ironic for such a beloved peacemaker, he taught us how to fight. He taught us how to fight against injustice, how to fight for equality, he taught us how to fight for freedom, how to fight for love, peace and how to fight for a better Ireland which we all can share. He fought with non-violence, he was a pacist, even when confronted with threats, bombs, bullets, and death all around, his morals never shted an inch. John taught us that living for your moral convictions was more righteous than using violent means to achieve your aims. googletag.cmd.push John Hume serves as an example to our post-conflict generation of what we can achieve when we put aside what ides us and instead celebrate what makes us equal. To young people he has shown that we can, in his words, “see an Ireland of partnership where we wage war on want and poverty, where we reach out to the marginalised and dispossessed, where we build together a future that can be as great as our dreams allow.” John’s influence is everywhere throughout the great nation he called home, whether it was through his work in founding the Credit Union movement in Derry and becoming the youngest ever President of the Irish League of Credit Unions, as chair of the University for Derry Committee, his involvement as a civil rights movement leader, his work with the Derry Citizens’ Action Committee, the founding of the SDLP, his positions as MP, MEP and MLA, his role in the ceasefire talks, his work in America or his participation in delivering the Sunningdale Agreement, the Anglo-Irish Agreement or the Good Friday Agreement, John Hume’s le’s work is an indelible inspiration to everyone who calls Ireland home. For me, personally, John Hume is an inspiration, he was a true political titan. I have been asked a number of times since John’s passing why I think everyday people are taking John’s death so personally, here’s why, I feel that John is inextricably linked to everyone in the North, his successes guaranteed that our lives and the lives of our children and grandchildren could be brighter. I think one of the most important lessons we must remember is that John Hume’s work is not finished. We still have to dismantle sectarianism within our society, we still have to work with all shades of the political spectrum, regardless of how much we disagree, in the pursuit of what is best for the people of Ireland. We still must protect civil rights and peace all across the globe from being corroded. We must work together to make a New Ireland and a Shared Ireland, where all people are equal. That is the Ireland John lived for and we must live for too, not only Derry but all of Ireland Mourns John Hume. Go raibh maith agat John, you were truly Ireland’s Greatest.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The start of the summer. A time of hope. A time of new beginnings. To celebrate my th birthday, my friends and I had travelled to Belfast on a minibus on a school-night in the middle of A Levels for that momentous YES concert. We were thrilled to get to see Ash and Bono at the Waterfront. We were extra ebullient at the sight of John Hume taking to the stage. The unlikely trio of David Trimble, John and Bono were applauded with yells of “Yesss!”. googletag.cmd.push  The burning pride deep inside on that night could have set the world alight. To the friends I had yet to meet, some of whom were at that concert, I would always be Proud Mary from Derry. I had come of age just in time to vote in the referendum three days later. Not all of us would have that privilege. My sister, Deirdre, who was singing and shouting her heart out for the entire excursion, was  months shy of voting age. In fact she would never get to vote as she was killed in a car accident we were involved in  months later. googletag.cmd.push I had meticulously studied the Good Friday Agreement text during the referendum campaign. As excited as I was to be on my way to Loch an Iuacuteir for Cuacutersa na Casca that Good Friday, my inner political nerd was sorry to be missing all the TV and radio coverage. No mobile phones or social media in those days. Just two days before the signing of the Agreement, I was at Stormont with a delegation of Derry Girls lobbying the British Government for a new school. I was on The Thornhill Talks Team with Mrs Boyle, Miss Hamilton and Head Girl, and my lelong friend, Emmylou. The eyes of the world were on these negotiations and the hand of history was on our shoulders. John Hume took time out to facilitate the meeting withMinister of Education, Tony Worthington MP. John was the architect of the unfolding momentous peace accord, but he was focussed on bread and butter constituency issues. He knew the importance of education in creating opportunities and building inclusive and peaceful communities. I was engaged in current affairs and local politics from a young age. I was fascinated by the work of my godfather, Uncle Mark. His job as John Hume’s parliamentary aide brought him to ious countries. He gted me with great stories and good lessons over the years. I proudly flaunted a “Hume for Europe” Tshirt in . I read newspapers. I listened intently to the kitchen wireless and followed the TV debates. Always rooting for John and rehearsing the Humespeak: You can’t eat a flag. Spill sweat, not blood. Respect ersity. An accident of birth. Dference is the essence of humanity. This language is now common parlance. John brought others on to his page and round to his way of thinking and speaking. It is impossible to consider John’s achievements without recognising the influence of his we and key adviser, Pat. On completion of my A Levels, I had the pleasure of working in the Bayview Terrace constituency office in the run up to the first Assembly elections. I learned so much about public service, not least in witnessing the compassion and care shown by Pat to every person. The office was buzzing. Phone calls were coming in from journalists, humanitarians and politicians from all over the world. I could hear John speaking in French on the phone one minute, then dealing with a constituent on a housing issue the next minute. Pat had time and warmth for everyone. Amidst the flurry, Pat still found time for banter and indulged my frivolous chats about nights out. I still regard Pat as a mentor and hero. I can only try and imagine the extent of sacrices made by Pat and her family over the years. After that short stint in the office, I spent three months working in Seagate , before starting my chapter at Queen’s and all the adventures that came with that and after that. The Omagh atrocity that summer was a stark reminder of the fragility of the hard-earned peace. John Hume was a political giant, a living legend and an international statesman. Above all, he was a Derry champion. He was a man of global thinking and local action. First-hand experience of poverty in his community motivated his relentless quest for social justice, and his role in founding the credit union movement was instrumental in giving opportunities to people and families. His civic leadership in the community was as impressive as his political leadership on the world stage. John Hume was a man of vision. Steadfast in his ambitions. Resolute in pursuit of solution. Willing to work with anyone. Determined not to be distracted by the viliers. He kept his shoulder to the wheel and his eyes on the prize. Not any of the acclaimed world prizes he won . Ultimately the prize for John was the prize for everyone: peace and the prospect of a brighter future. Those coming of age today face immense challenges as we emerge from a global health pandemic and enter a world recession. Climate emergency is real. In this part of the world we face the added challenges of Brexit uncertainty. Today’s generation need an injection of the hope that my generation were given  years ago. We still have much work to do. The “isolation of the West” remains a pertinent issue. The fight for a proper university presence in the city continues. “I sometimes wish it was that summer again…..” We should always maintain a little bit of that summer, even in the middle of the longest winters. The spirit of partnership and reconciliation underpinning the Good Friday Agreement and defining Hume’s pathway must be restored. And we shall overcome.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Entering the school foyer you’re struck that John Hume sits alongside illustrious company in what must have been a golden age of thinkers and creators. A bust made in the Derry man’s honour rests between two gentlemen who excelled in their own fields in Seamus Heaney and Brian Friel.  Each of these men attended the former Bishop Street school around the same time and went on to become giants in their respective disciplines. googletag.cmd.push John Hume’s own journey at the college began in  . “He told his mother he was going to the College and she said, ‘no you’re not, we can’t afford that’, but he passed his Eleven Plus and got in,” current principal Finbar Madden said. Hume was part of the first generation to avail of opportunities through the introduction of the Eleven Plus. It allowed more young people to continue their post-primary education which may go some way to explaining why men like Hume, Friel and Heaney grasped the opportunity with both hands. There was obviously ‘huge talent and ability’, Mr Madden said, as Hume left the school with a scholarship to study at university. googletag.cmd.push He had ambitions of joining the priesthood at the leading Catholic Seminary in Ireland, St Patrick’s College, Maynooth. Hume didn’t complete his clerical studies but instead opted to serve his community in another way. He graduated from the National University of Ireland in  with a bachelor’s degree in French and history and went on to receive a master’s degree. Returning to Derry, Hume would became a teacher at St. Columb’s. Mr Madden said that career lasted from -. At the time, the history curriculum was limited in schools and Hume taught the subject in a broader sense, keen to instil his vision of Ireland’s place in Europe. As he departed, transitioning into a career in politics, some of the key developments in the civil rights movement were starting to unfold. That, however, wasn’t the end of his journey with the school and his legacy endures. The colleges former pupils association present an annual award - the Alumnus Illustrissimus Award - to a past-pupil who has achieved something of major signicance or has made a considerable contribution in his own field. In , the Most Reverend Dr Edward Daly received the inaugural award and the following year John Hume would be recognised for his contribution to politics and peace in Northern Ireland. Mr Madden said: “The school is able to boast of many exceptional students who went out and made their mark locally, nationally and internationally. “The award recognises achievement whatever the field may be sport, science politics, religion and so on.” A proud College boy, Hume maintained connections over the years and wouldfor prize giving ceremonies. “He presented a facsimile of his Nobel prize to the school,” Mr Madden pointed out next to the assembly hall, “and our politics A-level prize is the John Hume prize in government and politics.” “And for as long as he could, he would come every year to prize-giving, he usually turned up unannounced but we always expected him to come, until unfortunately he wasn’t able to. “He had a very, very clear sense of his connectedness with this school and he never lost that right throughout his le. “In a way that many others weren’t able to do, by his connectedness here, by his presence, he was making it clear that St. Columb’s College meant a huge amount to him. “He recognised what the college had helped him to become.” The school’s principal believes that pupils have looked up to Hume over the years and used him as a source of inspiration in their own studies. Mr Madden concluded: “I think Colum Eastwood said it last night, John Hume was Ireland’s Martin Luther King and we recognise that Martin Luther King had a dream and did all he could to achieve it. “I think John Hume did exactly the same thing here.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The club have never tasted adult championship success. With the manner of victory over Glenullin on Sunday afternoon, it would suggest that consistency will be what Eamon Gibson will be looking from his squad during this condensed season. It leaves John Heaneys side with some soul-searching ahead of their clash with Limavady this weekend. From the way Ben McCarron careered through the Glenullin defence in the opening seconds, until the final whistle, they never looked like being reeled in. If anything, they shouldve won by more. If they are to stand up and be counted when the serious heat comes on, they will need a more ruthless streak in front of goal. The pleasing thing for them, they appear to have the raw materials. googletag.cmd.push They will have to take somewhat of a reality check. Glenullin didnt offer the threat many expected and showed signs of the form that found them in relegation trouble last year. It was a big ask for Michael Oacuteg McKeown in his first game in goals to replace the injured Pearse McNicholl and when they failed to secure possession at midfield, it was a long hour for him. Steelstowns runners through the middle hurt them and with Ben McCarron playing as a third midfielder, their mobile attack thrived in the space. Dermot OKane, one the best dead ball kickers in the county, was off colour and Eoin Bradleys relaxed  metre free coming off the post summed up a day they will want to forget. googletag.cmd.push Stephen Cleary played in the reserve game, but was forced off injured and  minutes into the senior game Eoghan Bradleys ankle injury saw him replaced. On came Rory Maguire who had while he had a terric game, he will be disappointed not to have bagged three further goals. Cahir McMonagle will be another option in attack, but its hard to imagine him getting the room he was afforded yesterday when the real action comes to town. Glenullin put Conor Rafferty onto Neil Forester in what seemed like a curtaining job, while Feargal Close pushed back on to Gareth Logue. It was Logie who dictated the game and even when Gerard OKane was sent out to mark him, the Steelstown mans movement caused Glenullin trouble. Steelstown were three points ahead when the first goal chance presented itself, but it fell to Glenullin. Dermot OKane picked out Paul Rafferty in front of goal but the low pile-driver was instinctively turned onto the bar by goalkeeper Marty Dunne. Seconds later Jacob Duffy had the ball over the bar at the other end. Brothers Dermot and Gerard OKane kicked two terric point, but it did little to stem Steelstowns incessant running game. Whoever is going to stop them, cant afford to drop off. They will need a half-forward line that will occupy them and top the overlap. When the first goal came, it was a majestic diagonal ball from full-back Shane OConnor who found Logue in space and his unstoppable shot went to the bottom corner of McKeowns net. Ryan Devine floated over a fine score from distance before Jacob Duffy made the second goal, with the strong-running Maguire blasting to the net. Steelstown missed three point chances before Maguire was blown up for over carrying when through on goal, almost ashe was caught in two minds to flick to the final support runner. Glenullin brought on three substitutes at the break. Brian Mullan was pulled out from goal with Eoin Bradley now stationed at full-forward. Early in the second-half he won a free but somehow spurned it from close range. He missed a chance in front of goal and the attacking unit didnt have the movement that would have tested Steelstown. At times Brian Mullan, who kept trying to push Glenullin forward, tried to float balls forward. The dference being was that the same space wasnt there that Gareth Logue made for the city men. The half took seven minutes to produce a first score. The move began with Dunnes monstrous kick over midfield, Rory Maguire was again involved and when the ball came from a Mark Foley, he was brilliantly denied by Eunan OKanes ing block, before Foley drilled over the . Then came a moment Gibson and his assistant Raymond Tracey wont be too happy with. Mark Foley had the ball at his feet in front of goal, with time to engineer a chance. He opted to lazily soccer the ball to Jacob Duffy who missed without working goalkeeper McKeown. On another day, this lack of urgency could be crucial. Ben McCarron and Darren McDaid, from opposite wings, floated over two sweet scores. And still the goal chances kept flooding in. After a neat move, McCarron and Jason McAleer created another opening but Maguires thundering shot hit the bar before spinning over. Maguire also brought out a fine save from goalkeeper McKeown who brilliant clawed the rebound clear, as the Steelstown attacks kept pouring forward. The chances Steelstown were mounting and missing had no bearing on the result. At the other end a fisted Eoin Bradley effort dropped into Dunnes arms and Conor Rafferty fired over when a goal was on, but it was always going to be Steelstowns day.

The fact he was man of the match in a dominant team tells enough about his performance. The finish for his goal combined power and accuracy to the bottom cover. With Ben McCarron playing further out, it was Logues running that made th Steelstown attack tick. MOMENT OF THE GAMEDUNNE SAVE – There were many scores in the game, but Marty Dunnes save was something . Dermot OKanes ball came in from the wing and Paul Rafferty just pulled on it along the ground and when the shot zipped off the turf, Dunne somehow got enough on the ball to prevent a goal that wouldve levelled the game in the thminute. TURNING POINTQUICK POINTS – While the first half goals gave Steelstown a , having Eoin Bradley lurking at full-forward meant they could not rest easy at the back. There were seven points between the teams with  minutes gone, but in the next five minutes Foley, McCarron, McDaid and McMonagle chipped in with scores to kill off the game.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

When he tossed a ball in the direction of his six year-old son Barry in the back garden, Barrys reaction was the watershed moment. Instead of catching the ball, he opted to put out his chest. Soccer was his first instinct andColeraine were going to take the first step out of junior football, teaching the basic components, as early as possible, was the priority. Otherwise soccer was always going to have first call on the youth of the Coleraine, Portstewart and Portrush triangle. googletag.cmd.push Fast forward  years and Barry would develop into a wing-forward and top scorer on Derrys  All-Ireland winning minor team and play at senior level for the county.   “It was a question of handling a ball, kicking it out of their hands and running with it – as opposed to dribbling it and chesting it.” SEAN McGOLDRICK  Richard Carey and Mark McTaggart were other future senior championship winners to go through Coleraines first underage coaching initiative. Armed with long-serving Kevin Mullan, Vinty McMahon and Brian Daly – whose son Barry scored the winning goal in the  final against Lavey – Sean set to work in Dominican College. It had to start somewhere. googletag.cmd.push “It was a question of handling a ball, kicking it out of their hands and running with it – as opposed to dribbling it and chesting it,” McGoldrick said in an interview before the  decider. What Coleraine have achieved with their persistence is nothing short of magnicent. And not against a backdrop of GAA tradition in the area, but one they grew themselves. The hub of it is the McGoldrick family who have formed the spine of teams, but imagine what could be done with the numbers in Derry City. Then again there are not many people in the world like Sean McGoldrick. This column has previously highlighted the lack of players to play senior football for Derry from outside the top flight. Of the  players, in the last  years, only  hail from non-senior clubs. From the city point of view, only Neil Forester, Eoghan Concannon and Ben McCarron from the city have played for the county at senior level. Thats a very sobering thought. Is all the money being invested worth it  You would have to wonder. It is dficult to break the mould against soccer, but more recently it is a totally dferent issue. Many young people in the city are not involved in any sport and the once vibrant Derry and District soccer league has been struggling. Whether we like it or not, unless the city can be properly harnessed then Derry, as a county, are always going to be fighting an uphill battle against the superpowers who are challenging for Sam. The college scene in the county is vibrant, with teams challenging for titles on a regular basis. St Patricks Maghera have led the way for years. St Marys Magherafelt – while having a signicant Tyrone and Antrim representation – have given Derry players a chance to play at a high level. St Pius had qualied for the MacLarnon final. St Colms Draperstown have been punching above their weight - despite picking from two clubs - and St Patricks and Brigids Claudy played in U finals. In Derry City, St Columbs Derry had a strong spine of boarders on their  Hogan Cup winning team. In more recent times, it has always had key players from outlying clubs Claudy and Craigbane. A worrying trend is that, apart from their MacLarnon team, the rest of the younger teams are playing at Grade C level in the new Ulster Schools format. A more recent development has been Cathair Dhoire, the amalgamation team in the city, which gave players in the city a taste of MacRory Cup football. The beauty of the Ulster Schools scene is that players can play at a higher level than they are getting at their club, often at a time when their club team is idle and against players from all over Ulster. It is a great bridge to county minor level. Any school coach I speak to, the first people they credit for success are the coaches in the feeder clubs. At the end of the day, a school just polishes the players and mould them into a team. If, as expected, money becomes available for Derry City to follow what Dublin, and more recently Belfast, are doing then it needs to be used wisely. Every penny that becomes available should be ploughed into getting the highest standard of GAA coaching into primary schools. Not concrete or infrastructure, with Doire Trasna now having their own pitch, coaching should be the only focus. Conrad McGuigan is a teacher in a city school and from a conversation I had with him lately, participation has never been higher. In the last six years the number of teams in the Tower Cup has risen from five to . He rated some of their players skills as every bit as good as what there is in his native Craigbane and surrounding clubs. The raw material is there. There has been a decline in the number of males going into the primary teaching profession andprincipals have extra people coming in to coach GAA as a key component of the schools PE curriculum, it has to be music to their ears. For me, the deal-breaker is accountability. To avail of the coaching, a primary school must have a link to the local club. No link, no deal. And it has to be done properly and a stringent review taken place every year. It wouldnt be hard to cross check names from the school teams with club records and eventually U team sheets. Any school or club not pulling their weight simply gets omitted from the funding. Money cannot be wasted on just ticking a box. There is no point in players learning all the skills and not transferring it to a club. Thats where the real gains are. A player who canpush for the countyminorteamandhave a  plus year club senior career. A rising tide lts all boats and the cream will eventually creep into the senior inter-county scene. Any new plan for the city will be the last throw of the dice at engaging a population base that could transform Derry as a county. It will take time, but unless it isproperly audited there is no point. If they can squeeze every drop of potential like Coleraine did, it would be a serious addition.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The test centre was set up at the Judges Road home of City of Derry Rugby Club in April. However, as revealed recently by Derry Now - https:bit.ly DiqvOu-with the rugby club planning toto sporting action soon, a new base has to be found for the testing centre. The test site has now moved to the Lycra car rarkin Maydown. Initially testing was restricted to health and social care workers, it then accepted key workers and their families who had symptoms and more recently any member of the public with symptoms. googletag.cmd.push These tests can be booked via the Public Health Agency website. Many medical and disease control experts have said that testing and contact tracing is key to tackling the spread of COVID-. The Department has developed a COVID- ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ Strategy which sets out the public health approach to minimising COVID- transmission in the community in Northern Ireland. The key elements of the strategy are testing all people with symptoms of COVID-, contact tracing, providing information and advice on self-isolation, and support to enable people to self-isolate. It says for ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ to work, each citizen in Northern Ireland has a very important role to play. googletag.cmd.push “We must all prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and prepare to be tested in order to protect ourselves, our families and our communities. “Symptomatic members of the public are therefore encouraged to get tested early - this will be crucial in controlling the spread of the virus,” a spokesperson added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A construction company, HartlandsLtd, and Apex Housing Assocation had applied to build  houses at a large site at Springtown Road. However, planning officers recommended that the application be refused because the site was outside the current limit for housing developments as outlined in the Derry Area Plan. Planners said thatgranted planning permission, the new houses would set an undesirable precedent in terms of housing development in the countryside. The final decision on the application, however, rested with the members of Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning committee. googletag.cmd.push The planning application was discussed for almost two hours at a special meeting of the planning committee on Wednesday. Maura Fox, Head of Planning at the council, said she could not underestimate the signicance of the decision being made in relation to the Springtown plans. During the meeting, speaking on behalf of those behind the housing proposal, Daniel McAteer, described the Derry Area Plan as being hopelessly out of date and out of touch. He said the new houses would help to meet the critical need for social housing in the city. SDLP councillor John Boyle said he was worried about the sustainability of further development in the Springtown Road area, given the large number of houses which have been built in there in recent years. googletag.cmd.push He said there was already a high volume of traffic in the area and more housing would increase this problem. People Before Profit councillor Shaun Harkin said he recognised the desperate need for housing in the city but highlighted the concerns around creating a precedent in what was zoned as a rural area. Sinn Fein councillor Aileen Mellon said the new houses would help tackle the housing crisis in the city. When the issue was put to a vote, four councillors voted to support the recommendation to refuse planning permission, while three councillors voted against the recommendation.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Jim McReynolds, the popular former owner of McReynold’s Bar, died peacefully last week at his home in Dungiven. Mourners at his funeral heard how Jim had given his time generously to his parish, community and family le. “Jim was a man of faith and trusted in God all his le,” Fr Seamus Kelly told the congregation. “He was very involved in the le of this parish, taking up the collection, doing his time working with St Vincent de Paul, helping and supporting people. googletag.cmd.push “Growing up he was an excellent footballer and represented Dungiven with distinction, gaining a place on the Derry minor team in . “He sponsored many groups and clubs down the years, and club members often said that Jim was the saviour of the hurling club on many occasions. “Even when they hadn’t the money, he would have bought hurls and kits where required until they could raise the funds.” Jim was dedicated to the bar, running what Fr Kelly described as a ‘tight ship’, and he helped cement the bar’s place as a community hub in the town. “He ran a tight ship in his pub. He did not make sales or money his god, but often refused to serve customers he thought were too young or who had already had enough to drink,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “McReynold’s Bar has been famous, not only in Dungiven, as it was the only chief landmark for weary and thirsty travellers from all over the world, and it remains as popular today. “Just last year I had a friend or two visiting and the person wanted a pint, so I said I’d take them down to the best pub in town, McReynold’s Bar, and we had a few pints there. “He had a ready ear for customers’ problems, which were always treated confidentially, and he helped countless numbers of people in a iety of ways over the years. “I’m also told Jim enjoyed cooking and often provided the family meal. The children wouldfrom school, and Rose from teaching, to find a dinner waiting for them. “It had been cooked by Jim while he dodged in and out between the bar and the house, keeping the customers happy as well.” Fr Kelly also spoke of how Jim’s love and commitment to his family, in particular his we Rose, shone through in all that he did. “He met and fell in love with a wonderful Drumsurn girl, Rose Boyle, who was a teacher in her local school.” he said.  “Once they met, Rose and Jim had eyes only for each other and naturally they got married in Drumsurn chapel  years ago. “He loved the cottage in Donegal and was in his element entertaining family and friends when he got off there for a break. I’ve no doubt it holds great memories for all the family. “I enjoyed my visits to Jim and Rose when we were able to visit the sick, Fr Joseph and myself always got a great welcome. “Jim was most generous and appreciated having Holy Communion brought to him when he could no longer go to Mass. “He and Rose always sat side-by-side and I could sense the closeness in their relationship together. I know all the family will miss Jim, but especially his dear we, Rose.” Jim is survived by Rose and his children Finvola, Siobhan, Fanchea, Bernard, Bronagh and Ciara. He was the much-loved grandfather of James, Claire, Anne, Michael, Chris, Katy, Patrick, Cathal, Domnaill, Conal, Niall, Ciaran, Oliver, Liam, Ellen-Rose and great grandfather of Darragh. Jim was pre-deceased by his siblings Frances, Mary, Jean, Patsy, Kathleen and Tony.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A delivery van was hijacked at Rathlin Drive in the estate on Tuesday afternoon before being set on fire. It was one of three vehicles hijacked in Derry on Tuesday. Local politicians condemned the hijackings and said they had destroyed the livelihoods of the workers involved. Community workers today said there were widespread concerns about the attacks in Creggan this week. In a joint statement, Conal McFeely, Tony O’Doherty, Shauna Deery and Gerry Quinn of Creggan Neighbourhood Partnershipsaid there were also concerns about police activity in Creggan which included, they said, house raids, stop and search tactics and other disruption activity by the TSG   TIU . googletag.cmd.push “We, as the community, need to listen and to speak out, to ensure that everyone fully understands the negative consequences of such events and the social, economic and reputational damage to iniduals, families and the wider community,” the statement said. “Creggan has been fully compliant to public health guidance, and extremely resilient and considerate during the Covid lockdown – an exemplar in how a community should respond to a crisis. “According to current statistics, this area has among the lowest reported crime figures in the city and, contrary to the widely-reported, albeit ill-informed, perception, Creggan is in fact a very safe and caring community. googletag.cmd.push “The last number of weeks, however, have seen a number of serious incidents which we believe require further investigation. “CNP believe there is an underlying context to this week’s disturbances, which has gone largely unreported and hence has, again, led to a very one-sided picture of this area being portrayed.” The community workers said young people and families had told them that they are being deliberately targeted by highly aggressive, frightening and quasi-legal policing procedures tactics. “And it is incumbent on us, as a socially-just community, to take account of all available evidence, to establish a full and fair perspective of the situation. “CNP in no way condone or excuse the activities leading to the physical, mental and reputational damage done by, or to, any person or property in this community. “We are aware, however, that there is a specic context to recent events – this response did not happen out of nowhere. “And we also believe that there is a responsibility on all of us to examine that context and engage with young people and local residents – both to listen to their concerns and to ensure that they understand the extremely negative consequences of the destruction of community or private property, and the knock-on affects in relation to the traumatic impacts on affected iniduals and the denial of public services to the area. “There is a growing concern about the ‘cause and effect’ nature of ongoing police activity in the area and recent community disturbances. “Many within this community believe that current police actions only serve to undermine public confidence in policing and indeed the independence and effectiveness of the local and regional police oversight bodies which are supposed to hold police to account. “Our public representatives and church leaders should be concerned, and not be afraid to speak out, about how our area is being policed and is being impacted by the resulting destruction of community or private property.” The Creggan community workers said that following a process of mediation with relevant groupings, it has been established that there is no impediment to the resumption of all delivery and maintenance services in the area. “Tensions are high in the area at the moment – there is a great deal of hurt and frustration which needs to be acknowledged and the specic reasons for these sentiments need to be explored. “CNP believe there is a critical need for an independent review of the recent disturbances – and their context – and will engage inclusively with the entire community to ensure that any such process will be as fair and transparent as possible.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Lisa McGee was doing her A-Levels at Thornhill College when the Good Friday Agreement was signed in , and grew up knowing about Mr Humes work for the peace process. He was just there all the time, she recalled. There wasnt a time that you didnt know about him. There was never any debate about it, he was a good man. At a time where everything was debated about and talked about nobody ever questioned that. Not that you would ever have needed to, or have wanted to, question what he was doing. googletag.cmd.push Ms McGee said the news of Mr Humes death on Monday morning came as a shock, despite knowing that he had been ill for some time. He was a hero who walked among us, she said. I got really upset I was surprised at how emotional I felt. We were just so used to having him. It was phenomenal what he did, the influence he had and the amazing vision of what our future should be. Ms McGee believes hundreds of people owe their le to Mr Hume, due to his role in the cessation of violence. He was an incredible person and he was sent here for a reason, she said. googletag.cmd.push I was just thinking yesterday of all the people that may not be herehe hadnt been able to do what he did and built the peace process. When you think of everything he did and he never gave up- thank God. Ms McGee doesnt knowJohn Hume ever watched Derry Girls, but she hopes he would have approved. I dont knowhe ever saw it, but he and Pat knew I was a big fan, she said. I hope they thought it was alright. He was always in the background in the news, so he was present in the show. And Erin chats about him a lot in the Derry Girls book that I did recently. There would be no Derry Girls without John Hume because I wouldnt have had the opportunities that I had,” she added. The Derry writer that she wants her two young children to learn about John Hume as they grow up. There was an amazing image of him on the front of thetoday [Tuesday] and I want to get that framed for the house because its important that they know about him, she said. This was always going to be a very sad time because it was always going to be about looking back over the past and that was a very painful time in our history. It has been a sad thing for me that towards the end of his le he couldnt remember everything he achieved. Thats why we have to remember for him.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He noticed that for special occasions people in the city rush out to buy a personalised cake from Doherty’s Bakery and thought why not also give them a special memento they can hold on to forever. Christopher Ferry is a Derry man with over  years’ experience in the design industry. He has won ious awards in that time for graphic design and social media management through his work with local businesses. Being on furlough at the moment and confined to his home during lockdown, he felt there was no time like the present to kickstart his own business, aptly named Ferry Clever. googletag.cmd.push It allows people to personalise cards or buy those with famous Derry faces for every occasion. A host of Maiden City icons appear on cards such as John Hume, Nadine Coyle, Micky Doherty , Pat Ramsey and places such as Free Derry Corner, the City Walls and, of course, The Ice Wharf.  Most of them are accompanied by local sayings, for example the common phrase ‘I love you to the moon and back’ is given a local spin to read, ‘I love you to the Bog and back’, with a sketch of the Bogside as the backdrop. It is not just cards but personalised images that can be framed, with a Liverpool-themed design currently proving popular after they were crowned Premier League champions. googletag.cmd.push Families can customise an image of them standing outside the Shankly Gates where it says ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’. The business has been built at home but Christopher’s ambition is to eventually open a shop in the city centre where the tagline will be ‘make it personal’. Working as a DJ he has established relationships with numerous bars and businesses in the town. “Years and years ago they seen me doing the designs for my own posters, this was back when social media was starting to explode, and they asked meI fancied doing posters for them. “I’d do everything from menus printed in their premises, posters, social media campaigns, to online videos – the lot. “But now I want to go full pelt at it and open my own business.” Recently he was in the town looking for a Father’s Day card and couldn’t find any he liked.  He said: “I thought it would be greatyou could just go on to some place and they could make the card for you. “So I thought, you know what, I’m going to try this as well.” He started off selling on the website Etsy and sales have been rising, ‘people are just buying the cards flat to the mat at the minute’, he added. As someone who is social media savvy, he has been keeping an eye on trends and designing cards accordingly. During lockdown the charity work of local celebrity Micky Doherty was well publicised which is why his image was selected to grace one of the cards.  The ultimate ambition for Christopher is to be the ‘go-to person’ whenever a special occasion comes up. “In Derry, and all over the world, it’s always going to be someone’s birthday, it’s always going to be Christmas, it’s always going to be Father’s Day so I just want them thinking of me for a card.” Micky Doherty said he loved the cards. “Im totally honoured,” he said. “Like someone wants a birthday card with my face on it, he laughed.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Chief Executive Paul Clancy has said the Northern Ireland Executive’s decision to make the wearing of face masks mandatory in shops is positive news because it protects both shoppers and staff. The decision also gives more certainty to businesses about the steps that need to be taken to keep people, including staff, safe. In a survey carried out with the Chamber’s members last week, % of  respondents supported the mandatory wearing of face masks in shops by the public. googletag.cmd.push Londonderry Chamber Chief Executive Paul Clancy said: “We are glad to see some certainty on this issue. A vast majority of our own members in the North West are supportive of the mandatory wearing of face masks in shops because they recognise that it protects the health and safety of their own staff, as well as customers. “The reality is that we will all have to make some changes to how we live, work, shop and socialise andthe wearing of face coverings is mandatory, it will help promote more of a cultural change in the acceptability of wearing face coverings. googletag.cmd.push “Shops in the city have put in place new measures and changes which will protect their customers and staff. Many retailers have invested a great deal of time and money to make people feel safe and secure and it is important that customers support the new guidelines. “This has been an enormous time of change, but we must all play our part to protect public health, keep the spread of coronavirus to a minimum and avoid a second wave which will be catastrophic for many businesses. “I hope that people will embrace this change and support local businesses as they try to navigate this new landscape. I would also urge members of the public to be mindful of shop staff and treat them with patience and respect. “The number one priority of retailers is the welfare and safety of their customers and staff and have taken these measures to protect everyone. By shopping local and staying local, we can support small businesses who have been impacted by the lockdown.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Chief Executive Paul Clancy has said the Northern Ireland Executive’s decision to make the wearing of face masks mandatory in shops is positive news because it protects both shoppers and staff. The decision also gives more certainty to businesses about the steps that need to be taken to keep people, including staff, safe. In a survey carried out with the Chamber’s members last week, % of  respondents supported the mandatory wearing of face masks in shops by the public. googletag.cmd.push Londonderry Chamber Chief Executive Paul Clancy said: “We are glad to see some certainty on this issue. A vast majority of our own members in the North West are supportive of the mandatory wearing of face masks in shops because they recognise that it protects the health and safety of their own staff, as well as customers. “The reality is that we will all have to make some changes to how we live, work, shop and socialise andthe wearing of face coverings is mandatory, it will help promote more of a cultural change in the acceptability of wearing face coverings. googletag.cmd.push “Shops in the city have put in place new measures and changes which will protect their customers and staff. Many retailers have invested a great deal of time and money to make people feel safe and secure and it is important that customers support the new guidelines. “This has been an enormous time of change, but we must all play our part to protect public health, keep the spread of coronavirus to a minimum and avoid a second wave which will be catastrophic for many businesses. “I hope that people will embrace this change and support local businesses as they try to navigate this new landscape. I would also urge members of the public to be mindful of shop staff and treat them with patience and respect. “The number one priority of retailers is the welfare and safety of their customers and staff and have taken these measures to protect everyone. By shopping local and staying local, we can support small businesses who have been impacted by the lockdown.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The league leaders were in danger of dropping their first points of the season after Walter Figuiras first half goal had given the Candystripes the lead, but an own goal from Colm Horgan and a follow up from Roberto Lopes maintained the % record this season. Derry kept their shape throughout an uneventful first half, with Rovers bossing possession, but without ever really causing a threat, a half chance for Danny Lafferty, on histo the Brandywell, the only effort Rovers had in the first half hour. googletag.cmd.push The first half was drting uneventfully towards half time when the first goal arrived out of absolutely nowhere. Eoin Toal collected the ball on half way and decided to join the attack, bursting between two Rovers players before finding Walter Figueira on the left wing. Toal continued into the penalty area in anticipation of a cross, which was duly delivered, but incredibly, the ball eluded both Roberto Lopes and Alan Mannus with the ball sneaking into the net past the bemused Rovers players. Stephen Bradley was far from happy with his teams inability to test Peter Cherrie and midway through the second half he had used all of his substitutes to completely change the look of his attack. googletag.cmd.push Those substitutions had the desired effect as Rovers finally levelled on  minutes, but there was still an element of luck about the goal. Gaffney did well to pick out a cross from the right and a glancing header by Williams went over Cherrie but onto the post before it bounced off the unfortunate Colm Horgan and into the net. Rovers were relentless after that, and, buoyed by the goal, they went in search of a winner, and they thought they had it when Farrugia went in from the left and picked out Williams, but he was denied from close range by a superb save by Peter Cherrie. But the goal was coming and City were unable to defend the resulting short corner, Burke receiving the ball in the area before sending it into the mix where Lopes was on hand to fire it past Cherrie to turn the game completely on its head with just eight minutes remaining. There was a chance late on for a City equaliser when Ciaron Harkin and Colm Horgan combined to set up Figueira, but his effort was too close to Mannus who gathered comfortably. City continued to push in five minutes of added time and they came so close to levelling when Adam Hamills cross was met brilliantly by Harkin who headed onto the crossbar before Mannus somehow kept out Toals follow-up.

Parking restrictions will also be in place around the working areas.Ni Water says the investment is part of a programme of work to improve the existing sewers in Downpatrick, which will enhance the local sewerage infrastructure and reduce the risk of out of sewer flooding.It has confirmed that the essential work will involve repairing existing sewers and will mainly be undertaken using underground trenchless techniques, which will signicantly reduce the duration and disruption of the programme.But NI Water is warning that it will be necessary to undertake lsquoopen-digrsquo repairs at some locations due to the condition of the existing sewers.The organisation says that this particular aspect of the work is expected to last just one or two days with contractors also working in the evening, with every effort being made to minimise disruption.ldquoAppropriate traffic management and signage will be in place as the work progresses, said a NI Water spokeswoman.ldquoThe majority of the works will be undertaken during normal working hours.

to a genuinely great political leader, he said.ldquoA few years ago during a visit with the late Maurice Hayes at his home in Downpatrick a chat about developing GAA facilities was taken on a brilliant rambling tangent re John Hume.Maurice knew him well, and opened a door to the man Irsquod only known through my studies at that point. It was laden with humour and humility ndash but also plenty of lessons for us all today.South Down SDLP MLA Colin McGrath spoke of the respect he had for Mr Humersquos commitment to ldquopeace and peaceful non-violent dialogue.He said: ldquoIn all his days, no matter how often he was attacked, John never once turned to violence and lived those very ideals of peaceful nonviolent resistance. He showed us that it was possible. He showed us that peace was achievable. We believed him, because of how radically he believed in those ideals and lived them.Mr McGrath said that through his work, Mr Hume offered ldquoyoung and old alike a vision of a future in which the gun would be removed from Irish politics, no matter how hard terrorists would and continue to resist this.Council chairperson Laura Devlin, praised Mr Hume as ldquoa man of peace and a ldquotrue hero who left a ldquolasting legacy as one of the highest profile politicians on the island of Ireland who was highly respected by all communities.Addressing the councilrsquos full virtual monthly meeting on Monday, she asked: ldquoHow do you put into words a fitting tribute to the contribution this man has made to the landscape of Ireland ldquoHow do you put into words a fitting tribute to this man who stood beside his community through Northern Irelandrsquos most terrying and dark days and walked proudly beside them as we ushered in together the days of peace Cllr Devlin added that from his example, she entered politics to ldquorepresent the needs of the community and added: ldquoIn all of his years, in all his roles, whether as an MLA, an MP, an MEP, a teacher, a family man, a friendhelliphis people came first.Respect was shown to Mr Hume and condolences to his family came from right across the political ide in the council chamber.Councillor Billy Walker, on behalf of the DUP council group, paid his respects to Mr Humersquos family and to the wider SDLP group.He said the death was a ldquosad loss to politics and paid tribute to Mr Humersquos determination to peace-making and ldquoremoving the gun out of politics in Northern Ireland, even sometimes when his own party did not support him during the Hume-Adams talks.He added: ldquoI also had the greatest admiration and respect of how the three then MEPs, John Hume, Ian Paisley and John Taylor, despite their political dferences, worked together to bring millions of European money into Northern Ireland for the benefit of us all.Alliance councillor Andrew McMurray said: ldquoIf it wasnrsquot without the hard work and sacrice of people like John Hume, we wouldnrsquot live in the Northern Ireland we do today.ldquoHis enormous contribution to the peace process, the end of violence and the determination to deliver a society built on peace and equality for everyone which be his lasting legacy along with a le well-lived.ldquoAs a young man growing up it was very obvious to me that John Hume was not only a man who stood for things but stood against things.Councillor Pete Byrne, leader of the SDLP council group, thanked his council colleagues for their kind words and said that the level of international tributes being made about Mr Hume reflected the ldquohigh level of esteem he was held in.ldquoItrsquos very hard to overstate the importance of John Hume to this island, he said. ldquoThrough the most dficult times, John fought for justice, equality and peace.ldquoHe taught me to have respect for dference and ersity and I think thatrsquos a message thatrsquos really important today.ldquoI want to thank John for delivering the institutions that we have today, they may not be perfect, but it brought peace to our streets and I want to thank John for leaving the blueprint for us all to build upon.SDLP councillor Dermot Curran called his former party leader as being ldquoa man of the people, for the people in his tribute.He said: ldquoAlong with the late Eddie McGrady, we worked with John a lot over the years, particularly when he was an MEP in Europe over fishing interests.ldquoI always remember he would tell me that he never sought to be a leader, only to help people. That stuck with me and it was something that I carried with me in my work.ldquoHis unstinting work for peace and what he did for us all cannot be understated.Due to Covid- restrictions, the Book of Condolence is now available online at https:www.newrymournedown.org chairpersons-book-of-condolences until Monday, August .All messages in the online book will be recorded by Newry, Mourne and Down Council and sent directly to Mr Humersquos family..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Saintfield Horse Show success  ","story":"THIS yearrsquos Saintfield Horse Show on Saturday at Eugene Milliganrsquos ldquomagnicent venue in Castlewellan was hailed as one of the best shows and attracted a large number of entries mdash despite the impact of the coronavirus lockdown.Competitors came from all over the island and were delighted with the huge, flat rings and the well laid out ground.Show director Joan Cunningham said: ldquoThere was sun, fun and something for everyone who attended.

Most of Europe was basking in a heatwav and race morning arrived with temperatures already at  degrees.The race statistics were scary with , metres of climbing to be covered in only .km race distance. The lsquowallrsquo to the finish line had a maximum gradient of an eye-watering %..In the early stages Hanna found himself in the leading group of five with the cream of the Italian mountain racing scene.Included in the quality field were lsquovertical kilometrersquo specialist Henry Aymonod, Davide Magnini, one of the best uphill and sky runners in the world, former European mountain racing champion Martin Dematteis and Frenchman Sylvain Cachard.At around half distance Aymonod put in a surge and Hanna tried to follow with Dematteis being ped from the group.On to the upper slopes and Hanna was at the back of the group of three in fourth place.

Hanna settled into the next bunch, finding his climbing legs quickly and reached the summit in fourth place over half a minute clear of Martin Dematteis.One of the best climbers in the field, Hanna continues to hone his descending skills too and he held on for a long time on the descent in fourth before being caught by Dematteis.However, he achieved a brilliant fth place finish, taking the scalp of the Aymonod, the winner the day before, and many other top runners..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"United front in drive to restore Downe services  ","story":"HEALTH campaigners have welcomed the new united front in the campaign to restore key services to the Downe Hospital.Politicians, trade unions and the Down Community Health Committee worked alongside each other in lobbying the South Eastern Trust to restore emergency services at the Downpatrick hospital which is scheduled to happen on October .In a throwback to previous campaigns, all of the districtrsquos political parties and trade unions are now working alongside hospital campaigners to secure the future of the Downe and to argue for a range of new services.Campaigners say while they will be keeping a watching brief to ensure that the hospitalrsquos AE reopens in October as planned, they are also conscious of the ongoing province-wide review of urgent and emergency care.The review mdash commissioned by the Department of Health ndash aims to establish a new regional care model for Northern Ireland with any future proposals subject to public consultation.At a socially distanced meeting of the community health group in Killough last week, campaigners said that future proposals for the Downe arising out of the review could be crucial and potentially be the launchpad for a major new battleground.Confirmation of theof emergency services in October comes after it was revealed that over the past five years there has been a % increase in AE attendances at hospitals across Northern Ireland.Signicantly, Department of Health figures reveal that the biggest increase mdash .% mdash was at the Downe, with the number of patients increasing from , to ,.Health campaigners say the figure represents another ldquostrong, persuasive reason why they must continue to fight for a local emergency department which is valued and needed.They are delighted with the plannedof AE services, suggesting that with the fastest growing emergency department in Northern Ireland, there is a ldquostrong, logical statistical argument for not only retaining the service, but enhancing it.Health committee chairman Eamonn McGrady,revealed that analysis of increased attendances at emergency departments shows that the growth area is not Belfast, but at hospitals in the Southern , Northern , Westernand South Easternhealth trusts.He added: ldquoWe know we are not home until the Downersquos emergency department is reopened in October and and we will all be keeping a watching brief.Mrs Anne Trainor said she was ldquomore prepared than ever to work harder for the Downe as she will never be able to repay the debt of gratitude that she owes the hospital and its excellent staff for helping her ill husband.She also described a recent meeting with senior officials from the South Eastern Trust to discuss theof emergency services to the Downpatrick hospital as ldquorobust and revealed she was left perplexed when health minister Robin Swann said health officials would ldquoexplore the feasibility of reopening the department.ldquoThis particular service has been part of the Downe Hospital for years. Its need has been proven. There was no need to explore the feasibility of anything, she said.Mrs Trainor said the outcome of the meeting with health officials was that politicians, the community and trade unions stood together in demanding theof AE provision.She added: ldquoThis very much reminded me of the early days of the hospital campaign where everyone was saying the same thing. We won the case for the Downe but, from day one, administrators started to strip services from it.ldquoOver recent days what has given me the greatest heart has been the reaction of the politicians, the community and trade unions on the Downe Hospital issue.Mrs Trainor said she hopes that the unity will continue, insisting that when it comes to hospital services, the people of Downe are asking for nothing more than parity with those in other areas.ldquoThere has been substantial underfunding in this district for many years and we need parity with everyone  alongside rural proofing as, for those in authority, the centralisation of services is still very much alive. Their attitude is that everything stops in Belfast, she continued.ldquoBut everything does not have to be centralised in the city. The Downe is a beautul hospital but is being totally underused, yet it is one of the most modern of its kind. There is room to expand to increase service provision and we also want more consultants and staff alongside increased investment for student nurses.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoThere is total unity across the community on these issues and a strong defence of the Downe Hospital.ldquoThe hospital is the single biggest issue in our district. There is strength in our unity and togetherness.

Photo: Press Eye PA WireThe scale of support required to help firms deal with the paperwork is testament to how serious the barriers to trade and business will become now that Northern Ireland is to be left behind as a colony of the EU, semi-detached from the rest of the nation.As for Mr Gove’s claims that this package underscores Westminster’s “absolute commitment” to Northern Ireland those who heard him and other members of the government loudly and repeatedly deny that an Irish Sea border would ever be accepted will understandably treat the comments with contempt.Yesterday’s announcement is bad news for everyone in Northern Ireland. Regardless of your stance on the constitutional question, the erection of a border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain means you will be hit in the pocket in the months and years ahead.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It makes no economic sense. Far from yesterday’s announcement displaying a commitment to Northern Ireland it underscores a historic betrayal of this part of the United Kingdom.The fact that the DUP DAERA minister, despite his previous affirmations to the contrary, is now overseeing the imposition of the Irish Sea Border infrastructure at our ports, adds to the sense of betrayal that I as a unionist feel.The evaporation of opposition to the Betrayal Act by those in a position to take a stand, through the governmental positions they hold, is a great disappointment and disservice to future generations.Just last week we saw north southery turbocharged while the wedge of an Irish Sea border Is driven through the east west links. Arlene Foster declared her sanguinity to the Dublin government’s ‘shared island unit’ while the Republic’s Prime Minister made clear today its purpose is to anticipate a break-up of the UK. History, from a unionist perspective, will not judge kindly those at both a national and local level who facilitated and whitewashed the catastrophic consequences of the Betrayal Act.Jim Allister QC MLA, Stormont——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAs reported in the Penarth Times on Thursday, the town councilsaid the results show ldquowidespread backing for changes.The survey, which attracted  responses, showed  per cent of people thought there should be more outdoor space for pedestrians and businesses.Seventy-five per cent thought parking arrangements needed to change, and  per cent said the town needs to ldquoprepare for the future.Some traders, who oppose the changes ndash specically a one-way traffic system around the town and making Windsor Road and Lower Glebe Street a traffic free zone, have said the questions in the survey were too generalised and misleading.As a result of the survey, Penarth Town Council have proposed the following changes to the original ideas:Windsor Road from Arcot Street to the roundabout as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and buses, with a mph speed limit.Lower Glebe Street as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and disabled bays. Other vehicles should not use Lower Glebe Street as a through road.Bus stops will remain as they are. There were concerns over the impact of a bus stop on Hickman Road for traders, due to air pollution, noise pollution and congestion.A two-way system to remain on Stanwell Road from the library to the traffic lights, to allow easy access to the bus stop on Rectory Road and to prevent congestion and ldquorat running through Hickman Road and Arcot Street. A two-way system to also remain from Windsor Road to Railway Terrace.The number of parking bays has also changed. There will now be  extra bays proposed, with  of them on Plassey Street.The leader of the town council, Cllr Rhiannon Birch, explained the findings and what happens next.ldquoEven before Covid-, town centres across the country were facing issues, including the need to modernise infrastructure, and the impact of online shopping, she said. ldquoThe current pandemic has added to the scale of the challenge.ldquoThe consultation shows that a clear majority recognise the need for a degree of change in the town centre, both for it to survive in the present and to thrive in future.ldquoThe results call for the establishment of a greater degree of safe space and proposals which increase a degree of pedestrianisation whilst also increasing parking spaces.ldquoThe results show substantial agreement on these aims. Reflecting this widespread and clear response, Penarth Town Council calls on our partners in the Vale of Glamorgan Council to embrace the results and recommendations.ldquoSpecically, Penarth Town Council believes that creating a safer environment through the closure of Windsor Road to traffic for part of the day, between Arcot Street and the roundabout, including the Lower Glebe Street, would be the best way to ensure that people can feel confident about shopping safely. It would allow safe use of the space in front of shops, bars, cafes and restaurants.ldquoIt also lessens the need for one-way systems on pavements for pedestrians, which are perplexing for many and hard to implement. These proposals can be achieved in a way which also increases the amount of parking spaces available.The results will now be put to the Vales Planning Committee for consultation.For more information, visit https:www.penarthtowncouncil.gov.uk news survey-results Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

minor players in the transmission overall.He added: ldquoWe cannot be in a risk-free society and this is about the risk balance.ldquoWhat is the risk balance equation and I think thatrsquos separate for children and young people themselves.ldquoItrsquos very clear for them the benefits and risks, the balance is for them to be back at school.ldquoFor broader society, look, I think itrsquos also clear that reopening schools is one of the least risky things we can do.ldquoAnything we do that reopens society will add a small or a larger amount to the overall population reproductive number and for schools we believe that itrsquos a relatively minor player, it would add little to the overall population R.In a statement Mr Williamson said the Government will continue to be guided by the ldquobest scientic and medical advice.He added: ldquoThe education and care of our children is a national priority. vw,vw,px, px\"Daily confirmed cases of Covid- in the UK ldquoWe have always been and will continue to be guided by the best scientic and medical advice.ldquoThe latest research which is expected to be published later this year ndash one of the largest studies on the coronavirus in schools in the world ndash makes it clear there is little evidence that the virus is transmitted at school.But Greater Manchesterrsquos Mayor Andy Burnham said that the Test and Trace programme had to be better to give parents the confidence to send their children back to school.Speaking on BBC Breakfast on Monday he called on the Government to give more resources to local councils to trace people the national call centres were unable to reach and to also allow people to self-isolate on full pay.Mr Burnham added: ldquoSo many people are struggling to self-isolate because they just canrsquot afford it. vw,vw,px, px\"The PM wants schools to remain open wherever possible in the event of future local lockdowns ldquoWe are saying to the Government: you have got to give all employees in the country the ability to self-isolate on full pay, and itrsquos only that approach that will get Test and Trace system working properly.Mr Burnham compared the request to self-isolate to jury service and said people should be supported to do it.He added: ldquoItrsquos a simple request we are making, a bit like when you are called up to serve on a jury, when you get a request from the Government to go and be a juror.ldquoThis also is a request from the Government when yoursquore being asked to self-isolate, so letrsquos give everybody the ability to follow that request.ldquoTest and Trace will start working much betterwe do that. vw,vw,px, px\"Global Covid- cases and deaths The Association of School and College Leaders said teachers might teach students on a week-on, week-off basisthere was a resurgence of coronavirus and schools were forced to limit the number of pupils attending, with the onus on parents to home-school in the alternate weeks.The unionrsquos general secretary Geoff Barton said schools were ldquolosing patience with the Governmentrsquos demand to have all children back in school next month while framing no back-up planthis was not possible.ldquoIf you want to limit the number of children on site or travelling to and from school, a big part of that is using rotas and the obvious way to do it is lsquoweek on, week off lsquo, Mr Barton told The Daily .However, care minister Helen Whately said the Governmentrsquos priority was to have children ldquofully back at school by September.She told BBC Breakfast: ldquoSchools are safe and there are extra measures that schools are being advised by Public Health England to take for instance, to have staggered start and finish times, staggered breaks, to teach children in bubbles, and teachers can enforce, encourage hand washing, hand sanitising, so all the steps that will make schools even safer for our children to be back.Askedschools should stay open in the event of a local lockdown, she said: ldquoYes, that is the approach, so, for instance, in places like Leicester and Greater Manchester, and areas where we have local restrictions going on, absolutely schools should be still going back. It is essential that children get back into school this autumn term.The latest tensions over Covid-rsquos impact on education come as a European study suggested reopening schools was not a major danger in community transmission of the disease.The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control studied  countries, including the UK, and concluded: ldquoThere is conflicting published evidence on the impact of school closure re-opening on community transmission levels, although the evidence from contact tracing in schools, and observational data from a number of EU countries suggest that re-opening schools has not been associated with signicant increases in community transmission..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Children  uvery minor players u in Covid- transmission, expert says article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Since ing to site Farrans, the contractor in charge of the build, has ensured the contract is completed ready for opening in the Autumn.Farrans has been spearheading the build since initial enabling works got under way early in , creating  jobs on site during construction as part of a project which has delivered at least £. million in direct wages to the local economy.Located at the south side of Craigavon’s balancing lake, the facility is a landmark venue for the area and is situated within a pre-existing network of walking and cycling paths covering around three miles. The council hopes the new leisure centre will welcome visitors from across the borough and beyond to its new -metre pool, a young children’s indoor leisure water feature, a ,m state-of-the-art gym, multiple studios, health and wellbeing suite, sensory room, eight-court sports halls, spin studio, soft play area and an on-site café.It also incorporates an outdoor water sports provision offering a wide range of water based activities including windsurfing, water skiing and paddle sports.

in pipelineA major new chain store is on its way to Lurgan and could bring  jobs to the town, a local councillor has said.By The NewsroomFriday, th August , : pmUpdated Friday, th August , : pm\"\"The application, lodged by applicant Inaltus Ltd on behalf of Curly Properties Ltd is for a retail development with car parking, landscaping, access and associated site works developed atvacant lands north of Millennium Way, Lurgan.Originally submitted in  the planning proposal has been recommended for approval by Council’s planning officers and will,approved, see Home Bargains arrive in town.Speaking in support of the application, Councillor Joe Nelson said it would bring “signicant economic benefits… including some  new jobs” to Lurgan.“I believe the site location is ideal for this development as it provides adequate car parking in situ and is located on Millenium Way which is in fact the relief road for Lurgan Town Centre,” say the SDLP councillor.“Bringing this development to the town while keeping the town centre free from extra congestion is the ideal position.“I strongly support these proposals and trust that the material considerations, associated with the economic and other benefits of the scheme, will be considered in detail by the Council planners.”Upper Bann MLA Jonathan Buckley has expressed “strong support” for the application.“The proposals will see the delivery of a Home Bargains store for Lurgan along with signicant economic benefits including a multi-million pound investment into the local economy and the creation of some  new jobs,” said the DUP MLA“At a time when many people are losing their jobs and many businesses are having to close, proposal such as this, where successful major retailingbusinesses are willing to commit to Lurgan, the Council must give very serious consideration to these proposals.”However, an independentreview of the application by Tom Stokes Associated Planning expressed concerns that rather than support the town centre, the application,approved, is “more likely to create an alternative retail destination to the town centre”.The report said that with  per cent of the Lurgan town centre’s turnover allocated to just two stores, the remaining smaller conveniencestores in Lurgan could be “vulnerable to impact” by the approval of this application.The review also suggested that the proposal would be better suited to the former Tesco site in Castle Lane as it is “a key regeneration site in the town centre”.However, in response to this, the application’s agent, Inaltus Ltd, said: “If this site did not suit Tesco’s servicing requirements, there are no grounds for TSA to suggest it will suit Home Bargains.”In conclusion Inaltus Ltd’s response to TSA assessmentstates that whilst some aspects of the TSA Review can be agreed “other aspects are illogical and do not form a sound basis to refuse the proposal on”.It also notes that no objections have been lodged in over  months and called for the application to be brought before Council’s planning committee.The application is now set to appear before Wednesday’smeeting of the planning committee, with officer’s recommending that the application is approved.-------A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
