Photograph: Alan Betson Local authorities must not revert to a “back of the fag packet approach” to the drafting of their development plans, the State’s deputy planning regulator, Anne Marie O’Connor, has said.Ms O’Connor described the rate of housing construction on land zoned by councillors as “absolutely shocking”, with only one in six zoned sites seeing an application for homes during the lifetime of a development plan.Speaking at a Dublin City Council housing seminar, Ms O’Connor emphasised the need for “evidence-based” zoning and a move away from blanket zoning or “colouring yellow across a development plan, hoping that something will happen”.Councils needed to ensure development plans became “action plans” for the delivery of homes, she told the seminar at the Mansion House in recent days.“Really focus and think about how much land you need, where it should be, and how you are going to achieve it,” she said.“Because the statistics in terms of the delivery on zoned land are absolutely shocking. There is a one in six chance a piece of zoned land will come forward for development in its planned period, and if we want to be trying to direct development into the right places for the right reasons, we have to change the way we have been looking at that traditionally, because we know where that has led us.”‘Flawed thinking’Ms O’Connor recently made a submission to the draft Dublin City Development Plan on behalf of the Office of the Planning Regulator (OPR) instructing the council not to go ahead with a number of restrictions on build-to-rent (BTR) schemes on the grounds that the council was breaching national policies and ministerial guidelines.Ms O’Connor told the seminar she realised some might find mandatory planning guidelines “difficult” but she said “they provide a real clarity around certain issues that are deemed to be key. You may not like some of them but that is their purpose.”When local authorities did not apply national policies it created a “friction and a tension that does not work well for the planning system or for planning outcomes,” she said.“The idea that clear breaches” of national planning policies “can be facilitated within the planning system and that is in some way going to lead to good outcomes I think is a flawed way of thinking”.However, she said there was room for councils to define appropriate housing mixes for particular areas.The planning system could not operate “business as usual and hope for different outcomes”, she said. “If we are hoping to build sustainable communities and sustainable development, then we know business as usual has not delivered that.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"french election macron to face off against far right leader le pen in presidential run off","story":"  Marine Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron will go into the April 24th presidential election runoff, according to projections following Sunday’s vote.  Photographs: Joel Saget and Eric FeferbergAFP via Getty ImagesPresident Emmanuel Macron will confront the extreme right-wing leader Marine Le Pen in the runoff of the French presidential election on April 24th, after ten other candidates were eliminated in the first round of voting on Sunday.Mr Macron defeated Ms Le Pen five years ago. The Ifop-Fiducial polling institute on Sunday night predicted he will defeat her again, by a much narrower margin of 51 to 49 per cent. That prediction is within the margin of error, meaning Le Pen has a chance of winning. Mr Macron defeated Ms Le Pen by 66 to 34 per cent in 2017.Mr Macron won an estimated 28.3 per cent of the first-round vote, five points higher than Ms Le Pen at 23.3 per cent.There was palpable relief among Mr Macron’s supporters, because the last opinion polls on Friday had placed Ms Le Pen only one or two percentage points behind him.Four other candidates immediately called on their supporters to vote for Mr Macron in the runoff and the extreme left-wing candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who came in third with an estimated 21.2 per cent of the vote exhorted his supporters: “Do not give a single vote to Madame Le Pen!”. Mr Mélenchon could make a big difference by asking his supporters to vote for Macron.“I solemnly invite our compatriots, whatever their choice in the first round, to join us,” Mr Macron continued. “Some will do so to bar the way for the extreme right. I am fully aware that does not mean they support my programme, and I respect that. I know that is the choice of Jean-Luc Mélenchon. I salute their clarity towards the extreme right... I want to hold out a hand to all those who want to work for France. ”Ms Le Pen made a similar appeal, inviting all those who did not vote for Mr Macron to join her. The leader of the Rassemblement National said the runoff presents France with “a fundamental choice between opposing visions” with on one side “ision, injustice and disorder” which she said were embodied by Mr Macron, and “social justice” if she is elected.Eric Zemmour, also from the extreme right, came in fourth, at around 7 per cent. He was alone in calling on his supporters to give their second-round vote to Le Pen. He said that the party he recently founded, Reconquête! (Reconquest!) “will not give up until France is reconquered”.Ms Le Pen’s niece, Marion Maréchal, who abandoned her aunt to join Mr Zemmour’s campaign, said it was up to Ms Le Pen to “hold out her hand” to Mr Zemmour “so that Emmanuel Macron will not be re-elected”.Sunday’s results showed how successful Mr Macron has been at destroying the traditional left and right-wing parties, the Socialists and Les Républicains, but how badly he has failed to blunt the appeal of the extremes. Of the top four candidates, only Mr Macron is not considered an extremist. Three extreme right-wing candidates and Mr Mélenchon from the far left won a combined score of about 53 per cent.None of the other candidates was certain to reach the 5 per cent threshold required to have their campaign expenses reimbursed.By winning more than 20 per cent of the vote, Mr Mélenchon, a former Socialist, is positioned to lead the remnants of the French left in the legislative elections which follow in June.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"\u0026lsquoEntertainment is such a good way to bring forth change,\u0026rsquo says play\u0026rsquos narratorPhenomenal success of Nigerian artists is bringing both opportunities and criticismAuthors are tackling topics from transgender rights to Islamic extremism, and picking up plenty of awardsTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"perilous moment conservative party","story":"And we have the ongoing police investigation into whether Boris Johnson himself broke lockdown rules by attending events in his flat and the offices within Number Ten. Here there is already a concerted attempt by loyalists to downplay the significance of the moment should the Prime Minister be fined by the police. Their job has been made easier by the strength Johnson has shown in arming Ukraine and standing up to Russia. They are aided too by the sense that Sunak’s recent difficulties mean he is less likely, for now at least, to win the race to succeed Johnson. And they will use Sunak’s example as a warning against taking a chance on other less experienced candidates.Regardless of their good fortune, however, the loyalists’ arguments will not wash. It is not sustainable, for example, for Downing Street to keep the names of senior staffers or officials secret after they have been fined. Nor is it sustainable for fines issued in relation to events in the Downing Street flat to be kept secret. Nor can the Prime Minister or his spokesmen get away with refusing to accept that it will be established, if he is issued with a fine he accepts and pays, that he has broken the law.However much the loyalists may wish to convince themselves otherwise, the idea that a prime minister should survive a process that finds him guilty not only of breaking the law, but breaking extraordinary laws he imposed and implored the public to respect, is simply absurd. So too is the idea that he should survive after denying breaking those laws and issuing emphatic denials in Parliament.The Conservative Party might be capable of deluding itself thus, but if it does the public will draw very different conclusions. They will see a Government – already struggling with inflation and finding it difficult to get things done – closing ranks and showing appalling double standards.This is dangerous enough for the Tories, but if part of the strategy to prop up the Prime Minister is to limit and discredit potential successors, there follow two more problems. Keeping tall poppies away from high office will mean the quality of day-to-day government will continue to suffer. And it will risk a crisis of leadership following the Johnson premiership, whenever it ends, as the choices are narrowed unnecessarily. It is ridiculous that the likes of Tom Tugendhat and Jeremy Hunt remain on the backbenches, and ridiculous that some in Downing Street see only advantage in Sunak’s recent difficulties.With notable exceptions – such as Nadhim Zahawi’s vaccine rollout, Ben Wallace’s work arming the Ukrainians, and Priti Patel’s forthcoming plans to establish offshore processing for asylum claims – much of what the Government is doing is piecemeal, technocratic and often contradictory. The Tories want to intervene in the economy, but have junked their industrial strategy. They say they want lower taxes, but keep putting them up. They promise to level-up the country, but while Michael Gove has the ideas, he lacks the spending power for them to make a difference quickly enough.As with the questions of ethical standards in government, this lack of coherence can be explained in part by the Prime Minister’s style of leadership. Johnson has deliberately formed a third eleven cabinet, to avoid creating powerful rivals. He has set lofty targets, but neither formed detailed plans to achieve them, nor empowered ministers to do so. He has appointed a chancellor with whom he was always going to clash thanks to their contrasting methods of working and starkly different views of fiscal policy.Tired governments, made complacent by years in office, come to believe that their position of power will last forever. They lose sight of the bigger picture, drift into technocratic decision-making, and their fights with one another grow more important than those with opposing parties and vested interests.Unfortunately, this government now suffers all these ills.So now seems a good time for Conservatives to remind themselves of the binary nature of power in our parliamentary democracy. You either hold power, or you do not. You can change the country, or you can watch the other side change it in ways you dislike.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Zelensky accuses Moscow of evading war crimes responsibility Oil protestors force one in three petrol stations in southern England to closeKhan supporters protest in Pakistan as Sharif tipped to take overFrench election: Exit poll says it’s Macron vs Le Pen in battle for presidencyPuppeteers snap up Olivier Award for role as Bengal tiger in Life of PiMan arrested after police officer attacked with macheteMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"stately homes set success thanks bridgerton effect","story":"Britain’s palaces and grand houses are basking in the “Bridgerton effect” after the Netflix series caused a surge in “set jetters” visiting locations seen on-screen.The National Trust has said younger visitors have become increasingly keen to explore the UK’s stately homes following the release of Bridgerton’s second series, which has made historic properties the toast of the “season”.Sites such as Basildon Park and Petworth, normally frequented by seasoned Trust members, are expected to see a rise in visits from those who would not set foot in a stately home “unless it was for Bridgerton”.Hampton Court Palace - the set for a wedding in the costume drama - is also bracing for an influx of fans whose interest in Britain’s palatial residences has been piqued by the show, and bosses are hoping to capitalise on this by hosting more Bridgerton-inspired weddings at the former home of Henry VIII.“They’re called ‘set jetters’, and they’re accounting for more and more visitors across historic properties,” said Harvey Edgington, the National Trust’s head of filming.“They are people who travel to see famous sets. It’s happening with Bridgerton. We certainly have evidence for an increase in visitors, and the series only came out a few weeks ago.“There is certainly more interest coming from younger people, and people who might not normally visit stately homes.“We have heard from properties that visitors are coming because of the series, our staff on the ground are being told ‘I wouldn’t be here unless it was for Bridgerton’.”Various National Trust sites feature in Bridgerton’s second series, including Basildon Park in Berkshire - used for a party scene - and Ashridge Estate in Hertfordshire - used for some equestrian shots.Petworth in West Sussex has also been included in the second series of the show, and Stowe House in Buckinghamshire featured in the first series as stand-in for Vauxhall Pleasure gardens.Stowe saw a 17 per cent rise in visits following the first series, and National Trust bosses are hoping the “Bridgerton effect” will once again bring in a new crowd.Lucy Hutchings, the head of Hampton Court Palace, said: “We’re thrilled that Hampton Court Palace features so extensively in the second series of Bridgerton.“It looks fantastic on camera, but even better in real life, so we’re hoping it’ll attract thousands of people to visit the palace this summer and walk in the footsteps of Queen Charlotte.“We’re also hoping that the glorious wedding scenes set at the palace might encourage more couples to consider Hampton Court as a wedding venue.”Other sites are also hoping for a surge in visitors, with Bath providing many locations for the Netflix hit, including its Royal Circus.Tourist body Visit Bath said that “the indirect benefit of seeing Bath on screen, media coverage and creation of Bridgerton-inspired visitor experiences runs into millions”.It has been suggested that nods to Regency dramas and Jane Austen adaptations at many stately homes could be replaced by references to Bridgerton, as marketing targets a new generation of viewers who may not remember Colin Firth as Mr Darcy.The economic benefits of Bridgerton come after the “Poldark Effect”, which saw Cornwall enjoy a rise in tourism following the release of the BBC series set in the county. Another BBC series, the Scottish costume drama Outlander, has also led to an increase in visitors to locations like Doune and Blackness castles.This Georgian country house was built in the 18th century in the Palladian style out of Bath stone.In the First World War, it was used as a convalescent home for wounded soldiers, before being requisitioned and used as a prisoner of war camp during the Second World War.It has featured heavily in media before, including in the 2005 version of Pride and Prejudice, starring Keira Knightley, where the house was used for Mr Bingley’s home.Within Capability Brown grounds sits the 17th-century Petworth House, which is home to an impressive art collection that includes paintings by Turner and Gainsborough.The house was inspired by the Palace of Versailles, and is on land which was in the same family for over 900 years. Currently the home of Stowe School, Stowe House was originally built as a home for Sir Richard Temple in the 17th century. Over the centuries it hosted kings and tsars from across Europe, as well as the poet Alexander Pope, who made a feted translation of The Odyssey.This Thames-side palace was owned by Henry VIII, who stayed here with every one of his six wives.Catherine Howard, his fifth wife, was arrested here before later being executed. Additions were made by William III and Mary II, and Capability Brown was the chief gardener here later on. This townhouse was the first of 30 stone-fronted Palladian homes to be built in the famous Georgian crescent. Inhabitants over the years have included politicians and Prince Frederick, a son of George III. More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Zelensky accuses Moscow of evading war crimes responsibility Oil protestors force one in three petrol stations in southern England to closeKhan supporters protest in Pakistan as Sharif tipped to take overFrench election: Exit poll says it’s Macron vs Le Pen in battle for presidencyPuppeteers snap up Olivier Award for role as Bengal tiger in Life of PiMan arrested after police officer attacked with macheteMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"xi jinping dare not climb zero covid tiger","story":"Since late January 2020, when the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) finally admitted that the Covid-19 outbreak had become an epidemic and locked Wuhan down, it has bombarded the world with claims about the success of its draconian containment policy known as Zero Covid. These claims have been widely accepted at face value. Not only People’s Republic of China (PRC) officials but bien-pensant Western commentators decry demands for hard data about the origins of the virus and the realities behind the CCP’s response. The experiences of Chinese citizens have remained largely unheard.This wall of silence is beginning to crumble. For more than a month the PRC has been hit by wave after wave of omicron outbreaks. It is clear that Zero Covid cannot keep more transmissible strains of the virus under control. Public opinion in the widening areas of China once more in the grip of a brutal lockdown has turned against Zero Covid – most notably in Shanghai, where 26 million people are now subject to a grimmer lockdown regime than Wuhan endured two years ago.Xi Jinping continues to force hard lockdowns onto increasingly desperate Chinese citizens in the apparent belief that the health benefits will outweigh the serious economic and social risks. But is this questionable judgment the real reason for his unwillingness to take a different path? It’s worth revisiting the background to Xi’s identification with Zero Covid from its inception.Xi kept a low profile in the early days of Covid-19. But a CCP journal later quoted him describing an extraordinary meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee he summoned on 7 January 2020 at which he gave instructions on how to deal with the outbreak. But nothing was done to stop the virus spreading until a fortnight later, by which time millions of Spring Festival travellers had passed into or out of Wuhan, the centre of an epidemic which then spread across the world.Yet the CCP claims the 23 January lockdown largely confined Covid within Wuhan and its surrounding Hubei Province. Subsequent outbreaks have mainly been blamed on returning visitors infected overseas. China’s official Covid deathtoll now stands at 4,638. Around 95 per cent of this strangely low number of deaths reportedly took place in locked-down Wuhan and Hubei in the immediate aftermath of the lockdown. This questionable assertion underlies CCP claims that Zero Covid “succeeded”.Two years on, key engines of the PRC economy are grinding to a halt as cities and regions which generate a quarter of China’s GDP go into lockdown. Maintaining growth is crucial for the otherwise unaccountable regime to maintain social order, but prospects look bleak for the economy meeting even this year’s modest targets. In urban centres, dystopian repression imposed on millions of hungry and frightened middle class citizens is becoming intolerable. Less is known of conditions in more remote regions, but repressive zeal there tends to be manifested more brutally still.Xi hopes to extend his tenure as supreme leader of the CCP at its 20th Party Congress later this year. His explicit backing for Zero Covid seems to be influenced by his interest in claiming victory over the virus to support his ambitions at home and his struggle with democratic critics abroad. Those who seek to share in his dictatorship will not venture to derail Zero Covid now. Nor will Xi tolerate any exposure of its flaws.Xi seeks to outdo Mao as an undisputed Chinese dictator as in Mao’s case the greatest risks, if he succeeds, will be to the Chinese people. So far, he seems indifferent to their plight, and that for the present the Roman tag apparently fits: “Let them hate, as long as they fear”. But a Chinese proverb bears repeating too “if you ride a tiger, it’s hard to dismount”. Zero Covid is the tiger that Xi dares not climb off.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Zelensky accuses Moscow of evading war crimes responsibility Oil protestors force one in three petrol stations in southern England to closeKhan supporters protest in Pakistan as Sharif tipped to take overFrench election: Exit poll says it’s Macron vs Le Pen in battle for presidencyPuppeteers snap up Olivier Award for role as Bengal tiger in Life of PiMan arrested after police officer attacked with macheteMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"chancellor rishi sunak asks prime","story":"Chancellor Rishi Sunak asks Prime Minister for probe into his OWN financial affairsChancellor Rishi Sunak has referred himself to Boris Johnsons independent adviser on ministerial interests, Lord Geidt, over his own financial affairsRishi Sunak Image: Getty ImagesByRachel WearmouthSenior Political CorrespondentRyan MerrieldReporter:,  Apr Updated:,  Apr |commentsRishi Sunak has asked the Prime Minister for a probe into his own financial affairs. The under-fire Chancellor tonight took the dramatic step of referring himself to Boris Johnsonaposs independent adviser on ministerial interests, Lord Geidt, following a growing row over his familyaposs financial arrangements. It comes hours after he had ordered a Whitehall inquiry into how his weaposs tax arrangements were leaked to the media. Mr Sunakaposs political future hangs by a thread as he faces fresh calls to come clean over his tax affairs and US immigration status. The Tory minister tried to claim his we Akshata Murty was the victim of a smear campaign, after it emerged she held non-domiciled tax status, which allows people to avoid paying UK tax on overseas income.  The Chancellor, whose Spring Statement last month failed to help struggling families cope with the UKaposs biggest fall in living standards since the time of rationing, was reportedly weighing up whether to quit after a string of damaging stories. His team has previously argued all declarations to the register of ministerial interests were above board. In a statement posted on Twitter on Sunday evening, Mr Sunak said: “I have always followed the rules and I hope such a review will provide further clarity.” In a letter to Mr Johnson, Mr Sunak said his “overriding concern” was to maintain public confidence.  “My overriding concern is that the public retain confidence in the answers that are given and I believe the best way of achieving this is to ensure those answers are entirely independent, without bias or favour,” he said. “To that end I would recommend that Lord Geidt makes all his conclusions public. “I am confident that such a review of my declarations will find all relevant information was appropriately declared. “I have throughout my ministerial career followed the advice of officials regarding matters or propriety and disclosure and will continue to do so.”  The White House has been urged to investigate after Mr Sunak admitted holding a US green card until October  - while he was the Chancellor.Mr Sunak has been hit with reports that he is listed as a beneficiary of tax haven trusts in the Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands, despite pledging to close tax loopholes. Meanwhile, Infosys, an Indian firm founded by his weaposs billionaire father, where Ms Murty holds £m of shares in, is urgently reviewing its base in Moscow. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said it was a matter of “basic fairness” that the Chancellor’s family should pay tax in the same way as everyone . “I don’t think the Chancellor gets that. That raises real questions about his judgment,” she told BBC’s Sunday Morning programme.  Policing Minister Kit Malthouse admitted Ms Murtyaposs status as a non-dom - something she gave up last week amid public fury - was “not ideal”, but nonetheless rushed to defend Mr Sunak from colleagues who declared the Chancelloraposs career to be toast. He said the Chancellor was a “smart, clever, committed politician” who had helped steer the economy through the worst of the pandemic. Ms Murty, who is an Indian citizen, dramatically announced on Friday that she would now pay UK taxes on all her worldwide income as she did not want her tax status to be a distraction. It has been estimated that her non-dom status could have saved her £ million in taxes on idends on her shares. Mr Malthouse admitted it was “not a brilliant time” for the details to come out when the country was struggling with a cost of living crisis. “Rishi Sunak has been a remarkable force for good in this country over the last two years, he said.“He put in place some incredible support schemes during the pandemic at enormous speed. “It is not ideal, but we all when we sign up for this job know that there is going to be rough times and smooth times,” he added. Meanwhile sources close to Mr Sunak have played down reports that he was moving his we and two daughters out of Downing Street to escape the glare of the media. The Sunday Mirror published pictures of removal vans arriving in the street on Saturday to take their belongings away. One source said however they had always intended to spend more time in their west London home as their elder daughter, Krishna, entered her final term of primary school before moving on to secondary school. Mr Sunak is still expected to stay in Downing Street during the week while joining them at weekends. Labouraposs Angela Rayner said: “The chaos caused by the Conservatives over the last week must be brought to an end. “A fish rots from the head. It is the Prime Minister’s responsibility to bring this debacle to a close by ensuring that standards are upheld across his Cabinet. When it comes to the Tories hiking up taxes on working people, it seems it is one rule for them and another for the rest of us.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Breaking NewsRishi Sunak\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Fishy Rishi is a beached Chancellor without credibility, struggling to survive and contemplating resignation over the Rishi Notax scandal. The nets trawling the sordid financial affairs of his incredibly wealthy family may yet produce another jaw-dropper that will force the Tory moneybags to resign in disgrace. And the morally corrupt Prime Minister he’s now unlikely ever to succeed – charlatan Boris Johnson, who presided over widespread law-breaking during Covid, his head on the chopping block until Putin spared him – remains a rotten man. Downing Street’s decaying neighbours represent a Conservative government decomposing rapidly, with ministers mocked for regurgitating on the airwaves pathetic excuses for indefensible behaviour.  Draw a Venn diagram and the fools spouting drivel to shield slippery Sunak and an heiress we, Akshata Murty, who’d pay £, to avoid millions of pounds in British tax, overlap with idiots who ly claimed Johnson didn’t hold parties and is innocent of all charges. Whether what non-dom Murty and Green Card Sunak did was legal misses the point that it is unacceptable for a Chancellor to put up taxes for the little people while his family lawfully dodge them. Sleaze taking the Tories back to the John Major era is a glorious opportunity for Labour – and a challenge. Leader Keir Starmer is receiving conflicting advice. Either he sticks with Ed Miliband and Jeremy Corbyn’s proposals to end the non-dom scam, or he listens to those who say it would be seen as anti-business. Championing fairness could draw a thick red line between Labour and the Tories at the election. The Conservative fish is rotting... Labour needs to use its head.

Dr Bousted went on: The Department for Education must take steps to right the ship, which is currently shedding too many staff and not finding enough to replace them. This is to a very large extent because the job is made unattractive and unsustainable. Labour warned that Tory cuts and the chaotic handling of childrenaposs education during the pandemic had made le a misery for schools.

On the international stage, Mr Johnson has shown Britain to be Ukraine’s staunchest ally, committed to Ukrainian independence and standing by the Ukrainian people in their hour of need. But that story is disturbingly dferent closer to home. What Ukrainian people fleeing war need most is sanctuary, and , big-hearted British families are ready to open their homes to provide it. Yet only , Ukrainian refugees have arrived here so far under the Homes for Ukraine scheme.  That is because Priti Patel is not issuing them with visas quickly enough. The Home Secretary promised Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko she would ensure visas were processed in three days. That was three weeks ago. Ms Vasylenko is an impressive MP. And she is not impressed by Ms Patel’s dilly-dallying. In Kyiv today, Mr Johnson showed President Zelensky the firm hand of friendship. Now the PM needs to take a firm hand with Ms Patel – and tell her thatshe cannot sort out this mess, he will find someone who can.  Grant us a plan There was something depressingly inevitable about Brits who’d been looking forward to their first proper holiday for years spending much of it stuck in traffic jams and airport lounges. Today, chaos reigned on the ground and in the air as people tried to get away for a much-needed Easter break. The port of Dover blamed its delays on the suspension of PO Ferries. Airports said they were plagued by Covid staff absences. And Transport Secretary Grant Shapps wrung his hands and expressed concern, which was about as much use as a flat tyre on the M. PO bosses are to blame for some of this by their summary sacking of  seafarers. We must spare a thought for them and their families. But Mr Shapps knew PO would present a problem this weekend. And Covid should have come as no surprise to him. Labour says better planning could have alleviated some of these delays. And when it comes to travel, Mr Shapps is planner-in-chief.

During his brief stay Mr Johnson pledged, as is his wont, everything that Ukraine needs to survive as a sovereign nation. And he’s promised missiles, rockets, armoured vehicles and new anti-ship weapons systems. That’s a start – these weapons are much needed. They are up against one of the world’s largest and most ruthless armies.  But the battlefield is not the only place where the PM needs to deliver. He also promised visas. He promised that the UK would make the process as easy as possible for desperate refugees. That’s a promise he’s failed to deliver. More accurately, his Home Secretary has failed. Lesia Vasylenko, a Ukrainian MP who took up arms against the Russians, said she was promised visas in three days by Priti Patel – three weeks ago. We’re used to this Government breaking promises.

Labour said Mr Sunak and his family potentially saved tens of millions of pounds in taxes through his weaposs non-dom status.

I was fed up being the fat mum, fat we and fat friend and wanted to make myself feel better. “Due to my MS, I was struggling with a lot of basic everyday tasks, so losing weight was one way I knew I could help myself.But, because of my health and being unable to do strenuous exercise, most of my weight loss had to be down to what I ate.”Allison, whose illness means she cannot work, had a body mass index , used to gauge a healthy weight, of ., compared to the NHS healthy range of . to . when she signed up to the slimming club, making her obese.Now a healthy st lb, with a BMI of . and a slim size  , she was delighted when in August , Alasdair decided to join her and lost st in just six months. Recalling how she had issues with her weight even as a little girl, Allison said: “I’ve always been big. Always the tallest and fattest right through school. “My mum would take me to slimming classes even when I was a teenager. I was so embarrassed and never really stuck to the plan.  “Over the years I’ve probably been to every slimming club there is. I’ve always lost a bit of weight then went straight back again to my normal eating habits and put it all back on.” When she finally joined WW, she had hit rock bottom with her weight, saying it was really influencing her moods and damaging her self-confidence. Also, while there were days when she felt fit and healthy, on others her MS meant she could not get out of bed and being big only increased her battered self esteem and poor body image, which made feeling fat even harder to bear. She explained: “I realised thatI carried on going the way I was that I’d have a heart attack and never see our wee boy grow up. I just wanted to be healthier.” Allison threw herself into the plan, buying books with new healthy recipes and cooking herself meals from scratch full of vegetables. While her weight loss was slow, because she could not combine diet with rigorous exercise because of her MS, she never once gained weight in more than three years on the plan. With Alasdair constantly trying to tempt her back to bad eating habits, she says this was a miracle. She laughed: I was cooking two or three dferent dinners every night. I’d make mine and Alasdair would say, ‘Is that all you’re having  I don’t want that.’ Or he’d try to twist my arm for a takeaway!”  She was delighted when he decided to join her on the diet in August  – not least because it meant cooking just one meal a night. She said: “The stuff we were eating, the junk food, made us feel so run down. We’re a lot happier and fitter now and it’s fantastic for Jacob as well. “He keeps saying, ‘Look how skinny you are!’ “I’d just like to say to anybody thatwe can do it, they can. Evenyou’re disabled, please don’t think you can’t.” Inspired by his we’s success and following an embarrassing incident at a funfair, Alasdair joined WW last summer. He said: “Last summer I was at the fair with Jacob and got marched off a ride for being too big. It was so embarrassing. “Exactly a week later, I joined Allison at my first WW meeting. I decided something had to change.” Despite being stick thin as a young man, by the time he joined WW, years of unhealthy eating, washed down with calorie-laden booze, had taken its toll on Alasdair, who wore a in waist size and whose BMI was ., making him obese. He said: “I’d seen how well Allison had done, but I was still a bit apprehensive about going on a diet at first, as I thought I would struggle cutting my portion sizes down, stopping drinking and all that.” But, losing a whopping .lb in his first week spurred Alasdair on to keep it up. And soon he was even sitting through meetings on topics such as eating more throughout your period. Sticking with the plan, he cut out alcohol, fizzy drinks, takeaways and started the couch to k app. With husband and we both using the WW app to track and scan their foods, they now enjoy a breakfast of porridge or muesli, lunches of homemade soups and salads and dinners of pasta or risotto cooked from scratch. Alasdair, now a in waist, runs k three times a week and has taken up cycling. In just  weeks, he reached his goal weight of st lb, making his BMI a healthy .. Between them the couple have lost an astonishing st lb and are both maintaining their weight, while still attending weekly WW meetings. Alasdair thanks his we for his success, saying: “Without Allison, I absolutely could not have done it. I’d have given up. She was the one who showed me the ins and outs and reassured me. She was always there to remind me how much I had to lose when I wanted to give in.” Their diet before Breakfast – Cooked breakfast, cereal or filled rolls Lunch – Toastie Dinner – Takeaway or homemade meal such as donner pizza and cheesy chips with curry Snacks – Crisps Diet now Breakfast – Porridge or muesli or brown toast Lunch – Homemade soups or salads, fruit and a yoghurt Dinner – Sausage bake, port tagliatelle or risotto.

Manager Karen Noble is on a mission to make sure people are getting the support and benefits they need – and this is particularly important for older visitors, who might feel isolated. “It’s not just about organising activities they can get involved with: conversations might come out of that,” says Karen. “People will tell you what they’re struggling with and how you can support them. You might find out that they’ve been given an iPad but have no internet connection, or that they don’t feel safe because some kids have been throwing eggs in the streets. “We have a lot of older people who shouldbe receiving benefits but they’re not. So we want to get that message out to them. They’ll go ‘No, I’m alright’ because there is a bit of pride there – but we want to make sure they get everything they’re entitled to.”Karen is devoted to helping people in the local community because she knows what it’s like to struggle. As a young mum of two, she worked and had to battle to support her children. “I had to fight to make sure I got all the right benefits – and then people saw what I did and started coming to me for help,” says Karen.

But after contacting the Deva office and receiving no answer, he sent a text message explaining the situation he was facing. The message said: Mate can you call me, am getting chest pains and keep going dizzy am gonna have to go and get checked out.  I started getting pains in my chest, feeling dizzy and I was getting sweaty. I ignored it for a minute or two but I started thinking no, this does not feel right. So I pulled over and phoned the office, but it rang out, so I texted the work mobile number that I was getting chest pains and the manager rang me back. I askedsomeone could come and get my packages because I wanted to go to the hospital. They told me someone could come and take half my route off me but that they couldnapost do any more than that. A spokesman for Deva said the company sent a driver to assist and believed Neil had been relieved of all his packages - a claim which Neil strongly refutes. Instead said he felt he had no option but to carry on with the route. Neil said: I didnapost realise how serious it was at the time. But it went on right through the afternoon, just getting worse and worse.  The dizzy spells were so bad I kept having to pull over because I couldnapost see anything. Despite his worrying symptoms Neil ploughed on with his sht and dropped the van back at the depot at around .pm, hours after the symptoms began. He said: When I got back to the depot my manager asked meI was alright to work tomorrow and said he had a smaller route over the water I can go on. I said I need to go to hospital first before I start thinking about packages. He ed home and went straight to AE at Whiston Hospital with his we, Susan Martin. Doctors quickly established something was seriously wrong, and Neil says his heart rate was around  beats per minute rather than the usual . Neil was kept in as an inpatient for the next  days, where he underwent extensive testing including an angiogram and was given medication to keep his heart rate under control. After being stabilised he was transferred to Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital for an MRI scan before being allowed home to recuperate. Neil said: The doctors told me I had already had a heart attack and asked me why I had waited so long before coming in. I was disgusted. It made me feel like delivering packages was more important than my health. I am not blaming them for me having a heart attack, but I feel like I could have died on that road and they didnapost care. A spokesman for Deva said: We take the safety of the independent, self-employed contractors we engage with, very seriously, and we are still investigating how the incident was handled. As soon as we learned Neil was unwell, one of our four standby contractors was sent to relieve him of the load and as far as we were concerned Neil had received the support that he had requested. We were not aware that Neil had been left with packages. Had we been aware we would have immediately sent another driver to relieve him. We have people on standby specically to cover routes which need support at short notice, including a driver needing to finish early, illness or in the case of traffic issues or vehicle breakdown. A couple of days later our site manager texted Neil to see how he was. Neil explained what was happening, thanked the manager and a thumbs up emoji for getting in touch and would keep him informed on his progress. A spokesman for Amazon said: “Safety is a top priority and we wish the delivery driver a speedy recovery. We have launched an immediate investigation with the delivery service provider who engages the driver.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Amazon\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But the Queenaposs relatives who are further down the line of succession donapost have this privilege, which means they have to use a normal surname like the rest of us. So while Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis use their parentsapos aposCambridgeapos title as their surname at school, their cousins Archie and Lilibet use the royal familyaposs aposofficialapos last name - Mountbatten-Windsor. The moniker combines the royal name, Windsor, with Prince Philipaposs surname, Mountbatten. However the name caused a massive row in the royal family and was even raised in the Houses of Parliament, resulting in a rt between the Queen and her husband.  It didnapost appear on an official document until , but the complicated story behind the name dates all the way back to .Before marrying The Queen and becoming the Duke of Edinburgh, Philipaposs official title was Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg.However, his name wasnapost considered to be neutral enough so he adopted the name Mountbatten after his grandparents. When the then Princess Elizabeth had the coupleaposs first child, Prince Charles, in , he assumed, due to tradition, that their little one would take his name.  However, when Elizabeth went on to become Queen in , she had to confirm the official surname of the Royal Family and many wanted her to continue using Windsor, instead of changing it to Mountbatten. Winston Churchill is said to have been an advocate for the Royals using the name Windsor and The Queenaposs grandmother, Queen Mary, agreed.Do you enjoy reading about the royal family for all the best royal news from the Mirror here. It is said to have caused such an issue that the matter was even discussed in Parliament. In the end, the Queen decided to support her familyaposs views and the name Windsor was used.At the time, Philip reportedly said: I am nothing but a bloody amoeba. I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children.The topic continued to bother him for years to come, but it wasnapost until  that Elizabeth decided to do something more about it. When the couple fell pregnant with their third child, Elizabeth was Queen and Philip was still keen for his children to have his surname. So in , Her Majesty is said to have gone to see Harold Macmillan, who had then taken over as PM. She said she absolutely needed to revisit the issue and admitted it had been irritating her husband since . Finally, a comprise was met, and on February ,  -  days before Prince Andrew was born - the Queen declared that she had adopted the name Mountbatten-Windsor. She announced that it would be used by all her descendants who do not enjoy the title of His or Her Royal Highness. And as we have seen, itaposs still used today. A statement on the Royal website explains: The Royal Family name of Windsor was confirmed by The Queen after her accession in . However, in , The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh decided that they would like their own direct descendants to be distinguished from the rest of the Royal Family , as Windsor is the surname used by all the male and unmarried female descendants of George V. It was therefore declared in the Privy Council that The Queenaposs descendants, other than those with the style of Royal Highness and the title of Prince Princess, or female descendants who marry, would carry the name of Mountbatten-Windsor.

Trafficked into the UK, she was tasered and forced to have threesomes, gang bangs, and sleep with  men a night. “It was the most traumatic time of my le, she says. Her horric ordeal left her with addictions to drugs and sex after she was farmed around dferent cities as her home was turned into a drugs hub.Natalie, who is going under a dferent name, said she would be lucky to get two hours’ sleep a night and wouldn’t see a penny from her sex work that she carried out over  months in dferent cities across the UK, reports WalesOnline. I had tasers to me, she says, At the time I did not realise how bad it actually was. It was a gang who kidnapped me and held me captive. I was stuck in my bedroom with a lock on the door and they took over my house. I was not there for  months and it was like a drugs hub, I was not sure what was going on.”  A victim of child abuse had made her vulnerable and she says she was naive as to how the gang had operated, who had been operating in Wales for two decades, Natalie says. She adds: “I was taken to Liverpool, that was probably the scariest time. That was the first time I was tied up. If I had spoken out I would have been killed and I thought my daughter would have it, it was mad.” At the time, Natalie admits she was a cocaine addict which left her in their debt and under their control. She continues: “They had seen the amount of money I was spending on cocaine - I was a coke addict. I was buying coke off them. It’s how I became involved in all of it.. I was sold to the sex trade.... I needed someone to find me.” As she was trafficked across Britain she barely slept to keep up with the demands of her kidnappers. The horror of being raped and abused is one she was familiar with. “Sometimes I would have sex  or  times a day all day,” she says. “I would only have two hours’ sleep a day and not even that. Me and my associate would be made to do stuff together and made more money. I would have to have threesomes and gang bangs. It was terrying, especially the trauma.”  She adds: “I was there for  months, that was not just in that one city it was everywhere. It was not in one place. I was in Liverpool for six weeks, I was not allowed out, I was in a room. I think I went to the south of the country after that - it was not as bad. “Obviously, it’s bad but I didn’t have tasers to me - it wasn’t as damaging there. I was there .for about four months, it was a normal house. London and Liverpool was the scariest one. London was bad - it was worst than the city in the south. I was in London for about six months, all I would do is work. In the whole time I didn’t sleep in any way and I couldn’t really sleep. After I had been gone for four months I never thought anyone would find me. Natalie has since been able to turn her le around, but the emotional scars remain and she still lives in fear. It was only on herto Wales that the brutal reality of her existence was finally uncovered but it was a struggle to speak out and reveal what had happened to her. The challenge now is living with the fear the crime gang remain at large. Natalie, now , said she was worried she would be discovered. “They didn’t jail them they are still out there,” she says. “They have been arrested but no jail sentence has been given for it. I get scared they may find me, I am petried. Now I just feelthey wanted to find me they probably would. I think I have moved on even to do with sex work, all that has all stopped. It’s because I had a sex addiction and I have seen love as through sex. aposFor me to be proud of myself is a thingapos Her le since her abduction has not been easy. She has endured spells of homelessness and drug abuse and found it dficult to maintain relationships. She ed to sex work on the streets when she did not know what  to do, although she says she has not done sex work for two years now. She has had four children, none of whom are in her care. Yet she says she has beaten her addictions to cocaine and crack cocaine and now only smokes weed. Her addiction to sex has been tougher to break and is something she still wrestles with.Natalie says: “My sex addiction was hard to overcome, I was working with BAWSO [an organisation that provides emotional support to black minority ethnic and migrant victims of domestic abuse, sexual violence, human trafficking]- I had  sessions and four extra sessions so I had a total of  hours support to help me,” she says. “I had to retrain my brain.I was working with a support group and I ended up working with one of the workers. She helped me a lot with my sex addiction -I do not have sex for two weeks I am fine. It’s breaking the cycle of not wanting it all of the time. She says she is now focused on her children and has been through three years of intensive support thanks to Safer Wales, which offers support to those who are invisible in society and work to protect victims of sexual exploitation from danger. Without them the woman would not have been able to move on into a dferent le and have a roof over her head. Her plan is to build a brighter future for not just herself but others who have struggled through their teens. “My Safer Wales worker has been there for tears and laughter, she has been through my three-year journey,” she said. “For me to be proud of myself is a thing - I was never proud before, now I could not be happier. “Two weeks ago I was given my flat - it’s all guns going with all the decorating. I think of the now, I try to bury everything - I shouldn’t but I do. I want to go to uni and do health and social care and open a rehab from  to -year-olds, I want to help people who have gone through dficult times when they are going through adolescence and offer a better start in the care system.” Natalie adds: “If I had a better start in le I would not have got into a situation of drugs and the trafficking.

Have you experienced any issues  Email webnews@mirror  Ours has never worked since we moved into our new home in September , he told The Mirror. Their actual meters have been faulty and my husband and I were successful in an ombudsman complaint for service failures during the meter issue. However, one thing BG have not got right is the internal smart meter that remains unfixed. Since September we are on our th smart meter. That is a low conservative guess.The smart meter fails to demonstrate correct usage.  One model said I was using £, per day in electric. The app only has electric data for February  and  now and I genuinely do not know how they intend to recty.As a result of a faulty meter we have been unable to adjust any of our energy habits since moving into our new property. He shared a photo of a day he said the meter showed £. Another customer, who wished to stay anonymous, told The Mirror: Both my gas and electric are supplied by British Gas. My smart meter stopped working as of the March . Unfortunately no engineer available until the July .  Not a happy customer, the worst is trying to speak to anyone. He added: The smart meter is showing all zeros and not actually recording any details whatsoever, a spokesman from British Gas acknowledged they are not receiving any information either. I am aged  and am down as urgent on receiving help under British Gas terms and conditions. I find  weeks too long to resolve the situation. Charlotte, who described herself as a disgruntled customer, told us: I too have experienced this issue since February. I have tried to speak to BG with no success, finally resulting to an online chat that was a waste of time. Like your other readers suggest something fishy is going on and as a customer that used the BG app daily to check consumption I am concerned that my current direct payment will be incorrect.

I hope my inidual story will help with highlighting the underhand actions of one of our fuel giants and the way that they are treating their loyal customers at a time of increased anxiety. A mum said: Our smart meter now by am reads over £. and we haven’t even used any electric or gas yet today- well be it minimal as we have actually got up.By the end of today it will show nearly £. - this is minimal use and no use of a washing machine or tumble drier.It’s shocking I have no idea how we will afford to keep our children warm by this winter at the price we seem to be being charged.

The NHS Confederation, which acts as a representative for hospitals and ambulance trusts, called for aposmitigating actionsapos such as not meeting people indoors and wearing masks in crowded spaces.This would help prevent the spread of the virus, the health and wellbeing organisation told The Times.It also said the Government needs to introduce a apospublic information campaignapos in England to ask people to stay away from AE unless they have an emergency. Already overcrowded AE rooms are suffering from staff shortages as three per cent of staff in the NHS have coronavirus. Confederation boss Matthew Taylor said: NHS leaders report a clear disconnect between the Governmentaposs Living with Covid plan and the realities at the NHS front line.

She had a perfect le. We were told she would never smile or get head support and that she would never sit on her own – she managed all those things,” Lisa said.  “She laughed constantly, she started waving and smiling. She developed her own little character. “All the things we thought she would never do, she did. And more. For a baby that was so poorly, she accomplished more in her nine months of le than most of us do in a year.”After a normal pregnancy, Lisa was concerned about her babyaposs movements and made her way to the University Hospital of North Tees in September  - when days later she was induced. On Friday, September , the health care assistant welcomed her daughter into the world via caesarean section.But it was only upon Nancy’s arrival that she and her midwery team recognised something was out of the ordinary. Nancy was taken straight to the special care baby unit which cares for premature or seriously ill newborns.  Lisa, , said: “When she was born, she didn’t cry. She had dficulty breathing – she had a wheeze. The only thing I remember saying was that she only had four fingers – she didn’t have her little finger on her left hand.” Medics found that Nancy had problems with her heart and kidneys, slanted eyes, webbed toes, a missing finger and she could not suck or swallow. The newborn was transferred from the University Hospital of North Tees to the paediatric intensive care unit at the Freeman Hospital. Lisa continued: “Two days after giving birth by C-section, I was travelling to Newcastle. I needed time to heal but Nancy came first. I was allowed to change her and hold her but she was so poorly. A doctor there asked meI understood how poorly she was. “He told me to take her home to meet her family because she won’t be here in  hours. They’d done all they could and we just had to wait and see now.” But three weeks later, on October , , Nancy came home. The following month, she was diagnosed with Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome . Symptoms of SLOS dfer from person to person. Some people may have more symptoms than others and symptoms can range from mild to severe. Those with the syndrome also have abnormally low levels of cholesterol in their blood. Lisa knows of only two other iniduals in the North East with this condition – one of whom sadly died.Despite being given just  hours to live, Nancy defied doctors’ expectations, continuing to grow and develop. Although she remained under the care of several hospitals and specialists across the North East, Nancy lived a full le, Lisa said.She enjoyed her first Christmas at home, went on three holidays and laughed as she spent time in the water. But on July , , Nancy was taken to the University Hospital of North Tees by ambulance where she received treatment after Lisa noticed she was struggling to breathe.She sadly died on the children’s ward two days later of heart failure and sepsis.Lisa continued: “I was sat with her the whole time and one minute she was quiet and not moving much, then a few hours later she was lively and kicking her legs, playing. I was holding her in my arms and when I thought she’d gone to sleep, I put her back to bed and put her oxygen mask back on her and she just flopped to one side and was gone. She’d died in my arms. Doctors and nurses worked on her for  minutes. But she was ready to go – she was tired and she’d had enough. We say now that she didn’t want me to have to make that decision to give her open heart surgery which only has a % survival rate. “Nancy made her own decision.” Since Nancy’s passing in July last year, Lisa and her family have dedicated themselves to raising awareness of SLOS and raising money for the organisations who helped Nancy. She has raised and donated money, along with blankets and clothing, to the special care baby unit at the University Hospital of North Tees. Lisa said: “I can’t describe how thankful I am to everyone in the special care baby unit at North Tees - to Zoe Kitching and Jayne Jobling especially.“Jayne came to Nancy’s funeral and continues to be a great support to me, as are a lot of other nurses. Nancy simply wouldn’t have had her nine and a half months without the NHS.”Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Childrens HospitalBabies\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Researchers carrying blind taste tests concluded that supermarket own-brands are often not only cheaper when it comes to everyday essentials, but sometimes taste better. Examples include baked beans where, Which  says, shoppers could knock over £ off their shopping bill. Budget chain Lidl’s Newgate baked beans - p for g, p per g - were ranked the best value option. They cost less than half the price of Heinz beans, that Which  found cost £ for g tin. The savings are even greater for orange juice, at almost £ a year.

Clive Stephensonaposs loved ones say they were assured his plot would be next to his mother’s in Handsworth Cemetery, yet he has been buried on the very edge of the vast Birmingham burial ground.His sisters, Vivienne and Jean Honeyghan, say mourners were unaware of the change until Clive was placed in the ground on the day of his funeral. Then, it was too late to protest, Birmingham Live reports.Vivienne said: They could not have placed my brother farther from my motherthey tried. They’ve made him look like the black sheep of the family. To add to their anguish, father-of-seven Clive was placed in a plot so sodden, it was filling with water as the coffin was lowered into it, they say Birmingham City Council has met the family on-site in a bid to resolve the issue. They have offered to exhume the body, at their own cost, and place it in the grave of another sister, Ionia Stephenson, who died only months after Clive, a painter and decorator from Northfield.  The local authority has told them it cannot put Clive, one of nine siblings, close to his mother Rita’s -year-old grave because that section of the cemetery is no longer used for burials. But support worker Vivienne - a cousin of former boxing world champ Lloyd Honeyghan - alleges graves have been placed in the area since her brother’s funeral. Things have moved on since Clive’s death, from a brain tumour, in February . The grandmother of his three youngest children died and was buried close to him. For those children’s sake, the family no longer want his body exhumed. They want the council to pay for a memorial stone on Clive’s grave - as an acknowledgement of mistakes made - and say sorry. They are being supported by Bishop Desmond Jaddoo who conducted the funeral service at Handsworth’s New Le Wesleyan Church in March . For the bishop, the campaign is particularly poignant. Clive died in his arms after the cleric delivered the last rites. The dying man told Desmond in those final hours he wanted to be buried near his mother.  The bishop has dubbed the council’s handling of the matter “shoddy” and “arrogant”. He says the authority is no longer communicating with him or the family. Vivienne says she was too numbed by grief on the day of the funeral to fully comprehend her brother was being buried in the wrong plot. She said: “Clive’s last wish was to be buried near his mother and that was agreed. That was the plan. On the day of the funeral, it didn’t sink in, but I know now. I know one of my brothers asked, ‘why are we stopping here ’ On the day, grief does take over your mind, grief does blind you. “If I’d known, then and there, it was the wrong place I would’ve stopped it in a split second. A lot of the family were totally distraught, but, at the time, what can you do  “On the same day, I contacted the undertaker and said, ‘this is not what was agreed’. I was given an assurance they would look into it and, to use their words, ‘heads would roll’.” Vivienne has claimed she later learned a decision was made on the day of the funeral to change plots: the one where Clive was intended to be interred had become badly waterlogged. Yet he was placed in a pool of a grave. Even the bishop askedanything could be done to stop the water pouring in,” she said. “We paid so much money for that grave. We are a close family. He is miles from the rest of his family. His last wish has not been realised. The council messed up. We want them to take responsibility, we want an apology stating they have done this.” Those sentiments are echoed by sister Jean. The -year-old, from Handsworth, said: “I think this has been handled terribly. Now, the council don’t respond to our requests, they just blank us. “I was too distraught on the day to notice what was going on, I just assumed it was the right spot. I had to be led away because I was so distressed I was passing out. We are not asking for money, we just want it sorted. Our brother is not in the right place. I’m so emotional about it, it has broken me down.” Bishop Jaddoo is currently attempting to broker a solution. He told the Sunday Mercury: “I think the family have been treated shoddily, at no point were they told the grave was going to be moved. “Things have moved on. They no longer want their brother moved, they don’t want to go through the trauma again. His final wish was to be buried as close as possible to his mother. They buried him on the edge of Handsworth Cemetery, it could not be farther from his mother’s grave. “Birmingham City Council has failed to consult with the family, which shows arrogance by the council.” A spokesman for the local authority told the Sunday Mercury: “Unfortunately, the request for the late Mr Stephenson to be buried as close to his mother’s grave as possible was not passed onto Handsworth Cemetery prior to the funeral. However, any request to locate a grave in a specic area cannot be guaranteed due to the uncertainty of ground conditions, and the paperwork which the family of the late Mr Stephenson signed, makes this clear.

Iris Jones, , fell for Mohamed Ahmed Ibriham, , three years ago in  despite their massive -year age gap.The loved-struck couple married a year later in  but have had to spend time apart the past month after Mohamedaposs father fell ill and he rushed back to Cairo to visit him.But their month spent thousands of miles apart has lead Iris to a major revelation, and has helped her realise what a priceless gem her hubby is, Manchester Evening News reports.  Iris welcomed him home last weekend, then reflected on how lucky she is to have him on Facebook.The British grandma, from Somerset, was swept off her feet when she met Mohamed in  through a Facebook page for atheists. They tried to get married in Cairo just four days after they first met in person, but they didnapost have the right paperwork. They were eventually able to wed a year later, and he was able to move in with her shortly afterwards when he was granted a three-year visa. Iris wrote on Sunday: Love is knowing you look like s**t after a days housework and gardening, without a scrap of make up on dressed in my scruff! After a monthaposs absence, my wonderful husband will welcome me just the way I am, because thataposs what love is all about.Welcome home, Mohamed. Missing you this past month has made me realise what a priceless gem you are. This rough diamond of a we will be more appreciative of you in the future. In an earlier Facebook post, Iris uploaded a photo of a suitcase, and explained in the comments: My husband had to make an emergency dash to Egypt as his father was ill. The update comes after the pensioner made headlines in January  by sharing intimate details of their sex le.Speaking on ITVaposs This Morning, she had hosts Philip Schofield and Holly Willoughby blushing. Describing their first night of passion, Iris said: “Pretty rough. Nobody had been near me for  years. I thought I was a virgin again.“Can I say we used a whole tube of KY Jelly  I couldn’t walk the next day. I felt asI had been riding a horse. Saddle sore wasn’t in it. Anyway we got over that.”  The pairaposs romance caused a rt in Irisapos family, with her previously opening up about how her two sons, both in their mid-s, had struggled to come to terms with their mumaposs relationship with a man  years her junior.Speaking with the Sunday Mirror back in , she said: Darren [one of her sons] is worried Mohamed is just after my money and we had a big row which resulted in me asking him to leave the house.We have made up since, but I’ve asked him not to talk about it – I don’t want to argue. Her other son Steve, , was aposa bit wary,apos according to Iris, but said she thinks he will eventually accept Mohamed as his dad.“If he’s marrying me for my fortune he’ll be sadly disappointed because I live on a pension, she said to those who questioned why Mohamed was with her. I don’t suffer fools gladly. I’m honest and I’m truthful and I told him straight away he couldn’t be a freeloader. “In Egypt we were quite frivolous, going out to the best restaurants all the time and we split everything  . She said Mohamed had agreed to sign a pre-nup to prove his love for her. It’s me he wants – not my house, she said. “I’ve spent years making other people happy, now I just want to marry the man I love before I die.

Royal matchmakingAfter meeting at university and falling in love, Kate and Wills split in . The couple discussed the brief breakup during their engagement interview.Kate admitted: At the time, I wasn’t very happy about it, but it made me a stronger person. You find out things about yourself that maybe you hadn’t realised.I think you can get quite consumed by a relationship when you’re younger. I really valued that time for me as well, although I didn’t think it at the time. William added: We were both very young… we were both finding ourselves and being d­ferent characters. It was very much trying to find our own way and we were growing up, so it was just a bit of space and it worked out for the better. However before long they were back together, and Sam reportedly played a big part in their reunion. Despite awkwardness surrounding the breakup, the jockey decided to invite both of them to his aposFreakin Naughty-themed partyapos at his familyaposs Oxfordshire manson. According to MailOnline, Wills wore hot pants and a policeman helmet and Kate was dressed as a naughty nurse in fishnets. They were reportedly seen in deep conversation during the evening, and within just a few weeks they were back together. However Sam always plays down his role, saying in : There’s an idea that I was like Cupid with a bow and arrow.

The -year-old council worker moved into hotels and then a rental property as work was started by insurers but it stalled and the damage quickly worsened.Ian believes the bill to fix his digs in Walton Street in the cityaposs West End could now be as much as £million, reports the Daily Record. He said his le has been on hold this whole time with his home, which dates back  years, lying in ruins. He explained that pouring fat down the sink had originally blocked the drains and he was told by insurers Axa to move into a hotel for six weeks.Have you had a similar issue  Let us know at webnews@mirror The firm agreed to cover the cost of the flooring repair and move Ian into a hotel in . He says they took the keys off him, then kept them until last year. “I had spent seven years doing it up. It was my first home and one I thought I’d probably be in forever,” continued Ian. At first he was moved into posh hotels Malmaison and Blythswood Square while work was done to patch up the damage. But with the work dragging on, insurers moved him into a flat and gave him replacement furniture when all his possessions were put in storage. And the y delays meant the water damage had spread to the walls, with builders forced to strip them as well as the floors. The repair work halted and, when it wasn’t restarted by , Ian asked the Financial Ombudsman Serviceto intervene. He said: “It was incredibly frustrating. I was getting nowhere. It wasn’t just the cost of the property. All my possessions were put into storage, where they remain. I’ve had to replicate my le.”  An FOS ruling found Axa had “mistreated” Ian as well accusing Axa of treating him “with contempt”. Despite the damning report, Axa didn’t restart the work again until  – after two more rulings by the FOS. By this time, the concrete foundations of the basement home had been damaged and new quotes to fix the building stretched to an incredible £,. Builders put in a support frame for the walls and heating to dry out the flat but then walked away and haven’t been back. In  Ian bought another home after being out of his first for so long. Axa stopped paying his expenses in September  – including funding for the   radiators that blast hot air into the damp home, which cost £ per month and which Ian now covers. He added: “They gave me my keys back last year and I couldn’t believe what it has been left like. Since they stopped paying my expenses, I have invoiced them for my costs and it now runs to over £,. I’m paying the utilities, mortgages and council tax in two properties. “Axa said they would repair the work. I don’t want to settle. I’ve not heard from them since  and even my lawyer is now being snubbed.” Axa, whose most recent offer to settle was £,, said: “We sympathise with Mr Gibbon’s situation. However, the majority of damage to his property was not caused by the original water leak for which he is insured. We’ve offered a cash settlement and continue to communicate via his legal representative.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HousingAssociation of British Insurers\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Thrive scheme sees youth workers equipped to host workshops to improve the confidence of young people in dealing with their finances. Visitng the Norborok Youth Club in Wythenshawe, south Manchester, Rashford said: “A lot of kids are scared to go to a bank and that’s not surprising because they don’t teach you about money mindset at school. “For those who grew up in the sort of area that I did, it’s about what you don’t have, rather than what you could achieve.The positive and empowering element doesn’t register in their heads. “It’s not hard to reverse that but not many people are trying to change that. “I know so many talented young people who could really benefit from a program like this, who could actually propel themselves into something much bigger and achieving their goals.”As well as at Norbrook, the programme devised with the National Youth Agency is being piloted at St. Mary’s Youth Centre in Primrose Hill, north London and Sunderland’s Lambton Street Youth Centre. A national roll-out is scheduled for the summer. NatWest CEO Alison Rose told Rashford: “You’re mum’s given you the framework, so that you know what to do, which is really powerful. “We’re in people’s lives from the very beginning. “If we can give people the tools to be economically secure and know what to do and not to see something to be frightened of, it can be empowering of their le rather than something that holds them back.” The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

Martin Lewis and his Money Saving Expertteam asked social media followers for their best tips to help people who are suffering amid the c ost-of-living crisis. The team has compiled the Cost of Living Survival Guide to help Brits weather the price hikes, Hull Live reports.Families are expected to feel the sting this month as energy bills and National Insurance are increased. Council tax, fuel prices and food are also going up, leading to more people feeling the pinch. Introducing his teamaposs tips, Martin Lewis wrote: For some there is sadly no route to cut expenditure below income that fix will need political intervention.  For others, we need a collective endeavour, to work together to take financial pressures off where we can. And that is partly behind this guide. He explained the team had received thousands of replies from people with clever ideas about how to cut household expenditure. Martin described the response - which included more than , replies to his tweet alone - as overwhelming and uplting. One of the tips was to invest in a slow cooker to batch cook meals for all the family. They are available from Asda for as little as £. The Money Saving Expert team said batch cooking creates less food waste and reduces the likelihood of spending extra cash on takeaways.  One follower said they are apossaving a fortuneapos by using theirs more and more. Sharron Quaile wrote: A chef was on TV recently telling us all to get a slow cooker, as it costs p to cook a meal overnight. Made a cracking chilli the other night, gave my neighbour a portionand thereaposs one portion in the freezer. A user under the name of Living in Hope wrote: Iaposm using my slow cooker more and more these days to batch cook delicious soups, curries, stews etc then I freeze it in recycled takeaway containers. Saves a fortune all round. They added it did not cost much to invest in. It’s a standard sized one, only cost me about £ - very simple, no whistles or bells, but does the job, they wrote. The MSE guide also says that using a microwave is generally cheaper than an oven. It states a jacket potato would be more than  per cent cheaper to cook in the microwave rather than the oven.

Food and energy bills are rising and donapost even mention childcare costs.Everyone is feeling the pinch right now and looking for ways to save money.I have to admit, I had heard of the Too Good To Go app from a very good friend, who often shared how she had picked up some amazing bargains from the likes of Starbucks, Costa and Morrisons, Hull Live reports.For those who donapost know, the app lets people buy food at a great price every day to stop delicious fresh produce from going to waste at cafes, restaurants and shops, just because it hasnapost sold in time. You donapost know what you are going to get, so it can be a gamble, but I was willing to put it to the test. I had a long day at work and missed the chance to go to the supermarket for our weekly shop as needed to get my boys from school and nursery. Instead of spending £ plus on a takeaway for the four of us, and still wanting to get some nutrition, I put my faith in ordering two carvery magic bags from West Bulls pub, part of the Stonehouse pizza and carvery company.  I placed our order - which came to £. in total - what a steal ! - and my husband went to collect the bags at the specied time slot we had. When he got there, all he had to do was show our order on the app and the bag was waiting for us. When he got home and we opened the bag in front of us, I was blown away by the sheer amount of food. We could easily have fed another family-of-four. We had Yorkshire puddings, mounds of mashed potato and roasties, dozens of slices of tender roast beef, lashings of gravy, four humungous sausages, stuffing balls and lots of fresh vegetables including carrots, peas, broccoli, sweetcorn and cabbage.  I plated up for four - and there were still lots left over. I wouldnapost be exaggeratingI said we could have fed two more adults and two more children. And, most importantly - the taste  It was delicious and it tasted very fresh and no dferent to asyou were eating homecooked food. My personal favourite was the roast beef and vegetables , whereas my husband and boys loved the sausages and Yorkshire puddings. I knew it was good as the boys in the family were so stuffed, they couldnapost even manage a dessert. In-fact my husband couldnapost eat anything until late afternoon the following day. I will definitely use the app againwe fancy a treat and a bargain price. I also felt good that we had stopped food going to waste. I am even thinking of going for a magic bag from Starbucks or Costa for an afternoon work pick-me up.

However many churches have now realised their leather muffles are rotten as they have not been used since King George VIaposs death  years ago.As a result, leatherworkers have been inundated with orders as churches rush to ensure theyaposre ready for the sad day, reports the Mail on Sunday. Sales have reportedly doubled in the past few months. Vicki Chapman, from the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers, told the newspaper that adding the muffle turns the bellsapos normal dong, dong, dong into more of a thudding sound. She said: We have spent a lot of time talking to the Royal Household and Lambeth Palace about the day the monarch passes, which we hope will not be any time soon. It is important as it is about paying due reverence to the service of the monarch and commemorating her le.”  Last year full details of Operation London Bridge were leaked, giving a full day-to-day run down of what will happen when the Queen passes away. The day will be known as D Day, with the days following called D Day plus the number of days that have passed. For example the second day will be D Day Plus One. Prince Charles - who will become King upon his motheraposs passing - will address the nation on the day of her death, while the Prime Minister will be the first government member to issue a statement. Government departments have been instructed to have flags at half mast within  minutes of the announcement, with Cabinet members set to be called with the sad news and urged to show discretion.  The Queen will be buried  days after she dies, it is expected, and Charles will embark on a tour of the UK before the burial is held. The sovereignaposs coffin will lie in state for three days at the Houses of Parliament, with authorities anticipating hundreds of thousands of people to descend on London - sparking fears over gridlock, policing and even food shortages. Any other Parliamentary business is set to be suspended for  days, it is reported. The day of the funeral will be a Day of National Mourning, but employers will not be compelled to give staff a day off. The service will take place at Westminster Abbey, and a two minute silence will be held across the UK at noon. A committal service will be held at St Georgeaposs Chapel, which is at Windsor Castle, where the Queen will be buried at King George VI Memorial Chapel.

It is part of three demonstrations across the country today, the other two taking place at sites in Hertfordshire and Essex. With dozens of activists having also locked themselves in at the Buncefield and Grays terminals. Further UK-wide demonstrations have already added to fuel shortage problems at the pumps for motorists. Are you involved in or affected by the protest  Let us know at webnews@mirror  One in three petrol stations in the South have been closed as a result of the eco protests, which began on April . Around , pumps south of the Midlands are currently closed, the Campaign for Fair Fuel has claimed. Warwickshire Police said  arrests have been made over the weekend in connection with the ongoing protest activity in Tamworth.  JSO said as police made arrests, five of their members remained inside the caravan to continue work on the tunnel on Sunday. Their actions have had a drastic impact on fuel supplies in the Midlands. Those taken into custody in Warwickshire were arrested for offences including criminal damage, conspiracy to cause criminal damage and conspiracy to commit public nuisance.  It is understood up to  arrests have been made since the campaign started earlier this month. At around .am today,  people approached the gates of the Buncefield oil terminal in Hertfordshire and locked on, blocking the entrance.Four hours later, the same happened at the Grays Inter Terminal in Thurrock, with  activists climbing the loading bay pipework and locking themselves in.   people are currently being dealt with at the site by local officers, say Essex Police, which has made a total of  arrests in a week.Speaking today at the Tamworth demonstration, Rev. Tim Hughes, , a retired priest from Swindon, said:I’m here because our government is useless, they make a lot of noise but they are doing nothing.As a priest I have a duty of care for people, and also for creation.  What I’m doing here, with everyone in this caravan, is what our government should be doing – that is trying to protect our families and our loved ones from the appalling future that stands before us. I hope we can continue what we’re doing and stop the flow of oil,the government won’t.” The public will continue to see a heightened police presence in the vicinity of the site over the coming days.  Assistant Chief Constable Ben Smith said: “It has been another busy weekend for the force as protestors continue to target the Kingsbury site.As a result of unlawful protest activity another  people have been arrested and taken into custody. This weekend’s protest activity has been contained to the Piccadilly Way area and has caused little disruption to the wider community, or to the operations of the oil terminal. While we will always recognise and respect the public’s right to peaceful protest, we will take action against anyone who breaks the law or causes signicant impact on the local community. Finally I’d like to thank the public for their ongoing patience and offer reassurance that we continue to do everything we can to minimise disruption to both the local community.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Petrol pricesBPFuel povertyExtinction RebellionWarwickshire Police\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The -year-old monarch tested ­positive for coronavirus in February but carried on performing duties in isolation from Windsor Castle.She spoke about her condition during a video call with the Royal London Hospital to mark the official opening of its Queen Elizabeth Unit. Talking to former Covid patient Asef Hussain, and his we Shamina, the Queen said: “It does leave one very tired and exhausted, doesn’t it  This horrible pandemic. It’s not a nice result.” Mr Hussain was the third member of his family to be admitted to hospital with Covid in December .  While he was in a coma for seven weeks after being put on a ventilator, his brother died and his father passed away. Mrs Hussain told the Queen at one point there were  friends and family on a Zoom call praying for her husband. The monarch made them smile when she joked: “So you have a large family, or a large influence on people ”  On Wednesday, she heard how the -bed unit in East London was built in record time to treat around  patients. Her Majesty was told by one senior nurse: “We held their hands, we wiped their tears and we provided comfort.”  Hospital chaplain Imam Faruq Siddiqi explained that families “felt a sense of hope” when he visited their loved ones. “Although I didn’t hold any miracles, I hope I was able to bring some sort of comfort to them through my presence and prayers,” he said. The Queen said: “It obviously was a very frightening experience to have Covid very badly, wasn’t it ” He replied: “What made it worse was being by themselves.” “Exactly. So they were alone, too,” the monarch said.  She was also introduced to the men who built the care unit in just five weeks, Paul Chandler and Jeff Barley. Her Majesty said: “It is very interesting, when there’s some very vital thing, how everybody pulls together. Marvellous, isn’t it ” Mr Barley hailed the “little bit of Dunkirk spirit” involved, prompting the smiling monarch to reply: “Thank ­goodness it still exists.” The Queen, who had “mild cold-like” ­Covid symptoms, has been suffering from mobility issues, forcing her to cancel a number of public engagements. Buckingham Palace announced on Friday that she had decided not to attend an annual Easter church service. Prince Charles will for the first time represent her at the Royal Maundy Thursday service at St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle, Berks.

Brendon Grimshaw, from Dewsbury, in Kirklees, West Yorkshire, abandoned his high-pressured old le in the face of unemployment - before the age of  - and took an extended holiday. In , he purchased Moyenne, a tiny island just half a mile wide in the luxurious Seychelles, a cluster of islands in the Indian Ocean.The ex-journalist immediately fell in love with his new home, with its tranquil silence and wild tangle of vegetation, Yorkshire Live reports.Brendon lived almost completely alone on the island. Moyenne had been left abandoned for decades, prior to his arrival and was so overgrown that falling coconuts were said to never reach the ground.  It has previously been likened to a tiny rainforest erupting from the ocean. With the help of -year-old Rene Antoine Lafortune, the son of a local fisherman, Brendon set about forging paths through the undergrowth. They also planted trees in an attempt to transform the island. Brendon built a humble wooden home for himself. But to truly transform the island he knew he would need to nurture itaposs wildle back to full health. He gradually introduced giant tortoises to his corner of the Indian Ocean and eventually shared Moyenne with  of the indigenous creatures.  Brendonaposs relentless hard work inevitably attracted the attention of wealthy investors, who viewed the Seychelles as a tropical paradise and an ideal spot for a luxury holiday destination. The aposreal le Robinson Crusoeapos - also since compared to the Tom Hanks character in the  film Castaway - is said to have turned down close to £million for his small island. But he wanted to ensure its future in a dferent way, and not to line corporate pockets.

Met Office weather meteorologist Aidan McGivern said: Warmer weather is on the way for the start of the week, and we could even see C in the southeast.The general trend is for it to turn warmer with higher pressure increasingly likely through the week and into the following week. There is still the chance of some rain mainly in the west. Stubborn rainfall threatens to dampen spirits in Scotland and north-western Britain, he added. He said: Into Monday, low pressure becomes more and more erratic, but it looks likely that northern and western parts of the UK that bear the brunt of any wetter weather. Low pressure is slowly progressing from the west bringing some rain in on Sunday, most likely in north-west of the UK, western Scotland, western England and north Wales  Cold air remains in the far north with the potential for snowthat rain mixes with cold air as it approaches from the west.

However it turns out our bedding and mattress are a hotbed for bacteria and other gross things, and many people are guilty of not washing their sheets often enough.Some people may go a few weeks or even a month without changing the duvet cover, but the experts at online-bedrooms stress it needs to be done once a week.They explain that your favourite pillow can accumulate over several thousand times more bacteria than a toilet seat in just seven nights. Luckily, the organisms found on pillowcases are largely harmless and are simply a build up of skin cells, sweat and saliva. Another mistake many of us may be making is how often we change our mattress. Itaposs hardly an exciting purchase, so many people donapost really think about splashing out on a new one unless they need to.  However, it too is a nesting place for germs and you could be sharing your bed with yeast, mould and bacteria. As well as microbes, skin cells and food particles that are transferred to our mattresses from our bodies, a factor in making mattresses such a germy spot is gravity. Airborne particles of dust and debris float around the bedroom before settling on the bed. The experts recommend replacing your mattress every seven to eight years.Nic Shacklock from online-bedrooms said: “It is no secret that germs live all over our houses, however there are lots of hidden spots that we may not ever think about during our cleaning rituals.“Spots like pillowcases and curtains might look fresh and clean, they are hiding a range of nasty bacteria that could lead to enhanced allergies, unpleasant odours and skin issues.” Bur perhaps the most surprising germ hotspot is bedroom lamps, which collect a huge amount of germs but tend to be missed during cleaning. Their surfaces offer space for dust and dirt to settle and are common touch points so need to be wiped and disinfected every week.

But thanks to YouTube she has completely transformed her place on a budgetCarrie Kline with husband Adam and sons Rolly, three, Ruben, two, and Odie, six months. Image: Jam PressByPaige HollandShowbiz Audience Writer:,  Apr |commentsA mum transformed her family home for less than £ – learning DIY skills from YouTube videos. Carrie Kline, , a stay-at-home mum from Minnesota, US, and husband, Adam, , purchased a four-bed, detached home for ,in June . It was love at first sight for Carrie, who recalls the house feeling like home. The open layout and the space were a blank canvas, which gave her the opportunity to turn the house into a happy, airy and colourful place. But having no DIY experience, she enlisted the help of YouTube and got to work learning the fundamentals needed to transform the space. Firstly, she started by working on the living room, where she spent on shiplap boards for wall decoration and on pieces of pine wood to build a picture frame and floating shelves. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. I purchased a giant canvas from a thrt store and made my own art over it by mixing paint and spackle together, Carrie said. I built my own frame using pine and hung this on the wall as a statement piece. The shiplap was pre-primed MDF and I attached this using a nail gun, followed by painting it white.[Finally] I built my own floating shelves which hold my cookbooks and cutting boards.” In total, she spent on transforming her living space into a cosy area. In the master bedroom, she spent three days revamping the space with a few simple steps. She said: I primed and painted the entire room, with white on the top half and tan on the bottom.  I bought some lattice strips to do picture moulding around the bottom of my walls, which I cut to size using a mitre saw. I nailed these on and painted them tan to match the wall. Using a pine board, I built a trim piece that went around the room and served as a ider between the tan and white. On the wall behind our bed, I used faux brick ling and screwed these onto the wall, before painting them white.  I built a very simple shelf out of poplar wood with some brackets and all of this completely transformed the room. In our powder room, it felt dark and small, so I painted this white and added a colourful floral mural on the wall. I built some more floating shelves and kept the existing vanity mirror, but changed the look by covering it in cement, using lattice strips and painting it pink. I painted [the kids’ bathroom] and added faux herringbone tile backsplash by using paint.  I used a Sharpie pen to draw out the grout line so that people think it’s real tiling. For the mirror, I used lattice strips again and painted them black, as well as the light fixture and water faucet. I made a gallery wall using thrted picture frames and painted another floral mural on the other wall.” In total, she spent turning the bathroom into a light, fresh space.Carrie’s favourite area is her front porch, as she always wanted somewhere to relax and watch her kids play on a summer evening. She painted and stencilled the area with a floral design and refinished second-hand furniture, as well as hanging some lights and baskets to make the space feel homely. She juggled her projects while her sons, Rolly, three, Ruben, two, and Odie, six months, were sleeping she said, and managed to turn around the final product within a few days.  She said: I really value my time with the kids, as I know how quickly time can pass. I started DIY as a creative outlet for myself, so I made a goal to work on projects while they’re sleeping. They’ve learned to sleep through most noises really well, so I don’t need to try and work quietly. There has been plenty of times when they’ve woken up mid-project, but I’ve learned to accept that things don’t always go according to plan.  I’ve transformed my laundry room into a mini-workshop, where I created storage space for all my tools and paints. Having my tools accessible means I can get started much quicker as soon as they fall asleep, as well as making clean up time easy. In total, Carrie estimates that she’s spent transforming the property into her perfect family home. As she’s worked on a budget, she has many tips which help to keep costs low without having to sacrice quality.  Carrie added: I don’t let any material go to waste as I’m always saving every bit of wood I have and finding ways to use the scrap for my next project. I often purchase paint from the aposoopsapos section in stores or even mix my own colours using paint I have on hand. Always shop thrt stores or build yourself before buying anything new. I’ll always choose the route of saving money, evenit takes more time. We’ve added so much moreto the house, so I definitely feel we’ve added lots of value in appeal.I have zero plans for slowing down and I’m participating in an online event where I have eight weeks to complete my bathroom on a budget. For me, DIY is so much more than the finished product and there’s not much I’d rather do than build and create something. I share my projects online because I hope to inspire and give courage to other women who also want to learn because it’s been so le-changing for me. You don’t have to wait for a full remodel before you can make a signicant impact. Start small and learn to enjoy the process.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Limescale is a hard, chalky deposit, that can be found around the home in bathrooms and kitchens around taps, toilet bowls, baths, pipes and any water area you come into contact with on a daily basis. Not only does it look unsightly, but it can also do a lot of damage to your pipes. Thankfully, thereaposs one ingredient that can help to remove limescale in just five minutes - and itaposs sitting in your kitchen cupboard. Cleaning fans shared their top tips on how to get rid of the stains on Reddit, but one, in particular, stood out. One user said the secret to ridding the stubborn grime is to use something acidic.  F or more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. They said: Start with white vinegar, though brown works just as well. Put some in a spray bottle, spray it on, wait five mins then give it a scrub. Do this a few times. As limescale is made of calcium carbonate, an alkaline, the high percentage of acetic acid it contains works to break through the hard deposits. The Reddit user continued: If vinegar does no good, you can try other acids. The strongest one is aposSpirit of Saltsapos. Use with great caution, follow the instructions on the bottle, ventilate the area thoroughly and wear protective gear as it will advise. I applied a dilute solution with a brush and it worked a treat for me. You can pick up white vinegar in most supermarkets for as cheap as £.This comes as a man shared the aposcorrectapos way to fit toilet rim block. Fabian Coghetto said that instead of hooking the item over the toilet bowl like most of us do, you should push it inside the rim of the toilet. It should then lock into place. This means that the toilet seat will sit flush rather than resting on the plastic.Take a look at how itaposs done, here. Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

The company executive was humbled to see the end result after arriving in Lutsk - now a ghost town - on Friday evening. Mr Blackmore, who founded commercial intelligence specialists Audere International in , said: To be given this incredible reception by the Deputy Mayor of the Oblast, the region where we were going, where there were speeches, and patriotic songs, and the appreciation, made the journey worthwhile.  When you drive through checkpoints, when you drive through cities in curfew, when  per cent of the city of Lutsk - which is , people - have left the city, youaposre going into a ghost town. And when you see what is happening, to be able to bring the aid to the people was a very important journey. Audere, which provides intelligence to parties wishing to make overseas investments, has already been active in the effort in Ukraine since the start of Russiaaposs invasion, helping with evacuations and conducting five resupply operations.Mr Blackmore said it was important that the company, which did business in Russia and eastern Europe before the invasion back, should put our shoulders to the wheel and assist in Ukraine.We had been involved in evacuating people out of Afghanistan last August, he said. We did not expect some seven months later to be involved in a second evacuation, this time in Europe. But when it happened we decided that we did actually want, and we had the right operating template, to be able to contribute to the humanitarian aid, to the evacuation and to providing support for the Ukrainian people. As part of that effort, the company has delivered two tonnes of food and  litres of liquids, as well as essential items like first aid and clothes, and extensive medical supplies. But Mr Blackmore was moved to do something more personal after speaking to an American friend of his, Herb Holtz.  Mr Blackmore explained: He said, aposI want to do something meaningful. aposMy grandfather was Ukrainian, he left in . I want to do something more than write a checkapos. So I said, aposLetaposs buy a couple of ambulances, one each, and letaposs both first take them down, take them into Ukraine, and see the end resultapos. The ambulances were sourced were sourced via a charity in the UK and filled with two tonnes of medical supplies. And although they were delivered to Lutsk, in western Ukraine, Mr Blackmore said he had been assured the vehicles and supplies would be going right to the front line. Theyaposre going to Bucha, for example, he said. And weaposre very happy that the ambulances were really properly prepped, properly serviced, so that we know theyaposre going to last what was obviously going to be a long journey for them. And they, I suspect, are going to get a lot of usethe situation continues as it is right now.  Mr Blackmore praised the generosity of the British people, saying: Thereaposs so many people doing so much, whether theyaposre working in food kitchens, or whether theyaposre helping refugees or whether theyaposre volunteering to drive ambulances to Poland. He said the Ukrainians really appreciate the help and support coming from the UK. And although he said there was a sense of satisfaction from having done his own bit to help, he stressed there was more to be done. What impressed us most was the cheerfulness and the resolve of the Ukrainian people, he said. And itaposs very important that we stand even closer behind them and give them the more support and weaposre going to look to do that ourselves.

Now pictures have emerged of inside the plant - the site of the worldaposs worst nuclear disaster in  - showing a floor blanketed with discarded clothes, cups and sleeping bags, with underwear and towels hanging from a line below the ceiling.Ukrainian Interior Minister Denys Monastyrskyy told CNN it is not known where the Ukrainian guards are, but it is feared they have been taken to Russia through Belarus. They were kept here for  days without sufficient lighting and food, he told the American news outlet. They were not allowed outside. On the last day, they were taken away from here in an unknown direction. Today we know nothing about their fate, unfortunately. The Russian military went through all Ukrainian clothes, personal belongings, like dogs, in search of, probably, money, valuables, laptops. There was looting here. The Russian military stole computers and equipment.  Engineer Valeriy Semonov was one of those trapped inside the site and spoke to the BBC about how they had to steal fuel from the Russians when the power was cut off for three days, which could have caused catastrophic results. Radioactive material could have been released, he said, The scale of it, you can well imagine. He added: I wasnapost scared for my le. I was scared about what would happenI wasnapost there monitoring the plant. I was scared it would be a tragedy for humanity. The Chernobyl nuclear plant is no longer a working power station, but it was never fully abandoned and requires constant monitoring after reactor number four exploded  years ago.

Washington is reportedly banking on the growth of the western alliance from  to  members, as a direct consequence of President Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.US officials said both Nordic countries attended talks between NATO’s foreign ministers last week, during which membership was a “topic of conversation and multiple sessions”, The Times reported. “How can this be anything but a massive strategic blunder for Putin ” one senior American official asked.Washington is expecting Finland’s application in June, while Sweden is expected to follow suit soon after. Both are neighbouring countries to Russia, which sits just across the Baltic Sea. Finland also shares an -mile land border with Russia.Finland’s prime minister Sanna Marin has said it was time for her country to seriously reconsider its stance on joining the alliance.  Speaking on the weekend, she said Russia was not the neighbour she once thought it was. “I think we will have very careful discussions, but we are also not taking any more time than we have to in this process, because the situation is, of course, very severe,” she said. Similarly to Finland, Sweden is carrying out a security policy review expected to be completed by the end of the month. Magdalena Andersson, the Swedish prime minister, said a fortnight ago that she did “not exclude Nato membership in any way”. While the two countries were working together to build domestic consensus, the final decisions would be taken independently. The countries are working together to build domestic consensus but, officials emphasise, the final decisions will be taken independently. Late in February, just days after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Vladimir Putin threatened Sweden and Finland with apos military and political consequencesaposthey joined NATO.Maria Zakharova, Russiaaposs foreign ministry spokeswoman, said there would be serious repercussions for their close Arctic neighbours. Zakharova said during a news briefing: Finland and Sweden should not base their security on damaging the security of other countries and their accession to NATO can have detrimental consequences and face some military and political consequences. Speaking to Sky News on Friday, Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov doubled down on this warning. “Everything is about mutual deterring and should one side — and we consider Nato to be one side — be more powerful than the other, especially in terms of nuclear arms, then it will be considered a threat for the whole architecture of security and it will take us to take additional measures,” he said. NATO now has , troops under its direct command in eastern Europe, from the Balstic to the Black Sea. Its force has increased nearly tenfold since Russia invaded Ukraine on February .  The alliance is making plans to deploy a permanent full-scale military force on members’ borders to prevent a further Russian invasion as it adapts to a “new reality. NATO’s general secretary, Jens Stoltenberg, said Putin’s actions had provoked a “fundamental transformation” of the military coalition, which would reflect the long-term consequences of the war in Ukraine. The bolstering of NATO’s military power would be carried out with the aim of enabling countries that share borders with Russia and Belarus to repel an attempted invasion. If Finland and Sweden join NATO, Putin would be expected to redeploy troops to his northwestern flank, putting further pressure on his stretched military. European diplomats have said the addition of both countries to NATO would signicantly bolster the group’s capabilities, particularly in terms of intelligence-gathering and air force powers. Nato membership for Finland and Sweden would prompt redeployment on Putin’s northwestern flank, further stretching his military, which has been badly affected by Ukraine’s resistance and the prolonged conflict.

They work well in a sunny or partially shaded area in fertile well-drained soil.Climbing jasmine can be highly scented, with ieties that flower in summer and winter. All produce pretty flowers and are fairly easy to grow against walls or up trellis.There are some fun options for kids to plant such as sunflowers, snapdragons and the four o#clock flower.If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o#clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock # so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.You will need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot. Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types # bush and cordon. Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall, supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom. Expect the inevitable April showers but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn.It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors. Just watch out for frosts.Top three jobs this month:"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 18 2021 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Surely the council must accept its plans # even as outline proposals # for school clusters should be reconsidered.Teachers are largely opposed, unions are against it, parent councils are certainly in opposition.

The goal settled the Royal Burgh side, and Lewis Montgomery added a brace on  and  minutes.In Mowi South Division , Kilmory ran out - winners against a young Oban Celtic second team at sun-drenched MacRae Park, Lochgilphead.Goals from Sandy Leiper on  minutes and three by Alex Cunninghamsealed the points for the Kilmory.The home side enjoyed a good first half and would be disappointed with aof just two goals. Play was more scrappy in the second period but Kilmory managed to close out the match.The club thanks Crinan Construction for sponsoring the match and all the supporters who came out to watch.In the same ision, Inveraray and Bute juniors drew - at the Winterton.Bute started the match strongly, using their pace and youth to advantage. It did not take long for Craig Speirs to gave the islanders the lead on six minutes, rling home from the angle.Two minutes later Inveraray were level, Neil Campbell showing scoring from  yards.Bute again took the lead in the th minute when Aray failed to clear and Aiden McGregor took advantage.The home side settled into the game after that setback and started to play some decent shinty, though, despite creating numerous chances, the sides went into half time with the score - to Bute.Inveraray started the second half the better of the two sides, giving the youthful Bute side problems settling.With Inveraray pressing it took until the th minute for the equaliser to arrive Neil Campbell again driving the ball home. Bute pressed to find a winner but the Inveraray backline held firm.In the Women#s Camanachd Association Mowi South Division , Dunadd Camanachd scored three goals in either half to defeat Uddingston - at St Ambrose High School in an excellent advert for women#s shinty # both teams fielding young players with a bright future ahead.Dunadd looked slightly nervy starting their first game of the season but a well-taken goal from Eilidh Cameron settled the team.The next  minutes were end-to-end but the Dunadd defence stayed strong with some excellent saves from stand-in goalie Laurene Cameron.At the other end  Eilidh E Cameronwas tenacious and set up Dunadd#s second as she slotted the ball to Rhian McCuaig, who finished superbly for her first goal for the club.Uddingston, though were not going to give up and, after a spell of pressure, Christie Robertson struck an excellent shot straight in the top corner.Dunadd didn#t let heads go down. After some excellent play on the wing, Alice Adair found striker Eilidh Cameron whose shot was judged to be kicked away by the goalie.Cameron didn#t hesitate from the spot and finished low to the goalie#s left.In the second half Dunadd#s experience started to show as they settled into the game.McCuaig completed her brace, Nicola Smyth finished from close in and Cameron went on to get her hat-trick.That winning feeling # Kilmory#s Sandy Leiper in their match against Oban Celtic juniors.

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world, walked across Scotland numerous times, climbed many of its peaks and now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves. All her walks can be booked as bespoke guided experiences.*The  bus service is only available on schooldays term time you would need to start and finish at Muasdale. The Scottish Citylink bus times are not suitable.**If you start and finish at Muasdale, carefully check tide tables and aim for an ebb low tide for the whole coastal section from Killean to Muasdale.With sandy beaches, an igneous dyke splitting red sandstone and the impressive waterfalls on Clachaig Water reflecting geological history, man’s time here is reflected in a prehistoric dun, the old settlement of Achaglass and abandoned dwellings that span right through the centuries.Amongst these are the wonderful old ruins of St John’s church at Killean, parts of which date back to the th Century.Although you can no longer go inside it is still possible to walk around the graveyard and view the impressive carved tombstones from a distance.According to Canmore records the burial vault is that of the MacDonalds of Largie it is believed they helped prevent further deterioration of the church in the mid-th Century.The start point is A’Chleit Church, which replaced St John’s in the th Century. Leaving the car park head south via a short path to the beach.Follow the beach south for the next .km. En route a couple of small streams are crossed.It is sometimes easier to go above the beach, especially as you approach the large rocky outcrops near Muasdale.Look out for a path that takes you up to a stile just before you reach Clachaig Water .Cross the stile and main road. Turn right to gain a view from the new bridge to the old bridge over Clachaig Water.The village store is m south of the bridge should you need refreshment. Return north from the bridge and take the first turning right .Follow the track up the hill for m until you reach a field on your right. Cross this diagonally towards the west corner of the forestry plantation.On reaching it turn right into the woods to look at the waterfalls at the bend, which, I gather, are called Peter’s Hole . The drop is sudden and vertical, so take care!From the falls head upriver, descending into the plantation, before re-ascending northeast above the river and trees.Follow the field edge you will go over a small knoll and reach a fence line. Turn left up the side of South Crubasdale farm to rejoin the track you left earlier.Turn right, then after m turn right again. The track will drop you down to a bridge over Clachaig Water before rising to a T-Junction.Turn left. After m look for a gate on your left. To visit the Duncross the field diagonally andthe same way. Please keep dogs on a lead.Continue northeast on the track for m to a Y junction. Bear left past the now empty Low Clachaig farm and bear left again at the next Y junction. Continue to High Clachaig. There is a ruined farm off to your right en route.At High Clachaig it is best to go round the buildings and walls to the right before rejoining the little used track that heads northeast into the forestry.The track is grassy and boggy # especially near the stream crossing # but easy enough walking for the km to Achaglass.Achaglass is an old settlement that appears to have been rented to a shepherdand his family back in . It has now partially disappeared amongst forestry, like so many old sites in Argyll.Continuing northeast up the Clachaig Water from Achaglass there is a fine sheep fank, m beyond this there is a bridge.Cross the bridge and take the forestry track northeast for the next .km until you reach the Kintyre Way.Note there is a cattle grid with no side gate en routeyou have a dog you may need to lt them over the fence.Turn left. You will now follow the Kintyre Way down to the coast for over km.You can take a slight short cut by taking a left at NR and then bearing right at NR down to the ruin of Braids, but it is muddier.Near the bottom, after a small dam, a left turn will drop you down through the eerily empty houses of Killean to the main road. Opposite is St Johns’ church. Cross over with care.After visiting the church take the lane on the north side of Killean burn towards the sea # gate climbing may ensuelocked.

As the country emerged from its second lockdown, football was one of the few after-school activities available. As a result, many more girls came along to try the sport for the first time with the existing mixed teams at the club.Sensing the enthusiasm, Ally Robb, LVSC chairman and one of the club’s coaches, saw the potential to develop an all-girls team for the first time. With the support of fellow coach Bob Campbell, he ran an initial training session for P-P girls. This was quickly followed by another mini milestone: a first ever LVSC U girls’ game in a friendly against Penicuik in June .“After a great first game, coaches and parents alike were keen to ensure this new chapter in the club’s history was given every opportunity to succeed,” said Ally.In the nine months since the inaugural game, the club has extended training to include girls from P to P. Three new coaches subsequently joined the team and, with the support of parent helpers, they organise weekly training sessions and games.The club and team are now affiliated with the Scottish Women’s Football Association and this year have attended tournaments in Lauder, Galashiels and Coldstream, playing a mix of three, four and seven-a-side games..removeAnd it’s fair to say that the girls are loving the experience.

If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky and wherever the light is a sunflower will find it.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o’clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock – so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.To grow tomatoes successfully, you need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot.Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types – bush and cordon.Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall and are supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall, transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom.#Expect the inevitable April showers this month but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn,# said a spokesperson.#It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors.

Campbeltown-Machrihanish area that the farming community were unable to finance such a scheme themselves in its entirety andhe would devise some new plan to carry out this urgent work for which a rate or levy to cover the interest charges on capital expenditure could be raised from the proprietors and farmers whose lands would be restored to regular cultivation.Mr W McNair Snadden MP, Joint

Many are willing to go the extra mile to help.I am pleased to congratulate, and thank, Campbeltonians for their collective attributes, which the rest of the country would do well to aspire to.I would like to set the record straight regarding South Islay Development ’s Port Ellen playing fields #community hub# development which was covered in last week’s Campbeltown Courier.I am one of the objectors who went round every door in Port Ellen. We gathered hundreds of signatures against this, which got the first lot of plans scrapped.So SID changed the plan to suit the roads department and resubmitted the planning application.Most of the objectors didn’t know they had to object again.SID didn’t knock on every door and ask how folk felt about it. They put leaflets through people#s doors and a lot of people didn’tthem.They also had open days, normally through the week, when people are working and can’t attend.And that is the reason I, for one, couldn’t attend the virtual planning, protective services and licensing committee meeting. People have full-time jobs and can’t attend these things at am on a Thursday.The community of Port Ellen is ided over this development.This was always intended to be a community space and now it’s being developed for tourism.We know and understand something has to happen in the area but it should have been to benefit the community, not more space going to tourism.The campervans are an eyesore but don’t think we’re saying we don’t want them on Islay, but there are places better suited for them outside the village.Equally, the people in these campervans will probably pick somewhere they have a good view, quiet and relaxing, rather than by the main road, where all ferry traffic passes.Islay will soon be unrecognisable, all for tourists and nothing for the locals.

Since God is eternal and therefore stands outside of time, it may be that every moment in time is always present with him.And yet, the Bible often speaks of God not remembering something – people’s sins.One example is Jeremiah chapter  verse : ‘For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.’It is not that God forgets in the way that I forget where I have left my wallet or car keys.In the Bible, ‘to remember’ is another way of talking about keeping a promise. We use ‘to remember’ in that way too.‘Don’t forget to phone me when you arrive home,’ shouts Morag, as her daughter heads home after visiting her.‘Don’t worry, Mum. I’ll remember.’Sure enough, Morag’s phone rings later, and the voice at the other ends says: ‘It’s me. I’m home.’God does not forget our sins in the sense of pretending they never happened or ignoring our failure and refusal to do what he wants.Instead, he remembers his promise to forgive the sins of anyone who asks him to do so.He is able to do this because Jesus has died on the cross to deal effectively with sin’s penalty.So, when you trust in Jesus, God refuses to hold your sin against you, but treats you in the way you do not deserve.

sunshine was breaking through the last remaining wisps of morning mist. Signs of spring, my favourite season, were visible all over our garden. The blackbird was perched on the fence and I opened the window so I could hear his song better.I watched him for a moment. He is a regular visitor but he seemed particularly vocal this morning. Then I noticed there was a female blackbird as well. I felt privileged that I could witness their visit to our small rewilded garden, which we have tried to make bird friendly.Then the singing stopped and they both seemed to be peering down at the patch of soil where we have recently planted wildflower seeds and vegetables. The male landed on the soil and began hopping in a zig-zag fashion, stopping every now and then. At first I wonderedthis was a dance to impress the female, but soon realised he was looking for breakfast.Blackbirds love earthworms and I supposed the overnight rain on the exposed soil of our newly seeded flowerbed meant it was a good moment to go hunting for his favourite food. He was looking for worms, but also listening for them, as blackbirds can hear the sound of them moving underground. I find that almost dficult to believe, but apparently it’s true. It was fascinating and joyous to watch.But I don’t knowhe caught any worms. My attention was taken by the sound of our kids getting up. School day morning routine beckoned. Time seems to vanish in the drama of it all, and so after I kissed my we goodbye as she headed for work, I quickly got busy making the kids’ breakfast.It was at this moment an emotion overtook me: guilt. I often feel a sense of guilt when I know others are suffering terribly. One solution could be to disconnect from it, not think about it, or even try not to care. After all, we have our own family worries and problems to sort out.But the guilt comes from the empathy I feel and I don’t want to disconnect from that. I don’t think I could stop caring evenI tried. The world needs more empathy, not less. But there is a downside to it: it can become overwhelming and even affect my mental health.Guilt in this context is such a useless emotion. It doesn’t help those who are suffering and it certainly doesn’t help the person feeling empathy. So as my guilt arrived at the breakfast table that morning, I gave it short shrt and became determined to replace it with two things.The first was to learn the lesson the blackbird had taught me moments before, to enjoy the moment and the gts around me. It put me in mind of a beautul short film of the artist David Hockney, made by Louisiana Museum of Modern Art. It’s titled The World is Beautul and he talks about the beauty around us and that when bad news is dominating our senses, the arrival of spring is good news. The important thing is to really notice the gts around us, which Hockney says he does with “intensity”.So I took up his advice and, on my walk to school with my son, I made sure I was fully present for him as he talked about monsters, Dr Who and his favourite scenes from Clash of the Titans. I savoured every moment of our connection and conversations.On myto the house, I made an extra effort to notice the beauty of spring’s arrival and other gts: the diamond-like sparkle of the dew drops on the grass, and the patterns made by the children running and playing amongst them, the dedication of George the lollipop man in keeping us all safe, the brief and faint rainbow in the sky above us, and the shimmer of the sea below the trees in bloom, and the yellow carpet of daffodils dancing in the breeze the birdsong, the smiles and greeting of people, the sense of community, the warmth of the sun the fact of being alive and having loved ones in my le.The walk was only four minutes, but when we notice the beauty and gts we have around us with the intensity that Hockney mentions, then we don’t measure with time.The second thing was to change my guilt into acts of compassion that can make a dference, no matter how small. Donate, write a letter, send a message of support, whatever. That way, empathy works for positive change for those in need.I already knew all this, but it seems I constantly need to relearn it. And that morning, the blackbird helped me to do so. His song was an awakening gt, his zig-zag hop across the soil a reminder that we should have moments when we pause to look and listen with “intensity.”Asto confirm this, he was still there on the fence when I ed home. I’d love to say he had a worm in his beak, as that would have been such a poetic ending, but he didn’t. His companion wasn’t there and he flew off as I watched him.He’d made my morning by making a positive dference in ways he will never know or understand, and not just for me."},{"url":null,"title":"pictures-thousands-new-trees-planted-butterdean","story":"At the end of last month, local school groups and corporate volunteers got out their gloves, boots and shovels to help plant new trees.The trust also ran a community day on Saturday, March , that saw  people participate and help populate the wood with thousands of native trees., Abbie , Dad Corin and Daisy the dog! \" alt\"East Lothian Courier: This is the McCrum family of Tranent.Mum Leigh, Ella , Abbie , Dad Corin and Daisy the dog! \" class\"editor-image\"The McCrum family of Tranent.  Mum Leigh, Ella , Abbie , Dad Corin and Daisy the dog! Woodland Trust Scotland recently acquired two open fields adjacent to Butterdean Wood, thanks to support from Bank of Scotland.

He also appears to be unaware that policy and development of Scotlands rail network will continue to be the responsibility of Transport Scotland whose rail ision is led by Bill Reeve, an experienced railwayman and an eminent member of the engineering profession, who is highly esteemed throughout the UK and beyond. The recent electrication between Glasgow Central and Paisley Canal was widely acclaimed, having been delivered at a cost substantially less than similar projects where in the UK.Scotland is well rid of the Abellio management and Mr Macwhirters unsupported scepticism is unlikely to be borne out by events.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.MAKE ALL TRAINS AND BUSES FREEIT’S a pity that the tenor of Ian Macwhirter’s piece on the newly-nationalised rail services is predominantly negative before Holyrood does anything and I suspect this is just the start of an agenda that will eventually blame all the ails of our sub-standard rail network on those dammed Nats.Why is it referred to as “NatRail” and not “OurRail”  Eventhe present Holyrood executive is as gormless and ally inadequate as the previous providers of the service were, it will cost the general public less than it has been doing as no shareholders will be feasting on the dripping roast that privatisation of the rail services had handed them on a plate.As the reality is that one way or another the general public ultimately pay for everything, why not make all rail and bus transport free and paid for by the taxpayer  Make it a real public transport, do away with tickets and money altogether.I know from personal experience since I got my old-fogies free bus pass it has dramatically reduced my reliance on the car for short journeysI knew I could jump off and on any train I wanted to without a ticket I’d think about getting rid of the car altogether.David J Crawford, Glasgow.LET THE UNION RUN TRANSPORTI NOTE Iain Macwhirters article on the faith that the travelling public might, or might not, have in Scotlands rail service. With his comments on the power of the RMT union when it comes to pay and the provision of an efficient and effective service and the need for cabins on ferries, I wonderedthe answer would be to negotiate with the RMT on the basis that it be given total responsibility for the management and running of all rail and ferry services in Scotland.With such responsibility comes accountability and they just might acknowledge that they have a duty of care for the proper provision of transport and for paying passengers and goods. It would at least be beneficial to see them put their money where their mouth is. If over a period of time the RMT succeeded in managing our transport infrastructure, praise would be justied. If it failed it would then be found wanting and deserve the same fate as Abellio.Ian Gray, Croftamie.TIME TO END THIS FARES DISCREPANCYBEFORE the pandemic I used to travel monthly by train from Arbroath to Gourock to have lunch with old Clan Line shipmates. A dayusing my senior railcard and split ticketingcost around £, butI decided to stay overnight with my son in the Greenock area the fare was £. Occasionally I would drive and not once did my car stop on the Erskine Bridge and say “it’s Good Friday Christmas Eve or are you stopping over, because you will have to put another two gallons in the tank”. The distance was  miles  days of the year and that’s what you should pay for.We have not long had our hourly Aberdeen service restored, and the first time I used it I had tovia Edinburgh because a train broke down between Stirling and Dunblane, cancelling all trains north for several hours.No doubt ScotRail would say “ah well,you’re actually getting a bargain with £” but would you look at it like that  RET on Calmac suggests not.David Fyfe, Arbroath.BBC PURSUING ITS OWN RACE AGENDAIT was called Disclosure: The Truth About Scotland And Racism . A far more appropriate title would have been The BBC Take On Racism In Scotland.Ever since the ghastly death of George Floyd , the BBC has been following an agenda that England is a similar dystopian racist nightmare which few of us would recognise. It flies in the face of recent worldwide academic research stating England is a tolerant multi-cultural society.Clearly, the BBC, as with a criticised Panorama documentary in January , has decided Scotland will be treated in the same way. I would have expected a highly experienced broadcasterto have presented such a sensitive topic but we got young, Scottish, black, former model Jean Johansson. From the start of the documentary she admitted that she had been unaware of racism in Scotland yet, by the end, concluded that we were becoming much more racist, quite a jump in  minutes. As the we of former Rangers player Jonatan Johansson, it was surprising she struggled to name one of the many current black players in Scotland before settling on Chris Iwelumo,who hung up his boots in . One problem, which undermined her argument throughout, was her reliance on historic evidence. Cue the ghastly  coverage of bananas thrown at Mark Walters or solicitor Aamer Anwars abhorrent story of police abuse in . Similar stories in that period were all too commonplace.Surely the documentary should have focussed on the Scotland of today  In  there were , racial incidents reported to the police. The current figure is ,, a reduction of  per cent. Many pupils are taught Modern Studies where race relations, racism, prejudice, discrimination and stereotypes are covered. I would like to think education is having an effect in stamping out the cancer of racism. Certainly the Census of  showed that many of the top jobs in Scotland have many Scots of Chinese, Indian and Pakistani origin. Professor Nasar Meer was convinced that Scots of ethnic origin do suffer discrimination but do not report it. He offered no evidence.My greatest concern was the willingness of Mr Anwar to refer to the Sheku Bayoh case as more evidence of Police Scotland discrimination but this is still under investigation by the public inquiry of Lord Bracadale. Suffice to say PIRC investigated the case and the Lord Advocate brought no charges.Yet again the BBC has tarnished its historic reputation for impartiality.John V Lloyd, Inverkeithing, Fe.WHY NOT CHOOSE LIVING HERE NOVELIST and separatist mouthpiece Irvine Welsh has criticised the Scottish Tories for adapting words from Trainspotting as a device to highlight past and current SNP failings. Fair enough, I guess. But what does Welsh, from the comfort of his Miami sun-lounger, really have to contribute to any discussion about the reality of le in Scotland today  He hasnt lived in Scotland for many years . If he had, perhaps he could at least contribute to the debate in an informed manner, instead of hurling abuse at us from , miles away.Martin Redfern, Melrose.WEST CAN BE DESTRUCTIVE TOOI WATCHED a movie on Netflix the other night called Official Secrets. It tells the story of whistle-blower Katherine Gunns extraordinary effort to highlight the lies of George W Bush and Tony Blair in the lead-up to the Iraq war. She was an amazing lady and risked her freedom to expose the truth. It is particularly relevant at the moment during the Putin-led invasion of Ukraine.Both wars were are illegal, unprovoked acts of aggression, with enormous civilian death tolls involving the complete destruction of innocent countries. Putins Russia has been quite rightly severely sanctioned and hopefully Putin himself politically damaged and on his way out of power. After watching this movie, Messrs Bush and Blair were no better when it came to Iraq shame on them both. The so-called democrats of the West can be just as destructive when it suits them.Paul Morrison, Glasgow.WE SHOULD STOP FOREIGN AIDTHE latest report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says what the  countries in the world have to do to tackle climate change, but few are listening.

However, Holyrood and local authorities lack the powers to do this and Anas Sarwar wouldn’t even sign a joint-party letter demanding the devolution of these powers. Also, Labour voted against doubling the Scottish Child Payment to help hard-pressed families.Other than high energy costs, Brexit is the biggest cause of UK austerity and falling exports is causing real problems for our businesses, yet Sir Keir Starmer told LBC on Wednesday that “theres no case for rejoining the EU” and is in favour of the most expensive nuclear energy option which will add hundreds on to household bills for years to come. Scotland can’t afford UK Labour in power.As a leading energy-exporting country Scotland does not need nuclear power stations and should be focusing on the production of hydrogen fuel cells, the clean energy future for gas boilers, cars and ferries.Fraser Grant, Edinburgh.* GROWING up in the s, we were informed that Scotland led the world with nuclear power. It was a nonsense of course. Scotland had and has no nuclear industry: we do not design, build or export our nuclear expertise.Nuclear power remains hugely expensive and dficult to build, needs guaranteed access to coolant at a time of increasingly serious climate events requires costly state intervention with subsidies, insurance and security. There is no long-term solution to waste. Scotland should utilise its share of funding to build expertise and an export industry around tidal power and green hydrogen.I actually heard a trade union rep complain that without nuclear power Scotland, as part of the UK grid, would partly rely on England’s gas-powered electricity generator. Was he really unaware that much of that gas originates in Scotland GR Weir, Ochiltree.* I HAVE been following the reaction to the UK Government’s decision to go nuclear and maintain its restrictions on onshore turbines.I wonder thoughyet again Westminster is missing yet another cheaper option.Why are we not placing bladeless turbines up and down our motorways and trunk roads  The turbines, while not quite as efficient as their bladed cousins, are cheaper to manufacture, install and maintain. Further, placing them along the roadways both avoids many planning constraints and provides another source of generation as well as the wind, ie passing vehicles. Just think, all those lampposts powered for free and the excess used to power service stations and homes nearby. Maybe even electric cars no, that would be an imaginative step too far.Perhaps before the A dialling finishes and any other major road project Holyrood might want to take the lead and plan for a bladeless contribution to our power needs.John Davidson, Carnoustie.TORIES RANCID PHILOSOPHYDR RM Morrishits the nail on the head when he characterises the Johnson Government as \"supremely competent\" in pursuing its own narrow interests rather than the interests of all its citizens. Thus the wealthy, oligarchic backers and Brexit-loving xenophobes are appeased by policies and promises that are entirely self-centred and devoid of empathy where the less well-off are concerned.This particular nail would have been obvious to many for some considerable time, but clearly not enough, as the results of the last election show us. Voters should ponder long and hard whether they wish to continue to collude with such a rancid philosophy.Dr Angus Macmillan, Dumfries.WE MUST CHANGE THE TAX LAWSAS wein the press re the UK Chancellor’s we avoiding tax , I wonder when we are going to tackle the real issue.The social group that benefits from the current tax laws is the same group that made the tax laws and the business laws that – while intended initially to encourage investment – now just protect business people from the very market forces they are always banging on about. Ditto the same group that made the company laws that saw Sir Philip Green get away with asset-stripping British Home Stores and running up huge pension deficits while buying multi-million-pound yachts for his own pleasure.It was legal. Everyone knows it was wrong but the law protected him.Those same laws mean that those who benefit from government subsidy, post-privatisation of almost everything, are de facto living off massive social handouts – the very sort which is derided when givento poor people.Pinpointing the vile iniduals who have accumulated so much of the world’s wealth while people starve and suffer the effects of climate devastationis no longer a thing.The real thing is, laws need to be updated and made fit for purpose to reflect what actually happens in the st century.Amanda Baker, Edinburgh.WHATS FAIR IS FAIRAMID all the huffing and puffing about Rishi Sunaks Budget and wealth I spotted this on Twitter: \"This fair society thing. I know exactly what it is. Everyone richer than me can pay more in taxes. Preferably a windfall tax too for being richer than me. Everyone whose property is worth more than mine should pay punitive inheritance tax on their death. Everyone who owns a car bigger than mine should pay a much higher road tax. Then my taxes could be lowered and benefits through public services that I personally would use could be raised. That seems fair to me.\"Allan Sutherland, Stonehaven.TV TREATS US LIKE CHILDRENI REMEMBER the Vietnam War but have no recollection of TV news reports from the time being prefaced with warnings about distressing content. I’m also pretty sure that in  the BBC didn’t preface Richard Dimbleby’s dispatches from Bergen-Bn with such advisories.Now, however, in the excellent coverage of the Ukraine war, we are endlessly told, as for example in Channel  News on Thursday, five times in  minutes, that \"this report contains distressing images\".We know that these images will be distressing, it’s war, we understand this, we do not need broadcasters treating us like children. For those who don’t want to see reality, they know where the \"off\" switch is.Stuart Neville, Clydebank.WE CANT DECIDE ON PEACENEIL Mackay describes reports of atrocities in Ukraine with Russia as the likely culprit . He writes that evenRussia withdraws from Ukraine \"there can be no peace until both Putin and his regime are destroyed\".So far Ukraine is the only country at war with Russia, not the UK. Commentators from our country cannot decide whether peace terms are acceptable to the countries at war.Allan Mackenzie, Cumbernauld.THE OTHER WH SMITHIAN McConnells article was not just interesting from a business perspective, but also from an educational one. Narrating the le and legacy of John Menzies and the business he founded was very informative.The mention of the takeover by WH Smith in the s reminded me of another WH Smith who has largely been forgotten by history. William Smith opened a foundry in Whitchurch, Shropshire, in  with three men  years later it had grown to a company which employed more than . His \"vision\" was to be able to \"make anything my neighbour might want\".I am not sure when the business closed, but I do know that there are still manholes and drains in Shropshire which bear his name and one of the easiest to find is in the village of Ironbridge near Telford. Behind the village store a drain cover is emblazoned with it.If any of your readers are in the vicinity of Ironbridge, they should go looking for it and be impressed by a piece of social history.I do realise, of course, that I am a bit of a saddo, butits a good enough hobby for Jeremy Corbyn then its good enough for me.Gordon Fisher, Stewarton.LITTER SOLUTION IN OUR OWN HANDSTHE letterfrom George Moore requesting an apology from Glasgow City Council for \"the filthy state of Glasgows litter-strewn pavements\" typies much of what is wrong with todays society. I was reminded of an occasion, years ago, waiting for a train on Queen Street Stations low level . A fellow passenger castigated a railway employee who emerged from an office that the litter-strewn  was a disgrace to which the employee replied : \"I didnt drop the litter there, madam.\"I am sure it is not Glasgow City Council which drops all the litter. A litter-free city, indeed country, lies in our own hands.Bob Byiers, Bearsden.AN OWN GOAL FROM SCOTRAILI AM going to Hampden Park on Tuesday evening to watch the Scotland Women’s National Team play Spain. On checking the train times from Mount Florida after the match, I discover that it is an hourly service. I shall therefore drive to the game, as I am sure many others will do.

Just looking at these images, at the waves thundering around sea stacks, the dizzying clfs, the dark sea caves, is an escape in itself.These are places of desire and longing. Evenwe never reach them, there’s an awe in knowing they exist. Caisteal Abhail, ArranA view from above, of Goatfell, the surrounding Corbetts and the rocky peak of Caisteal Abhail. Peter Irvine describes how Richard Cross captured this image by drone, after a climb from Glen Rosa to the summit of Caisteal Abhail, aka the Sleeping Warrior. \"The Corbetts here,\" he notes, \"Cìr Mhòr, Goatfell and Caisteal Abhail, together with Beinn Tarsuinn , can all be bagged in a twelve-mile ten-hour expedition. You’d want it to be a day like this one.\" Arran, of course, as Irvine observes, is one of the most accessible of the Scottish islands, but for wild, remoteness like this you have to put in a bit of work. Carsaig Arches, MullOne of Mull’s most striking natural phenomena, reached by a four-mile walk from the pier at Carsaig Bay, which is itself five miles off the main A in the southwest of the island. The route is tough and includes very rocky ground, strewn with boulders. \"Carved by erosion,\" Irvine writes, the arches are \"part of a volcanic landscape at times supernatural... As you reach the first arch at the end of the track, descending from the ridge, it looks like an opening into the sea, or ‘into another planet’. Other arches are like tunnels and there are sculpted pillars of basalt.\" Best to visit during low tides, when the arches themselves are more accessible, particularlyyou plan on walking further than the first arch. Fingals Cave, StaffaAn hours boat trip from Mull, on the tiny uninhabited island of Staffa, is a sea cave that has lured countless travellers since it was discovered in . Irvine writes, \"Sir Walter Scott wrote that ‘it exceeded in my mind every description I had ever heard of it’ and the -year-old boy wonder, Mendelssohn was so moved by it when he arrivedin  on the newly introduced paddle steamer service round Mull, that he was inspired to wrote his famed Hebrides Overture. The basalt columns, the huge arched entranceway and the cave’s dimensions –  m deep,  m high – leave a profound impression.\" Boat trips generally allow an hour or two of exploration, and some adventurous swimmers have even braved a dip there. National Geographic photographer Jim Richardson took this shot with added lighting effects, which bring its dark and dramatic architecture to le. The Mangarstadh Sea Stacks, LewisMany come to Uig for the breath-taking white beaches. But this area on the west coast of Lewis, washed by the wild Atlantic, is also an area of such rocky and elemental spectacle that it stirs the soul. \"The drama,\" writes Irvine, \"of the MangarstadhSea Stacks could not be further away from the gentle sandy strand of the same name, though they are only  km further on along the B...You might marvel at the grandeur of these timeless pinnacles, that they are so unknown, or just at the indomitable endurance of Lewisian gneiss.\" This photograph was taken by Michael Stirling-Aird, while on holiday. Irvine also advises that visitors be sure, on the way to visit the stacks, or after, to pop into the \"superlative seafood restaurant with the view to die for\", Uig Sands. Muckle Flugga, Unst A Sheiling, LewisThe sheilings of Lewis are iconic signs of a le that lingered longer here. Effectively summer bothies which were used by people who took their cattle out to the moors in order to preserve the pastures close to the villages for use in the winter months, they are the simplest of dwellings. Its their tin roofs that often stand out in the landscape and seem so distinctive. As Irvine puts it, Mhairi Laws \"photograph of an isolated house over the hill near Acha Mòr reminds us that the Old Ways are still part of the landscape of Lewis visible around the A, which cuts through the island’s heartland. They can seem to merge into the stony land. Sheilings are rough and ready, for animals rather than their keepers, though butter and curd cheese might have been made and shelter taken.\" Clfs of Yesnaby, Orkney\"The red clfs of Yesnaby,\" writes Irvine, \"are to Orkney what the white clfs are to Dover and England. Somehow they’re emblematic folk say, with a wistful sigh, you must at least go there before you leave.\" In this photograph by Ingrid Budge, they glow in the late afternoon sun, the tones of their rock of old red sandstone set on fire. Into this porous stone, the sea has carved blowholes, geos and sea stacks. The clfs can be reached via the West Coast Walk, south of Skara Brae. Climbers are often lured by the challenge of Yesnaby Castle. Neist PointAs far west as you can go on Skye, at the tip of the Duirinish Peninsula is a lighthouse,  metres above the water, that lures walkers towards it, just as it warns boats away. The rocky outcrop juts into the Minch, providing drmatic , as Irvine says, \"from here there are regular sightings of dolphins, porpoises, whales and basking sharks and, of course, seabirds on the clfs.\" Built in  based on a David Stevenson design. \"On the -minute up and down walk, the lighthouse doesn’t come into view immediately, but when it does it’s a stately edice, a worthy destination, as the field of stone cairns built by walkers, attests.\" For the ultimate view, visit at sunset and watch the light dip down in the west. Machair, South UistAs Irvine himself points out, the Machair, of course, is not a place, but a marvellous habitat, one of the rarest in Europe. Its formed by the meeting of low-lying coastline, shell fragments, strong winds, just the right amount of rainfall, and the impact of people and their grazing animals. In these coastal fields, wild flowers mixed with crop grasses like oats and rye. It is also, Irvine notes, home to the great yellow bumblebee and the \"secretive\" corncrake. \"If you are lucky enough to hear the corncrake’s distinctive krek call or see the swallows high in a wide blue sky, and the sea shimmering in the distance as you walk through a rippling field of flowers, and there’s nobody around for miles, you know that…le is good.\" Photograph by Dalziel. Black Cuillin, SkyeSo iconic, it was called simply The Ridge, in the film in which Danny Macaskill tackled it by bike. This is, quite possibly, Britains most dramatic mountain silhouette, and is formed from, notes Irvine, the \"remains of an eroded magma chamber of a giant volcano, its jagged edges sculpted by glacial activity and millennia of weathering\". Its also a challenging mountain climb: eight miles long, with eleven Munros and  other summits. However, though the Cuillin can seem daunting,writes Irvine, \"there are ways of experiencing it without risk or too much effort. Coire Lagan, a five-mile round trip from Glen Brittle, is a beautul mountain loch surrounded by the highest peaks. Also on the four-mile walk around Loch Coruisk , you are in an amphitheatre with one of the world’s most spectacular backdrops.\" Photograph by Richard CrossScotland The Best: The Islands by Peter Irvine is published by CollinsIt should have been a safe space for informed debate, somewhere for readers to discuss issues around the biggest stories of the day, but all too often the below the line comments on most websites have become bogged down by off-topic discussions and abuse. heraldscotland is tackling this problem by allowing only subscribers to comment.We are doing this to improve the experience for our loyal readers and we believe it will reduce the ability of trolls and troublemakers, who occasionally find their way onto our site, to abuse our journalists and readers.

The book, though fictionalised, features Zara, a young Glaswegian health worker whose online dating adventures could have been scripted by Quentin Tarantino and Bette Midler.But they’re characterised by the seasoned Glaswegian’s capacity to find humour in the most absurd and socially awkward encounters.And amidst all the unrefined concupiscence and gleefully abandoned foundation garments there is tenderness too and the eternal struggle of a young woman seeking reassurance and validation about her looks and experiences.Sophie Gravia This being The Herald, I’ve chosen the comparatively subdued aftermath of one of Zara’s bedtime rendezvous which she discusses with her friend, Ashley.“So, how big was he,” she screeched as she walked through the door into the kitchen, holding the Chinese bags in her hand.I burst out laughing. “F***ing big. Like ... this big.” I pulled a rolling pin out of the cutlery drawer.“Lucky! And was he generous ”This confirms all men’s worst nightmares of how women describe these occasions.The full account of the previous evening’s exertions are outrageously funny and gloriously manky.In all the spilling and leaking and splashing, though, there’s humanity and compassion as one girl struggles through shame and self-doubt to find what everyone is looking for: love and a little tenderness.“I was really touched by the messages I was getting from other women when I first started posting my blogs. They were telling me that they’d been waiting for years for someone to describe how it really is for them in real le.“There was a time when people tended to be judgmental about dating websites, as though it was for desperadoes. But it’s totally mainstream now.”I ask herit’s not fraught with a greater degree of peril for women than it is for men. Are they taking a bigger risk Several of my female friends have relayed tales of meeting blokes who think that the simple act of agreeing to go on a date is a contractual guarantee of sex.“I’ve never agreed to date someone with whom I haven’t had a prolonged period of chatting beforehand. Therefore, you can usually tell who the roasters are. Are they over-affectionate or too complimentary about the way you look “Andyou’re only agreeing to have a coffee then that sets its own boundaries. “When I was younger I was probably quite naive about all of this, but you learn from experience. I think you can get a sense of someone from the way they dress and their chatthey’re bad news.“My friends call this ‘The f***-boy vibes’.”This is one of several revelatory locutions with which Sophie acquaints me during our conversation. I strive to appear knowledgeable and seasoned about all of this and affect an insouciant man-of-the- world vibe that soon crumbles.I’m treated to some other new concepts. One of these is “dropping a pin”.Sophie explains this is a safety mechanism where her friends can electronically embed her location on their smartphones in case anything untoward unfolds.Another one is the “Tinder-walk”. This, Sophie explains, became one of the big features of Scotland in lockdown while people like me were watching old football videos and trying to decipher cookery books.Yet this Tinder-walk malarkey possesses a reassuringly vintage aesthetic. “Everyone got a dog and went on Tinder walks during lockdown,” she says. “It helped to ease us all through the social restrictions and was a way of keeping the flames of romance enkindled.”Heather Suttie, the Scottish events and PR specialist, was thrilled when she first read A Glasgow Kiss. “It just seemed to be what a lot of us had been waiting for,” she said. “I can’t remember laughing so much at a book – and crying too.“It’s just so honest and it could only have been written by a Glaswegian because it’s got that honesty and directness that’s usually missing from fiction that deals with sex and relationships.”Suttie is founder of BookFace, an international, online book club that holds monthly events in Glasgow with modern authors. “When Sophie appeared at one last month the response from women and men was overwhelmingly positive. Yes, some of the scenes are outrageously graphic, but they’re leavened with humour and honesty.”There are several astonishing aspects to A Glasgow Kiss. It’s been written by a first- time author who had not the remotest idea of how to break into the publishing world and yet has secured her a two-book deal featuring the further adventures of Zara.And as well as hitting top spot in the Erotic Fiction charts, Waterstone’s made it one of their books of the year. Yet, she’s still looking for a literary agent.Perhaps the most startling is that Sophie wrote the book while juggling the demands of being a full-time nurse in a busy Glasgow hospital during lockdown with the responsibilities of being a single mother to two children.“I didn’t really stop to think about that,” she said. “Writing the book probably helped me cope during the pandemic.”And while the majority of the responses to the book have been from women, quite a few blokes responded too.“I can honestly say that all the responses from men, including from some former internet dates, have been very positive. They all got the humour.“One messaged me last night and said: ‘F*** me, it was like reading an old scuddymag when I was a lad. If you ever feel like ditching the halo just give me a shout and I’ll take you out’. I mean, where did he even get his hands on the book ”Any worries she may have harboured about the reactions of friends and family were ill founded.“I’d only initially told a few of them and they were all so supportive. I was a bit more anxious about my family’s reaction, to be honest.“They’re all pretty committed and traditional west of Scotland Catholics, but my mum says she’s very proud of me. She hasn’t read it and I don’t really want her to. But she knows what it’s about. And my family have also said that, of all of them, I was the one with no filters.“I recently bumped into one of my gran’s friends, a woman in her s. She waved over and said: ‘I bought your book. I sat down with it at  o’clock last week and I didn’t stop til am.’ And she’s the holiest wee woman ever. She’s lovely.“And then she said: ‘Your granny would have been so proud of you’.“I was also a bit worried about how it might be received at my workplace. And then I saw that some of my patients were reading it. One of them was sitting in our dialysis unit reading it and asked me to come over and sign it for her.”Recently, on the gogglebox, there have been some howlers posing as provocative television drama that are about as edgy as Classic FM.You find yourself unconsciously casting A Glasgow Kiss even as you’re reading it, as it’s perfect for a six-part comedy drama. The second book in the series will be published in August and by then Sophie hopes to have found an agent.There’s a message from the author at the front of the book. It says simply: “This book is for any girl who has ever wondered why she isn’t enough.“Just open your eyes and raise your standards. I see you.” It should have been a safe space for informed debate, somewhere for readers to discuss issues around the biggest stories of the day, but all too often the below the line comments on most websites have become bogged down by off-topic discussions and abuse. heraldscotland is tackling this problem by allowing only subscribers to comment.We are doing this to improve the experience for our loyal readers and we believe it will reduce the ability of trolls and troublemakers, who occasionally find their way onto our site, to abuse our journalists and readers.

Instead, for the first time Prince Charles will carry out the traditional coin-giving ceremony, to be held this year in Windsor. It will be the first Maundy Service the Queen has missed since  when the Queen Mother took her place as she was on tour in New Zealand.Despite mobility problems, the Queen took part in the Thanksgiving Service for Prince Philip on March , with special arrangements put in place, including use of a shorter entrance route rather than the usual entrance at the Great West Door that involves walking theof the church.During her video call with workers and medical staff, the Queen listened intently to their stories of coping with the huge influx of Covid patients, and was told by one senior nurse \"we held their hands, we wiped their tears and we provided comfort\".Around  people from across north-east London were treated at the -bed Queen Elizabeth Unit, built in five weeks to meet the demand instead of the normal time period of five months, and the Queen hailed the Dunkirk spirit that inspired the construction team.Speaking to former Covid patient Asef Hussain, and his we Shamina, the Queen said of the virus: \"It does leave one very tired and exhausted, doesnt it \"This horrible pandemic. Its not a nice result.\"Mr Hussain was the third member of his family to be admitted to hospital with Covid after they became ill towards the end of December . His brother died first and then his father, who passed away while Mr Hussain was on a ventilator.The Queen was told his we called the ambulance after he had struggled to catch his breath, and Mr Hussain added: \"I remember waking up one morning and just finding it really, really dficult to breathe.\"I remember waking my we saying that I feel like theres no oxygen in the room. I remember me sticking my head out the window, just trying to breathe, trying to get that extra oxygen.\"He was eventually put on a ventilator for seven weeks at the Royal London Hospital, and is still recovering, having recently dispensed with his wheelchair but now using a portable oxygen machine.Mrs Hussain told the Queen at one point there were  friends and family from across the world on a Zoom call praying for her husband, and the monarch lightened the mood and made the couple smile when she asked: \"So you have a large family, or a large influence on people \"The issue of families and friends being unable to visit loved ones being treated in hospital was discussed a number of times during the Queens video call with hospital staff, and at one point she said: \"Of course not being able to see your relative was very hard.\"Mireia Lopez Rey Ferrer, a senior sister who has worked at the hospital in Whitechapel, east London, since , told the Queen about their commitment to the patients.She said: \"As nurses we made sure that they were not alone. We held their hands, we wiped their tears and we provided comfort.\"It felt at times that we were running a marathon with no finish line.\"She added: \"I look back to the last  months with great pride, pride not only in the care we provided to each and every single patient, that was in one of our hospital beds, but pride in each member of staff that every day they left their families at home despite their fears and worries and they came to work.\"Polly Fitch, a clinical psychologist who ran the units family support team, described how information was put beside patients beds so medical staff knew their backgrounds and Imam Faruq Siddiqi, a chaplain who is part of the hospitals multi-faith team, said his presence was viewed with a sense of \"hope\" by families.The head of state, who is the hospitals patron, said to the Imam: \"It was obviously a very frightening experience to have Covid very badly, wasnt it \"At the end of the call, the the Queen chatted to the construction team who created the unit on the hospitals th and th floors in quick time, and told them: \"It is very interesting, isnt it, when there is some very vital thing, how everybody works together and pulls together - marvellous isnt it \"When the team hailed the \"Dunkirk spirit\" that inspired them to achieve their goal, the monarch replied: \"Thank goodness it still exists.\"It should have been a safe space for informed debate, somewhere for readers to discuss issues around the biggest stories of the day, but all too often the below the line comments on most websites have become bogged down by off-topic discussions and abuse. heraldscotland is tackling this problem by allowing only subscribers to comment.We are doing this to improve the experience for our loyal readers and we believe it will reduce the ability of trolls and troublemakers, who occasionally find their way onto our site, to abuse our journalists and readers.

People are also being advised to take a test prior to visiting someone who is vulnerable.If you develop symptoms, you should continue to get a PCR test.On vaccination, the First Minister said: “The advice to everyone, of course, remains as important as ever – please do take the opportunity to get vaccinated as soon as you are able and make sure you get all doses of vaccine that you are eligible for.

Relatives of residents will tell you that was no fluke – but down to good standards, diligent management and conscientious staff.There will be some truth in the financial and staffing pressures that CrossReach cite in their reasons for closure. But two years on from the outset of Covid, should the sector not be doing all it can to preserve and build on the success of an institution which proved such a good example during the pandemic, rather than bowing to the bottom line and accepting its loss.There is also the matter of an options appraisal on health and care needs in the north of Skye, currently being prepared by NHS Highland.Closure must at the very least be halted until this review is complete – andthis requires support for CrossReach, our Government should find it.In the longer term what we really need are alternative models to those that are currently governed by economies of scale than on inidual or community needs. An agenda of rationalisation and centralisation has taken hold of far too many of our public services and is ultimately driving decisions like the closure of small care facilities offering a homely, personalised environment in favour of a vast, but possibly distant one many miles from an inidual’s home community.No-where has this been more obvious, or dangerous, than in the west Highland health and care sector.We should start the fightback by backing Budhmor care home, and keeping it open."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4008432.jpg--_the_people_you_are_visiting_may_be_particularly_vulnerable_.jpg?1629440923000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220407newsthe people you are visiting may be particularly vulnerable","story":"The public has been urged to keep wearing face coverings when visiting hospitals, care homes and other health and care settings.

The families are bringing in their ious harvests and making preparations for next year. It’s October, and on the shores of Strangford Lough the Elliott family rear turkeys. The family have years of experience looking after the birds and yet Mark and Olive are still fascinated by their behaviour. Olive comments that they are ‘extremely inquisitive’. While Mark is making sure the turkeys are well fed, his mum Olive can’t help giving them an extra treat. She comments too, “I can’t do without my family, I have to be so nice to them at the minute!” Mark points out that they have been receiving orders for Christmas since August, which is ‘absolutely nuts.’ Near Kilcoo in the Mourne Mountains, Aine Devlin is preparing her flock for the most critical part of her farming year- breeding season. Aine is keeping an eye on her rams to make sure they’re doing their job. She coats their chests with paint to see which ewes they have been with. Aine laughs, “This is his cologne for the girls!” For her AI is not the way to go as the ewes would then all lamb on the same day on the mountain. She loves this time of year and is proud of the part she plays in the economy. “What’s better than buying produce from down the road from your neighbours and local communities ” she says. Outside Crossgar, Richard Orr is thinking ahead to next year’s wheat crop. It’s all about the planning and attention to detail to make sure the groundwork is done right. He’s conscious of the environment, saying, “The major thing in the world is carbon footprint. Chemicals have made farming easy, and modern machinery has damaged the structure of the soil - we need to rebuild that.” Meanwhile, just outside Portadown it’s all hands on deck for apple harvest at the McKeever family farm. There isn’t a high yield this year but sometimes things not going to plan can be a blessing. Pat talks about the seven to eight weeks of hell and this year pickers have been hard to get. Peter comments, “It’s half the battle when you have good people around.” On the Donegal   Londonderry border, potato farmer Jamie Rankin and his team are coming towards the end of their harvest. He enjoys the early starts and says, “What you do before dinner time’s your day’s work.” While it’s a job Jamie enjoys, it also comes with challenges as winter months close in. The bad weather has led to reduced yields and a late harvest, but he’s very proud to have produced a good crop. UTV’s Mark McFadden narrates the series.

That means there is much for visitors to explore, from ancient to modern history.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Read MoreBallycastle is Northern Ireland’s best place to live in : Proud locals are in full agreement as Co Antrim town edges out Derry and Helen’s Bay‘There’s no place like home’: Derry Girls writer Lisa McGee reacts to city being named among top places to live in NIYou have the completely intact -year-old Derry Walls which is a real selling point for tourists.Other historic landmarks include the Guildhall — where it now stands was once the middle of the River Foyle where ships moored. It was mostly destroyed by fire in  and after extensive rebuilding was opened in .Because it is relatively small in size, Derry is an easy place to navigate for visitors.A key piece of infrastructure built in recent times was the Peace Bridge.Nowadays it is hard to imagine the city without it, and it’s an area of recreation popular with walkers and joggers.That area is arguably the best feature of the city, expanding the city centre, linking to Ebrington, St Columb’s Park and the renovated railway station.The Peace Bridge connects the Cityside and Waterside it was a masterstroke both in practical terms and as an act of symbolism by reconnecting the largely Catholic Cityside to the traditionally unionist Waterside. Derry is also a city of culture — made official in  — with musicians, poets, painters and actors famous the world over.Danny Boy is one of the most famous songs in the world, and has been covered by Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash and Eva Cassidy. Phil Coulter, The Undertones, Dana, Cara Dillon, Johnny McDaid of Snow Patrol fame, Red Organ Serpent Sound, Fighting with Wire, SOAK and Wood Burning Savages show the range of musicians Derry has produced.It is also a city with proud sporting traditions in GAA and football and has produced Olympic medallists and world champions who first learned their trade on Derry’s pitches, roads and rivers.Nowhere does a festival like Derry, but there should be more added to the calendar.You have Glasgowbury in Draperstown, the City of Derry Jazz and Big Band Festival, the legendary Halloween festival and, in recent times, the Foyle Maritime Festival, which have all proven popular.When considering Derry, you also have to factor in the location. A short drive across the border and you’re in some of the world’s nicest beaches including Dunree and Tullagh Bay.To Derry’s advantage in the Sunday Times survey was an average house price of £,.“Reaping the rewards of years of investment and with a fine cultural reputation, this much-improved city stands out as somewhere cool, credible and cheap, with a bright future,” The Sunday Times states.But most people in the city would disagree with that statement, as multiple-deprivation measures, unemployment rates and analysis of investment show the second city has not received a great deal of inward investment.For example, since Invest NI was formed in  until   it has assisted , new jobs in Belfast whereas Foyle got , and East Londonderry ,.In that time it invested £.bn in Belfast and £.bn between Foyle and East Londonderry.Most ReadVideo: Feral teenagers’ attack on police in Co Down village caught on cameraBelfast paedophile brothers Gary and Gregory Rea shocked to be shunned by neighboursCharity fight event in Belfast marred by violence outside hotelDecoratordenies that he ripped off almost  pensionersMan arrested after street brawl on Belfast’s Dublin RoadTop VideosPlayFootage of an attack on police in Killough Co.DownPlayThe Derry Girlsjourneyand what next for the showPlayDerry Girls season  premiere: #We#ve shown people another side of Derry#Latest Northern IrelandPolice at scene of road crash in OmaghAuthor of The Eagle Has Landed dies at age of Barry’s: New name but still all the fun of the fair as amusements open in PortrushNI Civil Service chief apologises to senior whistleblower vet hounded out of jobCalls for an update on school transport ahead of proposed strike action by bus driversLatestPressure forced Scottie Scheffler to ‘cry like a baby’ before winning MastersWhat the papers say – April Articial intelligence may help trainee teachers with assessments – studyJohnny Depp’s multi-million-dollar US lawsuit against Amber Heard to beginHauliers’ protest to bring ‘complete lockdown’ to Dublin,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

DAERA instead struck a deal with Dr Bronckaers which will involve the department admitting that the original judgment was right, and paying her a huge sum in compensation.That judgment repeatedly criticised the whistleblower’s treatment by two of her senior colleagues: line manager Julian Henderson and chief vet Robert Huey. DAERA has taken no action against either man.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up At the heart of the case was Dr Bronckaers’ desire to enforce the law against Ballymena Livestock Market over alleged suffering caused to animals, as well as livestock movements being electronically deleted from DAERA’s much-vaunted computer system meant to track all inter-farm moves to ensure traceability of meat.Dr Huey told Dr Bronckaers that he knew the manager of Ballymena Livestock Market personally and that he also knew its chairman. Both he and Dr Henderson discouraged her from pursuing enforcement of the law, with Dr Bronckaers left in tears after an encounter with Dr Huey.In a statement on Thursday, DAERA said it “unreservedly apologises” to Dr Bronckaers and said it had set up an “internal review” into the issue. The department also denied that Minister Edwin Poots had ever had any involvement in the case, despite being in charge of the department and despite the case having been extensively reported by this newspaper and other media outlets for months.Last month the Belfastasked the Head of the Civil Service, Jayne Brady,it was acceptable on her watch for a Stormont department to attempt to overturn a judicial finding that a civil servant was driven from her job after she blew the whistle on potential fraud and animal suffering, and whether she had any message for whistleblowers. At the time, Dr Brady said it was “not appropriate to comment on an ongoing legal issue which is a matter for DAERA”.However, now that DAERA has abandoned its appeal, Dr Brady has issued her first substantive comment on the case. In a brief statement to this newspaper, a spokesman for Dr Brady said: “As Head of the Civil Service, I unreservedly apologise to Dr Bronckaers.“This case highlights a number of signicant concerns and I welcome the internal audit being undertaken by DAERA into this matter. Work is underway on actions to improve our processes for dealing with concerns raised both internally and externally and I have asked that this is taken forward at pace and consistently across all departments.“This underlines the need to drive forward the important work we have committed to do as an employer.”Related topicsDepartment of Agriculture, Environment  Rural Affairs - Edwin PootsMore On \" class\"-as:\"Department of Agriculture, Environment  Rural Affairs - Environmentalists take Stormont department to High Court over ‘highly damaging’ gas storage projectStormont criticised for ‘inadequate response’ after , wildfires in two years PremiumDepartment refuses to release information after Tamara Bronckaers tribunal caseStormont department criticised for building Derry park-and-ride which breaches planning rulesPlanning system is chronic failure, says Stormont watchdogMost ReadVideo: Feral teenagers’ attack on police in Co Down village caught on cameraBelfast paedophile brothers Gary and Gregory Rea shocked to be shunned by neighboursCharity fight event in Belfast marred by violence outside hotelDecoratordenies that he ripped off almost  pensionersMan arrested after street brawl on Belfast’s Dublin RoadTop VideosPlayFootage of an attack on police in Killough Co.DownPlayThe Derry Girlsjourneyand what next for the showPlayDerry Girls season  premiere: #We#ve shown people another side of Derry#Latest Northern IrelandPolice at scene of road crash in OmaghAuthor of The Eagle Has Landed dies at age of Barry’s: New name but still all the fun of the fair as amusements open in PortrushCalls for an update on school transport ahead of proposed strike action by bus driversCharity fight event in Belfast marred by violence outside hotelLatestWhat the papers say – April Articial intelligence may help trainee teachers with assessments – studyJohnny Depp’s multi-million-dollar US lawsuit against Amber Heard to beginHauliers’ protest to bring ‘complete lockdown’ to DublinTimeline: Johnny Depp and Amber Heard,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

By working in partnership with Ards and North Down and Newry, Mourne and Down councils, we have an opportunity to develop a sustainable, international walking route, which has the potential to attract visitors, both from home and abroad, to explore our outstanding countryside and learn about our incredible Christian Heritage.Cllr Enright believes that developing a trail of this scale will also encourage walkers to visit existing tourist attractions such as the Livingston Centre at Killinchy Parish Church and stop off on the way in restaurants and stay in local accommodation which in turn will bring much needed income and business to the local economy.Hinch Distillery owner, Dr Terry Cross mdash who set up the David Cross Foundation in memory of his son mdash said he was very impressed with the application for funding from Friends of Columbanus Bangor.ldquoThis project has the ability to bring people from all walks of le to meet and greet one another, regardless of their community background, he enthused.ldquoBuilding relationships, peace and reconciliation across Europe is now more important than ever given the critical situation that has erupted in Ukraine.

However, at the weekend they were determined to not give Armagh a head start and to be as competitive as possible from the first whistle.During a frantic first  minutes the Down girls did not disappoint, fighting for every ball and matching Armagh in every position around the pitch.At the first water-break Down led - to Armagh - in a very even game with Clodagh Simpson scoring a great goal and the lively Orla Owens scoring two points.During the second  minute period of the first half, the Down girls raised their own standard again and pushed Armagh back into their own half.Although Down scored a further - during this period they could have had more, and it was the Armagh team and management who were the happier team to hear the half-time whistle.Scorers in this period were Annie McEvoy with - and Orla Owens again with another point. The half-time score of Down - to Armagh - did certainly not flatter Down as their performance up to then was excellent.Into the second half and Armagh tightened up a lot and restricted Down to less clearer opportunities to score.At the other end Armagh took their own chances and scored a couple of quick goals which gave them the lead for the first time in the match. A point for Owens was the only score for Down during this period.At the second water-break the score was - to - to Armagh.Into the final  minutes and Down made changes to get fresh legs on the pitch. Another Owens point, her fth of the day, levelled up the score at Down - to Armagh - with ten minutes left.Armagh scored two points take the lead for the second time and with time running out, Down went for the goal to win the game.With the ball seemingly stuck in Downrsquos attacking third they just couldnrsquot break down the Armagh defence. With time up Armagh broke up field and scored a goal with the final play to win the match.Full time: Down - Armagh -.The Down girls were disappointed with the result but the management team were delighted with their overall performance. All of the  girls used for Down played their bit.Scorers for Down were Annie McEvoy , Clodagh Simpsonand the top scorer was Orla Owens .Best performers for Down v Armagh were Lily Magee in nets, Eloise Austin, Therese Cowan, Ava McArdle, Zara Kelly, Isa McCarron, Aoe Wolfe, Anna McArdle and captain Maia Murdock but it was Orla Owens who took the player of the match award with her five points.With the Platinum All-Ireland series still to be played in the coming weeks, and the way these girls continue to improve week by week, who knows how far they can go.The management and girls would like to thank everyone for all the messages prior to the final and for all the support on the day.Down: L Magee E Austin, F M Morgan, T Cowan A McArdle, M Murdock, Z Kelly A Wolfe, I McCarron A McArdle, H Donnelly, A McEvoy O Owens, C Simpson, E McKee.Subs: D OrsquoShea, E OrsquoKane, H McGeough, R Horisk, E Farrell, C McDermott, C McGrath, G Kelly, G McMullan, E McHugh, A McKay, H Cassin, C Lundy, T Ryan, L Elmore..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  April 8%2C 1992  ","story":"NEWCASTLE mdash The RNLI has unveiled plans for a major new pound, leboat station for Newcastle.The station, which is at the planning permission stage, will house the new Mersey class leboat which is due to arrive at the seaside town towards the end of November.If the station plans get Department of the Environment approval, the new complex will be constructed to the north of the harbour beside Newcastle Yacht Clubrsquos car park.The RNLIrsquos tractor house and the old Coastguard station will be demolished to make way for the building and a  metre-long slipway will be constructed to just beyond the high water mark.The new station will replace the existing boathouse which was built in  and, apart from some superficial work, has never been updated. The leboat crew and the shore team have to wash at a stand-pipe and the only toilets are an old Victoria public lavatory adjacent to the boathouse.In addition to a modern launching facility, which is clear of the problem-bedevilled harbour, the new station will provide the leboatmen with a crew room, equipped with toilets and showers, a kitchen, training room, lookout area and souvenir outlet.Work on the new complex is likely to take up to six months to complete and,planning permission is granted, is expected to start in June.The longest part of the work will be the construction of the slipway which will be cut down through the steep shore bank and will involve reinforced piling.Once completed the station will be ready to take delivery of the new leboat, which will be named the Bryant and Eleanor Girling after a generous RNLI benefactor.SAINTFIELD mdash Three workmen and two police officers required hospital treatment after a chemical spill in Saintfield last week.Four  gallon drums containing a mixture of acid and caustic soda, fell from a lorry on the Old Grand Jury Road at around am on Friday morning, initiating a full-scale emergency response from the Fire Brigade.Appliances from Ballynahinch and Downpatrick were sent to the scene and a specialist equipment carrying emergency tender unit was also despatched from Belfast.The incident occurred as the articulated lorry was leaving a yard on the Old Grand Jury Road carrying a large number of the chemical-containing drums.The four drums fell from the lorry, with two spilling several hundred gallons of the corrosive mixture onto the road.The lorry driver and his two assistants quickly righted the drums but suffered from fume inhalation, as did two police officers who arrived on the scene minutes after the spill.All five were treated at the Downe Hospital but were later released.STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash The Department of Environmentrsquos proposals for the management of Strangford Lough have been welcomed as a ldquotriumph of common sense.The comment comes from the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Associationrsquos chairman, Mr Sam Davis, who is urging all lough users to unite in supporting the new administrators.Mr Davisrsquo confidence-boosting commendation of the new body comes a matter of weeks before its inaugural meeting.SLNCA was born out of the conflict felt around the Lough by controversial DoE management proposals put forward a few years ago.The recommendation to support the new administrators on the eve of their activity will be seen as a wholehearted effort by people who are anxious to make the new management structure work.Mr Davis and the Associationrsquos joint council declared after last weekrsquos meeting that the new structure represents what the loughside community have been looking for.ldquoThe new body represents a wide spectrum of community support, including the pockets of power which were driven largely by their own self-interests, he said.MOURNES mdash Health officials have been accused of ldquoplucking figures from nowhere to justy closure plans for Newcastlersquos Mourne House.The Eastern Health Council heard this week that a renovation figure of pound, for the residential home has been produced without the benefit of a quantity surveyorrsquos report.The claims were made by a deputation from the Friends of Mourne House which addressed the councilrsquos monthly meeting in Dundonald on Thursday afternoon.Friends spokesman, Mr Damian Smyth, told the meeting that the renovation figures which were produced by the Down and Lisburn Unit of Management, are completely dferent from early figures produced by the Eastern Health Boardrsquos building control officer.The officerrsquos report said Mourne House was in good repair, was free fro structural faults, and had a lespan of  years, explained Mr Smyth.He added that a more recent set of figures, produced by the unit of management on April , indicate that only minor works are needed at the home.ldquoThese latest figures say it would cost pound, to raise the standard at the home, including pound, which would have to be spent on fire safety, said Mr Smyth.ldquoThis patently does not square with the unitrsquos first report, which was used to initiate the consultation process, that it will cost a total of pound, to bring the home up to standard, said Mr Smyth. ldquoThis figure includes pound, for fire safety, pound, for a new roof, pound, for a new electrical system and pound, for a new kitchen.ldquoThese figures are bald figures produced by the unit of management with no specications and without the benefit of a quantity surveyorrsquos report, he added.PORTAFERRY mdash Portaferry has become the first town in Northern Ireland to benefit from a pioneering emergency response scheme which will save the lives of heart attack victims.The British Heart Foundation this week handed over a le-saving defibrillator which will enable doctors to provide a first response to cardiac emergencies pending the arrival of an ambulance.The presentation was made on Monday to Portaferry GPs Dr Desmond Compton and Dr David Peacock by Mr Peter Welsh, the Foundationrsquos regional organiser.The doctors believe the equipment could provide a le-saving service for , people in Portaferry and lower Ards Peninsula.It takes around  minutes from an ambulance based in Newtownards to reach the lower Ards.Even so, it would be virtually impossible to put a permanent ambulance in the area because it would be seldom used, according to the Eastern Health Boardrsquos chief ambulance officer, Mr Alan Murray.The Ambulance Service has funded the inclusion of sophisticated diagnostic facilities on the defibrillator, as well as communication systems for the doctors to ensure their immediate availability.BALLYNAHINCH mdash One of Down Districtrsquos biggest charity events of the year will take place in Ballynahinch next month.The Ballynahinch Lions k and

that next monthrsquos event will top the pound total which was raised last year.This yearrsquos beneficiaries will be the Leukaemia Research Fund, the Marie Curie Trust, Beaconsfield, and Lions charities.The event, which is over a proven course and backed by the Northern Ireland Amateur Athletics Federation, has already become established as one of the major events on the athletics calendar

In the case of Jim Fitzsimons, you can take a man out of Downpatrick, but you canrsquot take Downpatrick out of a man.Jim Fitzsimons was born and reared in Downpatrick. He left the town as a young man, having graduated from Queenrsquos University, and spent the next  years or so in England where he had a successful career in further and higher education and in management training.Jim ed to Northern Ireland  years ago and for eight years lived in a cottage at Inch. Now , he and his we, Anne, live in Hillsborough where they enjoy regular visits from their three sons and seven grandchildren.But the lure of Downpatrick remains strong. When the coronavirus struck in March  and the world went into lockdown, Jim decided that the time was ripe for him to write about the town of his upbringing.The result is My Downpatrick: Reflections of  years ago, an affectionate account of happy times. For local people of a certain age, it will be a joyous trip down memory lane packed with names and places comfortingly familiar even with the passing of the years. For those who have no connection with Downpatrick, it is a story which is both educational and entertaining.Jim says he is pleased with the outcome of his efforts. ldquoI am very pleased with the book and I certainly enjoyed writing it. Growing up in Downpatrick we were modestly off, but we had all the things that we needed. It was a good place to live.Jim was born in March , six months before the start of the Second World War, the eldest of three children of William Henry Fitzsimons, a bread server, and his we, Marion. He and his younger brother and sister were reared in Saul Street in the warmth of a loving family and surrounded by many friends.He was educated at Fountain Street School and the Southwell School for Boys, where he and his schoolmates trembled in front a ldquosadistic master who ruled with the cane, before enrolling in Down High School in .Outside of school, there were plenty of opportunities to play sport, as well as trips to the cinema, church socials, the Boysrsquo Brigade and dancing. There were holidays at Tyrella, the annual BB camp, Sunday school excursions to Newcastle and trips to Coney Island, Belfast, Warrenpoint and Dundalk, among other places.It was a time when there were no supermarkets and there was an abundance of bread servers. Like his father, Jimrsquos grandfather was also a bread server, as were some of his other relatives. It was a time when bread servers they didnrsquot just serve bread. Butchers and grocers used them for deliveries. They also carried letters and parcels from the countryside to be posted in Downpatrick and also delivered a sizeable quantity of Down Recorders each week. In short, they were something of a social service.Jim writes about helping his father on his bread cart and also his paper round, which ended when he started in high school, collecting scrap metal during the Korean War and then ersying into collecting waste paper before getting a summer job in the County Surveyors Office in Downpatrick before starting university.He also writes about Downpatrick when it was a market town with a monthly fair and a weekly Saturday market. As the county town it had had many government offices and institutions, as well as hospitals and large factories offering plenty of employment, the county courthouse and two grammar schools.The factories have gone and the hospitals are much diminished since Jimrsquos childhood, but the town has grown considerably mdash its postwar population of around , is now over ,.Of Downpatrick then and now, Jim writes: ldquoDownpatrick was small enough to have a village feel about it. I donrsquot think this is still the case. People donrsquot know each other as they did in the past they live less in town centre terraced houses and more in detached houses in the outskirts.ldquoIn the past many men would go to the pub every evening, not to get drunk, but for perhaps a single drink while catching up with all the local news with friends. Going out to public houses is less common now and the public house and other entertainments is not solely for males. Women in the s and s ands were largely unseen, now they are much freer to do and go as they please. In  it was unheard of for a woman to go into a pub.He goes on: ldquoAlthough there is much to regret about the passing of the Downpatrick that I knew, it is a much better place in which to live. The slum houses that I remember are no more there are modern schools, an imposing new technical college with a nearby state-of-the-art fitness centre, a much expanded campus at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and advanced plans for a new building for Down High School.ldquoDownpatrick has a range of educational, cultural and sporting opportunities for all ages, for those who wish to take advantage of them. All these opportunities define the quality of a town.My Downpatrick: Reflections of  years ago costs pound and is available at the Saint Patrick Centre and the Grove Post Office in Downpatrick..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Minister waste treatment refusal is blow for Arc 21  ","story":"THE decision by Stormont Minister Nichola Mallon to refuse permission for a large scale waste treatment facility at the site of a former quarry in Newtownabbey has ramications for Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The local authority is a member of Arc which was seeking permission for the multi-million pound plant which could thermally treat , tonnes of municipal waste each year.Ms Mallon said the incinerator plant, which drew over , objections, could discourage recycling, with her decision due to be discussed at the next meeting of the local councilrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee.Currently, black bin waste collected across the district is transported by sea for incineration in Europe, with council officials keen for the districtrsquos ratepayers to continue focusing their efforts on recycling their waste.There is currently a particular emphasis on ensuring that all food waste is not dumped in black household bins, but in brown bins whose contents is treated and turned into compost.Arc mdash which is considering the decision to refuse permission for the proposed incineration plant mdash is an umbrella waste management group representing six councils on the eastern coast.It was established in  and formally incorporated in  following a process of increasing co-operation amongst its constituent councils.The organisation works on behalf of its partner councils to guide, support and help them deliver their statutory waste management obligations, drive forward innovative waste management programmes, including developing infrastructure and address greater circularity of resources.In addition to Newry, Mourne and Down, the other councils which are members of Arc include Antrim and Newtownabbey, Belfast City, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh and Mid and East Antrim.Ms Mallon said: ldquoI am not persuaded that there is a need for this specic facility. In that context, I do not consider there to be any need for this proposal.A spokesperson for Arc said there was still a ldquoclear need to develop a ldquonew, modern waste infrastructure for the region.It said the proposed facility would boost recycling, reduce emissions and provide green electricity.ldquoIt is essential that Arc has an opportunity to review the planning reasons behind the ministerrsquos statement and we will carefully consider todayrsquos announcement in that light over the next few days, added the spokesperson..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Museum to shut doors over Easter  ","story":"THE Down County Museum in Downpatrick will be closed over Easter.The announcement came just hours after Newry, Mourne and Down Council refused to confirmthe museum would be open to the public over the busy Easter holiday period.Initially, the local authority would only confirm that a decision on the Easter opening would be made in ldquodue course, but within hours of informing the Recorder of this and the paper being printed, it was finally revealed that the museum would remain closed.The council has subsequently confirmed that a reduced staff team is delivering services at the museum mdash which only opens between am and pm from Wednesday and Friday mdash and it is ldquowith regret that it will not be open at Easter.The Recorder understands that are six vacant staff positions at the museum and that up to five staff members are currently off sick.Adverts to recruit new museum staff have been published this week with the local authority looking to appoint and assistant curator, education and outreach officer, museum assistant and a cultural assistant.While council officials are hoping to have new employees in place next month, the local authority has not made clear how many new staff are being recruited and what the Downpatrick museumrsquos future opening hours will be.The museum has been at the centre of a controversial staff restructuring process.Downpatrick SDLP councillor Dermot Curran said thee council should have made it clear last week that the museum would be closed at Easter.Welcoming plans to recruit new employees, he suggested that councillors should be briefed at a one-off council meeting by senior local authority officials on exactly what is happening at the museum.ldquoI remain disappointed that the museum will not be open at Easter. While I understand that work is underway to recruit new staff, many will be disappointed the museum is closed as it is one of the many jewels in the districtrsquos tourism crown, he said.ldquoTourism is something we do very well in our district, but not opening what is a county museum at this time of year is frustrating and very disappointing.He added: ldquoWe need a fully ing museum in the heart of the county town. The Down County Museum is one of the districtrsquos main attractions and the visitors it draws spend time in Downpatrick and support other businesses, especially those in the hospitality sector which boosts our economy.ldquoGiven tourism is a prime driver for our economy, I am very disappointed that our museum will be shut to visitors over the Easter period and know this view will be shared by many.Alliance councillor Patrick Brown has also criticised the councilrsquos decision to keep the museum closed over Easter.He also called for staff to be moved from Newry to alleviate what he described as ldquostaffing pressures.He said: ldquoI am frustrated to see yet another blow to the Down Museum. Our county museum is so important to the area, and leading into the summer months it should be able to play its essential part in our local tourism industry.ldquoThis is particularly important this year, as we try to bounce back from the pandemic. We have already seen huge controversy over councilrsquos downgrading of the museum, and the news that the museum will remain closed over Easter is very unwelcome.ldquoI, along with other councillors, have secured a full review of museum services across the district as a whole, which is due to start this month. I look forward to seeing the results of this so that we can begin to make changes. Council urgently needs to resolve these staffing pressures, reflect on how the downgrading of the museum has contributed to them and seek the urgent reopening of the Down Museum.He added: ldquoI am disappointed that the Down Museum has become another example of how services are being moved from Downpatrick to Newry. I see all the potential Downpatrick has to be a thriving city, but time and again our services are being redirected to Newry.ldquoI want to see Downpatrick on the map as a destination town for the whole of Northern Ireland, andelected to the Assembly in May, I will fight to bring an end to the lack of delivery for Downpatrick that we have seen from the political establishment in the area for so long.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the organisation is currently operating with a reduced team of staff to deliver the services at the Downpatrick museum.He said: ldquoIt is therefore with regret that the museum opening times over the Easter holiday period will be Wednesday to Friday between am and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Portaferry man Peter hoping to lose 50lbs in 50 weeks during fundraiser for Air Ambulance NI  ","story":"PORTAFERRY man Peter McGrattan set himself a target of raising vital funds to Air Ambulance NI by losing lbs in  weeks before his th birthday.He started last October and has already lost  pounds, with just  pounds to go before his birthday on September .Peter is a driver for Coach Connections and coaches the Down U- hurling team in his spare time.He explained why he wanted to get involved in such a public way of losing weight.lsquoMy father Kevin was involved in a road traffic collision in Portaferry in , sustaining a traumatic head injury, said Peter.ldquoThankfully Air Ambulance NI were there on the day to treat him and swtly transferred him to Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast.

The team will be announced in due course.Aaron McGrady was in the Peak District along with  other runners for the annual Chicken Run which is a fell race approximately . miles distance and includes , feet of climbing.He had a strong run and placed second overall in a time of .. Aaron was more than happy to be runner-up to the winner Steve Vernon, who is a triple British cross country and mountain running champion ndash He also set the Chicken Run course record in .Steve and Aaron were the only two to break  minutes for the testing course and only nine runners made it home in under the hour so it was a creditable performance from Aaron from all angles.Sunday saw the rescheduled Titanic K. This race was due to take place in  but was called off due to Covid-.At the time a large number of runners deferred their entry to a new date in  but this also fell foul of restrictions at that time so for some runners this was a two year-old ticket.With the ers bolstered by new entrants there were  excited participants in the Harbour Estate ready for action.Paul Lloyd was delighted to finally take to the roads in a race as he has been hampered by a long term injury and has only managed a modicum of training.He last raced in June  so it was a long time coming.He finished in . which placed him th overall. This is a good marker for further improvement as he s to previous form and he commented on how good it felt to be back at a mass participation event. Hopefully he will now feel ready to enter more races in the near future.Manchester MarathonAs anyone who has done a marathon will know, the preparation required is gruelling. Most runners start months in advance and gradually increase their mileage so that they have the stamina to cope comfortably with . miles.They also need to include speed workthey want to set a good time so it is a juggling process.Gordy Graham, coached by Ryan Maxwell, had followed his schedule to the letter and had many promising race results in his build up so it was a hammer blow when he developed a knee injury with only three weeks to go.He eased off the miles in the hope that it would settle and right up to the morning of the marathon, he was debating whether racing was in his best interests.This head versus heart is not a new thing to runners. With the hours spent training for that day, sitting it out would have been too much to bear.In the end he set off with equal amounts of hope and caution and for the first hour or so maintained the pace that he needed to match his . personal best set in Belfast last year.He was in a group banging out miles at an incredible . minutes per mile pace and he felt pretty good until mile .At this point the niggle became enough to disrupt his natural rhythm and as a result his pace wavered. However, true to form he persisted to the line recording .. as he passed the tape.This result is one that would cause celebration for most and it is, in fact, his second fastest marathon but for Gordy there is still a time out there that he wants to achieve and we know that when he has assessed and treated his injury, he will be back pushing for his goal.We wish him luck in his recovery and future endeavours.Hannah Somani was also out chasing specic targets firstly to better her time of . which she set in London Marathon last October and secondly to come home in under three hours. This sub-three barrier is regarded as a holy grail for many and for Hannah being so close on in London was enough to convince her to give it another shot.She continued consistent training throughout the autumn and into the winter with multiple sessions per week as well as long runs at weekends.On her recent trip to Downpatrick she was so committed to the plan that she ran -odd miles on the morning of Jimmyrsquos Ten before heading to the start line.She then went on to run quick enough in the K to lead with two other high performing EDAC ladiestoclinch victory in the team competition.All this must have stood her in good stead as she absolutely nailed it on Sunday. She arrived at the start with quiet resolve and executed her race with precision pacing.Her time of .. was well deserved after her hard work and she was naturally over the moon. Super work, Hannah.Steph Graham was equally determined in her approach. A small matter of a wedding and a baby in the last  months might seem reason to hold back from committing to race targets but when your husband is also your coach then the lines become blurred.Gordy has had prior mention above for his own race but Steph would be quick to acknowledge his part in her achievements. She entered Manchester due largely to his encouragement as she had doubts as to whether she would be ready in time.She had been hacking chunks off her marathon times in the last few years and in Berlin  she ran . so sub . was her aim. This was a big ask as training with a young baby is never easy but she pulled it off with style.Gordy was brimming over with pride when she finished in ... Steph deserves kudos for this performance but even more so for the fact that she had to resort to the treadmill for daily miles.Despite the tedium of running miles looking at a wall, she never missed a session and her hard graft has paid off. What a team.Same distance but dferent city ndash Dee Murray had decided that Paris in the spring would provide the incentive to train over the winter months and he had racked up his miles motivated by excitement of a European marathon.The day dawned bright but chilly and it took a bit of effort to get warm enough to shed the layers before the start.Fortunately once they were lined up on the famous Champs Elyseacutees, the sun came out in fulland the , runners had perfect racing conditions for the rest of the day.Dee ran with his usual metronomic rhythm ticking off the miles and the iconic landmarks as he ran the winding route.Apart from a bit of cramp in the last couple of miles, he felt comfortable and was delighted to get a sub three hour finish in .. shaving a few seconds off his previous best which had held since .Dee is known as lsquoMr Consistentrsquo and running as quickly as he did five years ago endorses that nickname no end.

And then that same year, he collected the Open Championship at Royal Liverpool.It was a truly astonishing tally for a sportsman who was then still only aged . It also cemented Northern Ireland as a golfing superpower — not only home to numerous fine golf clubs including two of the best in the world, Royal Portrush and Royal Co Down, but also to three recent major winners, Graeme McDowell and Darren Clarke as well as Rory. England, a country with  times the population of NI, has never had three major golfing winners in such a limited period of time. If Rory McIlroy’s career had come to an end in , it would still have been a glittering one.But we have all been hoping that he can go a step further, and win the one major title that has so far eluded him — the prestigious Masters at Augusta. That would be a truly astonishing feat, and put him up in a select group of currently only five players, including the greatest names in the history of the sport — Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods.Rory almost did it yesterday, coming second at the Masters to the US golfer Scottie Scheffler. But what an achievement! Rory has been one of the few players to challenge American dominance of the majors in the last decade.His second place yesterday comes after years in which he rarely seemed to be within reach of the very top.Rory is a testament to dedication and perseverance, an inspiration to young people, and a fine ambassador for Northern Ireland.See the back page"},{"url":null,"title":"prince harry and meghan markle watch how the royal romance blossomed in a new documentary with expert analysis ","story":"Great news as busy Belfast route is reopened after ongoing incident   Detectives call for information to help crack notorious murder case which saw Protestant minister beaten with nail-studded bats  years agoNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraineSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes  Gardense-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsPeoplePrince Harry and Meghan Markle: watch how the Royal romance blossomed in a new documentary, with expert analysisPrince Harry and Meghan Markle’s story has been one of the most talked about romances of the st Century.By Bill Smith, Latest TVFriday, th March , : pmUpdated Friday, th March , : pm  \"       \"  How did it start  Where did their love bloom  Who were the original Duke and Duchess of Sussex  With exclusive footage, this is the full story of their love covering what happened on the night they met their engagement, the royal wedding, and the challenges they faced as they searched for a home.

This year almost  thousand people across the UK took part, counting more than  million birds.       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Each autumn, Jays, a colourful member of the crow family, can often be seen flying back and forth finding and hiding acorns to help see them through the winter. These are then hidden in the cracks and crevices of trees, but also in leaf litter on the ground. An inidual jay can store around , acorns each year and many remain buried to grow into oak trees.RSPB Big Garden Birdwatch. Mother and her daughter counting birds in their garden, Bedford, UK, January The RSPB’s Chief Executive, Beccy Speight said “We don’t know the reasons for the sudden increase in Jay sightings this year. It may be down to food availability as we have reports that last year was poor for acorns, but whatever the reason a sighting of this stunning bird is enough to raise one’s spirits any day of the year let alone on a gloomy January weekend.“It’s been brilliant to see so many people taking part again this year, taking time out to watch and reconnect with birds and then generously submit their sightings to help RSPB scientists gain some insights into how our garden birds are faring.”Big Garden Birdwatch results also found a small increase in Greenfinch compared to . This gives scientists a glimmer of hope that this might be the first signs of a popuation recovery, but only time will tell. In recent years the Greenfinch has suffered a population crashcaused by a severe outbreak of the disease trichomonosis and as a consequence the species was added to the UK Red list last year. This infection is spread through contaminated food and drinking water, or by birds feeding one another with regurgitated food during the breeding season. Garden owners can help slow transmission rates by temporarily stopping the provision of foodill birds are seen and making sure that garden bird feeders are cleaned regularly.The House Sparrow remained at the top of the Big Garden Birdwatch rankings as the most commonly seen garden bird with more than . million recorded sightings throughout the weekend. Blue Tit and Starling remained in the number two and three positions respectively.RSPB Big Garden Birdwatch. Family filling up a bird feeder in their garden, Potton, Bedfordshire, UK, January Over its four decades, Big Garden Birdwatch has highlighted the winners and losers in the garden bird world. It was first to alert the RSPB to the decline in song thrush numbers, which are still down % compared to the first Big Garden Birdwatch in . This species was a firm fixture in the top  in . By , its numbers were less than half those recorded in , it came in at  in the rankings this year, seen in just % of gardens.Throughout the first half of the spring term the nation’s school children took part in the RSPB’s Big Schools Birdwatch. The UK-wide survey of birds in school grounds saw amost , school children and their teachers spend an hour in nature counting the birds. Woodpigeon was the most numerous species seen with an average of eight per school and was seen in % of all schools that took part. Blackbird was a close second with an average of seven per school.Beccy added: “Connecting with nature doesn’t have to stop with Big Garden Birdwatch.

Do something instead‘Don’t worry!’ How often have we heard that and how often do we say it to others  I suspect it’s being said quite often at the present time, when there seems to be so much to be worried about, writes Rev. Ron Elsdon.By The NewsroomSunday, rd April , : am  \"       \"  There’s the state of the Health Service, the never-ending fallout from Brexit, the war in Ukraine, and the spiralling cost of living which is already inflicting so much hardship on so many. ‘Don’t worry!’ But the problem is that it’s far easier said than done. So when you come across it in the bible as well, you could be excused for writing it off as unrealistic. Please stay with me for a few moments, however, while I try to explain.        \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It points you to something rather more than that. I offer you two examples where it offers you responses that are practical – strategies,you like.Ron ElsdonFirstly, Paul directs people to pray instead, and to pepper their prayers with thanksgiving . The trouble is that we’re so good at finding things to complain about, often trivialities, that finding things to give thanks for doesn’t come easily, even to people who pray regularly, but why not switch course and actually do it, then keep on doing it  Then, says Paul, the protecting peace of God is there to be discovered, even in the midst of stressful situations. Secondly, Jesus talks about worry in the Sermon on the Mount . When it consumes us, he says, what we need is a new set of ambitions which point us beyond ourselves “Seek first God’s kingdom and God’s righteousness” is His command to His followers. As I write, I’m thinking about a local politician, one I shan’t be voting for. I know he spends Christmas Day at a place for the homeless, helping to serve up hot meals for that I admire him greatly. As I write, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are fleeing the army of a tyrant from the east, many with nowhere to go in freezing weather. In neighbouring countries, churches and other organisations are swinging into action to help support these folk in their hour of desperate need. So, in their dferent ways, Jesus’ and Paul’s words in the bible are saying to us all, ‘Don’t worry! Do something instead.’Read: Covid travel requirement set to change"},{"url":null,"title":"wit wisdom this too shall pass ","story":"Belfast International Airport issues top travel tips for Easter passengers   PSNI investigating theft of much-loved working sheepdogsNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My Businesscanonical_urlCANONICAL_URLhostnameCANONICAL_HOSTNAMElocationCANONICAL_URLreferrerEXTERNAL_REFERRERpage_view_id_PAGE_VIEW_ID_scroll_SCROLL_HEIGHTgeo__INJECT_GEO__cid_ga:CLIENT_ID,comScore:CLIENT_ID,compass_uid:CLIENT_IDversionsha-wJFtySqNnAxBmRbBZGkmXyZeJTYkxlpMdJsFNIrrGVlru-DcIEIZ\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-container\" i-amphtml-layout\"container\"Loading...NewsAdam Harbinson. WIT  WISDOM: This too shall passWith our recent fine weather I’ve been doing more than my usual five-to- miles a day walking, an activity that, with many of my countrymen, I developed during the lockdown, when there was little  to do, writes Adam Harbinson.By The NewsroomSunday, th April , : am  \"       \"  Last week was idyllic as I walked along the Donegal coast from Moville to Greencastle it was magical, and it struck me again, that while we all know the value of regular exercise, fresh air and social engagement, we might never really know just how beneficial such days are for our physical and mental health.But what perhaps, on the flipside, will our memories of - be in  years time  We’ll be asking ourselves, how on Earth did we remain sane  Brexit has wreaked havoc on our economy, piled on top of which was Covid-. I can still feel the cloud of gloom that settled on me when a radio announcer was suggesting that all over s would not be allowed outside the door of their homes for  weeks.Thankfully it didn’t quite come to that.Then came the murderous war in Ukraine, with pictures being flashed onto our screens of European families hiding in cellars in fear or their lives, not to mention the bloody carnage. But how does this bad news affect our mental health To further exacerbate my potential for anxiety I can tell you that five of my close friends and family members are suffering from le-threatening health problems one has even invited me to his rd birthday party, when he and I know full well that in reality it’s a ‘going away’ party. I’m in my mid-s and while I feel as mentally and physically fit as I was in my s, the thing I hate about my age is that so many of my contemporaries are dropping like flies.So, what can we do to protect ourselves  Firstly we must regulate our intake of deadly news regular exercise and getting out into the countryside is helpful too. Gratitude is of vital importance, so let’s get a pen and paper and make a list of the many aspects of our lives for which we can be truly grateful.But is that enough  You might say no, but since there might be little we can do to help our suffering brothers and sisters, we must recognise the need for serenity to accept the things we cannot change and thecourage to change the things we can.One thing’s for sure this too will pass.

The eagerly anticipated successor to the popular Barrys Amusements opened its doors for the first time on Saturday amid great excitement. Hundreds of people young and old filed through the doors all afternoon as the magic ed to Portmagic - and just in time for Easter. The good news is that Currys is now up and running, boasting all the old Barrys favourites and adding some new ones too. And for those with old Barrys tokens - no, you cant use them, but you can help the RNLI by dropping them into collection boxes dotted around the complex. The fun park has chosen the charity as its partner - a thoughtful gesture given the important work volunteers do in the waters off the north coast. But for now, after two years of zero craic because of the pandemic, all roads lead to the Port and what promises to be a fun-filled holiday period.

The families are bringing in their ious harvests and making preparations for next year. It’s October, and on the shores of Strangford Lough the Elliott family rear turkeys. The family have years of experience looking after the birds and yet Mark and Olive are still fascinated by their behaviour. Olive comments that they are ‘extremely inquisitive’. While Mark is making sure the turkeys are well fed, his mum Olive can’t help giving them an extra treat. She comments too, “I can’t do without my family, I have to be so nice to them at the minute!” Mark points out that they have been receiving orders for Christmas since August, which is ‘absolutely nuts.’ Near Kilcoo in the Mourne Mountains, Aine Devlin is preparing her flock for the most critical part of her farming year- breeding season. Aine is keeping an eye on her rams to make sure they’re doing their job. She coats their chests with paint to see which ewes they have been with. Aine laughs, “This is his cologne for the girls!” For her AI is not the way to go as the ewes would then all lamb on the same day on the mountain. She loves this time of year and is proud of the part she plays in the economy. “What’s better than buying produce from down the road from your neighbours and local communities ” she says. Outside Crossgar, Richard Orr is thinking ahead to next year’s wheat crop. It’s all about the planning and attention to detail to make sure the groundwork is done right. He’s conscious of the environment, saying, “The major thing in the world is carbon footprint. Chemicals have made farming easy, and modern machinery has damaged the structure of the soil - we need to rebuild that.” Meanwhile, just outside Portadown it’s all hands on deck for apple harvest at the McKeever family farm. There isn’t a high yield this year but sometimes things not going to plan can be a blessing. Pat talks about the seven to eight weeks of hell and this year pickers have been hard to get. Peter comments, “It’s half the battle when you have good people around.” On the Donegal   Londonderry border, potato farmer Jamie Rankin and his team are coming towards the end of their harvest. He enjoys the early starts and says, “What you do before dinner time’s your day’s work.” While it’s a job Jamie enjoys, it also comes with challenges as winter months close in. The bad weather has led to reduced yields and a late harvest, but he’s very proud to have produced a good crop. UTV’s Mark McFadden narrates the series. Sponsored by Moy Park, ‘Rare Breed – A Farming Year’ continues on Tuesday th April at pm on UTV.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fecaaebafacccddfdfcd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_eedcbacedafd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
