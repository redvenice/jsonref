I was searching on Christian Mingle and s**t and I seen her profile pop up and I’m like, “This b***h is fire.”‘So I slid in her Christian Mingle messages and s**t and she responded to my email so then we had linked up and s**t… I don’t wear a condom!Blac Chyna ‘loses deal with stroller company’ as she \u0027uses one as weapon\u0027 in scuffleWe mean, these quotes are really something, but anything could happen in this Kardashian-offshoot universe. contacted reps for comment."},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/sec_9953905.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"butcher offering big cocks and horny sausages told to tone it down","story":"Butcher Pete Lymer with his saucy sign in Leek, Staffordshire (Picture: Becky Loton)A butcher has been warned by police about his risque signs after he advertised ‘big cocks on special offer’ outside his shop.Pete Lymer also wrote on his blackboard about ‘big breasted birds’, ‘big cocks’ and ‘horny sausages’ but was surprised to feel the long arm of the law.The 43-year-old claims he has been using humour to sell meat for years at J W Ash \u0026amp Son, in Ball Haye Street, Leek, Staffordshire, and believes the police getting involved is ‘political correctness gone mad’.Pete told The Sentinel: ‘We’ve put the signs out for years and it’s always been a bit of a laugh.

(Picture: Alexander Crawley)What I Rent is ’s weekly series that takes you inside people’s rentals in London.Because trying to find a place in London to rent can be hellish.It’s tricky to know how much is a ‘normal’ amount to be paying each month. Countless viewings make you start to genuinely consider living in a flat with a fold-out bed in the kitchen. Meanwhile, you see other people’s perfectly decorated homes on Instagram and wonder what on earth you’re doing wrong.There’s a lot of mystery and confusion when it comes to renting, which isn’t helped by estate agents’ very flattering photos of ‘cosy’ studio flats and the average renter’s reticence to openly chat about what they’re getting for how much they’re paying.**Either because they’re embarrassed by just how much they’re spending, or they don’t want to make us all feel bad because they have a bargain.To get rid of the mystery, we’re going inside different Londoners’ rented properties each week, for a look at all the bits landlords might not show you.This week we’re talking to Miranda and George, who live with their two cats, Chess and Cinder.They pay £1,283 per month, plus £170 in bills. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)How much are you paying?Miranda: We pay roughly £1,283, plus £170 a month in bills. We’ve been trying to a more eco-friendly electricity provider but they keep screwing up the account.Bizarrely, this was the cheapest flat we could find and it’s in the nicest area we looked. Some es in North London are charging over £1,300 a month for what looks like a slightly spruced up slum.And what are you getting for that price?Miranda: It’s got three rooms and a balcony – a bedroom, a bathroom, and an open plan livingcookingdining space.It’s in Highgate, just down from Boogaloo. We’re not talking Highgate Village here (the ultra expensive, lush bit), but we were drinking in the same local as Jude Law last weekend….How long have you lived there?The flat has a bedroom, a bathroom, and an open plan living roomdining roomkitchen. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)How did you find it?Miranda: We set off one day determined to not return to my parent’s house until we’d found a flat.We started in Camden and walked up here – stopping at every single estate agent. We were just about to give up and head back east when we spotted a tiny estate agent next to Highgate station, and this was the first property they showed us. We fell immediately in love.George: Through a lot of searching. For the price we’re paying and the areas we were looking at, it was quite a full on process and we missed out on a couple of places before finally finding this one. But I’d say this was the best of any we saw for the price.And do you like it?We’re perfectly positioned at the top of the hill between Archway, Muswell Hill, Crouch End and Highgate Village. It’s perfect for running (try running up the hill from Chalk Farm and you’ll soon get a sweat on), it’s leafy, it’s got great transport links and there are any number of bars and restaurants.Unfortunately, we moved here in November when it was dark and miserable and we were both on quite strict training regimes so we’re only just starting to get to know the area properly and take full advantage of all its features.It was the cheapest place the couple could find. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)I’m learning to play tennis in the most beautiful park five minutes from the flat and as soon as the weather comes back, we’re off to start swimming in Hampstead Ponds.Oh, and it’s super quick to get to the Emirates which is a blessing given the number of mid week 7.45 kick off games!George: Yes, I’m very much happy with where we live. It’s quiet enough to escape a lot of hustle and bustle from the centre of London but has easy and quick access to virtually wherever we’d want to go.We’re still exploring the area having moved in relatively recently but there’s certainly a bit more of a suburban feel, which suits me as I’m not originally from here.Do you have enough space for both of you and the cats?Miranda: Yes, but we have a lot of crap – we’re both hoarders. You can never have enough space.George: Absolutely. The balcony really adds an extra dimension in the summer and catches the sun from that side but even when not using that in the warm weather, I’ve not felt cramped at all.The balcony is a definite highlight. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)Are there any annoying bits about the place where you live?Miranda: At the start I couldn’t work out how to operate the heating and there’s a serious draft from the balcony (no double glazing). But now that it’s warmer, that draft is kind of a blessing.George: Not really. Again, not being from London, I’d say the price we’re paying is absolutely extortionate for what we’re getting (even though we do really like it) but that’s more of a general gripe with living in this ridiculously overpriced city, I guess…Any plans to move again?Miranda: Next year…but who’s to say what or where.George: I’d be happy to escape London ASAP but don’t have any immediate plans to go anywhere.Or who knows? I might even start saving some money elsewhere…And have you thought about buying a place?Miranda: I lived at home for so long with the express purpose of saving for my own place. I still haven’t given up hope although I’m starting to wonder if it wouldn’t be more expedient to just buy somewhere outside of London.My dad kept nagging me to buy somewhere in Barking a few years ago and I scoffed at him – why would I want a place even further out than my parents?Now, of course, they’re saying that Barking is THE place to invest and prices have already doubled. I’m a fool.Now, let’s have a nosy around Miranda and George’s place…What I Rent is \u0027s weekly series that takes you inside the places in London people are renting, to give us all a better sense of what\u0027s normal and how much we should be paying.

It could be a springboard to the rest of Europe.’"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/image-122.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"theresa may rejected cabinet pleas give visas foreign doctors","story":"Theresa May is facing fresh questions over her immigration policy (Picture: Reuters)Theresa May faces more questions over her immigration policy after she reportedly rejected pleas from Cabinet colleagues to ease restrictions on recruiting doctors from overseas.The Prime Minister’s actions in Number 10 and her previous role as home secretary have come under intense scrutiny following the Windrush generation scandal.Her efforts to create a ‘hostile environment’ for illegal immigrants and measures aimed at reducing net legal migration have both been challenged.It emerged today that as part of her plan to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands, Mrs May ‘refused to budge’ over calls to lift a cap on the number of skilled workers allowed to come to the UK, the Standard reports.Health chiefs have warned that limits on the number of visas issued to doctors from countries outside the European Economic Area are contributing to rota gaps and delays in patients receiving care.NHS Employers said there have been 400 cases of blocked visas since December.There are currently 100,000 vacancies in the NHS (Picture: PA)Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and former home secretary Amber Rudd reportedly urged the PM to lift the quota for NHS doctors, while Business Secretary Greg Clark allegedly wanted more exceptions for firms facing shortages of specialist skills.A Whitehall source told the Standard: ‘I think Jeremy and Amber were on the same page on this but No 10 were in a different place entirely.’The Prime Minister’s official spokesman defended the Tier 2 visa regime and stressed it was always closely monitored.‘It remains essential that we have control in our immigration system and it works in the national interest,’ the spokesman said.‘Around one third of all Tier 2 places go to the NHS and investing in our workforce will continue to be a top priority.’Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ‘It makes no sense whatsoever that the Government is turning away trained doctors who want to come and work here in the UK.‘Theresa May’s hostile environment policy is now directly damaging NHS patient care.’"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sei_5883763.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"whatsapp now lets shut annoying friends group chats","story":"Admins now have the chance to beat down their fellow group members (Photo: Asuyoshi Chiba AFP Getty Images)WhatsApp has rolled out a new feature which will give users a lot of power over their irritating friends.The chat app has unleashed a ‘restricted groups’ function which lets anyone named as an administrator of a group silence other members.If the admin doesn’t approve the message, it won’t be seen by other members of the groups.You’d better start being nice to your Whatsapp chums (Photo by Jaap ArriensNurPhoto via Getty Images)Meanwhile, the despot in charge can send as many messages as they want.If they switch on the restricted group function, they can also stop other members changing the name of the group.‘All participants can normally edit the group description, icon and subject, but finally the administrator can restrict this feature today, preventing no-administrators to modify the group description,’ wrote WABetaInfo, a website which specialises in covering Whatsapp updates.The restricted groups feature is included in version 2.18.132 for Android and is expected to be rolled out to iOS soon."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/19/21/4B54270B00000578-0-image-m-44_1524170616142.jpg","title":"Paris Hilton fianc Chris Zylka wed November","story":"    Paris Hilton, 37, and her fiancé Chris Zylka, 32, will wed in Beverly Hills, California, on November 11, a family insider has told DailyMail.com          Paris confirmed that she was engaged to Zylka in an Instagram post of the proposal in Instagram in early January           Paris and Zylka first met eight years ago at an Oscars party at Chateau Marmont but didn\u0027t start dating until 2016, finally making it official on social media in February 2017\u0027No one is quite sure of the significance of the \u00271111\u0027 wedding date, but that\u0027s what they\u0027ve chosen,\u0027 the insider told DailyMail.com. \u0027It\u0027s on a Sunday, but following day is a holiday (Veteran\u0027s Day) so it will be a long weekend celebration.\u0027Paris has strong ties to tradition and wants to have the wedding close to hope so her grandfather, Barron Hilton, can attend, the insider said.The church seats 600 people, and was also the site of Elizabeth Taylor\u0027s first wedding to Paris\u0027 great uncle Conrad \u0027Nicky\u0027 Hilton in 1950.

I guess it hurt enough for me to remember 60 years later\u0027.\u0027According to Simon, people thought Garfunkel was the one who wrote the songs, not him, because he \u0027looks like he writes the songs\u0027.Simon said: \u0027It came up all the time. There is a prejudice against small men and that has been a problem at times because I happen to be a sort of alpha male-ish type guy. It becomes a competitive thing.\u0027There\u0027s this attitude that \u0027I\u0027m taller, so I could beat you up, or I should be in charge\u0027.          By 1960 Simon started fretting about his thinning hair as well because all his role models like The Beatles and Mick Jagger were, as he put it \u0027skinny and tall, and they had a lot of hair\u0027. Simon and Jagger are pictured above in 1989Eventually, when he was in his 40s, Simon said to himself: \u0027Listen man, if you\u0027re going to make a big issue out of what you don\u0027t have, you\u0027re taking your actual gifts for granted….that\u0027s the hand I\u0027ve been dealt with. That\u0027s the way I\u0027m going to play it\u0027.Elsewhere in the book Simon talks about how his height was bound up in his long running mental health issues.In 1981 he went to see Los Angeles psychiatrist Rod Gorney and told him he was so unhappy he couldn\u0027t write songs anymore.Hilburn quotes an interview with Simon from 1984 in which he says that from the outside people could not understand why he was depressed, but inside he was looking at the \u0027thin slice of the pie that has got the bad news in it\u0027.What he meant by bad news: \u0027being short\u0027, his voice and his relationships.Simon said that his issues left him \u0027unable to absorb the bounty that was in my life\u0027 and he used to joke that he would happily pay $5 million to look like his hero Elvis Presley, who was 6ft 2in tall.Simon, 76, grew up in the Kew Gardens neighborhood of Queens, New York, and dreamed about playing for the New York Yankees.But his dream died because of something that Hiburn says would \u0027haunt him for years: his size\u0027. By 1960 Simon started fretting about his thinning hair as well because all his role models like The Beatles and Mick Jagger were, as he put it \u0027skinny and tall, and they had a lot of hair\u0027.          Simon first saw Garfunkel in 1951 at an assembly in their school when they were in the fourth grade. They attended the same high school and began to play music together. The pair are pictured together in 1957          Simon (right with Garfunkel), 76, grew up in the Kew Gardens neighborhood of Queens, New York, and dreamed about playing for the New York Yankees. But his dream died because of his small statureSimon said: \u0027That\u0027s what rock\u0027n\u0027roll was, and it was a really big thing with me.\u0027I once had this conversation with John Lennon, and he really wanted to know how I knew enough to keep my own publishing rather than give half of it away like the Beatles did. I told him I grew up around the music business....then I asked him: \u0027Who ever told you how to comb your hair like that?\u0027\u0027Much of \u0027The Life\u0027 is taken up with the love-hate - mostly hate - relationship between Simon and Garfunkel.Simon first saw Garfunkel in 1951 at an assembly in their school when they were in the fourth grade.They attended the same high school and began to play music together. Their first single was an R\u0026ampB number titled, \u0027Sh-Boom\u0027 in 1954. And even before they turned 18, the boys were being played on national radio. In 1957, however, they suffered a split that \u0027caused a wound so deep in Art it would never heal fully\u0027.Sid Prosen, the owner of the record label called Big which signed them, asked Simon if he could record some songs on his own and \u0027caught up in the excitement of the moment\u0027, Simon agreed.Hilburn writes that their \u0027massive mistake\u0027 was not telling Garfunkel who knew he had a great voice but was \u0027dependent on Paul for songs, which meant Paul had all the power\u0027.Garfunkel \u0027always felt in danger of being tossed aside\u0027, the book says. Simon\u0027s song flopped as did their next collaborative project and the pair went their separate ways for five years. Tank tops, flock wallpaper and a cheese plant in the corner:...\u0027She just wanted to know that he\u0027s in jail\u0027: Patton Oswalt...Share this article    Simon and Garfunkel, pictured above in 1993, have long had a love-hate relationship with each other. The biggest blow up came in 1993, when Simon\u0027s business manager had to to physically get between their dressing rooms to stop anything from happening.They would go through the same cycle for the next 50 years reconciliation and fighting before breaking up once more. The biggest blow up came in 1993. Simon and Garfunkel had reunited for a series of shows in New York called Event of a Lifetime that sold out so fast they added 14 more nights to the ten-night run.But the old tensions came back straight away, and Joseph Rascoff, Simon\u0027s business manager, had to physically get between their dressing rooms to stop anything from happening.He said: \u0027I genuinely believed that if there had been a knife on the table, one of them would have used it\u0027.At one point Garfunkel accused Simon of getting a journalist to write a negative review of one of the sets.On another night, while playing their hit \u0027The Boxer\u0027, Garfunkel suddenly stopped singing, which Simon thought was a mistake. But after the show Garfunkel told him: \u0027I didn\u0027t forget. I just wanted you to see what it feels like to be made a fool of\u0027.The two men went at each other and, recounting the episode, Rascoff said: \u0027They never came to blows but there was shoving, and I had to step between them\u0027.Simon described the incident as \u0027ugly - the most vicious fight, verbally at least, I\u0027d had in my life\u0027.Simon ided opinion among those who met him and a veteran from the British club scene in the 1960s called him \u0027shy, arrogant, self-assured, ruthlessly determined\u0027.           Simon did not get on with some celebrities, including John Lennon when they were supposed to be working on a covers album in 1974. He\u0027s pictured above, second from left, with Garfunkel (left), Yoko Ono (second right)  and Lennon in 1974Other said that he was so obsessed with music that human relationships came second.Joan Bata, a friend of his first girlfriend Kathy Chitty, said: \u0027He wasn\u0027t deliberately being hurtful. It was just that his mind was totally occupied with something else.\u0027The most striking breakup was with his first wife Peggy which is described with brutal starkness in the book.In 1974 the couple were due to go to their home in New Hope, Connecticut, but Simon was listening to his competition in that years\u0027 Grammy Awards, Stevie Wonder\u0027s Innervisions.Peggy called him to join her but he was too caught up in the music so she called him again and he became angry, thinking to himself: \u0027Can\u0027t I even listen to music any more?\u0027          Robert Hilburn\u0027s biography, Paul Simon: The Life, is out on May 8 on Simon \u0026amp SchusterAs the book puts it: \u0027When Peggy called out a third time, the marriage was over\u0027. Simon simply walked out of their townhouse and moved into the Stanhope Hotel around the corner until their orce was finalized.In the book, Simon said: \u0027Ultimately I wasn\u0027t ready for marriage. The marriage didn\u0027t solve the loneliness. I knew right away I had made a mistake. \u0027I didn\u0027t know how to be a good companion. I wasn\u0027t a very mature person. I didn\u0027t understand you had to work at problems. I wanted the marriage to solve my problems.\u0027\u0027The Life\u0027 says that Simon did not get on with some celebrities, including John Lennon when they were supposed to be working on a covers album in 1974.Lennon was constantly drunk and when Simon started to play acoustic guitar on \u0027Rock Island Line\u0027 before Lennon wanted he repeatedly told him to stop.Then Lennon started to reach over and mute Simon\u0027s guitar strings with his hand. A frustrated Simon told him: \u0027John, I play guitar too.\u0027May Pang, who was staying with Lennon at the time, said that Lennon was annoyed by Simon because \u0027unlike almost everybody else who entered John\u0027s orbit (Simon) had a powerful sense of himself and could actually refuse to be treated badly\u0027.In 2002 Simon was in Washington to receive a Kennedy Center Honor to receive an award for his lifetime of achievement to American culture through the performing arts.As he sat next to Elizabeth Taylor they watched as Alicia Keys butchered Bridge Over Troubled Water.Taylor leaned over to Simon and said: \u0027Tell me, Paul, does it upset you when somebody f**** up one of your songs?\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/30/17/4BB59ACE00000578-0-image-m-46_1525106173356.jpg","title":"Doria Ragland visits Oprah Winfrey 88m mansion","story":"    Meghan Markle\u0027s mother, Doria Ragland (right) was spotted over the weekend visiting Oprah Winfrey at her home in California, just three weeks ahead of the royal wedding  Ragland made a visit to Winfrey\u0027s $88million \u0027Promised Land\u0027 mansion in Santa Barbara on Saturday as expectations mount for her daughter\u0027s wedding to Prince Harry in LondonBut a source told DailyMail.com: \u0027No one knows how to schmooze better than Oprah.

The risk does not appear to have been explained to them.‘They were henceforth treated as freelancers and not as staff so they got none of the benefits such as sick pay, holiday pay, maternity leave, insurance or pension.’He told the court their contracts were essentially ‘no work, no pay’ and added Ms Gosling took unpaid maternity leave when pregnant with both her first and second children because her contract was ‘suspended’ by the broadcaster.Women like to watch other women being attacked, says...Share this articleThe BBC News Channel presenter, who was married to David Cameron’s former communications chief Sir Craig Oliver from 1996 to 2014, was told the broadcaster ‘would decide if and when it would have her back’.The court heard Ms Gosling, who has been with the broadcaster since 1999, was accidentally copied into an internal email which ‘put pressure on her’ to set up a PSC and said she would be given a job as producer rather than presenter at a lower fee if she refused.Meanwhile Mr Peacock told the court the BBC would not provide insurance for Mr Willcox when he reported from disaster zones, with the journalist covering major stories including the 2011 Japanese tsunami and the Chilean mining accident in 2010.Mr Peacock said: ‘If you are caught in a typhoon and you are injured you may hope the BBC send you a helicopter, but they have no obligation to do so.’          Ms Gosling joined the BBC in 1999 and the court heard she \u0027had to take unpaid maternity leave\u0027 when pregnantMs Gosling later moved to evening slots before taking the evening shift on the BBC News Channel from 2007 to 2013, and currently presents daytime slots.She has previously filled in on BBC Breakfast and has served as Friday presenter on the Victoria Derbyshire Programme on BBC2.Ms Gosling was married to David Cameron\u0027s former spin doctor Sir Craig Oliver between 1996 and 2014 and has three children with him.David Eades: Mr Eades has worked for the BBC in a variety of roles, having been with the broadcaster for decades.He was Channel Tunnel correspondent during its construction in the early 1990s and has also served as an Ireland and European correspondent.

But it would have given the government a way of knowing through those biometric ID cards who was here legally and who wasn’t.” Pushed again on whether he supported ID cards, Mr Gardiner replied: “We need to have much better ways of tracking people through the system.”Former Foreign Secretary Lord Hague today added his voice to calls for ID cards. “It would be worth thinking again about bringing in universal identity cards,” Lord Hague wrote in his Telegraph column. “We Conservatives were against this a decade ago, but times have moved on.” Yesterday Alan Johnson, and Charles Clarke, who both ran the Home Office under Labour in the 2000s, argued that biometric ID cards were the ‘best way to prove and so protect a citizen’s identity’.          Jeremy Corbyn, pictured on the local election campaign trail yesterday, voted against ID cards during the 2000s Ken Clarke, who was Tory Home Secretary in the early 1990s, also said ID cards would help deal with illegal immigration from Africa and the Middle East.However, it is understood Theresa May has ruled out bringing in such a scheme, which critics say would breach civil liberties.A Whitehall source said: ‘This Government is not going to introduce mandatory ID cards. It wasn’t the right policy when Labour first proposed it, and that remains the case.’When Mrs May first entered the Home Office, she oversaw the destruction of Labour’s identity card database, scuppering a scheme which at that stage was voluntary. Only around 15,000 cards were ever distributed.A law abolishing ID cards and the national identity register was the first to come out of the Home Office during the coalition government.At the time Mrs May said it would ‘begin the process of reversing the erosion of civil liberties and restoring freedoms’. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/09/4BB960A700000578-0-image-m-54_1525162161765.jpg","title":"Liam Fox accuses unelected peers trying block democratic people","story":"    Theresa May (pictured in Ulverston yesterday) today told her Cabinet today the House of Lords must not try to tie her hands in Brexit talks as she vowed a \u0027robust\u0027 response to a crushing defeat          Liam Fox (pictured on Sky News today) has accused unelected peers of trying to \u0027block the democratic will of the people\u0027 after the latest huge vote against Government Brexit plans          EU negotiator Michel Barnier is in Derry today (pictured) as he continues a tour of the Irish border The International Trade Secretary told Sky News: \u0027Now we have the unelected house actually trying to block the democratic will of the British people.\u0027This is a question about whether the will of the British people will be respected or not, and it must be.\u0027Asked by the BBC if Theresa May was now \u0027horribly weakened\u0027 he said: \u0027We don\u0027t have a parliamentary majority, that\u0027s for sure.\u0027That makes life harder.\u0027 Reviving plans for ID cards would prevent repeat of Windrush...Jacob Rees-Mogg rubbishes May\u0027s plans for a customs...GUY ADAMS: How an immigrant bus driver\u0027s son who survived a...Share this articleLast night\u0027s major amendment to the flagship Brexit laws going through Parliament radically strengthens the so-called \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 on the final deal.Tabled by Viscount Hailsham - better known as the former MP Douglas Hogg, infamous for expense claims to clean his moat - it will remove the right of ministers to quit Brexit talks without a deal and hand the decision to Parliament instead.Later the Government suffered another defeat when peers voted 270 to 233 to back plans giving Parliament a say on Britain\u0027s mandate for Brexit talks.             Viscount Hailsham - better known as the former MP Douglas Hogg, infamous for expense claims to clean his moat - said voters could not have made a final decision on Brexit without knowing the terms of the deal          He has secured support for a major amendment to the flagship Brexit laws going through Parliament that would radically strengthen the so-called \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 on the final deal          Former Tory leader Lord Michael Howard told the Lords the rebel amendment demonstrated the \u0027appalling lengths\u0027 Remain backers would go to frustrate the referendum voteViscount Hailsham was joined in the lobby by 18 other Tory rebels including ex ministers Michael Heseltine, Ros Altmann and David Willetts.  Following last night\u0027s vote, Brexit Minister Lord Callanan said the Government was \u0027disappointed\u0027 and would now consider the implications of the vote.He said: \u0027What this amendment would do is weaken the UK\u0027s hand in our negotiations with the EU by giving Parliament unprecedented powers to instruct the Government to do anything with regard to the negotiations – including trying to keep the UK in the EU indefinitely.\u0027It is absolutely right that Parliament is able to scrutinise the final deal, and that is why we have already committed to giving both Houses a vote on the final deal.Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer hailed the vote as a crucial moment in the wrestle for control over Brexit between Parliament and ministers.He said: \u0027Labour won the argument at the end of last year for Parliament to be given a meaningful vote on the terms of our withdrawal from the EU.

Who\u0027d have said before the 1930s that Germany, this cultured country, would involve itself in such a terrible war.\u0027 Lord Hailsham said Parliament - led by MPs - must be able to decide whether to accept no deal, send ministers back to renegotiate, order a new referendum or even stay in the EU on the current terms.Former Tory leader Lord Michael Howard told the Lords the rebel amendment demonstrated the \u0027appalling lengths\u0027 Remain backers would go to frustrate the referendum vote.  Conservative Lord Fairfax branded the Lords a \u0027cosy cabal of Remain\u0027 and attacker Remain supporters as \u0027fifth columnists\u0027 as he lashed the wrecking amendment.  Ahead of today\u0027s vote, Mrs May\u0027s spokesman said: \u0027Fundamentally, the British people voted to leave the EU and the Government is delivering on that.\u0027It is simply not right that Parliament could overturn this.\u0027It is absolutely right that Parliament is able to scrutinise the final deal, and that is why we have already committed to giving both houses a vote on the final deal.\u0027          Theresa May (pictured at a school near Manchester yesterday) lashed out at unelected peers who are trying to \u0027overturn\u0027 the will of the British people with a series of Brexit Bill wrecking amendmentsLater the Government suffered another defeat on the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill after peers backed plans to give Parliament a say on Britain\u0027s mandate for Brexit talks.An amendment led by Labour\u0027s Lord Monks and supported by a cross-party group of peers was supported by 270 votes to 233, majority 37.Brexit minister Lord Callanan said it was for the Government rather than Parliament to set the mandate for negotiations over the UK\u0027s future relationship with the EU.However, Labour indicated it was supporting the amendment, which would require parliamentary approval for this mandate. Responding to the Government\u0027s second defeat on Monday, on parliamentary approval for the UK\u0027s negotiating mandate, a spokesman for the Department for Exiting the European Union said: \u0027We are disappointed that the House of Lords has voted for this amendment in spite of the assurances we have provided.\u0027Parliament has been updated regularly throughout the negotiations and we have already committed to giving both the House of Commons and the House of Lords a vote on the withdrawal agreement and the terms of our future relationship with the EU.\u0027But it is for the Government, not Parliament, to set our goals for the negotiations on the UK\u0027s exit from the EU and to conduct them.\u0027We will now consider the implications of this decision.\u0027  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/09/4BB5DC6F00000578-5677543-The_video_shows_him_singing_the_lyrics_we_re_in_the_money_the_sk-m-46_1525165079611.jpg","title":"Sainsburys boss caught singing money sang James Blunts Youre Beautiful prawn","story":"    Mike Coupe\u0027s impromptu performance of \u0027We\u0027re in the Money\u0027 is not his first forray into the world of music having once sang James Blunt\u0027s You\u0027re Beautiful to a giant prawn to get 5,000 staff to sell more seafood at Christmas  The video shows him singing the lyrics \u0027we\u0027re in the money, the sky is sunny, let\u0027s spend it, lend it, send it, rolling along\u0027 and as well as musicals he also like Mr Blunt\u0027s music          During the \u0027unguarded\u0027 moment the Sainsbury\u0027s boss also takes a sip of his coffee in an off-air PR disaster now dubbed \u0027doing a Coupe\u0027The two-year plot to create a £51bn supermarket titan:...\u0027At least 75 Asda stores would have to be sold off\u0027: Can...Why I still don\u0027t buy it: ALEX BRUMMER says the Sainsbury\u0027s...Competition watchdog will probe £12bn merger of Sainsbury\u0027s...CITY DIARY: Fred Astaire moment won\u0027t be the only surprise...Share this articleYesterday he was forced into a humbling apology for his \u0027unfortunate choice of song\u0027 and the hiccup has been branded one of the worst PR blunders in recent  history.Mr Coupe was recorded singing \u0027We\u0027re in the Money\u0027 from the musical 42nd Street in between TV interviews.

In his words, \u0027What this means is the deal was not constructed on a foundation of good faith or transparency. It was built on Iran\u0027s lies.\u0027 France said today that Netanyahu\u0027s claims reinforced the importance of the 2015 deal that imposes controls on the Islamic republic.\u0027The pertinence of the deal is reinforced by the details presented by Israel: all activity linked to the development of a nuclear weapon is permanently forbidden by the deal,\u0027 said a foreign ministry spokesperson. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Netanyahu\u0027s presentation \u0027underlines the importance\u0027 of the controls imposed on Tehran three years ago.  Tehran, which has denied ever seeking nuclear weapons, dismissed Netanyahu\u0027s move as a \u0027ridiculous\u0027 show but did not address the documents produced by Netanyahu.Israeli minister Yoav Galant told Israel\u0027s Army Radio he suspected Trump was leaning toward nixing the deal, which would likely lead to a growing confrontation between Israel and Iran.           Netanyahu\u0027s speech was delivered in English and relied on his trademark use of visual aids          Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Monday that Iran is keen to develop ties with the rest of the world, which is \u0027not merely\u0027 the United States and European countriesBut he said Israel was prepared and doubted Iran would challenge Israel, given the humbling blow it was delivered.\u0027Anyone who saw the intelligence achievement can also understand what our military capabilities are,\u0027 he said. \u0027I assume that everyone around us will think long and hard before they try to harm Israel.\u0027Trump has signaled he will pull out of the agreement by May 12 unless it is revised, but he faces intense pressure from European allies not to do so. Israeli officials said the information it gathered had been shared in advance with the Americans, in an apparent hope of influencing Trump\u0027s decision.However, Netanyahu\u0027s presentation, delivered on live TV from Israeli military headquarters in Tel Aviv, did not appear to provide evidence that Iran has violated the 2015 deal, raising questions about whether it would sway international opinion ahead of Trump\u0027s decision.          Netanyahu claimed the material - some 55,000 pages of documents and 183 CDs of secret information Israeli Mossad operative obtained from a Tehran facilityIran\u0027s foreign ministry spokesman called Netanyahu\u0027s performance a \u0027threadbare charlatanism\u0027 show. The state-run IRNA news agency on Tuesday quoted Ghasemi as saying Netanyahu\u0027s speech was part of \u0027fruitless efforts of a bankrupt and scandalous liar.\u0027Israeli commentators lauded what was being described as one of the Mossad\u0027s greatest intelligence achievements in unmasking the true nature of the Iranian government\u0027s intent to the world. Still, there was disappointment over the lack of a \u0027smoking gun\u0027 proving Iran had violated the nuclear deal.Political opponents also bristled at Netanyahu\u0027s showmanship in presenting the find.\u0027I am convinced that an absolute majority of the intelligence and military officials were opposed to this presentation,\u0027 said Ram Ben-Barak, a former deputy Mossad director who currently belongs to the opposition Yesh Atid party.          Iran\u0027s foreign ministry spokesman called Netanyahu\u0027s performance a \u0027threadbare charlatanism\u0027 show\u0027What was the point, apart from national pride, broadcasting it in such a dramatic way, as if you were unveiling a new and revolutionary telephone to the world,\u0027 he asked.The display ratcheted up already heightened tensions between Israel and Iran. Israel considers Iran to be its biggest threat, citing Tehran\u0027s hostile rhetoric, support for militants and growing influence in the region.Israel has said it will not allow Iran to establish a permanent military presence in neighboring Syria, where Iran supports President Bashar Assad. Just before midnight Sunday, a missile attack in northern Syria killed more than a dozen pro-government fighters, many of them Iranians, a war monitoring group and an Iranian news agency said.There was no official confirmation of the death toll or the target but Israel was widely suspected of being behind the attack.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/14/4BB941CB00000578-5677887-_Magical_feeling_A_man_is_silhouetted_by_the_dusk_light_as_he_wa-a-26_1525180961682.jpg","title":"Photographer captures hypnotising footage INSIDE waves","story":"    Stunning: The pictures are taken in various locations off the shores of southern California.

She also claims he is innocent of the Saint Valentine\u0027s Day Massacre, and that it was carried out by corrupt cops instead          This picture shows Al Capone (bottom left) standing next to Bugs Moran, a target of the hit who narrowly escaped, who has his hands on Capone\u0027s shoulders. Deirdre claims the image was taken weeks after the massacre and proves Al wasn\u0027t behind it, otherwise the men wouldn\u0027t be so familiar with each-other\u0027So the police got upset that their livelihood was going to be cut off and that\u0027s who did it.\u0027 Witness accounts describe two men in police uniform entering the scene of the massacre – a garage at 2122 North Clark Street, Chicago – moments before it took place. However, the so-called officers are widely believed to have been mobsters in disguise, acting on the orders of Al Capone, who was then in his mansion in Miami.Moran himself was running late that morning and narrowly escaped the massacre, allegedly telling reporters afterward: \u0027Only Al Capone kills guys like that.\u0027 America\u0027s most notorious criminals in color: Al Capone, John...\u0027F**K KANYE UP\u0027: Rapper is flanked by bodyguards after...Share this articleDeirdre continued: \u0027Al\u0027s youngest brother, my uncle Matty, was with another gangster and they wanted to see what the pattern of Bugs going into the garage was. \u0027What they wanted to do was they wanted to go into the garage, talk to Bugs and just say there\u0027s enough business here for everybody, you don\u0027t have to act like this, just play by the rules. \u0027And of course my uncle told me this myself, he said Deirdre we were sitting in our car, and I saw this police car go up and down the street. \u0027It would go down the street – it was filled with policeman – and it would go back up the street.\u0027           The Saint Valnetine\u0027s Day Massacre saw seven members of the North Side Gang, rivals to Capone\u0027s Five Points Gang, lined up against this wall in Chicago and shot          The killings were carried out with two Thompson submachine guns and two shotguns, with each victim shot multiple times\u0027It wasn\u0027t really as bad as people are led to believe that it was back then, but yes there was bloodshed, of course there was.\u0027 The scene of the Saint Valentine\u0027s Day Massacre was demolished in 1967 and now provides parking for a nursing home. However the wall against which the victims were lined up and shot still survives, with bullet holes intact, at the Mob Museum in Las Vegas. Despite all of the publicity around the Valentine\u0027s Day Massacre, Deirdre said the first time she ever heard anything bad about her family was in 1947, when Capone died.She said: \u0027I was seven at the time and I was reading since the age of three, and all the newspapers all over the world were republishing all the things that they felt that the Capones had done.\u0027 Soon after, Deirdre\u0027s true identity was revealed to her schoolmates – they had known her as Deirdre Gabriel, the name her father, Ralph Capone Jr, had enrolled her with. \u0027I\u0027m a catholic girl, I was in Catholic school and Catholic children make their first communion in second grade,\u0027 she said. \u0027Sonnie, Al\u0027s son, and Sonnie\u0027s wife and girls… everybody came to church to watch me make my first communion and then we all went to Grandma Capone\u0027s house for a big picnic afterwards.           Capone was jailed in 1931 for tax evasion and served eight years before being released with syphilitic dementia. He died of a cardiac arrest in Florida in 1947\u0027Well back in those days there was always local editions of the big Chicago papers. \u0027So on Monday the local edition of the Tribune and the local edition of the Chicago American ran a story that said the children at St Philip Neri Church made their first communion, and Deirdre Capone – with the entire Capone family in attendance – made hers. \u0027They didn\u0027t know me as Deirdre Capone, they knew me as Deirdre Gabriel. But how many Deirdres do you think were in the city of Chicago, let alone this little school with 30 students? \u0027They knew. Two weeks after we made our first communion, every boy and every girl in my second-grade class was invited to this girl\u0027s birthday party, but not me. \u0027I would have a birthday party and nobody would come.\u0027 Her name also cost Deirdre her first job, working for an insurance company. She said: \u0027After you had worked for this insurance company for six months you got a free life insurance policy and so I had to fill that application out in my legal name – I had to use Capone. \u0027So two weeks after I made this application out, my boss called me into his office and sat me down and he says what is your name? And I knew something was up. \u0027I said Deirdre Gabriel and he said no, what is your real name? And I said Deirdre Capone. \u0027He said are you any relation to Al Capone? And I said, yes, he was my uncle. He said, you can\u0027t work here, you\u0027re fired. \u0027The outfit at that time was laundering their money and they would put it into insurance companies, into car dealerships and into restaurants. \u0027This insurance company couldn\u0027t take the chance that their investors would think that it was mob money that was going into this company, so they had to fire me. \u0027But it hurt. I mean, it was just one more thing.\u0027 Deirdre would later move to Minnesota, where she kept her Capone identity hidden from everybody except her husband, Bob. Even her own children only found out about their heritage after telling their parents they were learning about Al Capone at school. \u0027It was like somebody took a sledgehammer and hit me across the belly with it,\u0027 said Deirdre. \u0027I almost fainted. \u0027And so I went to my husband and I said \u0027honey, we\u0027re going to have to tell the children their heritage before they find out about it from somebody else.\u0027 \u0027I said, kids, I\u0027ve got something to tell you. I said, I was born Deirdre Marie Capone – Al Capone was my uncle. \u0027I have four children and the children looked at me, they looked at each other, and then they looked back at me and – this is the gospel truth – in unison they said cool mom.\u0027 Deirdre says she wrote her book to give a new perspective on the Capone family.\u0027There\u0027s no one left in the family that knew Al Capone, except me,\u0027 she said. \u0027So I have got to do it.\u0027Uncle Al Capone: The Untold Story from Inside His Family is available now from Recaplodge "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/16/4BBC813D00000578-5678723-Raffle_organisers_have_to_sell_150_000_tickets_to_ensure_the_dea-a-25_1525189825086.jpg","title":"Brighton Council refuses renew Ubers license","story":"    Brighton Council has decided not to renew Uber\u0027s licence in the city because it is not a \u0027fit and proper\u0027 firmA spokesperson for the firm said: \u0027This is a disappointing decision for the thousands of passengers and drivers who rely on our app in Brighton and Hove.

Yes, it breaks that non-disclosure agreement, but it’s the truth. There was bullying.’Mr Bercow’s office strenuously denied the bullying claims, saying many of his other staff had been happy to work with him for years.The revelations come weeks after it emerged that a judge-led inquiry into alleged bullying and harassment of Commons staff would not investigate inidual complaints. It led to claims that the probe, ordered by the House of Commons Commission, will be nothing more than a whitewash. The Commission is chaired by the Speaker.          Angus Sinclair, who said he was repeatedly undermined by Mr Bercow, finding himself the victim of angry outbursts, foul-mouthed tirades and mimicryMr Sinclair served for 30 years in the Royal Navy and joined the House of Commons in 2005 as the private secretary to Michael Martin, the previous Speaker, who died on Sunday. Mr Bercow succeeded him in 2009.As well as running the Speaker’s office, the private secretary also has a role in the Commons chamber, assisting him in his duties.Describing Mr Bercow’s behaviour, Mr Sinclair said: ‘The Speaker responded in a way that I can only say is a form of bullying.‘And that is to show anger, to thump the table to say that someone has failed in front of others. It seemed to get more frequent.’Newsnight said other Commons staff have corroborated the account, saying he was undermined in meetings and held responsible for things that were beyond his power. Mr Sinclair also recorded examples of the bullying in his diary.He added: ‘There was one afternoon I was working at my desk and he came in and was absolutely furious about something. \u0027He asked for some information from another part of the House.‘It had been very slow coming and I’d prodded for an early resolution and he knew that but he held me responsible. \u0027There was a tirade of how I’d let him down and it was the worst thing...‘There was a lot of bad language and suddenly his mobile phone which he’d been holding was flung on the desk in front of me and broke into a lot of bits.’Mr Sinclair says that after the 2010 general election he was called in to see Mr Bercow who told him he was going to ‘redesign the office’ and that he would not be needed. He was given a ‘compulsory early retirement’ with a severance package worth £86,250, which was more than a year’s pay.The payment was explicitly dependent on his signing a non-disclosure agreement that would bar him from speaking to the media or raising a complaint about his treatment.Mr Sinclair said: ‘I can only think it was because of the detail of what had happened, you know, the bullying and the manner of my leaving. What I’d done was sign a cover-up.’He was replaced in the role by Kate Emms, who it has been claimed was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after less than a year of working for Mr Bercow. The Speaker has also denied bullying her.A spokesman for the Speaker’s Office told Newsnight: ‘Mr Speaker strenuously denies that there is any substance to any of these allegations.‘Mr Speaker has a superb team of dedicated, effective and long-serving staff – five of whom have worked for him very happily for a combined total of over 40 years.’  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/22/4BBD8F5B00000578-0-image-m-3_1525209251935.jpg","title":"Former boarding school pupils dominating jobs dont waste study time long commutes","story":"    Martin Reader, the head of the private Cranleigh School in Surrey, said that boarding schools provide advantages to childrenOusted AA chief suing firm for £220m \u0027covered up street...Brexit could make children healthier: Jamie Oliver says...Share this articleAnd many boarding schools are also now able to completely eradicate online bullying by simply banning smartphones for younger age groups, he said.It comes after former education secretary Justine Greening suggested employers should discriminate against alumni of top private schools like Eton because they are ‘not as impressive’ as those with the same grades from struggling comprehensives.She said bosses should use ‘contextual admissions’ to see how privileged youngsters had been in their education.Mr Reader, who is also head of the private Cranleigh School in Surrey, said it was no secret that boarding schools provided many advantages for children.Speaking at the BSA annual conference in Brighton yesterday, he said: ‘What sets a boarding education apart from all others is the time that we have with the children, and the time they have with each other.‘When people question why our schools dominate the nations’ sports, creative and performing arts, the professions and politics, it is because they have had time to do those things and time with experts to coach them.          His comments come after Education secretary Justine Greening (pictured) suggested that employers should discriminate against boarding school pupils‘Why sit in a car or on a train or a bus for 45 minutes twice a day, or in a bedroom by yourself hunched over homework or a screen?‘You could be spending those hours rehearsing for a play, having a band practice, spending more time mastering your musical instrument or your goal shooting technique, spending more hours perfecting that painting, debating or discussing politics or science or history - whatever is your passion.‘Or, perhaps more importantly, real face-to-face, social time, not always virtual socialising.’The BSA represents 550 boarding schools, including some of the most elite private institutions as well as a number which are state-funded.Mr Reader said all of his schools pride themselves on encouraging children to pursue extra curricular activities in their evenings and weekends.And at Cranleigh, sixth formers are expected to do 15 hours per week of extra study outside of lessons.He said that for many children in modern Britain, a long commute to school is inevitable because they cannot get into their local school.Some parents considering boarding have even mentioned this as a motivating factor, he added.‘There are some good things about commuting to school,’ he said.‘It’s independence, and some children have no alternative.‘But wouldn’t it be better if they were able to spend that time doing lovely things?‘Why waste that time on a commute?’Mr Reader said boarding schools are also an ideal place to tackle social media, which can distract pupils from studies and cause online bullying.At Cranleigh, all pupils aged 13 are banned from having smartphones, and this has eradicated all cyberbullying for that age group, he said.‘A smartphone was not designed for a child,’ he said.‘We use to get an incident a week of something unpleasant for that age group but now we’ve had nothing.‘Children that age are not mature enough for it.‘We restrict alcohol and cigarettes as a society because they are addictive, so why not restrict something as addictive as a mobile phone.’Smart phone use is gradually phased in for older children - alongside special lessons about how to stay safe online.Sixth formers have no restrictions as they are thought to be mature enough to use phones appropriately.He added: ‘We have and many of our schools have restrictions on social media either through controlling WiFi, controlling the apps they can use, and encouraging them to spend more time with each other, doing activities where they’re not using social media. It’s beneficial.‘It encourages kids to spend real time with each other, not virtual time with each other.‘What we have done is be equally illiberal for everybody. It has helped parents. One of the hardest things about being a parent is that your child says “everyone else has got one”. There is a pressure.‘So it’s helpful when we’re all in this together.’Mr Reader also responded to Miss Greening’s comments yesterday.He said: ‘We need social mobility in this country. But businesses have to make their own decisions about what is right. It is not for government to tell businesses who is the right person for them.‘There is a real danger in constantly talking about privileged children and underprivileged children. Let’s just talk about children.‘I want to see more social mobility. But we can’t dictate what a company should do.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/30/13/4BB47E9300000578-5672051-image-a-27_1525091054259.jpg","title":"BBC stars elegant form zero hours contract tribunal hears","story":"    Joanna Gosling, pictured, is one of three BBC newsreaders challenging an HMRC tax bill in a test case at the High Court          The HMRC is claiming £920,000 extra tax from Ms Gosling, David Eades and Tim Willcox, pictured presenting with Emily Maitlis, but the journalists say the BBC had them on contracts that essentially treated them as freelancersAccording to the Telegraph, Jonathan Peacock QC, acting for the presenters, told the court they should be exempt from the tax bill because they were treated as freelancers and not staff.He said: ‘They were pushed by the BBC into contracting through personal service companies. The risk does not appear to have been explained to them.‘They were henceforth treated as freelancers and not as staff so they got none of the benefits such as sick pay, holiday pay, maternity leave, insurance or pension.’He told the court their contracts were essentially ‘no work, no pay’ and added Ms Gosling took unpaid maternity leave when pregnant with both her first and second children because her contract was ‘suspended’ by the broadcaster.Women like to watch other women being attacked, says...Share this articleThe BBC News Channel presenter, who was married to David Cameron’s former communications chief Sir Craig Oliver from 1996 to 2014, was told the broadcaster ‘would decide if and when it would have her back’.The court heard Ms Gosling, who has been with the broadcaster since 1999, was accidentally copied into an internal email which ‘put pressure on her’ to set up a PSC and said she would be given a job as producer rather than presenter at a lower fee if she refused.Meanwhile Mr Peacock told the court the BBC would not provide insurance for Mr Willcox when he reported from disaster zones, with the journalist covering major stories including the 2011 Japanese tsunami and the Chilean mining accident in 2010.Mr Peacock said: ‘If you are caught in a typhoon and you are injured you may hope the BBC send you a helicopter, but they have no obligation to do so.’          Ms Gosling joined the BBC in 1999 and the court heard she \u0027had to take unpaid maternity leave\u0027 when pregnantMs Gosling later moved to evening slots before taking the evening shift on the BBC News Channel from 2007 to 2013, and currently presents daytime slots.She has previously filled in on BBC Breakfast and has served as Friday presenter on the Victoria Derbyshire Programme on BBC2.Ms Gosling was married to David Cameron\u0027s former spin doctor Sir Craig Oliver between 1996 and 2014 and has three children with him.David Eades: Mr Eades has worked for the BBC in a variety of roles, having been with the broadcaster for decades.He was Channel Tunnel correspondent during its construction in the early 1990s and has also served as an Ireland and European correspondent.

But it would have given the government a way of knowing through those biometric ID cards who was here legally and who wasn’t.” Pushed again on whether he supported ID cards, Mr Gardiner replied: “We need to have much better ways of tracking people through the system.”Former Foreign Secretary Lord Hague today added his voice to calls for ID cards. “It would be worth thinking again about bringing in universal identity cards,” Lord Hague wrote in his Telegraph column. “We Conservatives were against this a decade ago, but times have moved on.” Yesterday Alan Johnson, and Charles Clarke, who both ran the Home Office under Labour in the 2000s, argued that biometric ID cards were the ‘best way to prove and so protect a citizen’s identity’.          Jeremy Corbyn, pictured on the local election campaign trail yesterday, voted against ID cards during the 2000s Ken Clarke, who was Tory Home Secretary in the early 1990s, also said ID cards would help deal with illegal immigration from Africa and the Middle East.However, it is understood Theresa May has ruled out bringing in such a scheme, which critics say would breach civil liberties.A Whitehall source said: ‘This Government is not going to introduce mandatory ID cards. It wasn’t the right policy when Labour first proposed it, and that remains the case.’When Mrs May first entered the Home Office, she oversaw the destruction of Labour’s identity card database, scuppering a scheme which at that stage was voluntary. Only around 15,000 cards were ever distributed.A law abolishing ID cards and the national identity register was the first to come out of the Home Office during the coalition government.At the time Mrs May said it would ‘begin the process of reversing the erosion of civil liberties and restoring freedoms’. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/09/4BB960A700000578-0-image-m-54_1525162161765.jpg","title":"Sainsburys boss caught singing money sang James Blunts Youre Beautiful prawn","story":"    Mike Coupe\u0027s impromptu performance of \u0027We\u0027re in the Money\u0027 is not his first forray into the world of music having once sang James Blunt\u0027s You\u0027re Beautiful to a giant prawn to get 5,000 staff to sell more seafood at Christmas  The video shows him singing the lyrics \u0027we\u0027re in the money, the sky is sunny, let\u0027s spend it, lend it, send it, rolling along\u0027 and as well as musicals he also like Mr Blunt\u0027s music          During the \u0027unguarded\u0027 moment the Sainsbury\u0027s boss also takes a sip of his coffee in an off-air PR disaster now dubbed \u0027doing a Coupe\u0027The two-year plot to create a £51bn supermarket titan:...\u0027At least 75 Asda stores would have to be sold off\u0027: Can...Why I still don\u0027t buy it: ALEX BRUMMER says the Sainsbury\u0027s...Competition watchdog will probe £12bn merger of Sainsbury\u0027s...CITY DIARY: Fred Astaire moment won\u0027t be the only surprise...Share this articleYesterday he was forced into a humbling apology for his \u0027unfortunate choice of song\u0027 and the hiccup has been branded one of the worst PR blunders in recent  history.Mr Coupe was recorded singing \u0027We\u0027re in the Money\u0027 from the musical 42nd Street in between TV interviews.

In his words, \u0027What this means is the deal was not constructed on a foundation of good faith or transparency. It was built on Iran\u0027s lies.\u0027 France said today that Netanyahu\u0027s claims reinforced the importance of the 2015 deal that imposes controls on the Islamic republic.\u0027The pertinence of the deal is reinforced by the details presented by Israel: all activity linked to the development of a nuclear weapon is permanently forbidden by the deal,\u0027 said a foreign ministry spokesperson. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Netanyahu\u0027s presentation \u0027underlines the importance\u0027 of the controls imposed on Tehran three years ago.  Tehran, which has denied ever seeking nuclear weapons, dismissed Netanyahu\u0027s move as a \u0027ridiculous\u0027 show but did not address the documents produced by Netanyahu.Israeli minister Yoav Galant told Israel\u0027s Army Radio he suspected Trump was leaning toward nixing the deal, which would likely lead to a growing confrontation between Israel and Iran.           Netanyahu\u0027s speech was delivered in English and relied on his trademark use of visual aids          Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Monday that Iran is keen to develop ties with the rest of the world, which is \u0027not merely\u0027 the United States and European countriesBut he said Israel was prepared and doubted Iran would challenge Israel, given the humbling blow it was delivered.\u0027Anyone who saw the intelligence achievement can also understand what our military capabilities are,\u0027 he said. \u0027I assume that everyone around us will think long and hard before they try to harm Israel.\u0027Trump has signaled he will pull out of the agreement by May 12 unless it is revised, but he faces intense pressure from European allies not to do so. Israeli officials said the information it gathered had been shared in advance with the Americans, in an apparent hope of influencing Trump\u0027s decision.However, Netanyahu\u0027s presentation, delivered on live TV from Israeli military headquarters in Tel Aviv, did not appear to provide evidence that Iran has violated the 2015 deal, raising questions about whether it would sway international opinion ahead of Trump\u0027s decision.          Netanyahu claimed the material - some 55,000 pages of documents and 183 CDs of secret information Israeli Mossad operative obtained from a Tehran facilityIran\u0027s foreign ministry spokesman called Netanyahu\u0027s performance a \u0027threadbare charlatanism\u0027 show. The state-run IRNA news agency on Tuesday quoted Ghasemi as saying Netanyahu\u0027s speech was part of \u0027fruitless efforts of a bankrupt and scandalous liar.\u0027Israeli commentators lauded what was being described as one of the Mossad\u0027s greatest intelligence achievements in unmasking the true nature of the Iranian government\u0027s intent to the world. Still, there was disappointment over the lack of a \u0027smoking gun\u0027 proving Iran had violated the nuclear deal.Political opponents also bristled at Netanyahu\u0027s showmanship in presenting the find.\u0027I am convinced that an absolute majority of the intelligence and military officials were opposed to this presentation,\u0027 said Ram Ben-Barak, a former deputy Mossad director who currently belongs to the opposition Yesh Atid party.          Iran\u0027s foreign ministry spokesman called Netanyahu\u0027s performance a \u0027threadbare charlatanism\u0027 show\u0027What was the point, apart from national pride, broadcasting it in such a dramatic way, as if you were unveiling a new and revolutionary telephone to the world,\u0027 he asked.The display ratcheted up already heightened tensions between Israel and Iran. Israel considers Iran to be its biggest threat, citing Tehran\u0027s hostile rhetoric, support for militants and growing influence in the region.Israel has said it will not allow Iran to establish a permanent military presence in neighboring Syria, where Iran supports President Bashar Assad. Just before midnight Sunday, a missile attack in northern Syria killed more than a dozen pro-government fighters, many of them Iranians, a war monitoring group and an Iranian news agency said.There was no official confirmation of the death toll or the target but Israel was widely suspected of being behind the attack.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/14/4BB941CB00000578-5677887-_Magical_feeling_A_man_is_silhouetted_by_the_dusk_light_as_he_wa-a-26_1525180961682.jpg","title":"Photographer captures hypnotising footage INSIDE waves","story":"    Stunning: The pictures are taken in various locations off the shores of southern California.

Labour embraced migrants … the Tories, not so much … Things are changing,” said one young black Tory in safer times, in 2015.Most of the black Tories I know are of African heritage and were raised with values that emphasise enterprise, faith, family and social conservatism. (For me, the conundrum has never been why there are black Conservatives at all, but why there aren’t more.) They have adopted a worldview in which racism – both within British society and the Tory party in particular – is largely a thing of the past. This has enabled them to create a mental ide between the party’s social and economic values, which they like, and its dodgy history on race. Their emphasis has been on personal responsibility and enterprise, rather than structural barriers to advancement.The last two Conservative prime ministers both made bold statements about their commitments toward eradicating these barriers. David Cameron, branding it “disgraceful” that a young black girl had to change her name to Elizabeth before she was invited to job interviews, for example and Theresa May, in her stance on stop and search, and the launch of her race audit.But the struggle to reconcile those warm words with the Windrush scandal has, perhaps not surprisingly, sent my black Tory acquaintances into a bout of soul-searching. “Better inside the tent looking out than outside the tent looking in,” one – a successful banker – told me. He then, somewhat mournfully, sent me the  article that Margaret Thatcher’s former speechwriter Derek Laud wrote on why the treatment of the Windrush generation made him glad he had left the party. Another black Tory told me, as if trying to convince herself: “Imagine how much worse it would be if there were no black people in the party.”I can’t imagine that, actually. How much worse could it be? We have a foreign secretary who has a long and distinguished track record of the crudest racist remarks – and the comments he published as editor of the Spectator about Caribbean people “multiplying like flies” are particularly painful to read in the light of current events. We have a litany of racist comments by activists, councillors and MPs. The last Conservative London mayoral campaign was so toxic that other Tories sought to distance themselves from it. And even when alerted to the Windrush injustices, May’s instinct was not to meet Caribbean leaders.Yes, there has been racism in the Labour party too, and it is currently – as has been widely reported – battling antisemitism in its ranks. The left has had a lazy\u0026nbsptendency to caricature black Tories as sellouts, while enjoying a historical sense of entitlement towards\u0026nbspthe black vote – an attitude that has its own imperialist connotations.Yet on the right there is a tendency to manipulate black conservatism to paper over a history of appalling racism and discrimination. Even the most conservative Conservatives have shocking stories of treatment within their own party, both at national and local level. Most do not speak about them publicly, although the former party chair Sayeeda Warsi’s rare account of the prejudice she experienced as a Muslim in the party is sobering. When a young black man close to me went to enquire about local party membership not long ago, they assumed he was there to deliver their pizza.But politics should be about policy, not the behaviour of rogue bigots, who can be found on all sides of the political spectrum. And that’s why the Conservative track record on immigration is so hard to reconcile. The new home secretary, Sajid Javid, for example, has a well-known backstory, beloved by Conservatives, of hard-earned success after his father’s arrival in the UK with just £1 to his name. Yet this story could not happen today, because Javid’s own party would not let his father into the country.The families of the MPs Kwasi Kwarteng, Sam Gyimah and Adam Afriyie, one or both of whose parents came, as my mother did, from Ghana having been British subjects under the empire, would – had they achieved the unlikely feat of making it into the country under today’s immigration policies – have found themselves in the nightmare of the Tories’ own hostile environment.It’s this hypocrisy that black Conservatives, on both sides of the Atlantic, struggle to shake off. The conviction of Bill Cosby for aggravated indecent assault against one woman – though he has more than 50 accusers – is bitter justice for a man whose message was, “Do as I say, not as I do”. Cosby, like black British Tories, blamed absent black fathers, shameless single mothers, black culture and rap music – not structural racism and injustice – for America’s creation of a black underclass. Substitute Cosby’s critique of “rap” for British Tories’ critique of “grime” and it all sounds very familiar.In the House of Commons on his first day in his new role, Javid told his shadow, Diane Abbott, that she did not have a “monopoly” on either being the descendant of migrants, or feeling anger and pain at the way some have been treated. And he’s right. But his party is fast earning itself a reputation for having a monopoly over treating British people of colour as less than British, indeed as less than human. And that will reverberate not just among people like me, who already fundamentally distrust the Tories, but many black and brown Brits who once did."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c4c1806e9de97e92413a25dd757287d3b882164/0_0_650_391/master/650.jpg?w=300\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc847c8c10de63388e6cb5352c903595","title":"from backstreet eats to five star feasts abu dhabis diverse dining scene","story":"Whether you’re on a blow-out budget or hunting for a bargain, Abu Dhabi has it all. Here, we pick some of the best – from souks to starry hauntsAbu Dhabi is a city of extremes, and we’re not just talking about that summer heat. The expensive tastes of wealthy locals and expats have seen it become a magnet for the biggest global names in hospitality, but if that’s not your scene, there’s also quite a selection of less overdraft-bothering local cafes that can offer astonishing value for money. From the ultra-shiny to the super-simple, here’s our pick of the best ...Liwan MansourLebanese is by far the UAE’s favourite cuisine, and despite the efforts of the capital’s top hotels, the best hummus and tabbouleh is still to be found in less polished surrounds. Most of the dishes here are simply on a par with nearby contenders, but it’s the takeaway shawarma – stuffed with beef or chicken, fries and garlic sauce – that make it a must for street-food seekers. Yours for just AED 6 (£1.16), one makes for a tasty lunch, two the perfect late night sustenance.liwanmansour.aeTandoori CornerIndian restaurants in Abu Dhabi fall into two categories: slick and pricey hotel-based operations, and backstreet curry houses where the bill can come in at a tenth of the price or less. Tandoori Corner (which isn’t, in fact, on a corner) is very much the latter, though the food is easily as good as its five-star competition. As with many Indian restaurants in the city, there’s a whole menu of Chinese dishes, too, making it perfect for any group at loggerheads over what they fancy for dinner.MeylasEmirati food is oddly difficult to come by in the United Arab Emirates. Looking to redress the balance is Shaikha Al Kaabi, a young local who first set up a roving foodtruck serving modern takes on the dishes of her childhood, and has since opened a bricks-and-mortar site. Start with the fareed (a meat and veg stew), before graduating to harees (a wheat pudding with beef). Even if one plate isn’t to your taste, dishes start at AED 20 (£4), so risks are minimal.meylasenBonna AnneeAs is tradition in Ethiopian cuisine, dishes at this welcoming backstreet restaurant come served up on a spongy sourdough flatbread called injera. This edible plate also serves as cutlery – rip a patch off and use it to scoop up the slow-cooked stews and curries on top. The Bonna Annee Special – preposterous value at just AED 40 (£8) – comprises a mix of meat and veg dishes, and will feed two people very handsomely indeed.Bord EauAbu Dhabi’s restaurant scene is full of wacky concepts. Thankfully, between the classic French cooking and the modestly stylish dining room, there are none to be found at this polished waterfront restaurant. That’s not to call Bord Eau stuffy – even traditional dishes such as boeuf bourguignon and confit duck surprise with canny twists and inventive presentation. Best of all, though, is the fact that even the simple stuff is beyond decadent – try the outrageously silken, buttery mash potato for evidence.shangri-laabudhabishangrilaHakkasanIt’s not unusual for glitzy restaurant brands to put down roots in the UAE. But Hakkasan – one of the first to do so – is unique in that it’s still every bit as good as it was when it first arrived at Emirates Palace eight years ago. The menu of modern Cantonese dishes is big on luxe ingredients – think Canadian lobster, Alaskan crab and wagyu beef – but the delicate, stunningly beautiful dim sum is where the kitchen’s real craft lies.hakkasanlocationshakkasan-abu-dhabiButcher \u0026amp StillThe Four Seasons hotel brought a whole new level of luxury to the city when it opened in 2016, so it’s no surprise to find that its flagship restaurant – a 1920s-styled steakhouse – is one of the hottest tables in town. The menu plays it straight – a simple selection of beefy cuts, some gobsmackingly expensive, with steakhouse staples on the side. Veggies, don’t run away screaming just yet – the beautiful and well-stocked bar is worth a visit alone.fourseasonsabudhabidiningrestaurantsbutcher_and_stillCoyaWith its focus on raw food, quinoa and pisco, Peruvian cuisine has been embraced by just about every trend-loving city in the world, so there was no way Abu Dhabi was going to miss out. At Coya, it all comes with an obligatory layer of luxury wagyu tartare bao, grilled king crab – even a side dish of fried potatoes is jazzed up with some black truffle.

But levels of contamination vary widely depending on government actions and financial resources.But these gains were set against a worsening trend in other regions.Delhi and Cairo are by far the most polluted mega-cities in the world with average PM10 levels more than 10 times the WHO guidelines. They are followed by Dhaka, Mumbai and Beijing, each with particulate concentrations about five times the recommended level.In terms of household air pollution, which contributed to 3.8m deaths, the gap is also wide because families in poorer nations are more dependent on burning wood, coal and kerosene for cooking and heating.Overall, the authors said the global annual death toll of 7 million is largely unchanged from the previous 2016 air pollution report by the WHO, despite growing awareness of the problem and government promises of action.Reducing these risks depends on public awareness and political will, as well as income. The authors of the report praised China, which has tightened pollution controls in the wake of “airpocalypse” scandals, public protests and health concerns.“One of the reasons for that, is the health argument is strongly presented and citizens felt the link between air pollution and their own health,” said Dr Maria Neira, director of public health at WHO. “We’d like to see the same movement now in India, which is a country of particular concern.”There are signs of progress from specific projects, such as India’s Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana scheme which has provided 37 million women living below the poverty line with free liquified petroleum gas connections, and Mexico City, which has committed to cleaner vehicle standards. More cities are also measuring air quality, which is pushing the subject up the political agenda.But there is much to be done, even in wealthy nations with relatively progressive policies. The new data reveals 49 towns and cities in the UK – ranging from London and Manchester to Prestonpans and Eccles – are at or over WHO standards for PM2.5. Jenny Bates, Friends of the Earth air pollution campaigner, said this showed the need for more research and stronger policies.“As more air quality data becomes available, we are uncovering a deeply concerning number of seemingly quaint, fresh aired places across the UK with dangerously polluted air,” she said.But the overall picture is clear. WHO says the threat remains enormous across the globe with the worst impacts hitting the poor.“Air pollution threatens us all, but the poorest and most marginalised people bear the brunt of the burden,” says Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of WHO. “It is unacceptable that over 3 billion people – most of them women and children – are still breathing deadly smoke every day from using polluting stoves and fuels in their homes. If we don’t take urgent action on air pollution, we will never come close to achieving sustainable development.”As well as governments, WHO are encouraging iniduals to do more to reduce air pollution with a campaign to promote greater use of public transport and bicycles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0114e3839633a577a37f98852993cfd43388faa4/0_265_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb600acfcfd1eb3e9ab744de55d9a1de","title":"new orleans cuban treefrogs","story":"Officials say frogs caught at city’s Audubon zoo could soon pose a threat to native frogs across the Mississippi riverInvasive, noxious Cuban treefrogs that eat smaller frogs and grow as big as a human fist have established a population in New Orleans, and officials say they could soon pose a threat to native frogs across the Mississippi river.The US Geological Survey says frogs caught at the Audubon zoo in the city and at a nearby riverfront park are the first established population of Cuban treefrogs on the US mainland outside Florida, where they’ve been multiplying at least since the 1950s.The captured frogs probably arrived on palm trees from Florida that were planted in the zoo in 2016, USGS research ecologist Brad Glorioso wrote in a study published in the April issue of the journal Biological Invasions.“They have noxious skin secretions, lay their eggs in bird baths and fish ponds, and they can clog plumbing and cause power outages by short-circuiting utility switches where they seek refuge,” he said in a news release.They could easily cross the river on vehicles, boats, barges or debris and prey on smaller frogs, he wrote in the article.Local treefrogs are considerably smaller than Cuban treefrogs, said Jeff Boundy, a herpetologist with the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries’ Natural Heritage Program.“The natives are about a quarter- to half-dollar-size on your kitchen window at night. These guys get up to five and a half inches (14cm) in body length. You’re talking about a fist-sized frog now,” Boundy said in a phone interview.The geological survey has been using acoustic monitors since 2014 to check for Cuban treefrog calls in the Barataria Preserve of the Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve, across the river just a few miles south of New Orleans, Dusty Pate, the park’s natural resource program manager, said.He said they’re the latest in a long list of invasive species, including Chinese tallow trees, nutria and feral hogs, threatening the park.“The park spends a lot of time and effort trying to manage invasive plant and animal species,” he said.Pate said a smaller Cuban treefrog, called the greenhouse frog, is already in the park, but is not considered such a threat. “They eat insects, not other frogs,” he said.Soon after palm trees from Florida were planted in the zoo’s elephant exhibit, elephant keepers “began noticing unusual treefrogs,” the study said. Not knowing what they were, they caught the frogs and released them at the nearby fence line until being told in October 2016 that they were invasive Cuban treefrogs and should be euthanized.Inidual frogs have been found here and there in Louisiana at least since 1990, but there weren’t enough to establish populations, Glorioso wrote.Four surveys of the zoo and park in late 2017 found 370 Cuban tree frogs: 58 in the zoo and the rest in the park. The park survey also found about 450 tadpoles in a tire rut, with 1,600 more in a pool only about a meter (3.3 feet) long and half that wide, the report said. Water was emptied from both pools to kill any tadpoles not caught.Boundy said invasive Cuban treefrogs in Florida seem to be found mostly in cities and suburbs.But he agreed that they could easily get to the Barataria Preserve.“Somebody goes to visit the zoo for a day and they get one up in their wheel well and go to Jean Lafitte the next day, they could end up driving it down there. And of course one doesn’t make a population. But if that repeats itself over and over ... it could become established.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c85c4cff78b2165dfda780ba631ac1bde6b9148/14_150_4373_2624/master/4373.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ea5e09078ff93c68314ab87649e8a15","title":"harry kane fa tweet england spurs","story":"• Tottenham striker says other nations would not belittle players• Kane will not leave social media despite actions of minorityHarry Kane has said the Football Association was silly to poke fun at his performance in Tottenham’s FA Cup semi-final defeat by Manchester United and questioned why people feel the need to mock England players before the World Cup.The striker was kept quiet by United’s Chris Smalling at Wembley and after the game, which United won 2-1, the official FA Cup account tweeted: “What’s that in your pocket, Chris?” and linked to an unrelated video of the defender saying: “Harry Kane.”The tweet was deleted and the FA apologised to Tottenham and United “for any offence caused”. Mauricio Pochettino, Tottenham’s manager, branded the game’s governing body an embarrassment last week. Kane is relaxed about the issue but he pointed out it was an odd way for the FA to treat one of its own.“The FA tweet was a silly tweet,” Kane said. “We all know that. I talked to the gaffer about it and all we said was: ‘Would other countries do that to their players?’ Probably not.“It is something that has gone. Two weeks ago now or whatever – I am over it. The gaffer may have said I am sad but I am focused. I am a guy that gets over things. If it happened, it happened. I move on and look forward to the next game and that is all I worry about.”Kane, who scored his 38th goal of the season in Tottenham’s 2-0 win over Watford on Monday, added that England players receive too much flak at times.“It’s strange,” he said. “Maybe it’s a mentality thing. It is easier nowadays maybe to banter England players or take the mickey out of the England players. So if we don’t do well in the World Cup, then they can write and say: ‘We told you so.’ But that is maybe a weaker mentality.“It is what it is. We are focusing on what we have got to do. We have got to go with the mindset and belief we can do it. We try to win everything we go into. The World Cup is no different.”Kane has been the butt of a few jokes since fighting to be credited with a goal that brushed off him against Stoke on 7 April. However he has no plans to step away from social media.“On social media you get a few people who don’t see eye to eye and it is being a fan and having an opinion,” he said. “I will always engage with my fans. It is just a small number of fans who maybe go over the mark but that is just life. You cannot get too down about that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db12fd1128e63e30b30cab2945c7d88c8516a93d/0_204_3067_1840/master/3067.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14af96f54b4fc3a83ad0dc562de0a200","title":"real madrid bayern munich champions league match report","story":"Real Madrid always find a way, they say, and somehow they did – all the way to a third consecutive European Cup final. For so long, they had the Bavarians at the gates, the Bernabéu gripped by fear, but when a long, wild, tense and often inexplicable match was over and the siege subsided at last, there they were, still standing. A goal down after three minutes, Real were not safe until the very end but it is they, not Bayern Munich, who made it to Kiev. The world’s biggest club, 12 times winners of this competition, finalists for the fourth time in five years, are also its greatest survivors.“The European Cup releases special powers in Real Madrid,” Toni Kroos had said it does something to their opponents too. For Bayern, 39 shots over two legs proved less decisive than three gifts, each greater than the last. This time it was Corentin Tolisso’s back pass and Sven Ulreich’s moment of panic that cost them, an error that lent credence to Franz Beckenbauer’s suggestion that Bayern have a “complex” when it comes to Real. And yet for a long time it appeared they might overcome even that.The problem was that standing before them, ing before them too, were the team who know that to resist is to win, making a virtue of suffering, a word Zinedine Zidane uses often. This time they suffered like never before: when one last ball was sent into Real’s area, desperate whistles bursting ear drums, the clock beyond 95 minutes, they might have wondered if for once fate would be cruel. Instead, the ball escaped Thomas Müller, the referee blew for the last time and the roar rocked this place. Ulreich sat distraught and alone on the turf as the noise engulfed everything. “That’s how Real win!” they chanted, but how, exactly? Real win because, well, Real win. Even when they don’t actually win. It finished 2-2 but those two goals from Karim Benzema were enough. A 2-1 win in Munich had allowed it, the tie finishing 4-3 on aggregate.It had been a long night. Zidane had said the key was “not to take a step back, not to try to hang on to the result, but to go for it from the start”, but in the end hanging on was what they did. Jupp Heynckes insisted the first leg showed Real could be hurt and it was his side who began on the front foot, swiftly levelling the aggregate score. When Joshua Kimmich struck from close range it was not even the first time Bayern had ventured into the Real area. James Rodríguez playing deep, finding space, red shirts seemingly outnumbering white, the balance tilted Bayern’s way. But hurting Real is one thing, killing them another.Although Marcelo’s superb cross was headed in by Karim Benzema to make it 1-1 in the 11th minute, Bayern had always needed two anyway and continued to press. In a match that was marked by missed opportunities, the most astonishing came after half an hour. Mats Hummels went past three and slipped the ball into the area for Robert Lewandowski, alone. His shot looped up off Keylor Navas and Müller leapt to head goalwards, the ball hitting Marcelo’s back. It dropped to Rodríguez, who volleyed over from three yards.Soon after that Cristiano Ronaldo forced a save from Ulreich, a reminder of the risk and Bayern must have felt that they needed another goal before half-time. The Bernabéu, whistling for the half to end, certainly feared one. Tolisso curled over and then Marcelo handled before Lewandowksi forced a corner. Hummels headed wide. The chance, it seemed, was gone.Thirty seconds into the second half, it seemed it really had. Tolisso played the back-pass blind and Ulreich froze, wanting to pick it up before realising he could not and effectively just sitting down, collapsing and allowing the ball to escape him. Benzema, barely able to believe it, strolled past to score – another “gift” to add to the two Heynckes lamented in the first leg.David Alaba’s shot was pushed away by Navas and then Lewandowski tumbled, challenged by Sergio Ramos, as Bayern kept coming. White bodies were on the line, just like in the first leg, roars accompanying every block, save and header. Tolisso could not force home and, on the hour, first Thiago Alcântara and then Lewandowski fired goalwards, before the equaliser arrived. James volleyed Niklas Süle’s cross, reacted swiftly to the rebound and guided under Navas. A former Real player, he did not celebrate but high in the north stand the German fans did.They were just a goal away now, the game on a knife edge. But if there is a team capable of living on the edge, it is Real. Tolisso connected with a volley six yards out and Navas made a superb save.It was the 18th shot Bayern had had, one more even than in the first leg, yet still they trailed. The deliveries from the left were endless – from one, Navas scrambled away Müller’s header and from another he punched clear. A scramble was hacked clear and in the fourth minute of added time Navas saved once more.Time slipped away, hearts raced and one last cross was played in, once more into the fray. Müller launched himself at it but the ball evaded him, taking the final with it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2df5d7366d178d1b0f13d0860fd782d3845311c4/214_0_3335_2002/master/3335.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ee62a550d39b99692d5fe0af91993bb","title":"real madrid v bayern munich champions league semi final live","story":"Bayern were brilliant, but ultimately undone by Sven Ulreich’s awful mistake ... and so resolute Real Madrid made it to yet another Champions League final.And now, the pièce de résistance ...

They’re tired, they know they were pushed to the absolute limit tonight ... and of course they’re getting used to this. This will be their 16th final, their third in a row, and their fourth in the last five seasons. It’s some record: not quite up there with the achievements of 1956-1960, but not far off, and in the modern era to boot. Bayern threw everything at them tonight, but they did what great champions teams do: hung in, fought hard, and found a way to get the result they needed despite not being at their best. They’re now 90 minutes away from becoming European champions for the 13th time!Several Bayern players instantly dissolve into tears. And no wonder.

Navas stays down. There will be five minutes of added time!89 min: Muller goes on a power dribble down the inside-left channel. He cuts inside and is cynically clipped by Casemiro, who is booked. A free kick, 35 yards out. A chance to load the box. Too far out to shoot directly, surely.88 min: Asensio is replaced by Nacho. Asensio takes his leave in the professional style, even stopping mid-meander to roll down his socks and sort out his shinpads. Then he spins to say goodbye, applauding every corner of the stadium before he departs. The clock ticks on. He’s cheeky, but polite.86 min: Ronaldo spins on a sixpence and flicks a gorgeous ball through a gap between three red shirts, sending Bale clear down the left!

Bayern have been brilliant tonight, two rushes of blood at the start of the second half excepted.80 min: The corner on the left comes to nothing. But this is good pressure from Bayern, who are doing all they can to find the goal that would knock the holders out and send the German champs to the final. The Bernabeu is accordingly tense.79 min: Thiago strips the ball from Modric and sends Alaba away down the left. The resulting cross is met by Muller, who heads down to the bottom right. Navas turns it around the post in slightly uncertain fashion. The corner on the right leads to a corner on the left.78 min: Ronaldo dribbles with great purpose down the right, but is stopped in his tracks by Sule, just before he’s got a chance to break into the box and shoot. Corner, which is worked to Marcelo out on the left. Marcelo is in a lot of space, but his cross is way too deep and wild. Another goal kick.77 min: This match is beautifully poised. One more goal for Bayern, and the reigning champions will be out. One more for Real, and it’s surely all over. Ronaldo bursts down the left and feeds Bale, who looks to have done enough to earn a corner, but Bayern get the decision. Goal kick.75 min: Tolisso is replaced by Wagner. And Bayern continue to push, Alaba crossing from the left for James, who tries to force the ball into the bottom left from the middle of a thicket of players. Navas claims.74 min: Alaba romps down the left yet again. He crosses deep. Muller heads down, and Tolisso smacks goalwards. Navas, who has been superb, parries strongly.73 min: Benzema and Kovacic are replaced by Bale and Casemiro.71 min: Kovacic is inches away from sending Ronaldo clear into the box with a sliderule pass down the inside-right channel. Not quite. Hummels intercepts just in time.69 min: Lewandowski wins a bouncing ball in the centre circle and sends Ribery skating down the left. Real are very light at the back, and Muller is clear in the middle! Ribery can’t find him with a pass, though, shepherded down the wing by Lucas Vazquez. That’s excellent defending. Top notch. Bayern would surely be leading now had the Real right-back not stuck tight to his man there.67 min: From a corner on the left, Marcelo is shaping to shoot when another ball appears on the pitch. Not sure who threw that on, but it’s put a stop to Real’s attack. Is Diego Simeone in the house? Bayern batter the dropped-ball restart miles upfield, much to the annoyance of the home support.65 min: Lucas Vazquez is booked for blocking an in-flight Alaba.64 min: This is no more than Bayern deserve on the balance of play. Their response to conceding 21 seconds after the restart, and in such ridiculous circumstances, has been magnificent. One more goal, and they’ll be in Kiev! Those Ronaldo misses look a bit more important, all of a sudden.Bayern are back in this! Sule makes good down the right. He fires into the centre. James smacks a shot low and hard, towards the bottom right. Navas parries, but James is first to the rebound, and slams it home from a tight angle. It’s back on!62 min: Modric is booked for a late clip on Tolisso’s ankles.60 min: Bayern, having recovered from the shock of that farcical goal, are giving this their best shot. It’s now or never. Thiago and Lewandowski take turns to shoot from the edge of the Real box, the hosts pressed back and momentarily unable to escape. But somehow Real hold firm under pinball pressure.58 min: Alaba bursts down the left yet again he has been magnificent tonight. He earns a corner off Modric. Muller flicks the set piece on at the near post, but neither Tolisso nor Lewandowski are able to force the ball home amid a melee. Muller gets involved himself, but eventually Real clear.56 min: Bayern aren’t giving up, though. James curls a cross into the Real box from the left. Varane slices hysterically behind for a corner. From which ...54 min: Modric tries to curl one into the bottom left from a position out on the right. He’s inches wide. Then Real come again. First Ronaldo is a toenail away from sticking a telescopic leg on a right-wing Asensio cross, then he misses an even bigger sitter, Kovacic curling in from the left, CR7 blasting 200FTUP from 6YDS. Real so close to putting this tie to bed.52 min: Lewandowski is barged in the back by Ramos as the pair contest a high ball in the Real area. The referee decides the touch Ramos got on the ball was enough to save Real, but it was a heavy challenge, and you’ve seen penalty kicks given for less. It’s a corner, though, from which Lewandowski can’t get any power on a goalwards header.51 min: Alaba cuts in from the left and unleashes a pearler. It takes a deflection off Varane, and looks to be heading into the left-hand portion of the net, but Navas somehow reads the deflection and turns the ball away for a corner. That one comes to nothing, but what a save!49 min: Benzema bursts down the left and falls over in the box. He’s on a hat-trick, but doesn’t bother to claim for a penalty.47 min: That was Sunday league stuff. I have no idea what Ulreich was attempting there. That’s a moment that will haunt him for a long time unless Bayern can score twice in the next 43 minutes plus stoppages. We can’t have extra time now.This is a complete nonsense! Tolisso, deep in the right-back position, turns and plays a blind pass towards his keeper. Benzema is lurking, though. And if that wasn’t bad enough, Ulreich has a brain freeze, thinking about handling, then sliding and fresh-air kicking. He lets the ball sail straight through him! Benzema rounds the stricken keeper and rolls into the empty net!And we’re off again! No changes. Bayern get the party restarted.And that’s the end of an exhilarating half of football. This semi-final is still very much in the balance. One more Bayern goal, and we’ll be heading to extra time. But as things stand, it’s Real who are going through to the final in Kiev on May 26.45 min +1: Kimmich crosses from the right. Marcelo jumps to block. The ball hits his hand, but there was no intent, though Bayern think otherwise. Lewandowski forces a corner, which comes to nothing.45 min: Tolisso gets a little bit more time and space, just outside the Real area. He sends a short-backlift curler inches wide of the top-right corner. For a second, that appeared to be flying into the net. Navas was concerned, that’s for sure, scampering across. Not sure he’d have got there had it been on target.44 min: Alaba causes more bother down the left. He’s bundled over by Lucas Vasquez, and wants a free kick in a very dangerous position, but he’s not going to get it. A strange decision.42 min: A pocket of space for the wily Tolisso in the middle of the Real half. He instantly rolls a pass down the right, in the hope of releasing Muller into the area. Just a bit too much on it. Real were wide open there.40 min: Muller and Lewandowski very nearly one-two their way into the Real box, with some crisp and inventive passing down the middle. Not quite. Here, is that the time already? Where did it all go? The clock is whirring round even more quickly than everyone’s legs.39 min: Ronaldo has done very little tonight ... so now he nearly scores. Of course he does. He dribbles in from the right and curls an effort towards the bottom right. Ulreich does very well to turn it around the post. From the corner, hit long, Ramos clanks a header into the side netting. This is relentless entertainment.37 min: Possession is at a premium right now. You could say it’s gone a bit scrappy, but brilliant flicks are so nearly coming off, while the pressing is relentless and impressive.

While 00s glossies consisted largely of insidious bodyshaming and bankrupting shoe recommendations, in recent years female-centric journalism has migrated online, simultaneously shifting its gaze to social justice, mental health and the hitherto hidden realities of womanhood. It has not always been a smooth transition: last week, the online women’s magazine the Debrief announced its closure, with its parent company, Bauer Media, deciding to refocus resources into its print product Grazia. Last year, Sarah Millican’s Standard Issue shut, while US website the Hairpin followed suit in January. Yet a host of other publications remain committed to doing things differently. Here, the women behind London-based site gal-dem and Mille World, an online magazine aimed at Arab readers, explain why they are determined to reimagine the women’s magazine as a force for positive change. RASofia Guellaty launched Mille World out of frustration that it did not already exist. She was looking for a publication that engaged with what it meant to be a young Arab woman. Versace, Dior, Calvin Klein and Chanel were sending hijabs down their runways, but who was catering to the savvy, cosmopolitan Arab women looking to reclaim the Arab narrative for an educated Arab audience? It turned out no one was, so Guellaty decided to.Educated in Paris, but born and now based in Tunis, the capital of Tunisia, 35-year-old Guellaty was at the helm of Condé Nast’s first Middle East launch, the now-closed StyleArabia, two years ago. “I kept hearing about things being ‘good enough’ for the Arab market. That really got to me, this ‘good enough’ attitude. Two things: one, it’s not good enough, what you’re doing is crap. Two, it’s racist,” Guellaty says. Two years ago, she quit Condé Nast last May she became pregnant with her first child. It was during her pregnancy that she developed the idea for Mille World. After giving birth, she recruited the first members of the board, which now includes Saudi princess Reema bint Bandar al-Saud and Saif Mahdhi, the president of Next Models. She recruited the company’s CEO, Nez Gebreel, from the Dubai Design and Fashion Council. It was crucial to Guellaty that her executive and editorial team were Arabs and leaders in their field.Mille World launched in January and already has 40,000 unique visitors a month. Its readers come from across the Arab world and diaspora, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Lebanon, Egypt, France, the UK and the US. Its 12-person editorial staff is equally international, based in Dubai, London, Paris and Tunis. The deputy editor, Samira Larouci, 28, has lived in Dalston, London, for years, but she was raised in “very, very white” Chichester by her Moroccan parents. She left i-D magazine in July, having helped set up its luxury lifestyle site, Amuse. She was put in touch with Guellaty by a mutual friend. Their first phone call lasted two and a half hours. “We were talking about Arab identity issues I’ve always been seeking a community of my own to connect with. We both agreed there was a voice missing that we wanted to hear. It was young, inclusive and not based around materialism,” Larouci says. “We wanted to address that need. It’s almost laughable no one’s done it before.”Larouci now commissions and edits the bulk of the site’s editorial content – 60 pieces a month, every one of which is translated into English, French and Arabic. She is interested particularly in Arab counterculture and championing Arab artists who do not have any other platform in their region. “The reader I want to reach is someone studying in Washington, raised in Saudi, who’s in a sort of cultural limbo. That’s where I come from. I want to find those people in LA who are interested in feminism in the Arab world,” Larouci says.Deep in the belly of a south London car park lie the offices of gal-dem, an online magazine produced exclusively by women and non-binary people of colour. It is not big – each of the work studios in Peckham Levels has been converted from a single parking space – but it is significant. By parsing culture and current affairs through a prism of intersectional feminism, covering topics from Grenfell to mooncups, gal-dem is one of the publications changing the face of female-focused media.As a concept, gal-dem is a world away from the blinkered women’s glossies available to the editorial team in their youth. While those magazines shared some women’s stories, the scope was narrow, and much of the content was designed to reaffirm strict beauty standards. gal-dem, meanwhile, has no such agenda, aiming to provide women with just one thing: a voice. In this sense, the site is part of a much broader cultural shift in women’s media – one that has seen print titles fail (recent casualties include Company, She, Glamour, Bliss and Sugar) and a new breed of online magazine take their place. Riding the fourth wave of feminism, publications such as The Pool and Refinery 29 are fuelled not by materialism, but by a rich seam of untapped subject matter: the experiences women have long been told to keep quiet.While the gal-dem team acknowledge their position in the wider landscape of newly feminist media, they are careful to distinguish themselves from their peers. “There is a tendency within feminism for its face to be quite white and middle-class,” says Little. “To see an editorial team comprising women of colour is a rarity I think that is clearly our point of difference.” From her desk in the gal-dem offices, the deputy editor – and  contributor – Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff explains how the focus on issues that affect women of colour manifests itself in gal-dem’s attitude. “The tone in general is a bit more serious than the Refinerys and Bustles we don’t have that ‘you’re talking to your best friend’ thing going on,” she says. “The nature of the topics we’re talking about a lot of the time don’t really lend themselves to that and we don’t want to ever dilute that seriousness.”Slowly, gal-dem’s efforts to rectify a lack of representation are being echoed by the mainstream media – with decidedly mixed results. Since he took over six months ago, the Vogue editor Edward Enninful has managed to include five women of colour on his covers (February’s Vogue featured Little in a spread about “the new suffragettes”), yet glossies are still regularly derided for their treatment of black women. In November, the actor Lupita Nyong’o expressed her disappointment at Grazia’s decision to photoshop away her natural hair on its cover the previous month, the Evening Standard’s magazine caused much consternation by airbrushing Solange’s braids. And just because online magazines tend to avoid scandal, that does not mean they are necessarily much better, Brinkhurst-Cuff says. “It would be more hidden if there was an issue online, because you don’t have the physical print cover to see. We can say Alexandra Shulman only published 12 black women on the cover, whereas if an online publication is pretty much exclusively publishing white writers or using stock images of white women you’re arguably less likely to pick up on that.” That said, she sees the new online media “struggling towards intersectionality, for the right or wrong reasons. Diversity is in fashion right now, but we hope it’s not always about money.”Money, however, is something gal-dem is beginning to consider seriously. Until now, it has been a voluntary organisation. Nobody gets paid, apart from contributors on specific brand collaborations the annual print issue, the covers of which hang from the office’s chipboard walls, is more passion project than money-maker. But as the site has grown – gal-dem receives “anything from 4,000 to 20,000 unique visitors a day”, according to Little – the team believe it is turning into an economically viable enterprise. Little has just stopped working full-time and the team are developing a business plan.It is still early days for the new breed of women’s magazine and the economic forecast remains uncertain – but, in terms of broadening the scope for women’s media, the legacy of gal-dem and its peers already seems indelible. RAThe PoolAimed at the time-stretched woman, this online magazine from Lauren Laverne and former Red editor Sam Baker focuses on snackable content – its intimate personal essays and practical advice are all stamped with an average reading time.Man RepellerInitially a blog documenting Leandra Medine’s love of ugly and offbeat fashion, Man Repeller now also publishes smart, funny and moving pieces on everything from ghosting to antidepressants.Broadly“For women who know their place” runs the tagline to Vice’s women-focused channel, which covers feminist issues with an emphasis on reportage.Burnt RotiOn Londoner Sharan Dhaliwal’s lifestyle site, writers of south Asian heritage discuss topics including bereavement and menstruation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0490b9a1759ac1afb4f6e9c4653887a7b59eaf1e/0_183_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32475c6796fe43af374671312161c934","title":"planking pizzas new rules successful meetings","story":"Amazon employees sit in silence – while Tesla boss Elon Musk advocates walking out if you aren’t adding value. But how can you stop wasting your life in pointless meetings? Here’s an expert guideSome human inventions flash into being, get a little polish and then are pretty much left alone, their users generally satisfied, or at least not so dissatisfied that they attempt to come up with an alternative. No one tries to build a better hankie, a more comforting cuddle or a dinner plate “that really works”. Yet the search for the perfect business meeting seems never-ending. The caravan instead of the boardroom, the rubber chicken that bestows the right to speak: you name it, it has been tried and generally found to suck. Now Jeff Bezos, the founder and CEO of Amazon, has had a go, creating what he calls “the weirdest meeting culture you will ever encounter”.Weird? Maybe, though other words that spring to mind include “anal” and “stultifying”. As Bezos told the audience at the George W Bush Presidential Center in Dallas, he has banned the PowerPoint presentations that dominate most commercial meetings. Instead, some poor devil must spend a week or more preparing “a six-page, narratively structured memo” full of “real sentences” rather than bullet points. Everyone else must then spend the first half-hour of the meeting silently – and publicly – pondering it, before moving on to a debate. Bezos calls this “a kind of study hall”.“Not surprisingly, the quality of these memos varies widely,” Bezos admits. “Some have the clarity of angels singing. They are brilliant and thoughtful and set up the meeting for high-quality discussion. Sometimes they come in at the other end of the spectrum …”If this sounds like your idea of hell, don’t panic. Some of the finest minds in business are working on alternatives.“This is quite pervasive in organisations now,” says Prof André Spicer from Cass Business School at City, University of London. “They might ask people to reflect for a few minutes in a meeting before making a decision. Or they’ll ask people to turn inwards, and think about what their own feelings are telling them.” Evidence suggests that injecting more mindfulness can help alleviate inidual anxiety, and help people focus better in meetings and lose the irrelevant information.“The danger of it, though,” says Spicer, “is that it gets treated as a way to cover up more systemic issues. I’ve been working with the Department of Health, which introduced a mindfulness programme to deal with health and wellness issues in the department. The truth was that the problems there were with endemic restructuring and extreme working hours – the mindfulness just extended meetings and the working day.”“The death of the long lunch is a tragedy for businesses,” says Spicer. “Many organisations had lunch together in cafeterias where everyone stopped and ate together and talked. There is research by Humanize, which studies social networks and work, that shows that people who go to lunch and sit in fairly large groups tend to do a lot better in the company, simply because they are building up networks and finding out what is going on in the business. Bring back lunch!”Actually, says Emma Sinclair, the co-founder of EnterpriseAlumni, there is a lot to be said for the regular company-wide catchup, even if it comes in the form of a traditional meeting. “People do need to feel included. And a bit of consistency is good.”“One PayPal executive, David Sacks, used to burst into meeting rooms like a prohibition-era cop and ask what people were meeting about,” says Bruce Daisley, the European vice-president at Twitter and the host of the Eat Sleep Work Repeat podcast. “If it wasn’t any good, he would stop the meeting right then and there. I love this idea of superhero-style vigilantes closing meetings down. Imagine if the burden of having a meeting was that at any point you’d have to explain what the meeting was about. Brilliant! If all of us knew we would be held to account for the cost of a meeting and the amount of people’s time we are taking up, our perspective would be different. The meeting is taking all the fun out of our jobs because we are so scared of not being busy. But sitting at your desk and thinking is an important part of the job.”Ever sat in a meeting and wondered how much it was costing the company in terms of salaries? Tools such as Harvard Business Review’s business meeting cost calculator will put a figure on it. Spicer recommends a meeting budget. “If you want to invite a member of staff to your meeting, it will get taken off your budget. The cost of inviting loads of people to come along and listen to a PowerPoint presentation actually becomes valued, and you have to think: ‘Do we actually need this person there?’”Everyone wants meetings to be shorter, but stunts pulled in some workplaces such as making attendees hold the plank, do situps, speak against a timer or put money in a charity box if they overrun are counterproductive and, frankly, irritating. “I’m a bit suspicious of any of that jiggery-pokery,” says Stefan Stern, the co-author of Myths of Management. “That doesn’t feel like work to me. If you’re trying to achieve something from your meeting, you need to be focusing on the meat of the matter.” Rather than your aching muscles, for example.“All this show-and-tell stuff turns the meeting into a spectacle, rather than something productive,” agrees Spicer. However, he adds, standing meetings are effective at cutting meeting times. Walking and talking (favoured by Mark Zuckerberg and Barack Obama) has also been shown to help people work better. “Marily Oppezzo at Stanford University has done a lot of research in this area,” says Daisley. “She shows how meetings can engage ergent thought – so they help people come up with ideas, although not necessarily narrow them down.”“It’s a great idea to get people to check in their phones and laptops,” says Spicer. “Unless they are actually being used, not having them helps people focus their attention on what is actually going on in the room.” That doesn’t mean it’s not awkward, however. “I recently did some work with senior managers at a bank and they were forced to put their phones in sealed envelopes. They were constantly looking over to the cupboard where their phones were. As soon as the first break came, they ripped them open like they were crack addicts who had just seen a bag of crack. But once they had actually got focused on a task, they got a lot more done. One of the basic principles of productivity is that we are terrible at multitasking, so we need to remove as many distractions from meetings as possible.”Another Bezos rule: he won’t call a meeting, or even attend one, where two pizzas couldn’t feed the entire group. “Meetings now are easier than ever to arrange,” says Daisley. This means they can often become “very low-quality exchanges of ideas and powerplay” if they are not considered properly and numbers kept under control. The solution is to “value the introverts”. “Most of modern work has been around celebrating the extrovert – brainstorming meetings, presentations, open-plan offices,” he says. “Performance art has become part of our job. But when you look into how a creative idea is formed, it is normally by inidual thinking and one-to-one conversation. As Susan Cain says in her book Quiet, the truth about the best collaborations is that they are in smaller groups – it’s more Lennon and McCartney than loads of people in an open-plan room.”“Walk out of a meeting or drop off a call as soon as it is obvious you aren’t adding value,” the billionaire CEO of Tesla, Elon Musk, has said. “It is not rude to leave it is rude to make someone stay and waste their time.” Of course, it is probably easier to get away with this when you are a fantastically rich company boss rather than an underpaid middle manager.“Is your meeting really necessary?” asks Stern. “As the management consultant Peter Drucker put it, ‘One either meets or one works.’” Daisley says we should abolish half of all meetings. “If you go into a meeting and somebody asks: ‘Has anyone got anything for today’s agenda?’, that should tell you that there is no point to it. We live in a world where the quality of our work is being appraised by others, by our bosses, so we never want to appear as if we’re not working hard. So when a meeting comes up that we are responsible for, we all want to show that we have packed agendas. We need to lose the fear of standing people down for meetings and cancel them.”How do you do it? Maybe cite some evidence. “We’re starting to realise that interruptions and distractions are the curse of getting anything done,” says Daisley. “We need to permit people to have quiet spaces. In Cal Newport’s book Deep Work, he argues that anything of any value is created only by a period of isolated concentration.” Something to send back on your next calendar invite."},{"url":null,"title":"kanye west on slavery for 400 years that sounds like a choice","story":"In a confrontation in the TMZ newsroom, the rapper talks about his view on slavery as well as reaffirming his support for Donald TrumpKanye West has said that 400 years of slavery is “a choice” in a TMZ interview that resulted in a confrontation.The rapper, who has been tweeting out support for Donald Trump in recent weeks, was talking about the president, free thinking and labels before he moved onto slavery.“When you hear about slavery for 400 years,” he said. “For 400 years? That sounds like a choice. You was there for 400 years and it’s all of y’all. It’s like we’re mentally in prison. I like the word prison because slavery goes too direct to the idea of blacks. Slavery is to blacks as the Holocaust is to Jews. Prison is something that unites as one race, blacks and whites, that we’re the human race.”He then proceeded to talk directly to the entire office before TMZ reporter Van Lathan shot back at him for his comments. “I actually don’t think you’re thinking anything,” he said.He continued: “While you are making music and being an artist and living the life that you’ve earned by being a genius, the rest of us in society have to deal with these threats to our lives.” Lathan said he was “unbelievably hurt” about Kanye morphing into something that’s “not real”.Earlier in the conversation, West reaffirmed his support for Trump calling him his “boy” and explaining why he tweeted a picture wearing a Make America Great Again cap. “I felt a freedom in doing something that everybody tells you not to do,” he said.West’s return to the spotlight has proceeded the release of two new albums out in June. The rapper dropped two initial tracks over the past week to a mixed reception.Today also saw the release of an hour-long interview with radio host Charlamagne tha God which saw West say he’s in “a stronger place” than he’s ever been while also expressing hurt over Barack Obama calling him a “jackass”.“Don’t tell the world I’m a jackass,” he said. “I’m fightin’ hard enough. Something about me going on stage was similar to what you was doing. ’Cause I’m fighting to break the simulation, break the setup. That didn’t make no sense.”In the same interview, West also briefly touched upon slavery. “When I saw Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill, that’s when I wanted to use bitcoin,” he said. “It’s like all the slave movies. Why you gotta keep reminding us about slavery? Why don’t you put Michael Jordan on the $20 bill?” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfae73c4721585e93640376faf4fea3a96bcbb45/0_42_4353_2612/master/4353.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b59c0a28a231761ece2ffd71fa360b1","title":"the muterkelly statement from women of color of times up","story":"The full statement calls on corporations and venues to cut ties with the musician and demands that investigations be made into allegations of abuseBelow is the full statement released by the Women of Color of Time’s Up on Monday morning, which released a flood of online debate about musician R Kelly and ignited a conversation about the activism of black women.

Here’s why that’s not very clever. By  David RuncimanDemocracy is tired, vindictive, self-deceiving, paranoid, clumsy and frequently ineffectual. Much of the time it is living on past glories. This sorry state of affairs reflects what we have become. But current democracy is not who we are. It is just a system of government, which we built, and which we could replace. So why don’t we replace it with something better?This line of argument has grown louder in recent years, as democratic politics has become more unpredictable and, to many, deeply alarming in its outcomes. First Brexit, then Donald Trump, plus the rise of populism and the spread of ision, has started a tentative search for plausible alternatives. But the rival systems we see around us have a very limited appeal. The unlovely forms of 21st-century authoritarianism can at best provide only a partial, pragmatic alternative to democracy. The world’s strongmen still pander to public opinion, and in the case of competitive authoritarian regimes such as the ones in Hungary and Turkey, they persist with the rigmarole of elections. From Trump to Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is not much of a leap into a brighter future.There is a far more dogmatic alternative, which has its roots in the 19th century. Why not ditch the charade of voting altogether? Stop pretending to respect the views of ordinary people – it’s not worth it, since the people keep getting it wrong. Respect the experts instead! This is the truly radical option. So should we try it?The name for this view of politics is epistocracy: the rule of the knowers. It is directly opposed to democracy, because it argues that the right to participate in political decision-making depends on whether or not you know what you are doing. The basic premise of democracy has always been that it doesn’t matter how much you know: you get a say because you have to live with the consequences of what you do. In ancient Athens, this principle was reflected in the practice of choosing office-holders by lottery. Anyone could do it because everyone – well, everyone who wasn’t a woman, a foreigner, a pauper, a slave or a child – counted as a member of the state. With the exception of jury service in some countries, we don’t choose people at random for important roles any more. But we do uphold the underlying idea by letting citizens vote without checking their suitability for the task.Critics of democracy – starting with Plato – have always argued that it means rule by the ignorant, or worse, rule by the charlatans that the ignorant people fall for. Living in Cambridge, a passionately pro-European town and home to an elite university, I heard echoes of that argument in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. It was usually uttered sotto voce – you have to be a brave person to come out as an epistocrat in a democratic society – but it was unquestionably there. Behind their hands, very intelligent people muttered to each other that this is what you get if you ask a question that ordinary people don’t understand. Dominic Cummings, the author of the “Take Back Control” slogan that helped win the referendum, found that his critics were not so shy about spelling it out to his face. Brexit happened, they told him, because the wicked people lied to the stupid people. So much for democracy.To say that democrats want to be ruled by the stupid and the ignorant is unfair. No defender of democracy has ever claimed that stupidity or ignorance are virtues in themselves. But it is true that democracy doesn’t discriminate on the grounds of a lack of knowledge. It considers the ability to think intelligently about difficult questions a secondary consideration. The primary consideration is whether an inidual is implicated in the outcome. Democracy asks only that the voters should be around long enough to suffer for their own mistakes.The question that epistocracy poses is: why don’t we discriminate on the basis of knowledge? What’s so special about letting everyone take part? Behind it lies the intuitively appealing thought that, instead of living with our mistakes, we should do everything in our power to prevent them in the first place – then it wouldn’t matter who has to take responsibility.This argument has been around for more than 2,000 years. For most of that time, it has been taken very seriously. The consensus until the end of the 19th century was that democracy is usually a bad idea: it is just too risky to put power in the hands of people who don’t know what they are doing. Of course, that was only the consensus among intellectuals. We have little way of knowing what ordinary people thought about the question. Nobody was asking them.Over the course of the 20th century, the intellectual consensus was turned around. Democracy established itself as the default condition of politics, its virtues far outweighing its weaknesses. Now the events of the 21st century have revived some of the original doubts. Democracies do seem to be doing some fairly stupid things at present. Perhaps no one will be able to live with their mistakes. In the age of Trump, climate change and nuclear weapons, epistocracy has teeth again.So why don’t we give more weight to the views of the people who are best qualified to evaluate what to do? Before answering that question, it is important to distinguish between epistocracy and something with which it is often confused: technocracy. They are different. Epistocracy means rule by the people who know best. Technocracy is rule by mechanics and engineers. A technocrat is someone who understands how the machinery works.In November 2011, Greek democracy was suspended and an elected government was replaced by a cabinet of experts, tasked with stabilising the collapsing Greek economy before new elections could be held. This was an experiment in technocracy, however, not epistocracy. The engineers in this case were economists. Even highly qualified economists often haven’t a clue what’s best to do. What they know is how to operate a complex system that they have been instrumental in building – so long as it behaves the way it is meant to. Technocrats are the people who understand what’s best for the machine. But keeping the machine running might be the worst thing we could do. Technocrats won’t help with that question.Both representative democracy and pragmatic authoritarianism have plenty of space for technocracy. Increasingly, each system has put decision-making capacity in the hands of specially trained experts, particularly when it comes to economic questions. Central bankers wield significant power in a wide variety of political systems around the world. For that reason, technocracy is not really an alternative to democracy. Like populism, it is more of an add-on. What makes epistocracy different is that it prioritises the “right” decision over the technically correct decision. It tries to work out where we should be going. A technocrat can only tell us how we should get there.How would epistocracy function in practice? The obvious difficulty is knowing who should count as the knowers. There is no formal qualification for being a general expert. It is much easier to identify a suitable technocrat. Technocracy is more like plumbing than philosophy. When Greece went looking for economic experts to sort out its financial mess, it headed to Goldman Sachs and the other big banks, since that is where the technicians were congregated. When a machine goes wrong, the people responsible for fixing it often have their fingerprints all over it already.Historically, some epistocrats have tackled the problem of identifying who knows best by advocating non-technical qualifications for politics. If there were such a thing as the university of life, that’s where these epistocrats would want political decision-makers to get their higher degrees. But since there is no such university, they often have to make do with cruder tests of competence. The 19th-century philosopher John Stuart Mill argued for a voting system that granted varying numbers of votes to different classes of people depending on what jobs they did. Professionals and other highly educated iniduals would get six or more votes each farmers and traders would get three or four skilled labourers would get two unskilled labourers would get one. Mill also pushed hard for women to get the vote, at a time when that was a deeply unfashionable view. He did not do this because he thought women were the equals of men. It was because he thought some women, especially the better educated, were superior to most men. Mill was a big fan of discrimination, so long as it was on the right grounds.To 21st-century eyes, Mill’s system looks grossly undemocratic. Why should a lawyer get more votes than a labourer? Mill’s answer would be to turn the question on its head: why should a labourer get the same number of votes as a lawyer? Mill was no simple democrat, but he was no technocrat either. Lawyers didn’t qualify for their extra votes because politics placed a special premium on legal expertise. No, lawyers got their extra votes because what’s needed are people who have shown an aptitude for thinking about questions with no easy answers. Mill was trying to stack the system to ensure as many different points of view as possible were represented. A government made up exclusively of economists or legal experts would have horrified him. The labourer still gets a vote. Skilled labourers get two. But even though a task like bricklaying is a skill, it is a narrow one. What was needed was breadth. Mill believed that some points of view carried more weight simply because they had been exposed to more complexity along the way.Jason Brennan, a very 21st-century philosopher, has tried to revive the epistocratic conception of politics, drawing on thinkers like Mill. In his 2016 book Against Democracy, Brennan insists that many political questions are simply too complex for most voters to comprehend. Worse, the voters are ignorant about how little they know: they lack the ability to judge complexity because they are so attached to simplistic solutions that feel right to them.Brennan writes: “Suppose the United States had a referendum on whether to allow significantly more immigrants into the country. Knowing whether this is a good idea requires tremendous social scientific knowledge. One needs to know how immigration tends to affect crime rates, domestic wages, immigrants’ welfare, economic growth, tax revenues, welfare expenditures and the like. Most Americans lack this knowledge in fact, our evidence is that they are systematically mistaken.”In other words, it’s not just that they don’t know it’s not even that they don’t know that they don’t know it’s that they are wrong in ways that reflect their unwavering belief that they are right.Brennan doesn’t have Mill’s faith that we can tell how well-equipped someone is to tackle a complex question by how difficult that person’s job is. There is too much chance and social conditioning involved. He would prefer an actual exam, to “screen out citizens who are badly misinformed or ignorant about the election, or who lack basic social scientific knowledge”. Of course, this just pushes the fundamental problem back a stage without resolving it: who gets to set the exam? Brennan teaches at a university, so he has little faith in the disinterested qualities of most social scientists, who have their own ideologies and incentives. He has also seen students cramming for exams, which can produce its own biases and blind spots. Still, he thinks Mill was right to suggest that the further one advances up the educational ladder, the more votes one should get: five extra votes for finishing high school, another five for a bachelor’s degree, and five more for a graduate degree.Brennan is under no illusions about how provocative this case is today, 150 years after Mill made it. In the middle of the 19th century, the idea that political status should track social and educational standing was barely contentious today, it is barely credible. Brennan also has to face the fact that contemporary social science provides plenty of evidence that the educated are just as subject to groupthink as other people, sometimes even more so. The political scientists Larry Bartels and Christopher Achen point this out in their 2016 book Democracy for Realists: “The historical record leaves little doubt that the educated, including the highly educated, have gone wrong in their moral and political thinking as often as everyone else.” Cognitive biases are no respecters of academic qualifications. How many social science graduates would judge the question about immigration according to the demanding tests that Brennan lays out, rather than according to what they would prefer to believe? The irony is that if Brennan’s voter exam were to ask whether the better-educated deserve more votes, the technically correct answer might be no. It would depend on who was marking it.However, in one respect Brennan insists that the case for epistocracy has grown far stronger since Mill made it. That is because Mill was writing at the dawn of democracy. Mill published his arguments in the run-up to what became the Second Reform Act of 1867, which doubled the size of the franchise in Britain to nearly 2.5 million voters (out of a general population of 30 million). Mill’s case for epistocracy was based on his conviction that over time it would merge into democracy. The labourer who gets one vote today would get more tomorrow, once he had learned how to use his vote wisely. Mill was a great believer in the educative power of democratic participation.Brennan thinks we now have 100-plus years of evidence that Mill was wrong. Voting is bad for us. It doesn’t make people better informed. If anything, it makes them stupider, because it dignifies their prejudices and ignorance in the name of democracy. “Political participation is not valuable for most people,” Brennan writes. “On the contrary, it does most of us little good and instead tends to stultify and corrupt us. It turns us into civic enemies who have grounds to hate one another.” The trouble with democracy is that it gives us no reason to become better informed. It tells us we are fine as we are. And we’re not.In the end, Brennan’s argument is more historical than philosophical. If we were unaware of how democracy would turn out, it might make sense to cross our fingers and assume the best of it. But he insists that we do know, and so we have no excuse to keep kidding ourselves. Brennan thinks that we should regard epistocrats like himself as being in the same position as democrats were in the mid-19th century. What he is championing is anathema to many people, as democracy was back then. Still, we took a chance on democracy, waiting to see how it would turn out. Why shouldn’t we take a chance on epistocracy, now we know how the other experiment went? Why do we assume that democracy is the only experiment we are ever allowed to run, even after it has run out of steam?It’s a serious question, and it gets to how the longevity of democracy has stifled our ability to think about the possibility of something different. What was once a seemingly reckless form of politics has become a byword for caution. And yet there are still good reasons to be cautious about ditching it. Epistocracy remains the reckless idea. There are two dangers in particular.The first is that we set the bar too high in politics by insisting on looking for the best thing to do. Sometimes it is more important to avoid the worst. Even if democracy is often bad at coming up with the right answers, it is good at unpicking the wrong ones. Moreover, it is good at exposing people who think they always know best. Democratic politics assumes there is no settled answer to any question and it ensures that is the case by allowing everyone a vote, including the ignorant. The randomness of democracy – which remains its essential quality – protects us against getting stuck with truly bad ideas. It means that nothing will last for long, because something else will come along to disrupt it.Epistocracy is flawed because of the second part of the word rather than the first – this is about power (kratos) as much as it is about knowledge (episteme). Fixing power to knowledge risks creating a monster that can’t be deflected from its course, even when it goes wrong – which it will, since no one and nothing is infallible. Not knowing the right answer is a great defence against people who believe that their knowledge makes them superior.Brennan’s response to this argument (a version of which is made by David Estlund in his 2007 book Democratic Authority) is to turn it on its head. Since democracy is a form of kratos, too, he says, why aren’t we concerned about protecting iniduals from the incompetence of the demos just as much as from the arrogance of the epistocrats? But these are not the same kinds of power. Ignorance and foolishness don’t oppress in the same way that knowledge and wisdom do, precisely because they are incompetent: the demos keeps changing its mind.The democratic case against epistocracy is a version of the democratic case against pragmatic authoritarianism. You have to ask yourself where you’d rather be when things go wrong. Maybe things will go wrong quicker and more often in a democracy, but that is a different issue. Rather than thinking of democracy as the least worst form of politics, we could think of it as the best when at its worst. It is the difference between Winston Churchill’s famous dictum and a similar one from Alexis de Tocqueville a hundred years earlier that is less well-known but more apposite. More fires get started in a democracy, de Tocqueville said, but more fires get put out, too.The recklessness of epistocracy is also a function of the historical record that Brennan uses to defend it. A century or more of democracy may have uncovered its failings, but they have also taught us that we can live with them. We are used to the mess and attached to the benefits. Being an epistocrat like Mill before democracy had got going is very different from being one now that democracy is well established. We now know what we know, not just about democracy’s failings, but about our tolerance for its incompetences.The great German sociologist Max Weber, writing at the turn of the 20th century, took it for granted that universal suffrage was a dangerous idea, because of the way that it empowered the mindless masses. But he argued that once it had been granted, no sane politician should ever think about taking it away: the backlash would be too terrible. The only thing worse than letting everyone vote is telling some people that they no longer qualify. Never mind who sets the exam, who is going to tell us that we’ve failed? Mill was right: democracy comes after epistocracy, not before. You can’t run the experiment in reverse.The cognitive biases that epistocracy is meant to rescue us from are what will ultimately scupper it. Loss aversion makes it more painful to be deprived of something we have that doesn’t always work than something we don’t have that might. It’s like the old joke. Q: “Do you know the way to Dublin?” A: “Well, I wouldn’t start from here.” How do we get to a better politics? Well, maybe we shouldn’t start from here. But here is where we are.Still, there must be other ways of trying to inject more wisdom into democratic politics than an exam. This is the 21st century: we have new tools to work with. If many of the problems with democracy derive from the business of politicians hawking for votes at election time, which feeds noise and bile into the decision-making process, perhaps we should try to simulate what people would choose under more sedate and reflective conditions. For instance, it may be possible to extrapolate from what is known about voters’ interests and preferences what they ought to want if they were better able to access the knowledge they needed. We could run mock elections that replicate the input from different points of view, as happens in real elections, but which strip out all the distractions and distortions of democracy in action.Brennan suggests the following: “We can administer surveys that track citizens’ political preferences and demographic characteristics, while testing their basic objective political knowledge. Once we have this information, we can simulate what would happen if the electorate’s demographics remained unchanged, but all citizens were able to get perfect scores on tests of objective political knowledge. We can determine, with a strong degree of confidence, what ‘We the People’ would want, if only ‘We the People’ understood what we were talking about.”Democratic dignity – the idea that all citizens should be allowed to express their views and have them taken seriously by politicians – goes out the window under such a system. We are each reduced to data points in a machine-learning exercise. But, according to Brennan, the outcomes should improve.In 2017, a US-based digital technology company called Kimera Systems announced that it was close to developing an AI named Nigel, whose job was to help voters know how they should vote in an election, based on what it already knew of their personal preferences. Its creator, Mounir Shita, declared: “Nigel tries to figure out your goals and what reality looks like to you and is constantly assimilating paths to the future to reach your goals. It’s constantly trying to push you in the right direction.”This is the more personalised version of what Brennan\u0026nbspis proposing, with some of the democratic dignity plugged back in. Nigel is not trying to work out what’s best for everyone, only what’s best for you. It accepts your version of reality. Yet Nigel understands that you are incapable of drawing the correct political inferences from your preferences. You need help, from a\u0026nbspmachine that has seen enough of your personal behaviour to understand what it is you are after. Siri recommends books you might like. Nigel recommends political parties and policy positions.Would this be so bad? To many people it instinctively sounds like a parody of democracy because it treats us like confused children. But to Shita it is an enhancement of democracy because it takes our desires seriously. Democratic politicians don’t much care what it is that\u0026nbspwe actually want. They care what it is they can persuade us we want, so they can better appeal to it. Nigel puts the voter first. At the same time, by protecting us from our own confusion and inattention, Nigel strives to improve our self-understanding. Brennan’s version effectively gives up on Mill’s original\u0026nbspidea that voting might be an educative experience. Shita hasn’t given up. Nigel is trying to nudge us along the path to self-knowledge. We\u0026nbspmight end up learning who we really are.The fatal flaw with this approach, however, is that we risk learning only who it is we think we are, or who it is we would like to be. Worse, it is who we would like to be now, not who or what we might become in the future. Like focus groups, Nigel provides a snapshot of a set of\u0026nbspattitudes at a moment in time. The danger of any system\u0026nbspof machine learning is that it produces feedback\u0026nbsploops. By restricting the dataset to our past behaviour, Nigel teaches us nothing about what other people think, or even about other ways of seeing the world. Nigel simply mines the archive of our attitudes for the most consistent expression of our identities. If we lean left, we will end up leaning further left. If we lean right, we will end up leaning further right. Social and political ision would widen. Nigel is designed to\u0026nbspclose the circle in our minds.There are technical fixes for feedback loops. Systems can be adjusted to inject alternative points of view, to notice when data is becoming self-reinforcing or simply to randomise the evidence. We can shake things up to lessen the risk that we get set in our ways. For instance, Nigel could make sure that we visit websites that challenge rather than reinforce our preferences. Alternatively, on Brennan’s model, the aggregation of\u0026nbspour preferences could seek to take account of the likelihood that Nigel had exaggerated rather than tempered who we really are. A Nigel of Nigels – a machine that helps other machines to better align their\u0026nbspown goals – could try to strip out the distortions from the artificial democracy we have built. After all, Nigel is our servant, not our master. We can always tell him what to do.But that is the other fundamental problem with 21st-century epistocracy: we won’t be the ones telling Nigel what to do. It will be the technicians who have built the system. They are the experts we rely on to rescue us from feedback loops. For this reason, it is hard\u0026nbspto see how 21st-century epistocracy can avoid collapsing back into technocracy. When things go wrong, the knowers will be powerless to correct for them. Only the engineers who built the machines have\u0026nbspthat capacity, which means that it will be the engineers who have the power.In recent weeks, we have been given a glimpse of\u0026nbspwhat rule by engineers might look like. It is not an authoritarian nightmare of oppression and violence. It is a picture of confusion and obfuscation. The power of engineers never fully comes out into the open, because most people don’t understand what it is they do. The sight of Mark Zuckerberg, perched on his cushion, batting off the ignorant questions of the people’s representatives in Congress is a glimpse of a technocratic future in which democracy meets its\u0026nbspmatch. But this is not a radical alternative to democratic politics. It is simply a distortion of it.Adapted from How Democracy Ends by David Runciman, which will be published by Profile on 10 May.

Labour would have to take 15 more seats – overturning huge majorities in some – to win control.But many believe that the tide is turning. Labour’s Emma Dent Coad sent shockwaves through the local Tory establishment when she won Kensington at the 2017 general election, primarily on the back of Brexit in one of the most remain-supporting constituencies in the country.Then came the horrors of the Grenfell fire, which killed 71 people, and the woefully inadequate response from the town hall which saw even national Tory politicians heaping on the criticism.Jackie Michael, 57, who has lived in the north of the borough for more than a decade, said: “It is inconceivable that the Tories hang on to the council after the disastrous way they responded to the fire. All you need to do is look up, and you see the tower. It’s a constant symbol of their ineptitude.”But Robert Atkinson, Labour group leader on the council, is cautious. “In the last 12 months we’ve made astonishing progress in all areas of K\u0026ampC and while we may not take the council this time, we’re certainly going to come close to it,” he told the . “But there will be future elections and we will then be starting from a much stronger position.”Party insiders believe the most likely outcome is that it piles on votes in wards it already holds, while picking up a few extra seats in those which are currently split between the two main parties, although not enough to take control. “But we’re fighting seriously in wards where we haven’t fought for years,” said one Labour candidate.They also play down the relevance of Dent Coad’s victory. “It’s not quite as revolutionary as people think,” said one, suggesting the outspoken MP fears she may not win a second time so is keeping her options open by standing again for the council.Momentum has been out in force and, although Corbyn was campaigning in Ladbroke Grove, so far he has stayed away from the south of the borough. “I don’t think it would help if he was seen down the Kings Road,” said one party insider.Back in Chelsea, however, Labour is knocking on some doors it never has before. Activists report that some lifelong Tory voters think the council’s handling of Grenfell has been a disgrace, but concede that the most they can hope for is that they stay at home on Thursday.The local Conservative party was condemned for its insensitivity in November for sending out a questionnaire in one of the richest parts of the borough asking people to rate the importance of Grenfell as an issue alongside rubbish collections and parking.But some voters think that enough is enough. “The council has spent a fortune on big new homes for Grenfell victims. Why are they still complaining? It’s about time the self-flagellation stopped,” said one.Labour is attempting to stir up anti-Brexit sentiment among the thousands of European citizens who live in the borough – many of them in Chelsea - and who make up almost a fifth of the electorate.“Don’t overlook the fury of the Europeans,” said one candidate. “Usually these people don’t think local government matters. So we hope some can be prodded into casting a protest vote.”The biggest issues that come up on the doorstep in this part of the borough, however, are planning and parking. John Miller, 72, a retired accountant, said: “While we all recognise how terrible Grenfell was, I think any council would have struggled to deal with it. I am more likely to judge them on how they look after our public realm and our streets.”Whatever the result, the incoming council is going to look very different to the old one, with 17 Tory councillors not standing for re-election. Some have retired, others have stepped down over the fire and its aftermath.The Tory leader, Elizabeth Campbell, who took over after the fire, has been campaigning “all over the borough”, perhaps mindful of the damage done when she admitted she had never been inside a tower block before Grenfell.She is reluctant to comment on whether the tragedy – or the fact that some victims are still waiting for new permanent homes – will affect her electoral chances. “I can’t predict things. I can only just work as hard as I can, so we will see. Ask me afterwards,” she said in one interview.Daniel Moylan, a former deputy leader of the council who is standing down as councillor this time, is also hedging his bets. “It will be tough for the Conservatives. We could lose some seats but it will be difficult for Labour to take control of the council,” he said. “It would be a political tsunami if we lost. Though, of course, tsunamis do happen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b299bd77de0a008f353cc581e3dbf88b5b309143/463_141_1866_1120/master/1866.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8965b776d1a8e978f8201d6eee31e3a","title":"pm tries to hold cabinet together by delaying customs partnership decision","story":"Two options for EU arrangement set to remain on table as 11-strong subcommittee meetsTheresa May will attempt to head off a rebellion of her Brexit inner cabinet and prevent key leave-supporting ministers from resigning by delaying a final decision on her “customs partnership” model.The prime minister is expected to keep both of Downing Street’s options for a future customs arrangement with the European Union on the table at least for now as the 11-strong subcommittee meet for talks on Wednesday.No 10 sources said the prime minister had no plans to “boot out” one customs union option immediately and that officials would continue working on both.However, May faces a tense showdown with key Brexiters, after sources told the  that they are planning to “pointedly and forcefully” persuade her to drop her preferred plan altogether.Downing Street has spent the last few days intensely lobbying ministers including David Davis, Liam Fox and Boris Johnson on the benefits of the so-called hybrid model, under which the UK would collect EU import tariffs on behalf of Brussels.But the Brexiters now believe they have the numbers to force her hand, claiming that new home secretary Sajid Javid and defence secretary Gavin Williamson would back them, giving them a majority of six to five in the crunch talks.It comes after it emerged that 60 Eurosceptic MPs from the European Research Group, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, have sent May a 30-page report setting out their opposition to the plan.The group is understood to have repeatedly warned No 10 in recent weeks that the customs partnership would be considered a red line, and crossing it could precipitate the collapse of the government. One remain-supporting cabinet minister told the  earlier that they expected the prime minister to make a “big push” for her preferred option at the meeting, but Whitehall officials suggested she would stop just short of ditching the alternative. Brexiter sources claimed that the prime minister had been told eight times by civil servants that her preferred option, which is backed by her top Brexit civil servant Olly Robbins, was unworkable but has continued to stick with it.The option is regarded as cumbersome and impractical by Brexiters, who describe it as the “unicorn” model and fear it would be “a customs union by the back door”.The customs partnership has become the most contentious issue in the debate about what kind of Brexit should be pursued, with many MPs regarding it as the only way of successfully avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland.Brexiters hope to persuade the prime minister to keep the alternative on the table for now – the maximum facilitation (“max-fac”) proposal, which relies on technology to minimise border checks.Conservative sources suggested Davis could be prepared to resign if the subcommittee throws its weight behind the prime minister’s option. Insiders said he felt “cut out of the loop” and concerned that he had been effectively replaced by Robbins, who is based in Downing Street.Liam Fox, the trade secretary, also put down a marker in a BBC interview, insisting that staying in the customs union in all but name would be unacceptable. He refused to deny that he might be prepared to resign if the government pressed ahead.“That’s worse than the position in which we found ourselves today in the European Union. I don’t think there is a customs union that could ever be acceptable,” he said.“If we are in a customs union of any sort we will have less ability to shape Britain’s future than we have today. That is not what the public voted for.”One cabinet minister suggested that ultimately the government would have to settle for a customs union in all but name. “My more pragmatic colleagues understand that, faced with the need to fix this, we will have to reach an agreement that involves significant alignment with Brussels, although we will not technically be in a customs union.”Cabinet supporters of May’s preferred approach, including Philip Hammond and Greg Clark, believe it has a better chance of avoiding the risk of a hard border in Northern Ireland by allowing traders to move goods freely.“The technology is challenging for the hybrid option but if you solve it, it solves the Irish border question”, said a Whitehall source. “Max-fac is probably more technologically straightforward – but it requires borders.”However, the Brexiters are expected to push back against the idea that maintaining the integrity of the Good Friday agreement requires no infrastructure whatsoever between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Instead they will argue that unobtrusive checks set a few miles back from the border wouldn’t breach the government’s pledge to avoid a “hard border”.The departure of former home secretary Amber Rudd removes one of the strongest voices in support of staying in the customs union around the cabinet table. Brexiter sources have suggested that Javid, who reluctantly backed remain in the referendum, and Williamson, considered by colleagues to be pliable, would take a different position. The subcommittee could also be asked to consider extending membership of the customs union temporarily, while the successor arrangement is implemented. HMRC permanent secretary Jon Thompson told a select committee last September that the customs partnership could take up to five years to be introduced.Mujtaba Rahman, managing director of political consultancy Eurasia Group, said with talks in Brussels at a standstill, negotiators would be watching the evolution of the government’s stance closely.“All eyes in Europe are on the Brexit subcommittee tomorrow, and what it throws up,” he said. But with the next round of talks in Brussels not due until late May, he suggested the prime minister could still delay narrowing her options too much.Rahman added that by continuing to press the hybrid option, which she knows is unacceptable to Brussels, May is engaged in “stagecraft”, while awaiting the outcome of a series of contentious parliamentary votes on the customs union. understands that neither the customs union, nor Brexit more generally, was brought up at Tuesday’s meeting of the full cabinet. They will be expected to endorse the final option once one is eventually agreed. The prime minister’s official spokesman said: “We have been absolutely clear that we are leaving the customs union and won’t be joining a customs union. “We have put forward two proposals for addressing the customs issue in general and they will be discussed by the government further.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eea698da1965548192c84f122cbc9402e718945e/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3eac000251a6cf305bf3e27e690aa23c","title":"sugar fat junk obsesity uk hugh jamie parliament health committee","story":"Exposed to ardour of TV chefs, the health committee dispenses with ceremony and sharp brains turn to juicy pulpThe proceedings are normally rather dour affairs but, for one afternoon only, the health and social care select committee was sprinkled with a little stardust as Jamie Oliver and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall came to give evidence on the UK’s obesity crisis. The two chefs strolled into the room, took off their jackets and sat down. Lights, camera, action. The Jamie and Hugh Show could now begin.“Hello Jamie, hello Hugh,” gasped the star-struck committee chair, Sarah Wollaston. It’s more usual for witnesses to be called by their surnames on these occasions, but no one was in the mood to stand on ceremony. The two chefs put on their best professional smiles: they’re used to the brains of ordinarily rational people being turned to pulp by celebrity.Jamie began with a bombshell. Words that haven’t been heard around Westminster for several years. He loved David Cameron and George Osborne. More than that, he adored them. He dabbed an eye, overcome with emotion. Several members of the committee shuffled uncomfortably in their seats but Jamie’s passions were not to be denied. Dave and George had been political colossi for embracing his vision and implementing a sugar tax.Here’s one they had prepared earlier. Jamie held up a bottle of pre-sugar tax Ribena he had brought with him and 12 white bits of paper taped together hung down. One for every teaspoon of sugar in the drink. He then passed a bottle of post-sugar tax Ribena to Hugh. This only had a trail of five pieces of white paper. “Change can be a beautiful thing,” he said. The soft drinks levy was a tax for love – a maternal kind of tax – not a tax on the poor.“What do you think, Hugh?” asked Wollaston, aware that Hugh had barely been allowed to get a word in edgeways.“He’s absolutely right,” replied Hugh. Jamie nodded approvingly. Echoes of “I agree with Nick”. On this particular show, Hugh was most definitely the sous-chef.Jamie moved into the first ad break. Food advertisements were the worst. Pure evil, designed to tempt children into tipping bucketfuls of sugar, fat and processed foods down their throats.But it didn’t have to be this way. Take Tony the Tiger, the Frosties icon, whom Theresa May had boasted of saving when she had pulled the plug on Dave and George’s obesity initiative in her psychopathic desire to kill as many children as possible. Jamie had news for Satan Theresa. Tony the Tiger was sick to his rotten back teeth of trying to turn kiddies into chubsters. He was deeply ashamed and desperate to make amends. Tony the Tiger had seen the light and wanted nothing more than to bound through the jungle promoting the benefits of chia seeds and celery.At this point, Hugh started to get in on the act. Forget Tony the Tiger. What he wanted was a real live Batman with carrots for ears. A superhero who could inspire people to go foraging for turnips. “I’ve got a programme on the TV about this tomorrow night,” he added helpfully. Not all ads are bad ads.After Jamie had followed this up with an all-out assault on “buy one get one free” offers, Labour’s Diana Johnson wondered what he would have to say to someone who was hard up and was tempted into buying four sausage rolls for £1.There was a hush in the room. Then Jamie spoke, a beatific look on his face. “A sausage roll is a thing of beauty,” he said. “It should be cherished.” There was nothing wrong with treats, but far too many sausage rolls were mere imposters. Rubbish meat just wrapped in fat. Out, out, damned Gloucester old spot.Hugh chipped in once more. “Perhaps,” he said, “instead of selling four sausage rolls, the butcher could sell two sausage rolls and a couple of carrots.” You never know, it might catch on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38c6a2598230a414b858f0366b349a2511499858/0_735_4900_2940/master/4900.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa16ae1b1235e2369b46181fb989044f","title":"uk to introduce public ownership registers for overseas territories","story":"Government says it will support amendment to introduce public ownership registers in Britain’s overseas territories Britain’s overseas territories will be forced to adopt public registers of company ownership at the end of the decade after the government conceded it would have to support a backbench amendment designed to stem the global flow of “dirty money”.Sir Alan Duncan, a Foreign Office minister, told the Commons that ministers recognised “the majority view in this house” and would not oppose an amendment to the sanctions and anti-money laundering bill from Labour’s Margaret Hodge and the Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell.The retreat was forced on Theresa May’s government after the Speaker rejected a string of government compromise amendments, which would have watered down the disclosure commitment, because they were tabled so late. Afterwards, some of the overseas territories voiced their unhappiness at what had been agreed at Westminster.The HodgeMitchell amendment requires the 14 overseas territories, including the financial centres of the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands, to introduce public ownership registers by the end of 2020 or face having them imposed by the UK government.Duncan told MPs that ministers were reluctant to dictate to the overseas territories, but acknowledged: “We have listened to the strength of feeling in this house on this issue and accept that it is without a doubt the majority view of this house that the overseas territories should have public registers.”About half of the companies referred to in the Panama Papers, offshore ownership disclosures revealed by a consortium of investigative journalist organisations including the , were set up in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), according to Transparency International. The campaign group Global Witness estimates that £68bn flowed out of Russia via the British overseas territories between 2007 and 2016.The Panama Papers are a leak of 11.5m files from the database of the world’s fourth biggest offshore law firm, Mossack Fonseca. The records were obtained from an anonymous source by\u0026nbspthe German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, which shared them with\u0026nbspa network of international partners, including the , in April 2016.The documents show the myriad ways in which the rich exploit secretive offshore tax regimes. Twelve national leaders were among 143 politicians, their families and close associates shown to have been using offshore tax havens. They included the Pakistani prime minister, Nawaz Sharif the former vice-president of Iraq, Ayad Allawi the president of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko and the prime minister of Iceland, Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson.An offshore investment fund run by the father of the then British prime minister David Cameron\u0026nbspavoided paying tax in Britain by hiring residents of the Bahamas to sign its paperwork.The leak is larger than the\u0026nbspUS diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks in 2010, and the\u0026nbspsecret intelligence documents given to journalists by Edward Snowden in 2013.Hodge said the importance of the issue justified intervention in the affairs of the overseas territories, noting that the UK had done so before in forcing the repeal of the death penalty in 1991 and decriminalising homosexuality in 2000.“The areas on which we have intervened … are moral issues. I can’t think of another issue which is more moral than trying to intervene to prevent the traffic in corrupt money and illicit finance across the world,” Hodge said.Mitchell told MPs that the justification for disclosure was made “elegantly but passively” by the leaking of the Panama and Paradise Papers, which revealed the true owners of thousands of offshore companies. “It is only by openness and scrutiny, by allowing charities, NGOs and the media to join up the dots, that we can expose this dirty money and those people standing behind it.

That was enough to defeat the government had the matter been put to a vote.A few MPs questioned how effective public disclosure would be. Geoffrey Cox, a Conservative backbencher, said the benefit from transparency would be “a one-hit wonder” and argued that “money will go to where it is darkest” to other global territories where there are no public disclosure requirements. Proponents, however, said that they believed it was important that the UK took some action to reduce the number of jurisdictions were company ownership and money could be hidden offshore.Representatives of the territories had argued that the disclosure requirement would be expensive to implement at a time when countries in the Caribbean were recovering from the impact of Hurricane Irma.Some overseas territories said they were unhappy with the outcome and tried to question the UK’s ability to impose its will. Orlando Smith, the premier of the British Virgin Islands, said: “It is not only a breach of trust but calls into question our very relationship with the UK and the constitutional rights of the people of the BVI.”But aid charities welcomed the result. Jon Date, senior advocacy manager at ActionAid UK, said: “These measures will help flush out the corruption and tax evasion that keeps the most vulnerable people in the world – including women and girls – locked in poverty. By accepting this amendment, ministers will ensure that Britain will lead, not follow, when it comes to UK-linked tax havens.”The disclosure measure had originally been proposed by David Cameron and George Osborne in 2013, but the commitment was dropped when May became prime minister, prompting Hodge and Mitchell to act in concert to get the measure on the statute book.The amendment does not apply to the crown dependencies, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands, because parliament does not have the legal right to impose its will on them. However, Mitchell said that in the light of the success of the amendment parliament would expect the government “to make the point persuasively, that we hope that the crown dependencies embrace the same ethical position and equal transparency”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fd1c3033c7e5edfdedfcbed8b7481ccb2987c9b/0_53_4199_2519/master/4199.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ccabfdb22d5c7503df467405f2dcf74","title":"wealthy professionals most likely to drink alcohol regularly figures show","story":"British manual workers drink the least and middle-aged have most harmful habits, reports sayHigh earners in professional jobs, such as doctors, lawyers and teachers, are much more likely to be regular alcohol drinkers than those on average incomes, according to the latest official figures.Drinking rises steadily with socioeconomic status: people whose work is classified as routine and manual, including labourers, receptionists and care workers, were the least likely to have had alcohol in the week before they were asked.The reports come from NHS Digital (England only) and the Office for National Statistics. The ONS Opinions and Lifestyle Survey shows that in Great Britain in 2017, an estimated 29.2 million adults said they had drunk alcohol in the week before they were asked.How much people drink varies with age. A fifth of people said they did not drink at all. They were most likely to be between 25 and 64. Those most likely to drink were over 65.When the young drink, they are the most likely to binge on Friday and Saturday nights and then not drink for the rest of the week. Data from previous years in the Health Survey for England showed the most harmful drinking was among middle-aged people, who were more likely to drink every day.“Middle-class drinkers are unlikely to pay attention to government health warnings as they may be less likely to get excessively drunk, and can withstand increases in prices,” said Steve Clarke, an alcohol addiction therapy services manager with the Priory Group. The data was published on Tuesday, the day Scotland introduces minimum unit pricing after a long fight with the alcohol industry, which challenged its legality in the courts. The ONS findings support other evidence that price is a big factor in people’s drinking habits. Campaigners and experts hope minimum unit pricing will lead people, especially the most vulnerable, to forgo the strongest drinks because they will become more expensive. They are lobbying for England to follow Scotland’s example.“The Westminster government should now follow Scotland’s lead and introduce MUP in England,” said Sir Ian Gilmore, chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance, a coalition of more than 50 organisations.“Cheap alcohol is wrecking lives and livelihoods in England as well as Scotland. There are more than 23,000 deaths a year in England linked to alcohol, and many of these come from the poorest and most vulnerable sections of society.”He added: “Minimum unit pricing will save lives, cut crime and benefit the public finances. At the same time, pub prices will be left untouched, and moderate drinkers will barely notice the difference under MUP.“Any delay in implementing MUP in England will only cost lives and lead to unnecessary alcohol-related harm. We urge the Westminster government to act now.”Minimum unit pricing sets the lowest price at which a unit of alcohol can be sold, which in Scotland is now 50p. A pint of beer containing two units will now have to cost at least £1, and a bottle of wine containing nine units will have to cost at least £4.50. But the biggest impact will be on the very strong ciders and other strong alcoholic drinks that have been very cheap and are often bought by alcoholics."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51d269dc920d86ee91a31b3c1eed5ee3ce8f3736/5_285_4780_2868/master/4780.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23e55dd04cb689a5212721681d73b51a","title":"barry hawkins ding junhui world snooker championships","story":"• Hawkins, on verge of fourth semi-final in five years, leads 11-5• Kyren Wilson leads Mark Allen by same scorelineBarry Hawkins moved to within two frames of a place in the world championship semi-finals in Sheffield after a superb second session in his last-eight match against Ding Junhui.Hawkins, bidding to reach a fourth semi-final in five years, won six of the eight frames on Tuesday evening to end the day 11-5 up.

As the Leicester and England prop reflects on his first season with the club he joined 12 years ago that has not ended with a place in the play-offs, he offers a succinct summation: not good\u0026nbspenough.Successive home defeats by Northampton, who had previously won only one match on the road this season, and Newcastle, who on Saturday entertain Wasps in a third-place tussle, have left the Tigers outside the top four and needing to secure two points at Sale on Saturday to be certain of maintaining their record of being the only English club to qualify for every European Cup.“It is a tough pill to swallow but the table does not lie and the top four deserve to be there,” said Cole, who has been on the past two Lions tours. “It is the first time we have missed out on the play-offs for 14 years. We have to reflect on this and come back stronger next season.“We have not been good enough. We have lost five league matches at home and we have not scored enough points. The league is competitive with everyone capable of beating everyone else. You have to be at your best every week and we have not been. We have scraped into the play-offs in the past when we did not really deserve to and the only positive from this is that we will have a longer off-season to put right what went wrong.”The defeat by Newcastle at Welford Road on Friday reflected Leicester’s season. They blew a 10-point lead in the final 11 minutes and had Gloucester beaten Bath at home the following day, the Tigers’ hold on a place in the top six and Champions Cup qualification would be more precarious.Gloucester will be in the Champions Cup next season after reaching the Challenge Cup final and go into their final match at Saracens not having to worry about where they finish in the Premiership. Leicester will start the weekend in fifth, two points ahead of Gloucester and four ahead of Sale, who are chasing a place in the top six.“You want to be in Europe’s top competition and we have to defeat Sale to confirm that,” Cole said. “They score a lot of tries, have a dangerous back three and Faf de Klerk runs the show behind a strong pack. We know we are going to have to play.“We reviewed the Newcastle game this week but the inquest on the season will wait until next week. What I would say is we have made progress as a squad and as a club off the field and we are a lot better than we were this time a year ago. Mark Bakewell came in as forwards coach halfway through the season and he has been brilliant: he will have a whole pre-season to bed things in and we will regroup.”Cole also endured a difficult season with England, who finished fifth in the Six Nations, their lowest in the championship, after losing their three matches.“The Six Nations is as competitive as it has been for a while and that makes it the best international tournament going,”Cole said. “We had a difficult tournament but we have not become a bad side. We lost in Scotland and France but there were periods in both when the game was there for us.”England have a three-Test tour to South Africa, who are expected to include at least five overseas-based players in their squad, next month. Eddie Jones has talked about resting some of his Lions but Cole does not know the coach’s thinking."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5517a4cd381c3b01a9c2fc30a7a537d4aee0d062/0_70_3911_2346/master/3911.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb54df177ece99ae3f632d77bec83db3","title":"uk athletics chairman bowker iaaf testosterone rule caster semenya","story":"• There are ‘a lot of questions and challenges’ says Richard Bowker• Semenya will be welcomed to London World Cup event in JulyThe chairman of UK Athletics has warned that there are “a lot of questions and challenges” with the IAAF’s controversial new testosterone rules – and says he feels enormous sympathy for the South African 800m world and Olympic champion Caster Semenya, who will bear the brunt of them.Richard Bowker also questioned whether the advantage that Semenya receives from high testosterone was really that different from the benefit a sprinter such as Usain Bolt derives from having a long stride length.“I can understand why the IAAF wanted to look into the issue,” Bowker told the . “I get that. But where we currently have got to has raised a lot of questions – and there are a lot of challenges with it as well.”Under the new rules, women athletes with high testosterone will have to take medication from November onwards to compete internationally in events from 400m to a mile.“When you look at what it takes for an athlete to be a global champion it clearly takes a lot of guts, determination, talent and a physical prowess that sets them apart,” he said. “They are not like you and me. And the difficulty for me is where to you take the debate?“If you are a high jumper and you are 6ft 8in and you are competing against someone who is 6ft 2in is that not an advantage? Or if you are sprinter and you have a much longer stride length, is that a physical advantage? I suspect that the decision that has been taken is not the end of the discussion.”The UKA chairman also expressed his strong support for Semenya, who he said he fervently hoped would compete in the inaugural athletics World Cup between eight leading nations, including Britain, the US and South Africa, in London in July.“There is absolutely no doubt that Caster is a phenomenal athlete who is a wonderful ambassador for the sport both in her home country and around the world,” he added. “And if she comes to London for the World Cup she will be assured of a fabulous reception by a very informed and loving crowd.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df38ecc571ca8e638a814ddd828c6619fbc2d7d9/0_28_2730_1638/master/2730.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16552d98af2b79d64bc5a1ae6b499655","title":"eu rule could leave theatres dark","story":"I am writing to you as the president of the Association of Lighting Designers, and as the Founder of Theatre Projects, an international theatre design company that for 60 years has been at the forefront of British theatre technology, responsible for the stage design of the National Theatre, and for over 1,500 theatre projects in 80 counties.I have been a lighting designer for over 60 years. British theatre now faces an extraordinary crisis. On Saturday 7 May consultation on an amazing EU draft regulation – the Energy Directorate’s Eco-design Working Plan 2016-19 – will close. If confirmed, in 2020 virtually all stage lighting equipment used throughout the British Theatre and entertainment industry will be rendered obsolete and the lamps within that create the light be unobtainable.British theatre and British lighting design leads the world. This month alone on Broadway, two productions, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, lit by Neil Austin, and Angels in America, lit by Paule Constable, have attracted universal critical acclaim.This draft regulation not only bans incandescent lamps, but virtually all the discharge and LED light sources that have been developed in recent years to reduce the theatre’s carbon footprint. This is a very real crisis. No existing entertainment lighting equipment presently meets the new theoretical power requirement.If, in 18 months, such equipment were to be invented – an aim apparently pushing beyond the boundaries of physics today – it would certainly cost as much as five to 10 times the equipment it replaces. This is, therefore, a potential financial disaster at best, and an artistic and practical catastrophe for every theatre in the land.The eco-design plan must exempt entertainment lighting from this mistaken regulation. The alternative may be dark and bankrupt theatres everywhere.

Despite the better-than-expected results, however, sales are slowing.Thomas Husson, principal analyst at Forrester, said the results did not mean innovation in the high-end smartphone is dead.Husson said: “However, it indicates Apple will have to smartly manage its iPhone product portfolio and pricing, especially in Asia, where some countries still witness smartphone growth Apple has proven over the past few years that it masters the art and science of managing its product portfolio.”Yet Husson believes 2018 represents a tipping point for Apple. “It has no choice but to demonstrate it can reduce its dependency on iPhone sales and enter new adjacent markets and territories,” he said. “Because it’s a human-centered and ideas-driven marketing company, Apple is still the most valuable brand worldwide and it would be a mistake to make too early a call based on this quarterly financial earnings.”On a call with analysts Cook was once again critical of tech rivals, including Facebook, that have been rocked by privacy scandals. “We believe privacy is a fundamental human right,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5421484a3fa1912373ec8355719e1e4f7131ddde/929_718_4466_2679/master/4466.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aacc2c9a2119d40b7ecb22e4930142f1","title":"facebook dating app mark zuckerberg f8 conference","story":"Mark Zuckerberg says app, which shares some features with Tinder, aims to build ‘real long-term relationships – not just hookups’Facebook is launching a new dating app on the social media platform, its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, announced at an annual developer conference on Tuesday, unveiling a feature designed to compete with popular services like Tinder.Speaking in front of a packed crowd in San Jose, Zuckerberg described the new dating feature as a tool to build “real long-term relationships – not just hookups”. “We want Facebook to be somewhere where you can start meaningful relationships,” he continued. “We’ve designed this with privacy and safety in mind from the beginning.”The announcement sparked gasps from the crowd and seemed to attract the most interest from the audience during Zuckerberg’s short speech, which focused on the company’s widening privacy scandal, new safeguards meant to protect users’ data and misinformation and fake news on the site.Chris Cox, the chief product officer, said the dating feature would be “opt-in” and “safe” and that the company “took advantage of the unique properties of the platform”.Soon after the announcement, Mandy Ginsberg, the CEO of Match Group, which owns Tinder, threw shade at Facebook, saying in a statement: “We’re surprised at the timing given the amount of personal and sensitive data that comes with this territory.”Cox showed a user’s hypothetical dating profile, which he said would be separate from an inidual’s regular profile, accessed in a different section of the site. The dating feature would use only a first name and only be visible to those using the service, not an inidual’s Facebook friends. The feature would not show up in the news feed, he added.Cox said users of this feature could browse and “unlock” local events and message others planning to attend. If a potential date responded, the two would then connect via a text messaging feature that is not connected to WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger.“We like this by the way because it mirrors the way people actually date, which is usually at events and institutions they’re connected to,” Cox said. “We hope this will help more folks meet and hopefully find partners.”The sample profiles displayed at the conference resembled some basic features of Tinder.Ginsberg, from Match, also said “Tinder continues to skyrocket” and that the company was “flattered that Facebook is coming into our space”, adding, “We understand this category better than anyone. Facebook’s entry will only be invigorating to all of us.”A spokesperson for Bumble, another dating app that recently stopped requiring users to log in through Facebook, said the company was “thrilled when we saw today’s news” and had already reached out to Facebook: “Perhaps Bumble and Facebook can join forces to make the connecting space even more safe and empowering.”The CEO noted that one in three marriages in the US now started online. He said couples who met on Facebook have repeatedly thanked him over the years.Zuckerberg said: “These are some of the moments that I’m really proud of what we’re doing. I know that we’re making a positive difference in people’s lives.”The announcement of the dating feature came after Zuckerberg acknowledged that it has been a particularly “intense” year for the company, following revelations that millions of Americans’ personal data was harvested from Facebook and improperly shared with the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/250bcb3f8f6a58551e95c44569fbb50af686ef4c/0_185_7952_4774/master/7952.jpg?w=1200\u0026amp;h=630\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxOC8wMS8zMS9mYWNlYm9va19kZWZhdWx0LnBuZw\u0026amp;s=02f9559dc2272a9683dc9af6c4d5570c","title":"christopher chandler founder of pro brexit thinktank has link with russian intelligence mp says","story":"Bob Seely uses parliamentary privilege to claim billionaire Christopher Chandler was ‘object of interest’ to French intelligenceA Conservative MP has claimed that a billionaire who founded an influential pro-Brexit thinktank has “a link with Russian intelligence”.In a speech made in the Commons under parliamentary privilege, Bob Seely alleged that Christopher Chandler had been an “object of interest” to French intelligence. Chandler, who founded the Legatum thinktank, rejected the claim as “complete nonsense”.Seely said that he and four other MPs had seen documents from Monaco’s security department. These “brief, terse, factual files” related to “national security and money laundering” and included information supplied by the DST intelligence agency, France’s equivalent of MI5.The MP said senior French intelligence sources plus their British and American counterparts had “authenticated” their content. He added: “The documents indicated a link – a noted inidual in this country – with Russian intelligence.”The files dated from 2005 and covered a period from the mid-1990s, he said. They concerned “Christopher Chandler and his brother”, the MP said, adding that he was convinced the files were genuine. He told the Commons: “According to the French intelligence services, as recorded by their colleagues in Monaco ... Mr Chandler is described as having been ‘an object of interest’ to the DST since 2002 on suspicion of working for Russian intelligence services.”Monaco intelligence ision had marked Chandler’s file with an S, to indicate “counter-espionage”, he added.The Legatum Institute has advocated hard Brexit and has had significant influence on ministerial thinking, especially over trade policy. Chandler and his brother Richard were born in New Zealand and made their fortunes from a series of investments in Russia in the 1990s.Legatum robustly denied the MP’s allegations on Tuesday. In a statement, the institute said that Chandler “has never been associated directly or indirectly with Russian intelligence or the Russian state”.It added: “Neither Christopher Chandler nor anyone at Legatum is aware of any such alleged “investigation” by the French authorities, not 16 years ago or at any time since. “To be clear Christopher Chandler has never been approached at any time by the French or any other authorities regarding Russia and maintains a sterling record of ethical business practices earned over many decades.” It called the accusations “complete nonsense” and said Legatum had “previously rebutted them”. Speaking in the Commons, the MP Ben Bradshaw who has previously raised questions about the Kremlin’s possible role in Brexit said he called for an investigation into Legatum last November.Bradshaw said he was concerned by Seely’s new “information” and by the “growing corruption, money laundering and sale of passports by Malta, where Chandler has just acquired citizenship”. The MP called on the UK authorities to “urgently investigate”.Last year the Mail on Sunday published a detailed story on Chandler’s alleged ties to Moscow. It claimed that Legatum’s economics director, Shanker Singham, had met Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, and had coordinated a letter written by them to Theresa May demanding a hard Brexit. Singham held discussions with leading cabinet Brexiters on multiple occasions, and saw representatives of David Davis’s department six times in the year up to August 2017, it has been reported. Singham recently left to work for a rightwing thinktank. Legatum said at the time in a statement that Singham had been sought out for his “unparalleled knowledge and expertise”. Legatum has said it will do less Brexit work and instead concentrate on the benefits of international trade. Chandler and Legatum’s chief executive, Mark Stoleson, became Maltese citizens in 2015. They say their applications were unrelated to Brexit, and were made the previous year.The Legatum institute responded to the Mail on Sunday with  a lengthy statement. Among other things, it said that Chandler was “a much-loved friend of the institute” but that he had no role within it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a69a552f467b51cc4f0ab67abc47ef47a4740fc3/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=184301314d57b10849b97cde2ffb8bf7","title":"iran nuclear deal documents questions benjamin netanyahu","story":"The White House seized on the Israeli PM’s dubious show-and-tell despite opposition from European allies desperate to keep the JCPOA afloatIf the reports are true, it was the heist of the century. Israeli spies are said to have broken into a secret Tehran warehouse in January, stolen a half-tonne of documents and somehow spirited them back to Israel the same night.That version of events, recounted in the New York Times, raises important questions about the documents presented by Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday as proof of Iranian dishonesty about its nuclear weapons programme.For example, why were the presumed crown jewels of Iranian national security not better guarded? Was there a struggle to get into the warehouse, an “inside man”, or was there just a padlock?And why – amid all those documents – were the Israelis not able to find substantive new information that had not been presented by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in 2011?“There was nothing there. There was nothing that the IAEA did not know, and all the theatrics and circa-2004 PowerPoint were a bit silly,” said Alexandra Bell, a former state department expert, now senior policy director at the Centre for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation.At least some of the unanswered questions may yet be resolved when Israel shares the trove with other governments and the IAEA, but by then Netanyahu’s multimedia show-and-tell is likely to have had its intended effect: to provide political cover for US withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.Donald Trump is threatening to stop issuing presidential waivers on nuclear-related sanctions when the next tranche is due on 12 May, which would mark an abrogation of the agreement, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), even if Trump does not formally announce withdrawal.That would open a rift with Washington’s European allies France, the UK and Germany, who are also party to the JCPOA and remain its strong supporters. London and Paris issued statements on Tuesday stressing that they have been aware of Iranians’ past weapons design work for many years, and it was precisely that awareness that drove their negotiating positions in the two years of talks leading up the deal.Despite such adamant opposition from key allies to Trump’s threatened violation of the deal, the White House seized on Netanyahu’s documents. In its eagerness to embrace the message the press secretary, Sarah Sanders, put out a statement that claimed: “Iran has a robust, clandestine nuclear weapons programme.”A few hours later, the claim was quietly put in the past tense, stating instead that Iran had such a programme.That assumption underpinned the JCPOA. So far, nothing from the Israeli document trove represents a direct violation of the deal, or contradicts the IAEA’s judgment in December 2015 that there had been no evidence of Iranian work on nuclear weapons design after 2009.In its only response to the Netanyahu’s presentation so far, the IAEA simply restated the formal findings of its director general, Yukiya Amano, in 2015, that there appeared to have been a “coordinated effort” in Iran on weapons development up to 2003.After that, there were more dispersed “feasibility and scientific studies” until 2009, and that were “no credible indications of activities in Iran relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device after 2009”.The Israeli documents do, however, highlight one of the compromises underlying the JCPOA. The IAEA had been pursuing evidence of nuclear weapons design since 2005, after a laptop containing files on nuclear weapons design had been smuggled out of Iran and handed to the CIA.By February 2008, the head of the safeguards department, Olli Heinonen, believed there was enough evidence to brief the IAEA board, and his inspectors continued to press for access to the places and people linked to the “Amad” nuclear weapons project, in particular, its chief scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh. The Iranians stonewalled, however, and the IAEA never got to interview Fakhrizadeh or his colleagues.The JCPOA did not resolve the impasse, but shelved it. The parties agreed the deal could not go into force until the IAEA had closed its file on past weaponisation issues. Amano did so in December 2015 with a “final assessment”, summarising what the IAEA knew, without the benefit of the interviews and inspections the safeguards department wanted. Those were mostly under the control of the Revolutionary Guard and therefore quite possibly not in the gift of Hassan Rouhani, the president of Iran.It was a political fix that made some uneasy, like Heinonen who argued that the IAEA was debasing its own currency as the gold standard of nuclear verification.The new documents could well re-open this dilemma, possibly identifying sites of past weaponisation work that IAEA inspectors could ask to visit, maybe triggering stand-offs with the Iranian military. Or they could prevent the IAEA reaching a formal “broader conclusion” that Iran’s nuclear programme is for exclusively peaceful means – a milestone which was envisioned in the first decade of the JCPOA’s implementation.“The IAEA’s final assessment was a bit of a fudge. They didn’t quite close it as put it on a back burner. This makes it difficult to do that,” said Ian Stewart, a former UK counter-proliferation official now at King’s College London.Under the JCPOA certain restrictions on Iran’s nuclear activities lift after eight years or when the IAEA reaches its “broader conclusion”.“It would leave us in a politically untenable situation, with the restrictions on the programme lifted de facto by the clock, rather than the IAEA satisfying itself that Iran activities are of a purely peaceful nature,” Stewart said. Such dilemmas may not arise however, if Trump – emboldened by Netanyahu’s documents – succeeds in killing off the JCPOA in the coming weeks or months.

The public accounts committee said the government did not yet have the data or systems necessary for understanding the exploitation of vulnerable and unregistered workers despite the introduction of an “ambitious” strategy four years ago. A report issued on Tuesday has also highlighted “extreme” variations in the number of potential victims flagged up for support by police, and the small proportion of recorded crimes leading to prosecutions. Modern slavery encompasses a broad range of offending including forced labour, domestic servitude and human trafficking. An official estimate previously indicated there were up to 13,000 potential victims in the UK, though experts put the numbers significantly higher now.The committee’s report says: “The Home Office introduced an ambitious modern slavery strategy in 2014 but it has taken too long to learn what works in the system, to understand the complexities of the crime, and to turn the strategy and the Modern Slavery Act into an effective and co-ordinated approach across government.“Government does not yet have the data or systems to understand the crime, the demographics and circumstances of the victims and the perpetrators. Nor does it know how much money it spends tackling modern slavery or what success looks like, meaning it cannot establish whether its strategy is working or how it should prioritise its actions.” The national referral mechanism (NRM) is a key framework for tackling slavery and trafficking, for identifying victims from possible cases reported by first-response agencies. The committee noted that three police forces with the highest number of adult referrals of potential victims had made more than 900 referrals since the NRM began in 2009, while six forces had made fewer than 10 referrals each in the same period. The report says: “The extreme variation between police forces’ referral rates suggests that some forces are not treating modern slavery as seriously as others.” MPs also raised concerns that victims were waiting “far too long” to receive NRM decisions, saying delays caused further distress and anxiety to vulnerable people. In another finding the committee concluded that a “hands-off” approach to businesses’ compliance with rules on transparency in supply chains was not working. The committee’s chair, the Labour MP Meg Hillier, said: “Victims of modern slavery can face unimaginable horrors but the government’s good intentions have yet to result in coherent action to help them. This crime is complex and a piecemeal approach will not cut it.”A Home Office spokeswoman said the government’s modern slavery taskforce would consider the committee’s recommendations carefully. “We have recently announced reforms to the national referral mechanism to make sure it supports more victims at a quicker pace and we are taking action to eradicate modern slavery from the economy, including requiring large businesses to report on how they are tackling and preventing this crime in their supply chains.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Revelation raises prospect hundreds more women could find smear tests were misreadTony O\u0026rsquoBrien has said he only learned of case from media reports after woman settled actionNot all cases notified to CervicalCheck subjected to screening history, Harris revealsTwo employees disciplined after member of public alerts local authorityDublin couple jailed for systematic neglect and physical abuseCampaigner urge wider use of \u0026lsquochanging places\u0026rsquo for those with mobility problemsExpert witness says Anglo ILP transactions could have continued \u0026lsquoad infinitum\u0026rsquoStudents say they are not being taught key topics such as how to use contraceptionVital young people make their voices heard in the debate, Yes campaign meeting toldSenator Niall \u0026Oacute Donnghaile calls on Seanad to raise matter with House of LordsMan in his 30s arrested as driver flees scene of Coolmine incidentCase involves estate in Co Louth of the late and legendary amateur jockey Bunny CoxHarris tells D\u0026aacuteil many smear tests not included in sample which revealed 208 false negativesPatricia Casey says Bill the Government intends to introduce should amendment be repealed \u0026lsquovery vague\u0026rsquoMinister says she will restore funding when assured governance at required standardD\u0026aacuteil told transport authority and TII should find an \u0026lsquoalternative option\u0026rsquoLinda Hussey Smith and her husband Gordon Smith were to be sent to Mountjoy prisonBakery owners appeal ruling they discriminated against Gareth Lee at Supreme CourtIrish Centre for Bio-Ethical Reform linked to US organisation"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3480154.1525202051!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"lord kilclooney accused of racism after calling taoiseach typical indian","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLord Kilclooney claimed Taoiseach Leo Varadkar ‘constantly antagonises Unionist feelings and is damaging the improved NorthSouth relations’.Veteran unionist politician John Taylor, now Lord Kilclooney, has been accused of making racist remarks on social media after he referred to Leo Varadkar as a “typical Indian”.Responding to a tweet from BBC Newsline that featured the headline “DUP: Varadkar’s visit to Northern Ireland showed ‘disrespect’”, Lord Kilclooney tweeted on Monday afternoon the Taoiseach was a “typical Indian”. When asked to explain the term “typical Indian”, Lord Kilclooney wrote it was “typical of this particular half Indian”.He continued: “No Irish PM has previously ignored the normal courtesies of visiting the UK.The 80-year-old peer defended his use of the term Indian, saying Mr Varadkar was “racially a half Indian and proud of it” and that there was “nothing racist about it - simply factual”.He tweeted: “It is not racially abusive as he himself has confirmed he is half Indian. That is great and not to be dismissed as Indians are a great race. However he has damaged NorthSouth relations by being continually offensive and provocative to the Unionist majority in NIreland.”The Taoiseach declined to respond in detail to the reference to Lord Kilclooney’s comments. Asked about it in the Dail on Tuesday, Leo Varadkar said he had seen Lord Kilclooney’s tweet.“I had thought it was a parody account, but seemingly it is not,’’ he added. “It is for real…that is all I will say about it.’’Earlier Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald said Lord Kilclooney’s remarks were “obnoxious, racially charged and very discourteous’’ and should be absolutely rejected. “In my experience, such remarks do not represent the attitude of the vast majority of the people from any side of the community, where people carry themselves with considerably more dignity and courtesy than that,’’ she added. Labour TD Joan Burton said Lord Kilclooney would be well advised to apologise for the slur that he had attempted to cast on the Taoiseach. “He is an ardent Brexiteer and has very hot feelings about Brexit but that does not permit him to use the kind of language he used yesterday,’’ she added. Alliance Party leader Naomi Long tweeted that Lord Kilclooney’s language was “a racial slur, insulting of not only the Taoiseach and the Irish people, but of Indian people too. There is no explaining this one away like last time.”Ms Long called for the House of Lords to address Lord Kilclooney’s behaviour on social media. “It is deliberate, calculated disrespect,” she wrote.Former UUP leader Mike Nesbitt also accused Lord Kilclooney of racist language, using the #NotInMyName in a tweet. Sinn Féin Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile tweeted that he was planning to ask the Seanad Cathaoirleach to contact the Speaker of the House of Lords “urging him to take appropriate action regarding yet another offensive tweet from a member of the House of Lords regarding An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar”.DUP member Christopher Stalford tweeted: “I don’t know what John Taylor thinks he’s playing at but he doesn’t speak for me. Absolutely ridiculous behaviour.”Alliance Party councillor Emmet McDonough Brown tweeted that “reducing someone to their race denies their humanity \u0026amp agency and lays prejudice bare. Every generation has to stand against racism and this pound-shop bore should know better by now.”A spokesman for the House of Lords press office said Lord Kilclooney’s behaviour would only be investigated if they received complaints that he had breached the House of Lords Code of Conduct. If a complaint is raised, the House of Lords Commissioner for Standards would undertake an independent investigation of the alleged breaches, he said. The House of Lords code of conduct states that members must always act “on their personal honour”. It notes that “members cannot rely simply on their own personal sense of what is honourable.

Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":null,"title":"us uk and france launch strikes on syria","story":"  April 14, 2018US ambassador to UN says US \u0026lsquolocked and loaded\u0026rsquo if Syrians further use chemical weapons   April 16, 2018Luxembourg meeting condemns \u0026lsquorepeated use\u0026rsquo of chemical weapons by Syrian regime "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3480684.1525202031!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"davis says eu and uk may be unable to resolve border issue before october deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexit secretary David Davis  giving evidence to the House of Lords EU committee  on  UK withdrawal from the EU. Photograph:  PA WireBritain and the European Union may be unable to resolve the future of the Border before they agree a deal on their future relationship in October, Brexit secretary David Davis has said. Mr Davis told the House of Lords EU committee that the viability of the first of three options for the Border outlined in last December’s joint report depended on whether Britain and the EU would have a comprehensive free trade agreement.“If we have a tariff-free free trade agreement and a light-touch customs agreement that makes Northern Ireland simpler than if we don’t have those things. So it’s all three we want, because truth be told I would consider it not a success if we were falling back on option C,” he said, referring to the so-called “backstop” that would see Northern Ireland remain in regulatory alignment with the EU after Brexit.“I can see why the Irish Government wants it as a guarantee, but we have to have all three. Now ,whether we can do all that by June, I’m not at all sure. But we are certainly aiming to complete it by October.”Mr Davis admitted that the EU had “pushed back” on the British government’s two proposals for a future customs relationship, confirming a report in the Daily  last month. He said EU negotiators did not understand how a “customs partnership” would work, with Britain collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU, and feared that the other proposal could encourage smuggling.Mr Davis will join other senior ministers on Wednesday for a meeting of the cabinet’s Brexit sub-committee that will focus on options for a customs relationship. Brexiteers want Theresa May to take the “customs partnership” off the table because they fear it is unworkable and could lead to Britain remaining indefinitely in the customs union.International trade secretary Liam Fox said on Tuesday that remaining in the customs union after Brexit would be worse than remaining in the EU itself.“If we were in a customs union with the European Union we would have to accept what the EU negotiated in terms of market access to the UK without the UK having a voice. That’s worse than the position in which we found ourselves today in the European Union. I don’t think there is a customs union that could ever be acceptable,” he told the BBC. Downing Street said the government would offer a “robust” response to a House of Lords vote to\u0026nbspgive MPs the power to stop Britain from leaving the EU without a deal, and to order the prime minister back to the negotiating table if they do not like the deal she secures.The Daily Mail on Tuesday described the Lords as a “house of unelected wreckers”, accusing pro-European peers of acting “in cahoots with Brussels” as they sought to derail Brexit.In the House of Commons on Tuesday, a Conservative MP accused the founder of the pro-Brexit Legatum Institute of being a Russian agent. Bob Seely used parliamentary privilege to quote from Monaco security files that identified Christopher Chandler, a New Zealand-born billionaire, as an object of interest.“According to the French security services as recorded by their colleagues in Monaco, and clearly I am confident that these documents are genuine, Mr Chandler is described as having been ‘an object of interest to the DST since 2002 on suspicion of working for the Russian intelligence services’,” Mr Seely said.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph launches next phase words chosen brand campaign","story":"The  has launched the second phase of the Words Chosen Well brand campaign which aims to showcase its award-winning quality journalism and raise brand awareness.The campaign started with a new television advert debuted during the commercial break of Channel 4’s Gogglebox on Friday 20th April. Created by adam\u0026ampeveDDB  in collaboration with The ’s in-house marketing and creative teams, it builds on the success of last year’s campaign with a bigger and bolder creative that utilises important cultural references and leans on some of the most emotive and impactful events of our times, highlighting iconic moments when words have been considered and chosen well.The ’s new campaign seeks to demonstrate the influence and importance of the spoken and written word, and the role that quality journalism plays in providing news, insight and analysis.

The plant, known for its sweet scent and delicate clusters of pink flowers, is thought to be the first East Asian rose to reach Europe some time in the 18th century.The scientists, led by Mohammed Bendahmane, from the University of Lyon in France, made comparisons with the genomes of other plants including strawberry, apricot and peach, to explore rose ancestry and evolution.They uncovered more than 36,000 protein-coding genes, and a biochemical pathway that co-ordinated the regulation of scent and colour.A number of candidate genes for flowering were identified which could in future be targeted to produce genetically improved rose cultivars.“If you go to the market and look at the cut roses, they won’t smell like anything. They smell like plastic,” Dr Bendahmane told The Times.A rose on display at the 2016 Hampton Court Flower show“I hope we will be able to change how these flowers look in the future and make them last longer with more of a scent, which is lost the longer roses stay in a vase.“They could also be made more brightly-coloured.”The research, published in the journal Nature Genetics, is expected to help researchers and breeders to manipulate rose flowering and colour, strengthen scent, or increase vase life.Writing in the journal, the scientists said: Reconstructing regulatory and secondary metabolism pathways allowed us to propose a model of interconnected regulation of scent and flower colour.This genome provides a foundation for understanding the mechanisms governing rose traits and should accelerate improvement in roses.A team from the University of Lyon identified the enzyme that helps produce roses\u0027 intoxicating aroma three years ago.They said the key lay in encouraging the roses to produce greater levels of an organic compound called geraniol, which is produced in petals.Arthur Bouquet, an American horticulturalist, claimed that just 50 per cent of today\u0027s roses have a noticeable scent, compared with 75 per cent in the 19th century.BBC presenters miss out on top jobs if they have double-barrelled surnames, court hearsBusinessman illegally raised value of home by chopping down protected treesJohn Bercow faces new allegations of bullying an aideWhite House defends seizing Donald Trump\u0026#39s medical records from former doctorCouncil cuts piling pressure on GPs as \u0026#3990 per cent\u0026#39 reduce servicesHaving blood type O almost trebles risk of dying from serious injury, scientists findWHO estimates 7 million die from pollution each year as it reveals latest global air quality figures Government at risk of \u0026#39collapse\u0026#39 as May warned by 60 Tory MPs Brexit customs partnership will sink herTiger cub found in duffel bag at US-Mexico borderThe Split, episode two, recap: All is fair in love and wine for Hannah and her sistersYouTube stars paid to help schoolchildren cheat on their examsHigh earners most likely to be drinkersPrue Leith: My brother died in agony because of ban on assisted dying lawsTories risk being locked out of London for generation in local elections, Cabinet ministers warnJohnny Depp sued by former bodyguards for unpaid wagesBoarding school children dominate world of work because they\u0026#39re not in front of screens at home, head says Indian Prime Minister \u0026#39authorised secret operation\u0026#39 to intercept runaway Dubai royalMike Pompeo vows US diplomats will \u0026#39get swagger back\u0026#39 under his leadershipMexico \u0026#39caravan members\u0026#39 celebrate as eight members admitted to USComment: Justine Greening has got it wrong.

You can easily do this, there\u0027s software to help you as a company,  Ms Greening told a social mobility conference in New York. Research showed disadvantaged applicants were 50 per cent more likely to be hired after contextual recruitment than otherwise, Ms Greening added, according to the TES magazine.Mr Reader, who is chair of the BSA, said that while social mobility is important, businesses must be left to “make their own decisions” about who they hire and this should not be “dictated” by MPs. “It is not for Government to tell businesses who is the right person for them at the end of the day,” he said.School fees by age groupMr Reader said that another benefit of a boarding school education is the “real face-to-face, social time” rather than pupils at day schools who are used to “virtual socializing” after school and at weekends.He said that many boarding schools restrict social media either through controlling WiFi or limiting the apps that pupils can use.Mr Reader told how his school has banned all mobile phones for pupils aged 13 to 14 as they are “not mature enough” for the technology.“We use to get an incident a week of something unpleasant for that age group but now we\u0027ve had nothing,” he said. “We restrict alcohol and cigarettes as a society because they are addictive so why not restrict something as addictive as a mobile phone.”Please review our commenting policyBBC presenters miss out on top jobs if they have double-barrelled surnames, court hearsBusinessman illegally raised value of home by chopping down protected treesJohn Bercow faces new allegations of bullying an aideWhite House defends seizing Donald Trump\u0026#39s medical records from former doctorCouncil cuts piling pressure on GPs as \u0026#3990 per cent\u0026#39 reduce servicesHaving blood type O almost trebles risk of dying from serious injury, scientists findWHO estimates 7 million die from pollution each year as it reveals latest global air quality figures Government at risk of \u0026#39collapse\u0026#39 as May warned by 60 Tory MPs Brexit customs partnership will sink herTiger cub found in duffel bag at US-Mexico borderThe Split, episode two, recap: All is fair in love and wine for Hannah and her sistersYouTube stars paid to help schoolchildren cheat on their examsHigh earners most likely to be drinkersPrue Leith: My brother died in agony because of ban on assisted dying lawsTories risk being locked out of London for generation in local elections, Cabinet ministers warnJohnny Depp sued by former bodyguards for unpaid wagesIndian Prime Minister \u0026#39authorised secret operation\u0026#39 to intercept runaway Dubai royalMike Pompeo vows US diplomats will \u0026#39get swagger back\u0026#39 under his leadershipMexico \u0026#39caravan members\u0026#39 celebrate as eight members admitted to USComment: Justine Greening has got it wrong.

Your friends aren’t going to see your profile, and you’re only going to be suggested to people who are not your friends.”The announcement drew a tongue-in-cheek welcome to the competitive online dating field from IAC, whose holdings include platforms like OKCupid and Tinder.“Come on in. The water’s warm. Their product could be great for US-Russia relationships”, CEO Joey Levin said in a statement, referencing the fact that Russian-linked operatives have been accused of using Facebook to widen societal ides and influence the 2016 presidential election.Chief Facebook product officer Chris Cox explained the details of the new dating feature further, saying that it has been in development for a long time.“We were convinced dating would be the next feature Facebook would add,” Mr Cox said, referring to when he first joined Facebook in 2005. “We hope this will allow more folks to meet, and hopefully find partners.”The feature will be opt-in and will be supported through the Facebook app.“People already use Facebook to meet new people, and we want to make that experience better,” Facebook explained. ”People will be able to create a dating profile that is separate from their Facebook profile – and potential matches will be recommended based on dating preferences, things in common, and mutual friends.“They’ll have the option to discover others with similar interests through their Groups or Events. However, what people do within the dating feature will not be shown to their friends. We’ll share more information when this begins testing later this year.”The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

Photos of the happy couple are strewn around the walls: Jane and Serge kissing in the back seat of a car on a rainy day in Paris Jane and Serge beaming into the camera on a lazy summer’s day, after a long, languid lunch. Jane looks beautiful, an English rose, the epitome of a carefree era when anything seemed possible. Serge looks incroyable, like a gargoyle or a goblin. No wonder the French press called him l’homme à tête de chou (the man with the head of a cabbage).From 1968 to 1980, Birkin and Gainsbourg were Europe’s most glamorous creative couple. They could scarcely have been less alike. She was young and lovely, health and innocence personified. He was seedy and dishevelled, yet he oozed Gallic élan. They appeared together in movies and fashion shoots, but the thing that made them famous was the song they sang together, “Je T’Aime… Moi Non Plus” (I love you… neither do I).Gasinbourg wrote “Je T’Aime” for Brigitte Bardot, with whom he had a brief romance in 1967. In 1969, he released the song with his new love, Jane Birkin. It was a Succès de Scandale, on account of Birkin’s contribution, in which she simulated the sounds of female arousal (20 years before When Harry Met Sally – quelle horreur!). If you’ve never heard it, it sounds awful – but, remarkably, it was a masterpiece. A conversation between two passionate, nihilistic lovers, it contained poetic pearls like “You are the wave – I am the island”, and Birkin’s heavy breathing, of course.Driving through Oxfordshire, on the road to Blenheim Palace in 1969“Je T’Aime” was condemned by the Vatican and banned from the radio in Britain and several Continental countries. France was a bit more enlightened. The song was played on the radio, but only after 11pm, and you had to be over 21 to buy the record. Even then, it was sold in a plain wrapper, like a porn mag or a blue movie. Naturally, this furore was wonderful exposure. A broadcast ban is fantastic for sales, giving a hit single a rebellious cachet that no amount of advertising can achieve. All these years later, “Je T’Aime” still stands proud in the pantheon of brilliant records banned by the BBC, from “God Save the Queen” by the Sex Pistols to “Relax” by Frankie Goes to Hollywood.  The record reached number one in Britain, and all across the Continent. Serge told Jane that the Pope was their greatest PR man. “He loved it!” she says, remembering Gainsbourg’s reaction to the controversy. He had a terrific appetite for mischief, and he knew no publicity was bad publicity.Jane \u0026amp Serge: Family album by Andrew BirkinJane \u0026amp Serge: Family album by Andrew BirkinJane and Serge kissing in the back seat of a car on a rainy day in Paris 1969 - Andrew Birkin: Serge seemed to know the hidden underside of the photo shoot and, clearly better than me, the readers of Jours de France: nothing too subtle. We looked for the Oxford bus depot, which was deserted at the weekend, and bribed the caretaker to close his eyes while Serge sat in the driver\u0027s seat in the bright red double-decker bus, Jane at his side. Buying him a hot dog was the not-too-subtle but sufficient reward, before setting off for Oxford, a true place of learning.\u0026#131974 - Andrew Birkin: Serge received some good news from his agent... and bad news in a Sunday rag, which quoted him as saying: You\u0027re not my wife, darling... I love my freedom too much! . Black had always been my favourite colour: when I was at school, I had painted my bedroom walls black and I thought about doing the same in this hideous house I had bought in London. Serge stole a march on me by covering his recently purchased house in the Rue de Verneuil in black from floor to ceiling. \u0026#13On the road to Blenheim PalaceSerge entertaining Jane and Régine during a lunch party in 1969Photography by Andrew BirkinJane in 19691977 - Andrew Birkin: Jane had bought an old presbytery in Normandy, somewhere she could impose her own taste rather than always approving Serge\u0027s style. Serge\u0027s love for the countryside was short-lived and after just a few days, he was itching with the idea of returning to Paris... Or at least the idea of reviving himself with a “Marcel Proust” cocktail at the bar in the Grand Hôtel in Cabourg. \u0026#13Serge and Nana in 1977That was nearly 50 years ago, but the memories of that hedonistic era still burn bright, and now Birkin is revisiting that heady époque in a new show called Jane \u0026amp Serge here in Calais. It’s an exhibition of photos of the couple by her brother, Andrew Birkin, taken from the late Sixties to the late Seventies. Andrew is an eminent filmmaker (his biggest hit was his haunting film of Ian McEwan’s novel, The Cement Garden) and he has a director’s eye for drama. Andrew has always been close to Jane and he became close to Gainsbourg too. Consequently, these photos are incredibly intimate. Each frame preserves a particular mood, a unique atmosphere. They not only capture the essence of their relationship but the spirit of their age.Andrew is here too, for the opening of the exhibition, and he takes time out to show me and a few other hacks around. “He was a provocateur,” he says, of Serge. “He was always on.” This isn’t a criticism, merely a statement of fact. Twenty-seven years since Gainsbourg died, of a heart attack, aged just 62, Andrew’s deep affection for the legendary chanteur endures. “That streak of melancholy was one of his most attractive facets.”Half a century later, Jane Birkin is still striking – the same fine features half hidden beneath a cascade of tousled brown hair. The laugh lines around her almond eyes merely add to her allure, and her rich voice is full of joie de vivre. Although she left Gainsbourg in 1980, on account of his escalating alcoholism, they remained friends thereafter, united by the child they had together, the actress and singer Charlotte Gainsbourg, and she speaks of him with fondness, and admiration.Jane in the grounds of Blenheim Palace in 1969 – the archetypal English rose“Andrew was around on all our holidays – and all the rather bad films I did!” she recalls, looking at the photos of her younger self that surround her, reducing her to a pale replica of the image on the wall. “It’s a bit weird. You feel as if you’re dead.” Everyone laughs, but it’s not so funny. Her youthful fame has eclipsed her, leaving her public persona stranded in a time that’s long since passed.She still spends most of her time in France, and today she seems more French than English. Watching her being interviewed by French reporters, speaking fluent French, she seems more natural, more at ease. It looks like an admirable life, from a distance, but she’s had her share of sadness. Kate Barry, her eldest daughter, from her first marriage to the composer John Barry, died in Paris in 2013 after falling from a fourth-floor apartment.Jane left Serge for the French director Jacques Doillon, with whom she had another daughter, the actress and singer-songwriter Lou Doillon. She still sings, and last year she released an album of songs written for her by Serge – he wrote some of his finest songs about her after they’d parted. “Which, for me, are the most beautiful,” she says. “Everything on Baby Alone in Babylone, which was perhaps the best record I ever made.”That was two years after they’d split, and she’d already given birth to Lou, but the aura of their romance lived on in Serge’s songs. “I liked the ones after I left more, perhaps, because they were really about what he was feeling, and I felt it was deeper.” It felt emotional, singing them in front of him after a parting which caused them both such pain.What made him so significant as an artiste, I ask her. “He really rediscovered the French language,” she tells me. “That’s why I think every writer these days is bound to mention his name.” She likens him to Picasso, passing through so many styles. “He never repeated himself.”Jane and Serge in 1977, in the old presbytery that she bought in NormandyLike a true poet, he loved ambiguity. “There were always two meanings, and sometimes a third.” Yet he far preferred to simply call himself a songwriter. “He didn’t want to say he was a poet. He thought that was for Baudelaire and Apollinaire. The people he really appreciated were classical musicians.” He said that songwriting was a minor occupation. She found such modesty refreshing.Time’s up. Jane has another appointment. A French TV crew are waiting. I return to Andrew and his photos. “The problem with photography is that it starts to overwrite your memories of what you didn’t photograph,” he says. I think I know what he means. The more you look at these photos of his sister, the more unreal the real person becomes.Jane Birkin asks Hermès fashion house to rename luxury Birkin bagsSimon Price on Jane Birkin: Jane reignites her flame for SergeJane Birkin: \u0027I was no Lolita,\u0027 says Britain\u0027s BardotHowever Andrew has a very clear memory of his final meeting with Serge Gainsbourg, about six months before he died. “I bought him a 1910 bottle of Absinthe from Sotheby’s.” Andrew went to see him in his home in Paris, and they watched a film together. “He was asleep within five minutes of putting on the video, so I got up, crept out of the black house and into the black street and that was the last time I saw him.”In the end, it was the same old, sad old story. “The main problem with Serge is just that he became an alcoholic, and had no particular interest in stopping himself.” So what was the connection between his sister and the chanteur? I ask him. “Sex,” he says, and everyone laughs, but he then stops and thinks about it. “It was the attraction of opposites, in a way.”Jane \u0026amp Serge is at the Musée des Beaux Arts in Calais (calais.fr) until 4 Novemberor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

As these movies have gone on, they’ve also become ever-more interlinked, featuring regular cameos, references, and Easter Eggs to other instalments.For newcomers to superhero movies — perhaps those who have become absorbed in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) following Black Panther — the amount of material to watch can be overwhelming. But for those wanting to persevere, there are two watching orders. Really, you should probably watch these movies in release order, starting the journey starting with Iron Man — one of the best MCU instalments to date — moving onto The Incredible Hulk, then Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, finishing Phase One with Avengers. This order works well in terms of the post-credit scenes all setting up the next movie and has the intended rhythm formed by producer Kevin Feige.However, many fans have taken to watching the series in chronological order. This might be a little convoluted, but that should not put you off: below is every piece of MCU viewing material mapped out into chronological order including movies, Netflix shows, one-shots (those mini-films you will find in the DVD extras), and other TV shows. 27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 Agent Carter (seasons one and two)For phase two, things almost play out in release order, except s of the Galaxy Vol. 2 comes directly after the first s, meaning the movie has been moved into Phase Two, despite being a Phase Three release. Ranking the Marvel Cinematic Universe filmsAlso of note, one-shots were phased out during Phase Two with the introduction of the Netflix shows and Agents of Shield. For those who do embark on Agents of Shield (the second and third seasons are great), you should definitely watch along with the movies as they have major effects on the show’s story.All Hail the King (one-shot – Thor: The Dark World)Agents of Shield (season one: episodes 1 — 7)Agents of Shield (season one: episodes 8 — 16)Agents of Shield (season one: episodes 17 — 22)s of the Galaxys of the Galaxy Vol. 2Agents of Shield (season two: episodes 1 — 19)Avengers: Age of UltronAgents of Shield (season two: episodes 20 — 22)Agents of Shield (season three: episodes 1 — 19)Made it this far? Well done, you’ve watched a whole lot of Marvel! Phase Three marks some of the best MCU movies so far, but also some timeline bending difficulties. For instance, Doctor Strange begins before Civil War, but finishes after Civil War, Slingshot features lots of flashbacks, and Agents of Shield season five features a lot of obscure time travelling. Also, Black Panther and Spider-Man both take place directly after Civil War, while Ragnarok and Panther directly lead into Avengers: Infinity War. Below’s just a guide for a manageable way of watching based mainly on release order.Agents of Shield (season three: episodes 20 — 22)Agents of Shield (season four: episodes 1 — 8)Agents of Shield: Slingshot (web series)Agents of Shield (season four: episodes 9 — 22)Agents of Shield (season five, episodes 1 — 14)Cloak and Dagger (season one)Congratulations. If you’ve watched all of the above, you’ve processed over nine days worth of Marvel movies and television. Nine days! And there’s still more to come, including: Ant Man and The Wasp, Captain Marvel, an untitled fourth Avengers movie, Spider-Man: Homecoming 2, s of the Galaxy Vol. 3, Luke Cage season two, Daredevil season three, The Punisher season two, Iron Fist season two, Jessica Jones season three, and New Warriors season one.

Others were able to log in but, when they did, some or all of their account details had disappeared.Customers have also reported that they could access other people’s accounts, including account numbers, sort codes and transaction histories.TSB apology after customers complain of online banking ‘data breach’​TSB could not say how many people were still locked out of the service or when the problems would be fully resolved.The ongoing IT disaster began with botched upgrade work on Friday, but has developed into one of the worst technology failures to hit a UK retail bank and has left many of TSB’s 1.9 million customers furious.Some said they were falling behind with bill payments.Others said they were worried their money had simply disappeared.Many customers expressed frustration that the bank was not being clear about what had happened.That came after Paul Pester, CEO of TSB, tweeted on Wednesday morning: “Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience and for bearing with us.”Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience and for bearing with us.MPs demanded answers from TSB on Tuesday. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Committee, said: “The reports of unauthorised transactions, access to other customers’ accounts and failures of in-branch services have all the hallmarks of an IT meltdown.“This is yet another addition to the litany of failures of banking IT systems. Potentially, millions of customers could be affected by uncertainty and disruption.“It simply isn’t good enough to expose customers to IT failures, including delays in paying bills and an inability to access their own money.”A spokesperson for the Financial Conduct Authority said on Tuesday that the watchdog was “aware of the issue and liaising with the firm”. A spokesperson for the Information Commissioner’s Office said: “We are aware of a potential data breach in relation to the TSB and are making enquiries.”Mr Pester said on Tuesday that he was “truly sorry” about the problems caused. “We’re still seeing issues with access to our digital services,” he added. “One of the steps we need to take to resolve this is to take our mobile app and online banking down for a few hours.“We did this at around 10.30 this morning and we hope to be back up later this afternoon.”The problems stemmed from a switch to a new online banking system. TSB had rented the technology behind its app and online banking from Lloyds Banking Group since the two companies split.

commons","story":"Downing Street argues the change imposed by the Lords will tie the government\u0027s hands in Brexit negotiationsTheresa May has vowed to overturn a key change to her Brexit legislation imposed by the House of Lords, which she claims could stop Britain leaving the EU.The prime minister said that when the proposed change comes back to a vote in the Commons the government would be “robust” in trying to block it.But her spokesman could not give a clear answer on Tuesday as to whether government whips believe they have the support of enough MPs in the Commons to overturn the change.Brexit result tainted by Cambridge Analytica scandal, says Tory MPIt comes as Ms May prepares for a Brexit meeting with select cabinet ministers on Wednesday, at which they will try to come up with a joint position on post-withdrawal customs relations following the EU’s rejection of the UK’s existing proposals.Ms May met with her full cabinet on Tuesday after suffering the decisive defeat in the Lords, which she argued will give parliament “unprecedented powers” to direct her administration’s course.The prime minister’s spokesman said after the meeting of top ministers: “Cabinet expressed its strong disappointment at the defeats inflicted on the EU Withdrawal Bill in the House of Lords, saying they risk tying the government’s hands behind its back in negotiations with Brussels.“The prime minister said that when the bill returns to the House of Commons the government would be robust.March for a People’s Vote: campaigners call for march on Westminster to demand fresh public vote on Brexit“She said it was vital to ensure the legislation is able to deliver the smooth Brexit which is in the interest of everybody in the United Kingdom.”  Ms May has said she will give

citizens registerBrexit result tainted by Cambridge Analytica scandal, says Tory MPWhat the Sainsbury’s-Asda merger says about Brexit EU gives Britain June deadline on Northern Ireland border issueCross-party backing for motion to give parliament more say on Brexit Given that the government’s own economic projections suggest this would be the worst possible outcome for the country, critics have accused Ms May of using the threat as leverage to get MPs to back her deal regardless of what it is.But the amendment passed by the Lords to Ms May’s EU Withdrawal Bill on Monday, would mean that if her deal is rejected, then it is parliament that will decide what happens next – with any option open.The prime minister’s spokesman said: “What the amendment which was passed last night would do, is weaken the UK’s hand in our Brexit negotiations by giving parliament unprecedented powers to instruct the government to do anything with regard to the negotiations – including trying to keep the UK in the EU indefinitely.”But twice asked if the prime minister is confident she actually has the numbers in the Commons to reverse changes, the spokesman said only that it is in the “interests of the Houses of Parliament” to allow the government to deliver Brexit.Tusk: Brexit is ‘one of the saddest moments’ in recent European historyMs May has already suffered a defeat at the hands of Tory rebels in the Commons, meanwhile the next stages of other pieces of Brexit legislation have been delayed because the government is unsure it can defeat amendments placed by Conservative backbenchers.However, the No 10 spokesman said the government is determined to have EU Withdrawal Bill passed in the same state that it left the Commons the first time round, indicating that it will try and overturn all of the changes imposed by the Lords.It has suffered seven defeats in the Lords in recent weeks, imposing changes to its legislation which if left untouched could lead the way to keeping the UK in a customs union, keeping the EU’s charter of fundamental rights and restricting the “Henry VIII” powers, which the Bill gives to ministers to make new laws without full parliamentary scrutiny.Brexit talks to resume this week after EU warning on Irish borderThe cabinet’s Brexit subcommittee will meet to discuss the vexed issue of post-Brexit customs relations on Wednesday, with at least one of its members having suggested they will quit if the UK remains in a customs union with the EU.International trade secretary Liam Fox hinted strongly that he would resign if the prime minister gives way to pressure in parliament and opts for closer customs relations with the EU after Brexit. He refused to answer the question directly over whether he would quit, but added: “Getting no answer you can draw your own inferences.”Foreign secretary Boris Johnson is also said to have considered quitting over the issue, though close aides deny it.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He added: “Without him it would have been a much longer, tougher, process!”China is North Korea’s sole major ally, but trade has declined by about 90 per cent after Beijing implemented economic sanctions due to Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile tests.In March Mr Kim visited China by train, meeting Mr Xi and the pair – according to the state-run China Daily – agreed a plan to develop relations between the two countries, and to address the North’s nuclear programme.The 36-year-old dictator is anticipated to meet Mr Trump at some point in May or early June, though no date has been announced for the encounter the Republican accepted on the spur of the moment earlier this year.On Twitter Mr Trump suggested he was considering the Peace House, on the border between North and South Korea, as the intended location. It is where last week’s summit between Mr Moon and Mr Kim was held.He tweeted: “Numerous countries are being considered for the MEETING, but would Peace HouseFreedom House, on the Border of North \u0026amp South Korea, be a more Representative, Important and Lasting site than a third party country?

Seoul began blaring anti-Pyongyang broadcasts and K-Pop songs via border loudspeakers, and Pyongyang quickly matched the South’s action with its own border broadcasts and launches of balloons carrying anti-South leaflets. Seoul’s announcement came a day after it said Mr Kim had told Mr Moon during the summit that he would shut down his country’s only known nuclear testing site and allow outside experts and journalists to watch the process.Additional reporting by agenciesor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

She was reported to be building a war chest in the event of the PM being ousted. For Ms Rudd this humiliation is a nightmare.But the simple truth is that she has been toppled because she was simply not up to the job.Misleading parliament over routine targets for deporting illegal immigrants is the least of it.Ms Rudd was already marked with the Black Spot.Her real blunders were the failure to act far quicker on both the Windrush victims and the knife massacre in London.The Home Office is the infamous “political graveyard” which chews ministers up and spits them out.Theresa May is the rarity who not only survived but used it as a springboard.Now the famously cautious PM needs to carry out emergency repairs with flair and imagination. She needs a new Home Secretary today.The right man for the job is Environment supremo Michael Gove.He has rebuilt his reputation, almost destroyed by his assassination of leadership rival Boris Johnson.He is the most articulate heavyweight minister in Cabinet and has proved that he can handle big responsibilities with both flair and courage.But Amber Rudd’s department has smashed the delicate Cabinet balance between Brexiteers and Remainers.It exposes deep divisions within Tory ranks over the roubled negotiations currently under way with Brussels.A handful of Remainers are threatening to defy the government in a critical vote over remaining in the EU customs union.Meanwhile Brexiteers who have remained silent are plotting a leadership coup if Mrs May gives in.The departure of Ms Rudd could explode all of this into open warfare.Will Mrs May risk putting potential rival Michael Gove in one of the really Great Offices of State?Jezza’s empty promise to crack down on anti-Semitism followed Commons applause for tearful Labour MPs as they read out vicious Jew-phobic abuse from JC4PM supporters.The answer to Mrs Merton is that Labour, with a 22 per cent poll lead, expects big things in London on Thursday, perhaps including scalps in Tory crown jewel boroughs Westminster and Wandsworth.JC doesn’t want a row over Jew-baiting to spoil a good night for Labour.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If you let your child be their own person then she probably wouldn’t make the same decisions I did.More poignant, however, is the revelation that Jade was sexually assaulted when she was 16 – at a time when she had never even kissed a boy.Understandably the traumatic experience had a profound effect on her.Anything that happens to someone at a young age when boys cross the line it is going to affect you, she says now.Afterwards I was having sex a fair amount and I thought that was all I was worth.Getting into the porn industry allowed me to mature, to grow into myself, she says.When I got into this, there were people telling me I was beautiful and it brought me out of my shell, it made me believe in myself more than I ever did before.It’s given me independence and self-esteem.On some level I’m the last person you would think works in the adult industry – but often it’s the girls you never would have expected having sex for a living, like the quiet ones you used to see sat in the library with a book.Jade wasn’t quite that girl, although she describes herself as a naïve teenager. She won’t discuss her family, although she describes her upbringing as perfect.By the age of 13 however, she was already watching porn online.Boys in the playground at school were using all these sexual terms. I didn’t have a clue what those words meant so I started looking things up on the internet, she says.It was curiosity really. We’re the generation that’s grown up with the internet, with online pornography, it’s more normalised for our age group.Initially a more traditional career path beckoned though: Jade was accepted on a fashion degree course in Manchester and embarked on student life in the city.But as her student loan started to run out she took an unorthodox route to topping up her funds.I tried everything I could to get a traditional job to get some extra cash but every job in retail I applied for there were to 200 applicants for, she insists.Then a guy I’d met online suggested I sell some pornographic pictures and videos.I already had some on my phone from previous boyfriends so it wasn’t a big leap.Suddenly I had £100 in my bank account every few weeks and I could go shopping and it made me happy.Then, aged 19, she received an email from a website asking if she’d like to make a pornographic film. I said yes, that I would absolutely love to, she says.The basic shoot involved a very simple boy meets girl scene. I had no idea what to expect but I wasn’t nervous, she insists.I knew nothing though - I turned up with just the clothes on my back. I remember them asking me where my underwear and outfit options were. But I enjoyed it.Quickly, it seems, Jade found that performing porn gave her a sense of self-worth that had been missing from her life: she describes her student days as lonely and depressed and says that her newfound porn career gave her confidence.Nonetheless, it’s clear she has gone through experiences which made her unhappy, some of which unfold in the documentary.In one scene, in which her male co-star is struggling to perform Jade can be seen having a panic attack as she worries about filming with him again.In another more shocking incident, she confides that she has been bleeding after suffering a tear in her vagina after a vigorous sex session – yet feels she has no choice but to have sex with the same man on camera again. It’s my job, she says to camera.Today she does not want to dwell on these incidents, saying they are in the past. It was the start of what would become, post graduation, a full-time porn career, travelling to shoots all over Europe – among them Prague, Budapest, Spain, Austria.For two years I didn’t see my bed for more than about three days in a row. she says. But I found it very fulfilling. It gave me independence in a way that getting coffees as an intern in the fashion industry could never do.And while the pay wasn’t huge – some shoots pay £500 a day, some much less, with an hourly rate of around £12 - it was enough for her, by the age of 21, to rent her own city centre flat.She was also able to fund a boob job, something she calls her 21st birthday present to myself.I didn’t do it for men, she insists. I wanted to balance my body out. I went from a small B to a DD. I wanted that perfect rounded shape.She insists that she’s never had a bad experience or felt vulnerable. When I first started out I did some things I’m not proud of - someone was a bit rough with me, she says.But it was because I was bottom of the ladder. Now in terms of what I do on set everything is agreed on before I arrive.If I think a guy is going too hard I will just tell him to stop and they always respect it.Like all sex workers, she has regular sexual health checks as 90 percent of sex takes place without protection. So far, she has emerged unscathed.Years later, she now says that it is her work in porn, not real relationships, that give her a sense of self-worth.In my professional life men treat me with nothing but admiration and respect. But I find in real life that’s not the case, she says.It’s one reason she has decided to remain single for the foreseeable future, describing herself as asexual.It’s just easier this way, she says. One ex-boyfriend was fine with it at first but then got jealous.It’s just easier to have either porn or a boyfriend, you can’t really have both at the same time.Her friends, meanwhile, are aware of what she does but are unfazed.They’ve known me a long time and they know I enjoy being outlandish. It wasn’t the biggest shock to them.Again this description seems at odds with the portrait of the naïve and lonely girl that Jade also likes to paint of her past self.Either way, today Jade likes to think of herself as an entrepreneur as well as a porn performer.She has given up travelling to shoots and instead works from her Manchester flat creating her own content, which she sells to subscribers.I work three days a week from my own home and while I’m not rich I’m not poor. For me it’s not about the money, she says. It’s about doing something I enjoy.Is there a sell-by date on what she does? Who knows?, she asks. I live each day by the day. What about regret in the future? After all, the 60-year-old Jade might feel differently about what she did as a young girl.Maybe but I don’t think so, she says. I like to think that I’ll enjoy seeing how hot I was.I am proud of what I do. I honestly think that discovering the porn industry made me the person I am today, and I couldn’t be more grateful.Jade features in Jade: Why I Chose Porn on BBC iPlayer and Things Not To Say To Someone Who Works In Porn on BBC Three’s YouTube channelOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But yesterday he ascended to one of the great offices of state.What makes Javid’s appointment so remarkable is that Theresa May cares about the Home Office — which she was in charge of for six years — more than any other department and she and Javid have not seen eye to eye over the years.If the Prime Minister was at the peak of her powers, he would not be the new Home Secretary.When Theresa May made Amber Rudd Home Secretary, it was on the implicit understanding that she would continue her legacy at the Home Office.Rudd accepted this trade — and swallowed her own doubts about several of Mrs May’s policies.This approach was, ultimately, what did for her. Javid, a far more independent-minded politician, will not repeat that mistake.Indeed, no senior member of the Cabinet offered the job would now be prepared to make the trade that Rudd did back in 2016.Mrs May simply isn’t powerful enough to demand that kind of loyalty any more. Rudd’s departure exposes Mrs May in two ways.First, the firebreak between her and the Windrush scandal has been removed. Any further revelations about what has gone wrong will end up on the Prime Minister’s doorstep.Second, it has shown how Mrs May now has to reach out in even her most senior Cabinet appointments, promoting those who have clashed with her in the past.When the political Cabinet met for the first time after Mrs May’s Election disaster last year, Javid was ABSOLUTELY BRUTAL in setting out what was wrong with the way she and her team had run Downing Street.The Prime Minister was left in no doubt as to Javid’s frustration with how her team had undermined him.But the reason why he was briefed against is fascinating, given his new job.Javid’s offence was not to kowtow to Mrs May.At the height of the May ascendancy, when she was the most popular Prime Minister since polling records began, most ministers went along with whatever she wanted, whether they agreed with it or not. Javid did not.He argued ferociously against what he saw as her anti-business proposals.He fought particularly hard against her desire for tests for foreign takeovers of British companies.In meetings he sided with Chancellor Philip Hammond in arguing that Britain shouldn’t become like France, a country where the government stopped foreigners buying a yoghurt-making company on national interest grounds.Mrs May now finds herself presiding over a Cabinet where ministers know they can push their own positions with little consequence.So Jeremy Hunt and Gavin Williamson have both campaigned publicly for more money for health and defence respectively.Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has openly set out the kind of Brexit he wants, unafraid to get ahead of the Prime Minister’s position.David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, is now letting it be known what the differences are between his approach and that of the Prime Minister’s chief adviser on the negotiations, Olly Robbins.If Javid was prepared to stand up to Mrs May at the height of her powers, what will he do now?He certainly won’t be her patsy at the Home Office. He’ll be determined to put his own stamp on the department.A more ruthless politician than Amber Rudd, he won’t feel any compunction about breaking from the Prime Minister’s Home Office legacy where necessary.Why, then, has Mrs May appointed him?Well, I understand her initial instinct was to consider Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland Secretary, for the job.Bradley is a May loyalist: She was one of her junior ministers at the Home Office, an enthusiastic backer of her leadership bid and is her most reliable ally in the Brexit inner Cabinet.However, senior figures at No10 persuaded the Prime Minister that appointing Bradley would look like she was circling the wagons — that it would project an image of weakness, not strength.With a growing feeling among the Cabinet that Mrs May has retreated into the Downing Street bunker, listening more and more to officials such as Olly Robbins and less and less to ministers, appointing a cipher to be Home Secretary would have caused dangerous levels of anger and resentment. Mrs May, to her credit, listened and the decision to appoint Javid was made.His instincts on immigration are different from Mrs May’s.He doesn’t regard it as a numbers game and is one of the Cabinet ministers most privately sceptical of the PM’s aim to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands.If Mrs May was in a stronger position, she would have appointed someone more prepared to defer to her views on this subject than him.Javid will be his own man as Home Secretary, not the Prime Minister’s. Mrs May, who knows the Home Office so well, will find that hard to take at times.But his appointment is a recognition that she isn’t any more in a position to dictate to her senior ministers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

My skin peels off and, at times, there is bleeding.“All I can do is watch children my age play and enjoy their life.”Vedika, from Indore in India, spends her time alone studying, painting and watching TV as she doesn’t have any friends.Her family have taken her to several doctors but none have been able to provide her with a cure.She has to cover herself in moisturiser several times a day to stop her skin from cracking, flaking and bleeding.Vedika’s older sister Sunidhi, 20, also suffers from the condition and is so self-conscious about her looks she doesn’t go outside.Their aunts also suffer from the genetic condition.“My elder daughter who also has the same skin disorder keeps herself confined in her room,” said mum Madhuri Gupta.“She is now a grown woman conscious about her looks and appearance. Hence, she avoids socialising, interacting with people or even coming in front of the camera.”Desperate for a cure the sisters turned to alternative treatments, which only made their skin worse.Then they heard about the plight of Shalini Yadav, an Indian teenager whose lamellar ichthyosis was cured by treatment in Spain.They are now crowdfunding for the same medication, which doctors say will be available in India.“All I want is that my daughters dont suffer the same way like me in the future, giving birth to babies with similar disorders, there should be a treatment,” Madhuri said.“At home, I keep my daughters in comfort, but outside the struggle that they face, I cannot do anything about it.”Vedika hopes the new treatment will change her life.“Everyone has treated me equally, but yes when I speak to some stranger then I feel a little uncomfortable,” she said.“If I get help like Shalini got, I can also lead a life of dignity.“If there is any treatment that helps improve my skin condition by 50 per cent, it will give my confidence a boost.”You can donate to their cause at their fundraising page here.The skin cells are produced at a normal rate, but they do not separate normally at the surface of the outermost layer of skin and are not shed as quickly as they should be.The result of this retention is the formation of scales.Symptoms:Signs of the condition will be present at birth.Babies are often covered with a clean membrane and have dark red, tight skin.Often the eyelids and lips are forced open by the tightness.Babies also can experience problems with temperature regulation, water loss and secondary infections.People with lamellar ichthyosis often have trouble closing their eyes completely because of the tightness of the skin around the eyes and eyelids.In some cases, the skin around the eyes pulls so tightly it causes they eyelids to turn outward exposing the inner red lid and causing continuous irritation.The dry skin builds up so much that suffers shed skin on a daily basis.Treatment:Lamellar ichthyosis is treated topically with skin barrier repair formulas containing ceramides or cholesterol, moisturizers with petrolatum or lanolin.Severe lamellar ichthyosis can be treated systemically with oral synthetic retinoids.Retinoids are only used in severe cases of lamellar ichthyosis due to their known bone toxicity and other complications.There is no known cure, but several clinical studies are active around the world."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict0004025960991.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"sajid javid tory power pose","story":"Almost immediately after his appointment to Home Secretary was confirmed, Javid appeared outside his new department, legs wide and staring off into the middle distance, a pose so popular among Conservative big guns that its pretty much government policy.Then-Prime Minister David Cameron used to adopt the exact same power pose while speaking on TV, Environment Secretary Michael Gove has used it while chatting to the media, and BoJo has been snapped doing it in the doorway of 10 Downing Street.Perhaps they took tips from Real Madrid footballer Ronaldo, whos also known to strike the pose on the pitch.But the same big question is on everyones lips: why do it?Did someone teach Tory ministers from to adopt this odd power stance, or have they all independently decided the best way to present themselves to the world is by doing an awkward version of the splits?Well, theres also a chance that they picked it up watching a popular Ted Talk by social psychologist and body language expert Amy Cuddy, who argues that power posing can boost your confidence and increase your chances of success.In her speech, Cuddy explains how her own research has suggested that power posing before a nerve-wracking event can be good for your self-esteem, and can help you stay cool and collected under pressure.Its all about taking up space and making yourself as big as possible - a strategy used by dominant creatures throughout the animal kingdom.But Cuddys tips revolve around pulling a power pose in private while youre preparing for your big moment, not standing on stage at Tory conference with your legs wider than the Thames.Either way, here are some of the other key lessons from her talk which Javid and Co. might have taken on-board, and how you can deploy your own power stance to get ahead in life.Amy explains in her talk: Social scientists have spent a lot of time looking at the effects of body language on judgements, which can predict meaningful outcomes like who we hire and promote or who we ask out on a date.Basically, you can exert power and dominance - over others and over your surroundings - and affect what happens in your life purely by standing in a certain way.In the animal kingdom, particularly among our close relatives, the monkeys, powerful individuals expand their bodies to stretch out and take up as much space as possible.Its about opening up, she explains. And this is true across the animal kingdom - its not limited to primates - and humans do the same thing.When we feel powerless we do exactly the opposite.We close up and make ourselves small.But its not just about projecting power over other people - Amy says we can fake it till we make it and convince ourselves that we are more confident and dominant just by consciously adopting a bold power stance.When you pretend to be powerful, you are more likely to actually feel powerful, she explains.Powerful people tend to be more assertive, confident and optimistic, and they take more risks.The body can shape the mind. In her own research, Amy has taken groups of people and asked them to adopt high or low-power poses, without telling them why.The famous legs-spread Tory stance is an example of a high-power pose, while low-power poses could include seated positions with the limbs tucked in.After two minutes in this pose, subjects were asked to play a gambling game, and the choices of the high-power and low-power groups were compared.Cuddy found that 85 per cent of the people primed by just two minutes in a power pose were prepared to take risks, while just 60 per cent of the low-power group took the same risks.By swabbing the mouth before and after a two-minute pose, researchers also found that testosterone, the male sex hormone associated with physical strength, increases by 20 per cent after adopting a high-power pose.This is true of both men and women, meaning anyone can gain a rush of masculine power just by standing with your legs spread.And on the flip side, testosterone levels tend to dip by around 10 per cent after two minutes spent in a low-power pose.Meanwhile, cortisol levels, which are associated with stress, decrease after a few minutes in a dominant pose, and rise after taking a cowering, submissive pose.In another test, Cuddy put a group of people through a mock job interview, with half of the group spending a few minutes in a power pose before they went in, and the other half adopting a low-power pose while waiting for the interview to start.She found that the people who had prepared with a power pose were more likely to get positive feedback from the test interview - suggesting that power stances can be useful to boost your own confidence, as well as to project your confidence to the world.By taking an exaggerated Javid-style power stance (sometimes dubbed the Wonder Woman pose) before you go into a meeting or give a speech you can improve your own confidence and presence.It can also make you come across as more comfortable, passionate and authentic - which explains why its so popular among big-name politicians.However, Cuddy explains that youre not necessarily meant to strike this exaggerated power pose while youre delivering a big speech - as Tory ministers are prone to doing.Its more something which you should do for yourself, in private, to gee yourself up before a big event.As Cuddy says: For two minutes before you go into a high-stress situation, try doing this: in an elevator, in a bathroom stall or at your desk, behind closed doors.Configure your brain to do the best in that situation and get your testosterone up.Of course, you dont have to be a government minister to benefit from this psychological boost - anyone can try a few minutes of power posing before a stressful or intimidating event.Just take a moment to privately adopt a big, space-hogging Alpha pose, and youll find that youre that bit more calm and composed when it comes to crunch time.Cuddy says: Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes. You dont just fake it till you make it, you can actually fake it until you become it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

which gives them a clue as to what is hiding below.Professor Faust and Yair Sapir, of Bar-Ilan University, believes the building could be part of the city of Eglon.The city is mentioned in the Bible as one of the five which fought against the Israelites before being conquered.But historians question the use of the Bible as a historical reference because most events mentioned in the text lack historical evidence.Inscribed stones have been found containing phrases referencing David, but his existence and story remains disputed among archaeologists.Dr Faust told Breaking Israel News: We, of course, did not find any artefacts that said ‘King David’ or ‘King Solomon’ but we discovered site signs of a social transformation in the region which are consistent with a change from Canaanite culture to a Judean culture.“Since it took place at a time we believed the Kingdom of David began to spread into this region, it is clear this building was part of the events in the Bible ascribed to the Kingdom of David.”He added: The structure was excavated, almost in its entirety, and was composed of a large courtyard with rooms on three sides.Hundreds of artefacts were unearthed within the debris, including a wide range of pottery vessels, loom weights, many metal objects, botanical remains, as well as many arrowheads, evidence of the battle which accompanied the conquest of the site by the Assyrians.King David’s myth begins with him as a young shepherd who killed the giant Goliath.He became a favourite of King Saul and he eventually takes the throne and conquers Jerusalem."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds monopoly man jumps over counter","story":"In the footage, the man can be seen grabbing the roll of vouchers before bolting from the London branch.The annual competition run by the fast food chain from March 21 to May 1 allows customers to receive a Double or Triple Game Piece which consists of two or three stickers, some of which are an online game sticker while others are an instant win like free food or a drink.Big prizes from the game also include £100K in cash, a Mini Cooper, a trip to Universal Florida, an XBox One games console amongst other items.While its unclear when it was filmed, the shameless thief jumps the counter with his hood pulled up and grabs the roll -

The power would have worked in a similar way to the “fit and proper person” test applied by the Football Association on foreign takeovers of English clubs.Explaining the U-turn, Government sources explained that Ministers had sought to strike a balance between supporting pensioners and allowing British companies to “grow and prosper”.Mr Coupe was caught singing We’re in the Money on TV as Sainsbury’s shares soared 17 per cent on the merger plan with long-time rival Asda.The chief exec didn’t realise his rendition of the Gold Diggers’ Song was being recorded by ITV. Mr Coupe said he was trying to compose himself before an interview on ITV about the merger.It came as critics claimed the merger could lead to widespread store closures and job losses – as well as a thumping for suppliers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She made the mistake of posting pictures of herself wearing a red silk Chinese dress to her high school prom.One twitter-warrior complained: My culture is NOT your goddamn prom dress. Another asked What’s the theme of your life? Ignorant”?And it was only a matter of time before Keziah was branded with the R-word! One troll asked, Was the theme of prom casual racism?Evidently, for social justice warriors, wearing clothes or costumes from another culture constitutes a crime that goes by the name of cultural appropriation.In recent times universities have become the hot-bed of the crusade against cultural appropriation.As a professor who has worked universities for many decades, I was taken aback by the speed with which a tiny group of cultural crusaders have succeed in gaining power over campus life.The rhetoric of cultural appropriation plays an important role in the performance of outrage. And everybody is at it.In some universities guidance is offered to students about what costumes they can and cannot wear on Halloween.Forget about organising a Latino themed party. On both sides of the Atlantic the wearing of sombreros by university students has been condemned as a cultural crime against Mexico.At one university, yoga classes were suspended because it might cause offence to Indians. A campaigner helpfully offered to change the title of the course to mindful stretching.Recently Oxford university decided to cancel a cannabis themed party amid concerns about cultural appropriation.Critics of this party encouraging guests to dress as pop-icons like Snoop Dogg or Shaggy claimed that the event would cause offence to minority students.Last month, students at Bristol University, who hosted a 21st birthday party themed A night at the Maharaja’s Palace, were denounced for committing a cultural crime. Critics were particularly galled by the sight of European students wearing glamorous Indian costumes.In recent years celebrities have become a favourite target of the culture police.White models and actresses, including Kim Kardashian, who wear their hair in cornrows are slammed for exploiting black culture.Iggy Azalea the Australian singer was attacked for rapping with a blaccent. Selina Gomez was crucified for wearing a bindi. Bruno Mars was accused of stealing black music.All celebrities – not just white – risk being accused of cultural appropriation.No sooner did Beyoncé appear portraying a Bollywood actress in Coldplay’s video Hymn for the Weekend, before the all too readily outraged social media warriors accused her of offending Indian culture.So what’s going on?Until recently people were delighted when those from another culture adopted their tastes and habits.Most civilisations - such as the Greeks, the Romans – praised foreigners who adopted their mode of dress, fashion, eating habits and customs.Throughout most of history the act of cultural appropriation was associated with enlightenment and progress.No one regarded hairstyles, costumes, music or indeed most cultural artefact as the sacred property of a chosen people.A civilised society is open to different cultural influences and is ready to share its own culture with others.Sadly, current crusade against appropriation turns every form of cultural interaction into a potential site for conflict.Even food has become the target of the culture police. Students no longer simply moan about the quality of food dished out in their canteens.At Pembroke College in Cambridge University, students condemned their institution for serving “culturally insensitive food” with “inauthentic combinations of ingredients”.Elsewhere complaints have been made about cooking fried chicken, Vietnamese sandwiches and sushi in a culturally inappropriate manner.Unwittingly the crusade against cultural appropriation serves to undermine the genuine multicultural impulses in our society.The policing of culture turns different cultural experience into no-go areas.Its ultimate objective is to build cultural fences and distance different people and ethnic groups from one another.Worse still, the policing of cultures creates a climate where the free and open attitude towards how people live their lives, decide what clothes they wear or what kind of hair-style they adopt becomes a highly charged political issue.If allowed to go unchecked, this horrible crusade will lead to cultural segregation.It will create a climate of hostility and suspicion were conflicts over who gets to decide what you can eat or wear becomes the new normal.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But if we don’t get access, we will find an alternative.”The Commission wrote to ministers in January saying Britain would not be able to stay in the Galileo satellite system for data security reasons.But that letter is being kept under lock and key in the Secretariat General, which is now run by all-powerful German official Martin Selmayr who has taken a hard line on Brexit.And it is understood that chief negotiator Michel Barnier and his team were left out of the process as the Commission insisted Britain will be cut adrift after we’ve left.The revelations came after diplomats from the 27 Member States gathered last Thursday to discuss the latest Brexit developments.An EU diplomat told The Sun: “The UK has sent a letter to the Commission outlining its wishes and the Commission has reacted to that not from Barnier’s end but from the Secretariat-Gerneral’s.“That [Commission] letter has never been seen by the Member States.”A second EU diplomat confirmed: “We’d like to get a copy of the letter that was sent to the UK.”A Commission source said the meeting had focussed on the security-related aspects of shutting the UK out of Galileo, a move which could cost British businesses hundreds of millions of pounds worth of contracts.Defence secretary Gavin Williamson has reacted furiously to the Commission’s snub and ministers are now mulling building our own rival satellite.But one EU diplomat added: “I think in the end the two parties will reach an agreement so that the UK can still participate in it.“The UK is leaving and that has consequences — you can’t expect everything to just keep on going on the same footing. But this is a negotiation and it’s still ongoing.”The £8.8 billion Galileo satellite is a rival to America’s GPS system and plays an especially important role in military operations. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The move could see prices rise by up to 24p a litre.Jamie said: “There is some logic to opening it out to milk products.” He added junk food two-for-one deals should be allowed only if there was an equal number on healthy items.And Hugh said GPs need to start routinely weighing patients to get people talking about obesity.But Christopher Snowdon, of the Institute of Economic Affairs, said: “Some people will only be happy when nobody can afford to buy any treats any more.”The second stage of the Government’s childhood obesity strategy is expected to include some of the calls when it is unveiled later this year.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.
