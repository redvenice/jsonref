There\u0027s no TV in the dining room, they make their own entertainment. \u0027As a Hollywood actress Meghan would be expected to excel if a game of charades is on the Christmas Day agenda.She will have been advised by Harry about how the day unfolds and also what present she could buy for the Queen.Recalling his visits to Sandringham he said: \u0027A book is a good present (for the Queen), she loves Jeffrey Archer novels and crime fiction. Or anything with horses or sport, but she loves a thriller.\u0027She always has a selection of the top 10 novels, if you\u0027ve ever had a novel in the top 10, then you can be sure that the Queen will have read it.\u0027He advises Meghan that \u0027practicality is the word\u0027 on buying a Christmas present for the Queen, someone \u0027who has everything\u0027, saying: \u0027Get something for the picnic, a tartan rug, Tupperware containers, something for the barbecue as Prince Philip likes tongs or the latest pepper mill. Or dog leads, as The Queen is always losing them.\u0027One year all the household staff had a collection and bought the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh an ice bucket with all our names inscribed into it.\u0027Maybe a flowering jasmine plant, that she loves the smell of, or a Hermes scarf, as she wears one all the time when walking with her dogs.\u0027The man that Diana described as her rock until her death in 1997 reveals some of the high jinks – often led by Prince Harry and William – at this most royal of Christmas celebrations: \u0027It\u0027s intense but fun for the family.\u0027 Burrell, who served as a footman to the Queen before becoming Diana\u0027s butler until her death in 1997, had told Daily MailTV that \u0027Sandringham is Downton Abbey on speed\u0027 and that it would be a Christmas \u0027full of egos\u0027, where she should stay close to Harry and the Queen - because other royals will be out to get her, setting \u0027traps\u0027.It comes after he prepped Diana when she first came into the family, by advising her to also get plenty of face to face chats the Queen, with the best time being \u0027when she\u0027s at her card table, where she will sit and play Bridge or Canasta and she\u0027ll ask people to join her.\u0027He says that Meghan\u0027s own family troubles – with her father Thomas Sr taking part in staged paparazzi photos and with her half-sister Samantha\u0027s publicity-hungry outbursts – could be nothing compared to what will hit her when she travels up to the family\u0027s country estate in Norfolk for four days from Christmas Eve."},{"url":null,"title":"Meghans father prepares lonely Christmas Mexican hideaway","story":"    Christmas without Meghan: Thomas Markle Jr. spent the run-up to the holiday at his Rosarito, Mexico, home.

I\u0027m not sure why it\u0027s happening. I love my daughter very much. I wish she would reach out, send me a text, anything. There has to be a place for me. I\u0027m her father\u0027.And in a message of reconciliation for his estranged daughter, who is believed to be around five months pregnant, Markle Sr. stared down the camera and said: \u0027I love you very much. I would like to hear from you. Whatever difficulties we\u0027ve had I hope we can work through them. We\u0027re family.\u0027He said of the Queen, his daughter\u0027s grandmother-in-law: \u0027I would be grateful for anything she can do.\u0027I would think she would want to resolve any family problems. All families, royal or not, need to be together, especially in the holidays.\u0027He may find some encouragement in the Queen\u0027s annual Christmas message which is broadcast in the UK and around the world and sees her speaking from Sandringham. This year she will say: \u0027Even with the most deeply held differences, treating the other person with respect and as a fellow human being is always a good first step towards greater understanding.\u0027The message is understood to refer to Britain\u0027s  troubled political landscape and ision over Brexit, the process of the country leaving the European Union, but appear likely to be well received by Meghan\u0027s father.In his interview with Piers Morgan, he had said the rift \u0027can\u0027t continue forever\u0027 and he would keep trying to connect with his daughter.He went on: \u0027I don\u0027t plan to be silent for the rest of my life.

They don\u0027t really get on.\u0027By early next year the two women and their husbands will no longer be neighbors at Kensington Palace in west London, with Meghan and Harry instead moving to Frogmore Cottage in Windsor, where they are expected to welcome their first child in April.The two brothers will also not be spending Christmas under the same roof, with Prince William and his family coming to Sandringham from their nearby home, Anmer Hall, for the celebrations.          Are you listening Meghan? The Queen\u0027s message from Sandringham will this year focus on reconciliation, a message the Duchess of Sussex\u0027s father may welcome but which is understood to be prompted by the political fallout from Brexit           The way they were:  Meghan Markle, then Prince Harry\u0027s fianceé, spent her first Christmas at Sandringham in 2017, walking to church with Prince Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. This year the two women\u0027s body language will be carefully watched for evidence of tensionDuring the day Meghan will be expected to take part in party games along with other members of the royal family and sit down for a Christmas dinner where the seating plan will be carefully organized to avoid any tensions surfacing.On Wednesday - a national holiday in the UK known as Boxing Day - much of the royal family will go hunting.Prince Harry will be watched carefully amid claims that he had agreed not to hunt because of his wife\u0027s opposition to the sport.One fact known in advance of the royal Christmas is that Meghan\u0027s mother, Doria Ragland, will not be there.She has turned down an invitation to join the royal family which was issued after she bonded with both the Queen and Prince Charles at her daughter\u0027s wedding, where she was the only family member present from Meghan\u0027s side.Instead the yoga teacher and social worker is expected to spend the holiday with friends in Los Angeles.She and Meghan remain close and there has been speculation that she will spend significantly more time in the UK when she becomes a grandmother for the first time.Thomas Markle Sr. is already a grandfather of five, all of them grown up.His son Thomas Jr. has two children with his ex-wife Tracy Dooley - Thomas and Tyler Dooley - but is estranged himself from both of them.And Samantha is twice-orced, with three children - daughters Ashleigh Hale, 32, and Noelle Rasmussen, 19, and son Christopher Hale, 33.

The turn to a bear market would mark the end to the longest bull market for stocks in modern history after nearly 10 years.Stocks fell sharply Monday after President Donald Trump lashed out at the Federal Reserve for guiding interest rates higher, writing in a tweet that the central bank is \u0027like a powerful golfer who can\u0027t score because he has no touch - he can\u0027t putt!\u0027 Administration officials had spent the weekend trying to assure financial markets that Fed chairman Jerome Powell\u0027s job was safe.

Despite Wednesday\u0027s rally, stocks are on track for their worst December since 1931, during the depths of the Great Depression.\u0027This is a market that\u0027s heavily oversold, and typically you expect a strong bounce following that,\u0027 Krosby said. \u0027Oil prices have just moved quite markedly. And retail is having a very strong holiday season.\u0027The lackluster finish to 2018 comes as most economists expect growth to slow in 2019, though not by enough to slide into a full-blown recession. Many economic barometers still look encouraging. Unemployment is at 3.7 per cent, the lowest since 1969. Inflation is tame. Pay growth has picked up. Consumers boosted their spending this holiday season.

Today’s pampered young snowflakes, who have apparently spent their entire lives being told they are brilliant, are unable to take criticism, he says. As a result, private schools which ‘don’t want to lose customers’ deliberately tone down their prose.And as report cards are filled with waffle, straightforward insults are now rarer than hen’s teeth. Even the time-honoured put-down ‘must try harder’ is slipping out of use.

Michael had even suggested a title which, Paul and I agreed on the way down, wasn’t that hot, but seeing he had been so accommodating, it might be best to go with it.

While other programmes set out to portray the ups and downs of showbusiness, we can safely claim that in 29 years we did not portray one up.

It alleged protesters have called children on ponies ‘murderers’, trespassed on private land and wrecked riders’ cars.In ongoing clashes, a female anti-hunt activist was airlifted to hospital on December 16 after suffering an alleged ‘unprovoked attack’ by members of the Eggesford Hunt in Devon.Earlier this month a hunt saboteur’s car was attacked with a hammer in Leicestershire while a farmer dumped a tractor-load of manure on a van full of activists in Staffordshire.Activists claim hunts flout the 2004 ban by pretending to lay false scents – in a practice known as trail hunting – only to set hounds on real foxes. Chris Pitt, of the League Against Cruel Sports, said: ‘The hunts are behaving as they did before the fox hunting ban was introduced, killing thousands of foxes and sadly getting away with their brutal and barbaric “sport”.A spokesman for the Countryside Alliance said: ‘Hunts comply with the Hunting Act 2004.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"The devious methods parents use choice school","story":"    Parents have been trying to use various excuses to get their children into their preferred school, picture posed by model          Parents are anxious to get their children into schools which offer greater opportunities This academic year, parents submitted 4,600 applications to schools in 60 local authorities using the special considerations criteria.

He falls in love, marries her, they have a glass child. At meals, he marvels, watching the food travel through their bodies. When he holds her he does so gently, and not just because he must. A quirk of nature – that lightning striking sand can make glass – becomes an inspired vehicle for preoccupations that recur throughout Gay’s work: that love means not being seen through, but seen, and heard for yourself that bodies are both breakable and a possible source of redemption.Gay’s stories often take the form of fable although, on her first visit to London, she is quick to reject that as any appeal to universality. “In fact, it’s the opposite,” she says. “As a black woman, as a black queer woman, specificity is incredibly important, because erse experiences are rarely seen in literature.” She agrees that fairytale “informs all of my fiction work” – there is the woman married to an identical twin whose brother takes turns coming to her bed in the belief she doesn’t notice, or the woman who is also a knife, or the miner so despairing of his life underground that he projects himself into the sun and puts it out – “because in the original fairytales there’s oftentimes a lot of suffering before you get to any kind of resolution or solace”. But details ground the stories, in the rural midwest, for example, or a gated community in Florida, or a strip club in Baltimore. “What we tend to forget is that we all deal with a lot of the same things,” she says. “We all deal with complicated relationships, with children, with the loss of children, with love and suffering. We have a lot in common, and I do think literature allows us to have some sort of shared empathy.”Since Gay arrived in London she has appeared at the Royal Festival Hall in front of an audience of 1,800 and tweeted her first impressions of the city to her 539,000 Twitter followers. “Still buzzing from seeing Roxane Gay speak last night at @southbankcentre,” one fan tweeted. “She has a unique capacity to be inspirational yet completely relatable. I am thankful for her.” They are drawn by her voice – direct, often funny, sometimes angry, always thoughtful – and her radical candidness about her own life and struggles, on display in her breakthrough collection of essays, Bad Feminist, as well as her memoir, Hunger, and her fiction. And they come out to bat for her when she feels impugned, especially by the press – so much so that they feel like invisible, judging witnesses to our conversation, conducted at the flashy riverfront offices of Gay’s UK publisher.Meeting her is thus already overdetermined, and made more complicated by a presence that seems, on this cold bright morning, not much like the writing voice: Gay makes little eye contact. She waits for the tape to be turned on and answers questions dutifully. At the same time I know, from Twitter, that jetlag and newness have caused two days of insomnia. And I should have been prepared, from her writing, for the frequent split between a disembodied freedom on the page and an unease in the world the way in which her fame and imposing 1.9 metres (6ft 3in) frame are undercut, as she put it in a recent essay about her decision to have weight-loss surgery, by the fact that “the moment I step outside the safety of my home, I hate how visible I am, how people treat me, how they stare and comment both loudly and under their breath … I do not know how to carry myself with confidence when I go out into the world. Any sense of self I have is often shattered within minutes, and then I am all insecurities and fears, wishing myself into a more socially acceptable form.”Gay is the oldest of three children born to Haitian parents who arrived in the US when they were still in their teens. “Everything good and strong about me starts with my parents,” as Gay puts it in Hunger, her 2017 “Memoir of (My) Body”. Her father was a successful and eventually very well off civil engineer, and her mother a home-maker. They moved a lot for his work, but spent summers in Haiti, and the stories in Gay’s first collection, Ayiti (2011), are drenched both in a physical sense of that country, and of the small humiliations of recent immigrants. Gay had written stories since she was tiny, drawing villages on napkins and describing the inhabitants she read and read – Little House on the Prairie, Nancy Drew and Sweet Valley High stories. She was “respectful, studious, hardworking”. They went to church, she excelled at school. She was a good Haitian daughter.Gay is fascinating on the “goodness” of girls – as a societal requirement, as an often impossible standard on how often being good is a matter of being “one who knows how to play by the rules and cares to be seen to be playing by the rules” who knows how to be liked. (Philip Roth novels? Lauded, yet full of unlikable men, she has written. Woe betide the female novelist who tries the same thing.) Above all, on goodness as vulnerability, not least because she knows, in the most visceral way possible, what that can mean. One day, when she was 12, a handsome classmate took her on a bike ride to an abandoned shack in the woods where a pack of other boys, fuelled by drink, were waiting. “There is a before and an after,” she writes, in Hunger. “In the after I was broken, shattered, and silent.”She returned home, where she performed “good”, but could not shut the experience away. In high school, she says now, “I wrote a series of truly insane stories. Always about young girls being violated in terrible ways. It was a cry for help.” Thankfully, she was heard by a teacher who both encouraged her to keep writing and walked her over to a counsellor. The experience still comes out in her stories, her essays, in her bestselling 2014 novel, An Untamed State vulnerabilities and terrible violations played through different scenarios, with different endings: husbands gentle, loving, preternaturally understanding perpetrators found and jailed (which did not happen for her).She got into nearly every Ivy League college she applied for (and cried, overhearing her acceptance at Yale instantly dismissed by a classmate as affirmative action). She was also eating, compulsively, defending herself by building her body into an impregnable fortress that at its largest, she says in Hunger, weighed 577lbs (262kg). After a year she dropped out of Yale, unable to cope. She had met an older man on the internet, and went to be with him. For a year, until her parents tracked her down, she supported herself, working with other “lost girls” on phone sex lines, finding a community that accepted and understood her, beginning to blog, in those very early days of the internet. She was beginning, too, the long discovery that would sustain her, that “through writing, I was, finally, able to get respect for the content of my character”.It is hard to read the abuse Gay gets for her size. If there is anything useful in the experience it is, she has said, in the way it engenders empathy, for other lives, for difficult lives, for different lives. Reading, she says now, does the same – fiction mostly, but also non-fiction, “because you just think, ‘Oh my gosh, imagine if that were my life, imagine if that were my children, how would I feel?’ A lot of times when we see narrow-mindedness, when we see racism, when we see xenophobia, these are people who are not well read.” Perhaps we could prescribe fiction classes – “that would be great – give each and every racist in the world a syllabus. Beloved by Toni Morrison. Tony Judt on world war two.” As for herself, “I read everything. The No 1 thing I tell my students” – until this autumn, when she announced she was quitting, she taught at Purdue University, Indiana – “is read ersely. And I’m not talking about demographics, though that’s part of it. Aesthetic ersity, genre ersity. It matters because it just makes us better informed, and it protects us from our worst instincts.”She reserves a particular ire for those who read only literary fiction. “Oh, but it exactly applies to them. Anybody who tells me, ‘I only read literary fiction,’ I’m just like, ‘Well, you’re an asshole. What are we going to talk about?’ Literary fiction – a lot of it’s not that good! I read good books. And they may not be the best written, but they tell a really good story. My favourite thing to read is spy thrillers, which I just love. I also read romance novels, because they are fun, and they are sweet, and they’ve got a happy ending, most of the time. The world is shit, so – I need that happy ending.”When it comes to literary writers, Gay is drawn to those who have an acute social eye – Edith Wharton in The House of Mirth, Alice Walker’s Possessing the Secret of Joy (“It’s not a perfect novel, but it’s a perfect political novel, and it just showed me what you can accomplish with fiction”), Zadie Smith’s NW. Gay writes the way she reads, she says, deliberately moving from genre to genre – short stories, a novel, essays, Marvel comics, movies and TV (she is adapting stories from Difficult Women for a TV anthology, and one has been optioned for a feature film). It is a concerted and self-aware bid not to be pigeonholed in any way.Not that it stops people from trying. Having written difficult, revealing things about herself, Gay largely refuses to discuss them further in interviews. “We rarely see men, even when they write memoir, having to bare themselves even further to get attention,” she says. Nor are they assumed to be an authority only on the self. “When a lot of women try to write straight non-fiction, people say: ‘Where’s the personal? Why aren’t you putting yourself into it?’” She is wonderfully cutting in Ayiti about the ways in which western readers insist on reading only through race, or background, requiring of writers from elsewhere a representation (of entire countries, or classes of people) that would never be required of a white man – and at the same time refusing to see them as capable of anything beyond that. “Yeah. People tend to have a very singular narrative of who someone is, and so people of colour, women of colour, queer people, are only expected to write about identity-based things, and the struggles of that identity. And when you write a narrative that challenges people’s expectations of who you are and your subject’s position, then all of a sudden they get confused and think, ‘This isn’t realistic,’ because they don’t understand that we contain multitudes.”She rejects the very phrase “identity politics”: “It’s used like a weapon. What it means is, ‘I don’t want to think about your concerns. I don’t want to have to extend my empathy.’” Instead, she argues, everyone, on all sides, has to try to understand and accept complication, fight against dichotomies, essentialism. “We have to think with nuance, and unfortunately public discourse rarely allows for nuance. And see where that has gotten us.”If she rejects a responsibility to represent, she does take, very seriously, a responsibility to make opportunities for others like her. “Because oftentimes I’m the first or the only – so I cannot be the last.” So she invites younger, up-and-coming writers on stage with her, or writes “specific things into my contracts, like you have to hire a black publicist. To make sure that publishing houses start to ersify.”• To order Roxane Gay’s Ayiti for £11.43 (RRP £12.99, Corsair) or Hunger for £7.91 (RRP £8.99, Corsair) go to bookshop or call 0330 333 6846.

They felt this lack particularly keenly in his 2016 Man Booker-shortlisted novel-in-short-stories, All That Man Is, which moved through the stages of nine different men’s lives, the gulf between their alpha-male aspirations and daily reality experienced variously as outrage, sorrow and cosmic alienation. As European men, they were told the world belonged to them: instead they found themselves knocked off course by shyness, by loss of status, by the humiliating grind of hard graft or old age. From a teenage InterRailer to his fading grandfather, across Europe via hotels and motorways, budget airlines and cruise ships, Szalay patiently built up a brilliantly unsparing portrait of masculinity and its dark shadow, misogyny.This new 12-story cycle, Turbulence, stretches its horizons to encompass the entire globe, as well as the female perspectives rigorously excluded from his previous book. Putting a girdle round the Earth in just 130-odd pages, it’s inevitably a much leaner work, written in a brisk, authoritative past tense rather than a layered and shifting present. Neatly organised as a series of plane journeys in which the narrative focus is passed between a dozen different characters, it begins and ends in London with a stifled fiftysomething Englishman awaiting the results of his cancer treatment. “Ironic, mocking and evasive”, Jamie is a familiar Szalay character, forced at last to accept his daughter’s insistence that “some things are serious. Which is frightening.” In between we spend time with a Senegalese businessman, an Indian caretaker living in Qatar and a Hong Kong academic, among others.In the opening piece, “LGW-MAD”, Jamie’s expat mother returns to Spain once his radiotherapy is over. Rocked by the realisation that her son might die – “She still thought of him as someone young” – she smothers her habitual fear of flying with bloody marys at the airport. Szalay deftly sketches in the tedious everyday miracle of air travel, from the “snaking security queue” to that “profoundly surprising moment” when the plane’s nose lifts. And then comes turbulence that, in a figure of the book’s larger upheavals, “ended the illusion of security ... made it impossible to pretend that she was somewhere safe”.Next, in “MAD-DSS”, the stranger who was sitting next to her continues his journey home to Dakar, where, in a story ringing with alarm, he idles in traffic, wondering why his driver is behaving so oddly. Then, in “DSS-GRU”, a pilot flying freight to Brazil has a tentative, fleeting encounter with a woman he finds on a dating app. As the book progresses, each story refracts and contextualises the one before, revealing the double life of a migrant worker or the family history of a man who is furious with his brother. It highlights those hinges in time where life is changed irreversibly: a childhood bereavement or a troubled birth, when an eager new grandparent finds herself “very aware of her failure to be equal to the needs of this moment”.There’s not an ounce of fat to be found, as decades of emotion hang in the spaces between the short, declarative sentences: “‘That must have been hard on your parents,’ the captain said. Werner said that it was.” The writing is permeated by a kind of unanswerable understatement, as with the 60-year-old academic torn between a sudden new love and mourning for her fractured marriage: “There was a feeling, apart from anything else, that it was late in the day for this sort of thing. There was also a feeling of desolation.” As the stories operate through plot ironies and the sudden illumination of character, this radical simplicity of style means that they offer up most of their pleasures on first reading (or listening: they were written for radio).What Szalay does so well is the minute-by-minute apprehension of the close-up world, what he calls “the tightly packed fabric of reality”, combined here with an impressively global vision. We may live on a planet that has shrunk sufficently to enable golfing weekends in Vietnam, but at the same time air travel reminds us of what “insignificant specks” we are – the “quantity of emptiness” all around our atomised selves.In the final story, Jamie’s daughter sees in his cramped toilet, alongside a stack of old magazines undisturbed since her childhood, a framed quote from John F Kennedy’s 1963 “peace speech”: “For, in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children’s future. And we are all mortal.” It could be read as an inspirational mission statement for the collection, or a brutal irony. It’s part of Szalay’s genius that he can encompass the distance between the two.• Turbulence is published by Jonathan Cape. To order a copy for £8.79 (RRP £9.99) go to bookshop or call 0330 333 6846.

But despite evidence that the US economy remains robust, this year could still mark the first bear market in close to a decade.With just four more trading days to go until the end of the year, investors are expecting a bumpy ride.Much of the headwinds have come out of Washington. On Christmas Eve Trump tweeted: “The only problem our economy has is the Fed. They don’t have a feel for the Market, they don’t understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders. The Fed is like a powerful golfer who can’t score because he has no touch - he can’t putt!”The latest attack contributed to Monday’s sell-off and came as economists wrestled with a government shutdown, sparked by Trump’s attempts to fund his border wall with Mexico. That shutdown is now in its fifth day with no signs of a resolution.Trump has since tried to walk back his criticism of the Fed, telling reporters at the White House on Tuesday that while the Fed was “raising interest rates too fast” he still had confidence in the central bank. “I mean, the fact is that the economy is doing so well that they raised interest rates and that is a form of safety in a way,” he said.Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York, told Reuters that he expected markets to continue to rally as investors looked for bargains. But he warned there was probably more volatility ahead. “The ‘bear grip’ is feeding on itself as Trump continues to spread uneasiness,” said Cardillo."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c5e95c18a593c5390c8655cf633c8cacf8f72ba/0_323_5030_3018/master/5030.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67017ee8c68525bb00f46dbe5dee5ce6","title":"gatwick airport sold to french group","story":"A controlling stake in Gatwick, the UK’s second-biggest airport, is being sold to the French group Vinci Airports for £2.9bn.Gatwick, the eighth-busiest in Europe by passenger numbers, was heavily disrupted in the runup to Christmas after drone sightings closed its runway, affecting more than 100,000 passengers. The airport resumed flights on Friday and has invested £5m in a range of anti-drone technologies over the past few days. Gatwick said there was no single commercial solution available for the type of drone activity seen last week.Gatwick will be the largest in Vinci’s portfolio of 46 airports spread across 12 countries. The French group’s network includes Lyon-Saint-Exupéry Airport, Nantes Atlantique and Grenoble Alpes Isère in France Lisbon, Porto and Funchal in Portugal, and Osaka Itami and Kansai International in Japan.Gatwick’s chairman, Sir David Higgins, said the deal was a “vote of confidence in Gatwick and its future potential”. He will stay on, along with the chief executive, Stewart Wingate, who said there would be no changes to the immediate running of the airport. Gatwick employs about 3,000 people and the deal is not expected to have any impact on jobs.GIP partner Michael McGhee said: “We expect the transaction to be completed by the middle of next year, with the senior leadership team remaining in place.“Their focus, along with everyone at Gatwick, obviously remains on doing their very best for customers over the busy holiday period after the challenges of recent days.”Vinci’s president, Nicolas Notebaert, said: “As Gatwick’s new industrial partner, Vinci Airports will support and encourage growth of traffic, operational efficiency and leverage its international expertise in the development of commercial activities to further improve passenger satisfaction and experience.”Gatwick operates the busiest single runway in the world and serves 228 destinations in 74 countries. The airport’s new owner vowed to push ahead with a planned 15-year investment programme. The airport handles about 46m passengers a year, up from 32m at the time of its previous sale. A decade ago, BAA, owned by the Spanish infrastructure group Ferrovial, was ordered by the Competition commission to sell Gatwick amid concerns over its dominance of the airport market. The deal ended BAA’s four-decade long monopoly over the capital’s major airports.Gatwick reported revenues of £764.2m for the year to 31 March, and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of £411.2m."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26d6c9e53be27fdff9dcbabb6fc9a9d6b3d169c7/0_263_7890_4734/master/7890.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea67c5c661482b3c6bc1de000b158b2f","title":"peter tuchman rollercoaster ride is written on wall sts most famous face","story":"His photograph on the floor of the New York stock exchange captured the panic of the financial crisis. Now he is almost the institution’s mascot but he insists that traders like him are still essential to the market“Hey Tucky!” shouts a trader as Peter Tuchman zips towards the floor of the New York stock exchange. “Where are we?” barks Tuchman. “Down,” comes the reply. Tuchman gives an expressive shrug and marches on.Everyone at the NYSE knows Peter Tuchman, and so do you. You may not know his name but he’s that guy – the one who looks like Albert Einstein, whose mug pops up every time the world’s media covers the financial markets. Throwing his hands up in horror or covering his mouth in shock when the markets crash, clicking his hands above his head flamenco-style or jumping for joy like a real-life Muppet as markets hit new highs.Like most celebrities in real life, Tuchman is smaller than he looks. Twin clouds of white hair, echoed by snowy facial fuzz, frame a bald pate that slopes gently down to expressive eyes on a face that seems perpetually in motion, as are his hands and feet. Tuchman is a human emoji, a one-man metaphor for the mood of the market. But don’t be fooled by the clowning – Tuchman is a cool cat. What you are seeing is not necessarily what he is thinking.Tuchman, 60, came late to fame. The born-and-bred New Yorker had already been working on the floor of the NYSE for some 20 years when he first made the front pages. It was 2007 and the financial crisis was dominating the news cycle. On another day of wild swings Tuchman, snapped mouth agog, appeared on the front of the New York Post. “I had just received the bill for my son’s barmitzvah and it was way more money than I anticipated,” jokes Tuchman.The photo went viral and sparked a trend that has continued to this day. “The cameras sort of went towards me and it just sort of took off on its own,” he says. “Photographers noticed that if they took a picture of me, it would end up in the paper.”He’s appeared on thousands of front pages, in news reports in the UK, China, Japan. Tuchman gets recognized when he travels on the subway. “It’s crazy,” he says.After the recession stock markets hit the doldrums and Tuchman’s picture count dropped. Now he’s back. Under Donald Trump stock markets have hit new highs and volatility is back with tweets, trade rows and reconciliations and Trump’s attacks on the Federal Reserve sending markets into a tizzy.On the day we meet the Dow lost close to 800 points as Trump declared he was “a Tariff Man” – signalling another downturn in China’s tense trade relations with the US and up popped pictures of Tuchman on CNN and other outlets. In the short term Tuchman expects more wild days but he’s bullish about the future. “The fundamentals haven’t changed,” he says.Tuchman moves fast, snatching bits of conversation with his co-workers as he whizzes around the floor. Flouting the NYSE dress code, Tuchman slips into a pair of New Balance sneakers before hitting the trading floor. The night before he had warned me and the photographer to adhere to the NYSE’s formal dress code, so why is he different? “’Cos I’m special. After 30 years you get to wear sneakers,” he laughs.Rules bend for Tuchman. He loves the New York stock exchange and they love him he’s basically the exchange’s mascot these days. There are Tuchman dolls, he has his own range of stickers and hats, he has organized an exhibition of street art – one of his passions – on one of the exchange’s most storied floors.“How do you become happy? Do what you love to do,” he says.Tuchman started on the NYSE in 1985 as a teletypist and worked his way up to being an independent broker. His father, a doctor, had a patient who ran a firm on the floor. “I loved business and I loved the environment … the frantic screaming and yelling. That’s my nature right. I thrive on chaos.”But while he may look like he’s taking each day’s losses and wins personally, he doesn’t take the job home with him – or at least he tries not to.His sangfroid, Tuchman says, comes from his parents. Marcel and Shoshana Tuchman were Holocaust survivors who were imprisoned in Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen. “My father was a slave laborer for Siemens Corporation, which is still a public company here,” he says, nodding ruefully at the trading floor.Marcel Tuchman, who worked until he was 93 teaching medicine, died earlier this month aged 97. His son was back at work the next day. “My father always said: ‘When I die, cry and go to work.’ That was his advice.”Tuchman says one of his father’s biggest regrets was the loss of the “humanist factor” in medicine. The swapping of the human touch for machines and data as opposed to “holding the patient’s hand and saying: ‘How are you feeling?’ It’s the same thing here for me, it’s, you know, that human thing.”That’s the irony of Tuchman’s celebrity. It comes as the human factor is disappearing from trading. Stock markets such as Nasdaq don’t have traders like Tuchman. Even most of NYSE’s stock trading is done from a far less photogenic data centre in New Jersey. Critics have dismissed the traders who remain as marketing and “a bunch of clapping seals”, which would make Tuchman the prince of the colony. Is he just the human face the NYSE wants to present in an increasingly robotic world?Tuchman could not disagree more. When panic hits the market, humans add a “restraint of time and an impulse”, he says, that algorithms cannot replicate. Like a plane on automatic pilot, Tuchman argues, everyone is happy to leave the computers in charges until the flight hits turbulence. Then you want the pilot in charge.“I don’t think algorithms will fully replace humans at NYSE,” he says. “The more we rely on technology, the more important it becomes to have humans involved.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d551192a480495d12a2a9994ab3920e8cc95305/0_96_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01033aafabfd2171da83fb288a77441d","title":"the location is a character where cinema meets the city","story":"Writer and movie buff Christopher Moloney juxtaposes classic film scenes with their locations as they are todayLingering at the window display of Tiffany \u0026amp Co on Fifth Avenue.

Alexander Payne really loves Nebraska. John Hughes loves Chicago.“It’s really more about the movies for me. It still puts a smile on my face to see a scene I’ve loved ‘come to life’.”The execution is striking in its simplicity. “Either I’m watching a movie or television show, recognise a location and print off a picture, or I walk past something that I recognise from a movie and go back later.” Moloney uses the camera on his iPod Touch. “I am not a technical person. Just to show you how long I’ve been doing it – my first photos were done with my Blackberry.”He came to Instagram as @moloknee after his shots highlighting film locations in New York City on his film photo website Filmography caught the attention of Vogue. “They asked me for the link to my Instagram and I was like, ‘My what now?’, and started one.” Now he posts to Instagram first, “retiring” them on his site a few days later.Whenever he goes to a new city, he researches what films were shot there – but sometimes they find him. Moloney grew up near Toronto, lived for nearly 15 years in New York City and is now based in Atlanta, known as the Hollywood of the south for its lucrative tax breaks for the entertainment industry. “It’s exciting for me to realise that a street or building I’ve passed for years was the location of a movie and I never realised it,” he says. “It happens a lot in those places.” Cities brings together the best in urban photography on Instagram at @cities.

Hoa Hakananai’a, as it is known, meaning “lost or stolen friend”, is a looming and powerful presence. On its back it bears a carving of a winged figure, witness to the complex history of the object – over time the religion of the islanders changed, and they began to honour “birdmen” instead of the great carved ancestor figures.Later, Hoa Hakananai’a was collected, under circumstances that the British Museum website does not make entirely plain, by Richard Ashmore Powell, commander of the British navy frigate HMS Topaze. It was then given to Queen Victoria, from whom it came to the museum. This autumn, Tarita Alarcón Rapu, the governor of Rapa Nui, made a tearful request for the sculpture’s return. “We are just a body. You, the British people, have our soul,” she said. What was less publicised was the fact that the governor was there at the invitation of the British Museum and that meetings will continue in 2019 in Rapa Nui.Such stories appear regularly in the press, and always have done. Indeed, the history of imperial powers helping themselves by fair means or foul to precious artefacts goes back at least to the Roman empire. Greece’s temples were stripped of their ritual objects by their Roman conquerors. Transferred to the villas of the wealthy, these sculptures became aestheticised into something else: “art”, the status symbols of collectors.Such news stories will arrive with ever more intensity in 2019 and the years to come. Calls to restitute cultural property, like calls to topple Rhodes, decolonise university curricula, or stop cultural appropriation, are part of a wider societal trend that can be placed under the heading of identity politics. And, like identity politics, demands for restitution are not going away. Both for ethical and pragmatic reasons, they must be taken seriously.The debate about cultural restitution has been stirred up in the past month by a report commissioned by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, as the direct result of a speech he made last year in Ouagadougou declaring that the restitution of African heritage to Africa would be a “top priority”. The radical and forthright report, by the scholars Bénédicte Savoy and Felwine Sarr, has had a mixed response. Some have welcomed the authors’ conclusion that all objects collected under colonial conditions ought to be restored unless evidence can be provided that they were collected legitimately – reversing the burden of proof so that it is borne by the former colonial power rather than the former colonies. Many have applauded the clarity with which Professor Savoy and Professor Sarr have described the long-term effects of the appropriation of artefacts. The removal of cultural property not only affects the generation from whom it is taken, they write, “it becomes inscribed throughout the long duration of societies, conditioning the flourishing of certain societies while simultaneously continuing to weaken others”.The report has received a less hearty welcome among the museum directors of northern Europe, however. Some point out that it was commissioned not from a sense of responsibility by Mr Macron but as a means of furthering his nation’s interests in sub-Saharan Africa (the report, indeed, limits itself to that region, excluding former French colonies in north Africa and elsewhere). Others say that the blanket assertion that any and all acquisitions for museums made under colonial conditions are wrong is a gross simplification. Items entered museum collections for all kinds of reasons, they argue. These range from cases of obvious looting (as in the example of the Benin bronzes taken in the 1890s by European troops from the royal palace in Benin City) to items that were perfectly legitimately traded, or indeed freely given. They say that the report gives little or no attention to the real-world, on-the-ground cooperation between museum professionals in northern Europe and their colleagues in other parts of the world.All of this is sensible. At worst, however, western museum professionals can convey the notion – even if it is not uttered out loud – that objects are somehow “better off” in Paris, London or Berlin than elsewhere, where they can, according to this unspoken assumption, be properly cared for and admired. It is unhelpful that major museum directors in this context remain almost invariably white men of similar background and education – an “all-male choir”, as one African commentator has put it.Disputes over cultural property cannot be seen in isolation. They must be taken together with an understanding that the imperial past is not dead but is a set of narratives that are still alive, still unresolved, and still bringing real-world consequences. In the end, resolving ownership of artefacts is one part of a broader project: that of former imperial powers finding the language to deal properly with the dark periods of their history. In Britain, this work is urgent, and it has barely begun.There is no point pretending that there are simple blanket rules, or simple possible answers. It is a meaningless absurdity to suggest that all objects held in museums should be returned to their point of origin in most cases it would be impossible as well as undesirable (think of those Greek sculptures acquired by Roman conquerors now in Italian museums). To suggest that none may go is equally absurd: there are thousands of objects scattered through Britain alone, and very few are subject to restitution claims – there is no immediate danger of après moi le déluge. Equally, this is not a question only for national museums but significantly, in Britain, for regional collections and university museums such as Glasgow’s Hunterian and Oxford’s Pitt Rivers.There can be no resolution without knowledge. This is not glamorous, nor is it cheap it is the slow, arduous work of provenance research, and museums must be equipped and resourced to undertake it. History, memory and dignity must to be restored to artefacts. Better, deeper stories need to be told to the public the archive needs to be enriched. Where items are found to have been acquired wrongfully, restitution must follow. Museums lie at the root of these difficult and painful disputes over memory they are also the places best able, in the end, to resolve them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/898fcf68abbb21b5685df2bd819ebf8c02438b4a/0_67_4301_2582/master/4301.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cdc7098379f4ad9a1e4edcea53b589ae","title":"its gods plan the man who dreams of bringing intensive chicken farming to africa","story":"A US mega-farm, a Christian backer and Africa’s oldest industrial chicken producer are bringing the world’s super birds to reform central Africa’s food market and feed the poorOn the evening of 7 August 2018, a KLM charter flight left Amsterdam, landing 11 hours later at Kilimanjaro airport in northern Tanzania. Its young occupants were nodded through immigration and driven 50 miles to their new home, close to some of Africa’s most famous game parks.These were no tourists hoping to see lions in the nearby Serengeti. The 2,320 little cockerels and 17,208 hens on the plane were a flock of European-bred pedigree Cobb 500 chickens, the world’s most popular breed. Their destination: a remote 200-hectare mega-farm under construction in the windy foothills of snow-capped Mount Kilimanjaro.Here, where wildlife and nomadic tribes have always roamed, Tyson, the world’s second-largest food company, has set up with Irvine’s, Africa’s oldest industrial chicken producer. With the backing of a devout Christian businessman, Donnie Smith, the three partners aim to revolutionise food production in central Africa and “save” people from hunger by growing chickens on an American scale. The little chicks and hens are the expeditionary force of an army of Cobb 500s to follow.Irvine’s $20m (£15m) parent stock laying eggs on the high plains below Mount Kilimanjaro is just the start. In a year’s time they expect to be sending 500,000 fertilised eggs a week to a sister hatchery on the Tanzanian coast, where millions of one-day-old chicks will be sold to local farmers. In a few years they could be rearing and exporting 40m or even 50m broilers a year to neighbouring Kenya, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other African countries.No one knows if they will flood the market and undermine local producers, or if they will improve food security in countries where millions of people regularly go hungry.But they should make money. There is an insatiable appetite for chicken meat in African cities, and only a handful of industrial farms across the continent competing with imports from the US, Europe or Brazil.Tyson sees central Africa as a promising new market. The corporate behemoth, which turns over $38bn (£30bn) a year, says it is “faith-friendly” and rooted in Christian values. It processes and sells about 11bn chickens a year worldwide, according to Bloomberg.And for Donnie Smith (below left), the genial former chief executive of Tyson, from Tennessee, the Kilimanjaro plant is “God’s plan”.Smith, who spent 35 years with Tyson, says he feels impelled by his faith to feed the world’s poor. He has already set up a small chicken charity in Rwanda that offers loans to small farmers to buy a few hundred birds. His mission now is to bring chickens to Africa on a grand scale.“I am a Christian. I feel a call to use my poultry background and put that to work. Poultry is the most efficient converter of feed to meat no religions are against eating poultry. If you want an impact on the poor, providing them with high-quality, affordable protein from chicken is the best way.The farm looks like aliens have landed. Planet Cobb sees giraffes on their way between national parks pass many low, 120 metre-long, 12 metre-wide, shiny white structures Maasai pastoralists in woven red shuka blankets drive their cattle over land dotted with steel masts, tanks and towers. The snows of Kilimanjaro glisten above the clouds.As happens all over Africa, many households in the few nearby villages keep chickens for eggs or to eat on occasional celebrations. But unlike the bright white Cobb 500s in their sealed sheds, these birds are scrawny, gaudy and all shapes and sizes. They look spectacular and taste strong.In contrast, the Cobbs are nature’s Arnie Schwarzeneggers – all jutting chests, rippling thighs, big feet and bland flesh. These meat machines have been highly bred for 100 years to grow fast, bulk up their breasts and to eat only small quantities of cheap soya and maize.Today, the Cobb 500 is an industrial marvel. A parent hen will lay on average 192 eggs in its short 15-month life, more than twice as many as any backyard bird and a young Cobb 500 broiler can grow from a day-old chick to a 2kg bird ready for the pot in just 33 days.The Cobb is now the chicken that ate the world, identically bred in 120 countries and the first choice of most of the world’s big poultry farmers and fast-food chains from McDonald’s to Wendy’s, KFC and Zaxby’s. No one has counted, but there are probably far more Cobb 500s alive than there are humans. The UN’s Food and Agriculture organisation (FAO) estimated in 2011 that there were 19bn chickens across the globe. Of those bred for their meat, nearly half are thought to be Cobbs. In the next few years chicken is expected to overtake pork and beef to become the world’s most popular meat. Cobb flesh by then could be in the diet of billions of people.“A broiler chicken’s bones cannot keep up with the explosive growth of its body.” He says that unnaturally large breasts may torque a chicken’s legs, causing lameness, ruptured tendons and twisted legs.But the Cobb 500 is the likely future of food. With scientists urging people to eat less meat to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Cobb broilers are proving to have the best carbon footprint of all land-based animals. According to one calculation, kilo for kilo, a broiler emits five times less CO2 equivalent than lamb, and is environmentally better than cheese.To get the best, soft white meat from a Cobb 500 you need more than genetics, says Enzo Faglioni, the young Brazilian vet who is Irvine’s breeder operation manager at the farm. “You must minutely control the birds’ environment. They must be as comfortable as possible at all times, and be treated like babies,” he says. “These birds live like kings and queens.”He accepts that commercial poultry farms have made welfare mistakes in the past, but says the lessons have been learned. No antibiotics are used unless there is an outbreak of illness, and no hormones are pumped into their feed.To go inside the sealed, dark, windowless Kilimanjaro chicken sheds you must shower twice, brush your teeth, wash your hair and wear special clothes. When the doors are opened, there are identical white chickens as far as the eye can see.It is only when you get down on floor level that the large Cobb cocks attack. Feet out, wings flapping and beaks thrusting, they come at you hard. It hurts and all you can do is yell and run.“We’re not there yet but we are making chicken more affordable. I don’t think that we will undermine other producers or traditional breeds. You will see two food systems running side by side.“I believe that chicken will become the most affordable, complex protein on the African continent. We know what the future is going to look like and this is it. We want to access the future in Africa because the need is so great.”Food security will be strengthened by improving the availability of broiler chicken products, confirms Anne Mottet, a livestock development officer for the FAO. But she emphasises the importance of small-scale operations. “Overall you want ersity of production sources. It’s more resilient than putting all your eggs in one basket. The more small-scale producers you have, the more resilient you are.”Is sub-Saharan Africa ready for unchecked corporate concentration and the pollution and potential animal welfare problems that have plagued broiler-chicken production in Europe and the US?Yes, says the Tanzanian government, which struggles to feed its fast-urbanising population and is a target for chicken imports from Europe and Brazil. Nearly a million people needed food aid in the country last year and Tanzania adds 1.6 million people a year. By 2035 its population will have grown by another 32 million. “Definitely we are ready,” says Rose Sweya (left), a young Dar es Salaam chicken farmer who is eager to buy thousands of Donnie’s day-old Cobbs to fatten up. She says she welcomes competition and that the demand for chicken is insatiable.“People desperately need protein and chicken is the best way to get it. The population is growing fast so the demand is rocketing. Eating chicken was rare when I grew up. It was seen as the food of high-class people. We had it for celebrations, and on special occasions like Christmas. For most people it is still quite rare,” she says.With British aid, her company, Kingchick, is investing heavily in four poultry farms and a processing plant. She expects to employ another 20 or more women and could be selling 2,000 Cobbs a week within a year.“There was always this mentality that frozen supermarket chicken was not good and that village chicken was best. But this is changing. ”Yet the arrival of the Cobbs is a mixed blessing for the villagers near the farm. It has provided well-paid work for some, but Maasai herders have complained that the farm’s high fences restrict their access to traditional pasture land. This, says Faglioni, has been resolved.“Industrial-scale farming goes hand in hand with development,” he says. “We are changing the way that people eat and how they see the world. People here are proud that they are producing safe food for the country. They have money and can buy better food. We are offering a better way of life for both chickens and people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e3d25447efc931930ed6e2793b4fca7ce83445a/0_241_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d98a9cbdee620fd014c59931d80d7c60","title":"feel like big rich baby my week comfort dressing","story":"Comfort is in fashion, with kimonos on the catwalk and cashmere jogging bottoms on the high street. But is it ever OK to wear your nightie to work?The designer Yves Saint Laurent once said that dressing is a way of life. In his view, clothes are not a mere accessory to life’s key moments, but integral to the moment itself. Fashion, then, is not just a hobby, but a methodology for living well. What Saint Laurent never made clear was whether this methodology can be applied to an ordinary, less fashionable life, where the best moments regularly include ordering a pizza from bed or hangover-crying to episodes of the Antiques Roadshow. But luckily, contemporary fashion has this covered with the current trend for comfort dressing.Broadly speaking, comfort clothes are the kind of thing that you already own. Think of the old jogging bottoms you wear around the house and might even pop to the corner shop in the stretched, bobbly jumper that your relatives mock but you can’t live without the oversized T-shirt you might lazily wear to your local but then fall face first into bed without removing. You have probably owned this style of clothing your whole life, but what is new is wearing it outside – and not just as a quiet trick you play hoping no one notices, but loud and proud. You’re comfy, and you want everyone to know about it.It is the logical next step of a sartorial period in which streetwear and sportswear fused to become “athleisure”, where going from the gym to anywhere was stylish. Now replace gym with “sofa” or “bed” and you’ve summed up this latest style iteration.There is more to say about this fashion moment. Could the prioritising of women’s comfort be described as feminist? Or is it simply the result of a dystopian tech nightmare, where so much of our life is lived online that “innerwear” – clothes for wearing in private – are now our de facto uniforms?Although I quite like the idea of everyone wearing their most relaxed clothes out in public with pride, the real test would be whether it is genuinely comfortable wearing pyjamas out in public or not, so I decided to find out.In theory, to achieve this look you can just wear items you feel happy hanging around your living room in. But in practice, comfort is a specific trend, and does not stretch to animal-print onesies or embarrassing tourist T-shirts. After consulting the ’s fashion desk, I get hold of an Asos pyjama-style shirt, along with a pair of Marks \u0026amp Spencer grey cashmere jogging bottoms and a jumper in the same shade. From my own wardrobe, I pick out a vintage oversized Mickey Mouse nightie a Japanese-inspired kimono gown and a pair of wide-leg plain black pyjama bottoms. I also want to find an oversized Lenny Kravitz-style blanket scarf, but settle on an actual blanket that previously belonged to my cat.On the first day of the experiment, I go with the nightie-kimono combo teamed with my baggiest, comfiest jeans and trainers. When I was first asked to write this article, I thought it would be a breeze. I am someone who does not know the meaning of dressing up: I am devoutly casual, and have been a fan of sportswear since my teenage years. But when I get to the door to leave my house, and the thought of being on the bus in my nightie becomes real, I chicken out. It feels wrong, which I realise is because I’d worn said nightie and gown as they were intended – as actual pyjamas – the night before. This is too extreme for even the most faithful of comfort-trend disciples: these clothes aren’t clean. Shoving them in the wash, I pop on the grey jumper and trouser combo that are so close in shade they look like a two-piece. It’s not every day you get to cover yourself top to toe in cashmere, and the close, sleepsuit fit makes me feel like a big rich baby. I love it.When I was growing up on an east London estate where people did genuinely wear their pyjamas outside, I was told that to get ahead I should dress smartly. It would incense me that at university, the posh kids could slip around in joggers, whereas if I did I’d bring myself to the attention of security staff at Boots. Yet, in my cashmere babygro, I don’t feel especially visible, just comfortable. There is safety in numbers, and I suppose as enough people are dressing this way, I needn’t worry as much.I am, however, much more visible at work. Not in a disciplinary way, more in an envious way. “You just look so comfy,” says a colleague as I walk past. “It feels so soft,” says another, stroking my arm. It is unclear if the clothes make me feel like it is a particularly relaxing day or if it actually is, but I am so chilled out that I fall asleep on the train home from work. Later, when I am lounging around my house, I am struck by how hot the outfit is. I become irritated and pull it off.The next morning, I put on my (now clean) nightie and kimono and head back to work. It is cold, so I keep the gown closed and enjoy the feel of silk against my skin. It is luxurious and genteel: I feel I could also wear a cravat and smoke a pipe.No one on the tube bats an eyelid. I receive no judgmental glances. No one mentions anything at the office, either. Eventually, after a bit of prompting, a colleague says: “Those jackets are in shops now. It just looks like one of those.” Fine.I turn it up a notch, undoing the gown to reveal Mickey as a wizard I am walking past desks slowly, flapping my kimono around in the hope that someone will notice. I ask someone’s opinion of my nightdress. “I don’t know. Looks retro. Just assumed it was some hipster, trendy thing.” This, I realise, is why my experiment may not produce substantial results. As a millennial working in the media, who already dresses informally, I am able to get away with a lot under a presumption of fashion. The real test would be someone with a smarter work dress code.The next day, I try out the black pyjama-style shirt – that is, a shirt with the trims of a silk pyjama top (piping around the collar and pocket). This design is made from a material that is closer to a suit jacket and would definitely not be worn to bed. Paired with my black pyjama bottoms, on first glance it does look like a set, but technically speaking could be worn to an important meeting. Again, no one says anything, but I notice a few curious glances. When quizzed, the only noteworthy comment is: “Isn’t wearing makeup cheating? I thought the look was straight out of bed?”For my final outfit, I want to test out the oversized blanket scarf (read: actual blanket). To give it the space it needs to be star of the show, I opt for the black pyjama bottoms and a black hoodie. The first thing to say is that wearing a blanket as a scarf – keeping it bunched up around the neck and shoulders – is actually pretty tough. You have to twist it up before it goes on and spend some time shaping it to get that just-thrown-on look. I wear it to Christmas drinks with friends, and aside from slowly dehydrating under all the layers, feel the confidence of a fashion insider. And at the cold bus stop, I am grateful for the full-bodied scarf. Why this has taken so long to catch on is beyond me.Saying that, it is a relief to be back to normal the next day, and I’m not sure if I will be wearing my comfort clothes to work again any time soon. It strikes me as a little pointless to change out of one pair of pyjamas into another, particularly if they are designed to look more comfortable than they actually are.The experiment has certainly made me think about the concept of comfort itself. To some, comfort is the feel of a certain material on the skin for others, comfort it is about invisibility and for others still, it is about being seen. I’m not sure which version is for me and suspect it changes daily depending on what sort of mood I am in.But mostly, it has made me think about how you can wear almost anything and be guaranteed a polite smile. “Back in your civvies, I see,” says my colleague who had previously claimed not to have noticed. “Shame, I was just getting used to that.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

My family never celebrated it. We put up our tree and opened our presents on New Year’s Eve, instead.But, when I was 10, in post-Soviet 1994, for Christmas, my family decided to take a pilgrimage to the tradition-laden Western Ukraine, a thousand kilometres away. We took a 16-hour train to get there, to discover our roots.We arrived to visit friends of friends on Christmas Eve. We were dropped off at a train station, in an outlandish location of dreams. For the first time, I saw a hill covered with a forest of Christmas trees with sparkling snow crystals.It was the mountainous area of the Carpathian Mountains.The friend of friends met us at the train station and said: “It’s not a long walk to the house, but there are no buses to take us there.” We said: “OK,” thinking it would take 10 minutes.Wrong. Little did we know, people who live in the Carpathians were used to walking or skiing everywhere. The “short walk” took an hour and a half in heavy snow.Exhausted, we finally arrived at a huge wooden house by a gushing brook, the sound of wolves howling in the distance. Inside, we were rewarded with a real traditional Ukrainian Christmas, full of colour. Guests wore beautifully made goat masks, violins were played and people were singing. The house was warm and cosy, with a roaring fire we stayed up by late into the night. We ate a traditional pescatarian feast: a mushroom borscht with wild mushroom-filled dumplings varenyky filled with potatoes and curd cheese local trout soft, yeasty buns called pyrizhky, filled with cabbage and prunes, and sweet ones filled with sweet poppyseed paste. It ended up being the most memorable Christmas of my life, and I long to recreate it.Stevie MartinWhile in most homes the giving and receiving of Christmas cards is a declining tradition, in our house – for my sister and I at least – it has evolved into a furiously fought competition. After the presents have been pored over while sat on my parents’ bed (I’m 30, my sister is 27, and we refuse to do it any other way), we give out Christmas cards. The rules are you can’t buy it from a shop, you have to make it yourself – and the loser has to make an extravagant breakfast.Gina, my sister, is an incredible artist. One year, she painted a picture of my parents. Another, she sketched an incredibly lifelike Father Christmas. Years ago, I figured out that I could win by making my parents laugh, seeing how little I could get away with. An A4 sheet of paper with a pine needle stuck on it using Sellotape above the words “HAPPY PINE-MAS”. Another year, I dribbled some gravy, drew a smiley face on it and dubbed the mess: “the gravy nativity”. Last year was blank, to represent the Holy Spirit.The only issue with this – apart from the fact that my cards get more traction than Gina’s, despite hers taking hours to create and mine taking roughly three minutes – is that I don’t know where to go after 2017’s blank card. It feels like I’ve reached the pinnacle of not caring. Do I give them no card? The world’s tiniest card? I suppose the only thing to do is go the other way – hire an artist and create an A0 canvas. Please pray for me – I’m terrible at making breakfast.Tom DugginsAs a vegetarian, Christmas sometimes feels like I’m under siege from otherwise well-intentioned friends and family who want to sneak meat into my food. If it’s not the yearly cry of “hang on, which gravy did we put the meat juices into?” (this tends to come mere seconds after covering my plate in the stuff), then there’s always the pleasure of arguing with my mum about whether the roast potatoes have to be cooked in goose fat or not. (No surprises on my position: olive oil and spuds go together like being vegetarian and only having one thing you can order on a menu.)That’s why, come 25 December, I like to focus on those parts of the traditional Christmas lunch that we can all get behind. Once the main course and pudding are all done with, there’s the vegetarian haven of the cheeseboard to look forward to.It’s like a culinary after-party taking place on your very own kitchen table. No one’s sneaking any sausage meat into the chutney or injecting pork grease into the soft cheeses and there’s no awkward discussion about who can have what, it’s just gorge time at the table and everyone’s invited.Christmas lunch tends to stress people out – getting the timings right is tough and there’s a lot of pressure overall. But with the cheese course, you’re ready to go in about five minutes: minimal effort for maximum satisfaction.Hayley CampbellAs far as I can tell, our only family Christmas tradition is pushing our oversized heads into too-small Christmas cracker hats until they split. We never wanted this tradition it was never planned. We have tried everything to get rid of it, short of having our skulls shrunk in questionable science experiments – such as balancing the hat on top of our spherical skulls and just not moving for the rest of the dinner, turning very slowly to address others at the table, the top of our bodies moving like Batman locked into his batsuit. But nothing works. The hats still split in two, or they topple into the gravy. It is an inevitability that we have given up dreading and merely succumbed to. If it’s just family at the table, we will turn the hats until the split is obvious, like a badge of big-headed honour. But we collectively fear work Christmas parties and being invited to Christmas dinner at other people’s houses. What if they make us put on the hats?Combining a creamy crumbly texture and mouth-watering garlic and herbs, Boursin is a welcome addition to any festive buffet – and a versatile soft cheese for your party season cooking, too.

This version is packed with flavour and can be pulled off in just 30 minutes. Dressed with butter, parmesan and crispy sage leaves, this is main course material, but it could easily be halved and served as a starter.To prepare, put the spinach in a large saucepan and pour over a kettle full of boiling water. Allow the spinach to wilt for 3 minutes, then drain. Press the spinach in a colander set over the sink, squeezing out the water. Once dry, roughly chop.Put the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat and add the garlic, cooking for 1 minute, until fragrant. Add the spinach with a generous amount of salt and black pepper, and cook for a further 2 minutes. Set aside to cool.In a large bowl, mix the Boursin with the egg. Add the spinach, stirring to combine, then add three-quarters of the breadcrumbs and mix well. Check the consistency – if it feels a little loose or sticky, add the rest of the breadcrumbs.Using your hands, shape the mix into pieces the size of ping-pong balls and put on a tray lined with greaseproof paper. Refrigerate while you fry the sage.In a small saucepan, heat 2cm of oil until shimmering. Add the sage leaves, frying for 30 seconds, until crisp. Drain on kitchen paper.Bring a large saucepan of salted water to the boil, then add the gnudi – you will need to do this in two batches, depending on the size of your pan. Cook for 2–3 minutes, until they float to the top. Remove from the water.Divide the gnudi between four plates, drizzle with the melted butter, scatter with the parmesan, sprinkle over the sage leaves, and finish with some black pepper.2 thick-cut pork loin chops1 lemon, halved2 sprigs lemon thyme, leaves pickedSalt and ground black pepperOlive oilFor the gratin:25g butter2 banana shallots, dicedSalt and ground black pepper1 garlic clove, halved250ml cream or whole milk150g garlic and herbs Boursin1 medium butternut squash, peeled and very thinly sliced50g gruyere, finely gratedFor something extra special, this wintry main is just the ticket. Here, Boursin has been added to the gratin sauce, creating a rich, savoury foil to the sweetness of the squash. The gratin is so good that it works just as well as a vegetarian main, served with a crisp green salad.To prepare, preheat the oven to 180Cgas mark 4 and rub the cut sides of the garlic clove around a medium-sized dish.Put the butter in a small frying pan over a medium heat and cook the shallots with plenty of seasoning for 5-10 minutes.Whisk together the Boursin and cream, or milk, until smooth, then season to taste.Layer the squash slices and shallots, adding salt and pepper to each layer in the baking dish, then pour over the milk and Boursin mixture, making sure it has seeped into the gaps. Scatter over the cheese, grind over some black pepper and cover with foil, then bake for 45 minutes.Roughly 15 minutes before the 45 minutes is up, prepare the pork. Rub with oil, season well, then, in a heavy-based frying pan over a high heat, hold the pork chops fat-side down in the pan, cooking for 2-3 minutes until golden. Fry on each side for a minute, until a little browned, then put in a small roasting tray, tucking the lemon and thyme around the chops.After 45 minutes of cooking the gratin, turn the oven up to 200Cgas mark 6.

In my prime, I could eat upwards of 10 Carr’s table water biscuits slathered in Boursin after seconds of turkey pie and an inordinate amount of chocolate mould dessert.But as a grownup – and as someone who gets more excited over the possibilities contained within the leftovers than the initial purpose of an ingredient – the garlicky cheese with the chant-inducing advert has come to represent versatility as well as comforting familiarity. I’ve long been stirring Boursin through fettuccine with lemon-roasted broccoli, or dolloping spoonfuls on top of slow-roasted red peppers, tomato and fennel. I’ve whisked it with milk to make the sauce for potato dauphinois, combined with soured cream, red onions and prawns, and even spread it on stale sourdough, scattered with pancetta and baked with whisked eggs to make a savoury bread and butter pudding. As an ingredient, it is undeniably simple yet effective, saving the lives of many a withered fridge companion. However, my favourite use is a relatively recent discovery, from a French friend: a roast chicken recipe – with a twist.Requiring only three ingredients: Boursin, lemon and the chicken itself. One Boursin is stuffed into the bird’s cavity with half a lemon, and a second is smeared underneath and over the top of the skin. And that’s it. The result is a creamy, flavoursome and perfectly textured meat that the carver will undoubtedly be standing over and picking at long before it reaches the table.Since learning of this dish a few years back, I’ve found that it’s the perfect recipe for those mellow days between Christmas and the new year, when families are still gathered, but the enthusiasm for spending hours in the kitchen to create a celebratory spread for those around you has dissipated to eating cold stuffing and cranberry sauce from the fridge on the sofa. This roast chicken requires no more than five minutes of preparation, a chopping board and a roasting tin. But the best thing about this recipe? It perfectly balances familiarity and nostalgia with indulgence – and that’s exactly what the festivities are all about.1 free-range organic chicken2 x 150g Boursin½ lemonSalt and ground black pepper1 bunch purple sprouting broccoli, ends trimmed25g butterZest of 1 lemonRoast or mashed potatoes, to servePreheat your oven to 180Cgas mark 4.Remove the string from the chicken and stuff one of the Boursin into the cavity along with the lemon half. Ease the skin of the chicken loose, then spread half of the other Boursin under the skin, using your fingers. Spread the other half over the skin of the whole bird and season well.Lightly oil a roasting tray and place the chicken inside. Cook for 1-1½ hours, until the juice of the chicken runs clear when a knife is inserted into the thickest part of the leg.

As Angela Hartnett warns, “don’t eat zabaglione and drive – it’s very potent!”Some of us might remember it from a time when it was a staple of the dessert trolley in Italian restaurants lit by chianti candlelight. But, according to Katie Caldesi, zabaglione is an ancient Venetian speciality, with its roots in the warming eggnogs common throughout medieval Europe, “simply flavoured in France and Italy, highly spiced in England”, if Harold McGee is to be believed. Indeed, food writer Giuliano Bugialli claims that zabaglione was “originally served as a tonic, stirred into morning coffee”, which sounds a good way to start the day at this time of year. Alternatively, serve it as a dessert-cum-digestif after dinner – preferably once the kids are safely in bed. A glorious cloud of pure pleasure that you can whip up in less than 10 minutes. Really, why wouldn’t you?Hazan observes in her monumental book, The Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking, that this may well be the only dessert using whisked egg yolks: “I don’t know of another,” she says. To whip up successfully, the protein-rich yolks need to be mixed with water – here in the form of wine, though you can, I’m assured, substitute coffee, hot chocolate or fruit juice, if you prefer. Then it is heated to set the foam (or, as McGee puts it rather more technically, to encourage the egg proteins to “unfold and bond with each other into a reinforcing matrix”). Caldesi also whisks in a whole egg, which makes her zabaglione gloriously light and foamy – if you’re after a particularly ethereal result, follow her lead, but the richer, yolk-only versions prove the firm favourite among my testers.The oft-quoted ratio of egg to sugar and wine is 1:1:1, using the eggshell as a measure (note: a yolk measures about a tablespoon, and a tablespoon is much easier to clean than an egg shell). But of the recipes I try, only Skye McAlpine’s lovely book, A Table in Venice, conforms: most others go a lot heavier on the alcohol, with Hazan calling for four times as much booze as yolk. The overwhelming feedback from my testers is that many of the recipes are just too sweet, so I’m going to reduce the sugar slightly as well as upping the alcohol, because I feel wine should be the predominant flavour.Caldesi also mentions that honey can be used instead of sugar, if preferred, which I think I’m going to like, but don’t – hot honey has a very strong flavour that we all find rather overpowering. If you’re a fan, however, do feel free to use it instead.That said, sugar is one of the principle flavours in this dish, and it seems a shame to use boring old white caster, so I’m going for the warmer, more caramelised notes of the soft, brown variety, balanced with a tiny pinch of salt, as suggested by Michael Ruhlman in his book Egg.And it works surprisingly well, giving the zabaglione a more savoury, tannic quality that is both intriguing, and rather less fun and frothy than its white wine counterparts, so I’m going to stick with Marsala and, in deference to Hartnett’s Nonna, who would “empty the drinks cabinet” in the process of making the festive zabaglione, sling in a slug of brandy, too. This last is entirely optional (whisky, rum or similar would also work well), but remember, Christmas comes but once a year, and you’ve got the next 11 months to recover.McAlpine describes her method as “slightly unconventional”, though in fact quite a few recipes whisk the yolks and sugar together off the heat before any Cook can take place, and with good reason – particularly daring chefs may be happy to make zabaglione directly in the pan, but I’d recommend a bain marie because, to quote McGee, “the mix thickens at such a low temperature that direct heat can quickly overcook it”.Hazan suggests her red-wine version is best served cold. The danger of this is that the mixture separates (though if it does, it can usually be whisked back together), but we all agree that we prefer zabaglione warm in any case: chilling it dulls the flavour. If you would like to serve it cold, however (and I have some sympathy with Anna Del Conte’s complaint that “zabaglione is lovely, but I do find it very tiresome to have to get up from the table and retire to the kitchen to make it”), I’d recommend whisking in some whipped cream, as she suggests in Amaretto, Apple Cake and Artichokes, to help stabilise the mixture.Either way, zabaglione is very good served over fruit, on a bed of crushed amaretti, or as a hot shot of pure festive joy.4 egg yolks3 tbsp soft brown sugar4 tbsp marsala or dessert wine1 tbsp brandy (optional)1 pinch saltNutmeg, to serve (optional)Find a heatproof bowl that will sit over, but not touch, a pan of simmering water, and put that water on to boil.Put the egg yolks and sugar in the bowl and whisk until thick and creamy. Gradually beat in the alcohol and salt, then set the bowl over the pan and continue to whisk, scraping the base of the bowl as you go, until the whisk leaves an impression in the mixture and, when lifted up, drops a fairly solid ribbon trail on the surface of the mixture.Remove the bowl from the pan and put on a cool surface. Keep whisking for another couple of minutes, then ide between bowls and serve (I like a grating of nutmeg on top).• Zabaglione or sabayon: do you have fond memories of this classic Italian dessert, or do you have another last-minute festive favourite up your sleeve?

Jürgen Locadia, though, equalised to give Chris Hughton’s side an invaluable point after a run of three defeats of their own.It was still a frustrating night for Arsenal’s travelling supporters, that frustration summed up at the final whistle when Unai Emery kicked a stray water bottle that spun into the crowd behind him. The Arsenal manager apologised but his side have become becalmed of late and the Spaniard will not need reminding of Tottenham’s contrasting vibrant form over the holiday period.Locadia, a Dutch forward who cost Brighton £14m, has not had the happiest of times at the club and this was his first goal of the season. Hughton was the more content manager, with Arsenal ending the evening 13 points adrift of Liverpool, whom they meet at Anfield on Saturday night. Brighton had to endure a torrid start and deserved their precious point.“I hope Jürgen can make progress now,” said Hughton. “He has had a difficult time but he is a very committed player and his goal couldn’t have come at a better time. In the end I was a bit disappointed we didn’t go on to win.”For Brighton it was a bad time to lose the services of Lewis Dunk, their England central defender, who was banned as a result of his dismissal at Bournemouth on Saturday.Dunk had scored one of Brighton’s goals in the 2-1 win over Arsène Wenger’s side here last season and he left a large hole in a defence facing the threat of Aubameyang, the Premier League’s top scorer.The Gabon striker was soon causing Brighton problems, his lob forcing Mat Ryan to turn the ball over the bar moments later Brighton failed to clear the danger and Aubameyang found himself unmarked in the area. His finishing is as sharp as a tack at the moment and an angled first-time shot gave the stranded Australia goalkeeper no chance.Glenn Murray had returned to lead Brighton’s attack and midway through the first half gave the visitors’ defence a fright when he appeared to have beaten Bernd Leno to a low cross and turned the ball over the line but he was ruled by Anthony Taylor to have fouled the goalkeeper. Murray continued to pose a danger with Leno forced to stretch to save a snap shot from the veteran striker.Aubameyang continued to keep the makeshift Brighton defence honest, missing a chance at the other end before Brighton equalised out of the blue. Granit Xhaka’s corner was cleared and Davy Pröpper hit a hopeful ball downfield. Stephan Lichtsteiner headed the ball into the path of Locadia who had come from nowhere and beat Leno from near the penalty spot.Alex Iwobi replaced Mesut Özil after the break. The German, making his 200th appearance for a side he seems destined to be leaving soon, had shown some nice touches in the first half without really imposing himself on the game.Instead it was Mattéo Guendouzi who was pulling most of the strings for Arsenal’s midfield. He had ended the first half in some pain and Martín Montoya was booked for a reckless challenge on the Frenchman.Emery said his early substitution of Özil tactical. The Spaniard said: “For the first 45 minutes we controlled the match but we didn’t create many chances after the break. It is difficult at the moment because we have a number of injuries but we are improving. The draw was not the best but it was not the worst.”Pröpper had a chance on the hour as Brighton continued to look the most likely side to break the deadlock. Solly March, influential in Brighton’s midfield, had a better opportunity when he escaped the clutches of Xhaka but his shot did not trouble Leno.Arsenal survived but they headed back up the A23 to London a relieved side. “I think they were there for the taking,” said Ryan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/580874f5c38f408931dab6fe5c0349a3f829313a/441_3_4612_2767/master/4612.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7172a9516ab49956d92d76a286a9f3e3","title":"liverpool newcastle premier league match report","story":"Word of Ricardo Pereira’s winner for Leicester against Manchester City spread like an electric pulse through Anfield. Liverpool were coasting at the time against Newcastle but now the entire stadium became charged, standing as one and singing with greater conviction about winning the league. With more justification too. Liverpool believe.The 100th victory of Jürgen Klopp’s Liverpool reign moved his team six points clear of Tottenham at the top of the table, seven clear of City, and extended their unbeaten run at Anfield to 30 league games. On current form, which is improving from a position of strength, they will take some stopping in the second half of the season. Dejan Lovren, a controversial Mohamed Salah penalty, Xherdan Shaqiri and the substitute Fabinho spread the goals through a team that is clicking at precisely the same moment as the reigning champions falter.“I thought that was because of us,” said Klopp of the moment Anfield rippled with excitement over a goal at Leicester. “I’m really naive. I thought: ‘That is really nice, thank you very much’. Then I heard after the game it was about another result! Obviously nobody told our crowd that Tottenham won 5-0. It is fine. The atmosphere for Boxing Day was really good and exceptional in that moment but I thought it was because of us.”His team’s efforts, quality and superiority over Newcastle did not go unheralded, however. Klopp refused to join in the euphoric reaction to City’s latest defeat – at least not in public – and described a six-point lead on Boxing Day as merely an encouraging platform. Rafael Benítez was more forthcoming on the possibility of Liverpool claiming the crown that eluded him at Anfield. “They are good enough to win the title, yes,” the Newcastle manager said. “They have a very good team and a very good squad with good players on the bench. If you want to win a league title you have to be consistent and they can do it.”Liverpool’s perfect Boxing Day began with a present from Jamaal Lascelles, the Newcastle captain, who made a mess of a straightforward clearance, teed up Lovren for his first goal of the season and undermined his team’s encouraging start in one action. There was no pressure on the central defender when Andy Robertson whipped over a cross from Shaqiri’s short corner but he miscued a header back across the area. The ball dropped invitingly for Lovren who swept an emphatic, rising drive into the roof of Martin Dubravka’s net. It was a finish that would have found approval from the onlooking Kenny Dalglish, Kevin Keegan and Alan Shearer, though not the defending obviously.Benítez’s team had started brightly with their threat from set pieces and Matt Ritchie’s deliveries stretching Liverpool. Unfortunately for the visitors it was not only Lascelles who struggled with his heading. Joselu, starting ahead of Salomón Rondón as Benítez selected with Saturday’s trip to Watford in mind, could have put Newcastle ahead when Ritchie’s cross sailed over Virgil van Dijk. Unmarked in the six-yard box, the Spanish striker headed down and several yards wide of Alisson’s goal.Liverpool were in no mood to offer further invitations once in front, however, and controlled proceedings. Sadio Mané was close to converting Roberto Firmino’s through ball only for Dubravka to save well with his feet. The Newcastle keeper was also alert to a powerful free-kick from Shaqiri that took a slight deflection off Mohamed Diamé before being beaten from a highly controversial penalty moments after the restart.Salah converted the spot-kick low to Dubravka’s right having won it with a theatrical tumble as he cut into the area from Trent Alexander-Arnold’s pass. Paul Dummett touched the Liverpool forward’s arm but not enough to impede Salah or produce the collapse that followed. Graham Scott, the referee, bought it and Liverpool scored a Premier League penalty at Anfield for the first time since November 2016. Benítez called it “a soft penalty that changed everything” but the legitimacy and merit of Liverpool’s victory was never in question.With the threat from Newcastle nonexistent Klopp could afford to look ahead and rest Georginio Wijnaldum and Firmino for the remainder of the contest. Shaqiri converted the third after the visitors failed to clear a dangerous low cross from the fit-again Alexander-Arnold. Jordan Henderson threaded a fine ball back to the defender on the right and, from his second attempt, the Switzerland international was on hand to beat Dubravka convincingly from close range.Anfield was still digesting the news of Leicester’s second against City when Fabinho headed home Salah’s corner at the near post – his first Liverpool goal – with Diamé slow to react. Alisson preserved his clean sheet with a fine late save from the debutant Sean Longstaff and Liverpool moved serenely on, and six points clear, at the Premier League summit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f257e8badc6042d8969f0994b11ad0a8d0347a70/0_14_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f6287182e00527230e78cddee1307eb","title":"manchester city pep guardiola tottenham liverpool leicester","story":"• Liverpool’s Klopp: Six-point lead needed with big games ahead• Pochettino says Spurs now a target after climbing to secondPep Guardiola said he must “change the dynamic” in his team after Manchester City suffered their third defeat in four league matches, taking them from first to third in the table.“Good results make miracles in the mind. Now there will be doubts but what we have to do is try to change the dynamic to win games and make good performances. But we are able to do that. I never doubt them.”Jürgen Klopp struck a similar note, noting his team’s six-point lead over Spurs could be whittled down quickly. “We play Arsenal and City next so it is good that we have six points more than other teams,” said the Liverpool manager after his side’s 4-0 win over Newcastle. “That is pretty much what we wanted to do from the start - create a basis for the rest of the season. We want to create our own history and it is the first time a Liverpool team has gone this long unbeaten in the Premier League and we have conceded only seven goals. They are good statistics. But we play Arsenal, then we play City and we play Tottenham and all the other teams again. We have to be really in the mood and have tunnel vision and see where it will leave us.”Mauricio Pochettino followed the same script after Tottenham’s 5-0 win over Bournemouth meant they leapfrogged City into second. “We have faith, we have clear ideas,” he said.“If we are able to keep our level then maybe we can talk at the end of the season that we are champions. But today it is too early to talk about us being contenders for the title.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/539de2b2ec7b08f790c70692ae3c5d866f6cee16/0_184_3940_2364/master/3940.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4250a1ae7dac53abe0cc874428d7088f","title":"manchester united huddersfield premier league match report","story":"Old Trafford, once again, felt like a contented place. Ole Gunnar Solskjær was wearing a sunrise of a smile. There was even an embrace from Fred the Red, Manchester United’s devil-horned mascot, before the team continued their immaculate start on Solskjær’s watch, and it is probably for the better that the current manager is nothing like as boastful as the previous one. If Solksjær were a different personality he might have pointed out he had taken as many points in five days as José Mourinho managed during his last 45 in the job.Solskjær is certainly entitled to feel pleased with himself after two second-half goals from a renascent Paul Pogba, to add to the one scored by Nemanja Matic in the opening period, gave United’s supporters the chance to go through their old songbook to pay homage to the man who has taken on the caretaker manager’s role for the rest of the season.The volume felt like it had been turned up a few notches since those difficult periods under Mourinho when visiting Old Trafford was such a strangely flat, often joyless, experience. Pogba, in particular, seems to be relishing the change of management. His goals were splendidly taken – a reminder why the club were more concerned about losing him, rather than Mourinho, in the power struggle between player and manager – and when he skimmed in a 25-yard shot to make it 3-0 all that was missing from his Cantona-esque goal celebration was the upturned collar.Solskjær has placed greater emphasis on width and penetration, with the full-backs Diogo Dalot and Luke Shaw encouraged to “fly on”, but it is the change in Pogba’s demeanour that is most striking. “That’s the Paul I’ve known since he was in the reserves and youth team,” Solskjær said. “He has always been a happy boy, he has always had a big smile on his face and when you score a goal, or two, of course you are happy. When you play football for Man United you should be happy. Of course it’s a responsibility, but it’s also an honour and a privilege. Paul loves playing for this club. He’s a Man United boy through and through, a kid who knows what it means to play for Man United.”At the same time it would be an exaggeration to say Solskjær has entirely transformed a team that is still 19 points off the top of the Premier League table. Not just yet, anyway. Huddersfield may not have won at Old Trafford since 1930 but a side mired in relegation danger had been difficult opponents for the opening hour. David Wagner’s team chased everything, frequently looked bright in possession and it was not until Pogba slotted in the second goal, after 64 minutes, that the home crowd could relax.Three minutes earlier it had needed a brilliant piece of goalkeeping from David de Gea to prevent Laurent Depoitre equalising from a corner and that clawing, one-handed save was arguably the key moment of the afternoon. De Gea showed in that moment why Solskjær had awarded him the captaincy – “the defining moment, one of the best saves I’ve seen” Solskjær eulogised. But Huddersfield did eventually get a goal for their troubles, courtesy of Mathias Jørgensen’s 88th-minute header. It was only Huddersfield’s 12th league goal all season and they have now lost their last six games.Their problems are typified by Jørgensen, a centre-half, now being their leading scorer with three goals and the Premier League’s bottom club will think back to a golden chance for Terence Kongolo, 10 minutes in, to open the scoring. His close-range shot went into the crowd and, at this level, Huddersfield were always likely to pay for that kind of wastefulness. “We were not clinical enough and we have not made use of our chances,” Wagner said. “Performance-wise we did not look like a side that is bottom of the league. Everybody knows what our problem is and this is that we are not clinical enough.”Sure enough United took the lead in the 28th minute after Pogba’s free-kick had been deflected behind for a corner. Marcus Rashford’s delivery was whipped over from the left. Victor Lindelöf was the first to attack the cross and, though Christopher Schindler blocked the initial effort on the goalline, the ball fell conveniently for Matic to apply the final touch.United’s second goal was the culmination of an incisive move along the right involving the lively Rashford, Juan Mata and the substitute Ander Herrera and concluding with a crisp finish from Pogba to beat Jonas Lössl from 12 yards.Huddersfield kept pressing but Pogba’s next goal was even better and United could be satisfied overall even if Jørgensen’s header, from a free-kick, left Solskjær staring back, arms folded.“It was a great day that I’ll never forget” said the Norwegian. “Walking out, hearing the crowd singing my song – it was humbling and made me really proud.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3318994f724b574ee48a01cfaf4202d5f9c7b299/0_34_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b91ba024cc71993216c3ec641337fd55","title":"have you or your partner recently given birth share your experiences with us","story":"We’d like to hear about your physical and mental recovery after birthMost parents will tell you that nothing prepares you for the arrival of your first child.

The risk is the possibility of being let down by a writer – we all have bad days – or, conversely, being sucked into something so compelling that I emerge with nerves completely jangled. So usually I go for old favourites. Not that they won’t surprise me with things I’ve never noticed before. But for most of the read, I know exactly where I am and what’s coming next. Jane Austen’s Emma Reginald Hill’s On Beulah Height Robert Louis Stevenson’s Treasure Island Iain Banks’s The Crow Road Agatha Christie’s The Murder at the Vicarage – they all work their magic on me.Some creative works operate on our consciousness like a time machine, or like Star Trek’s transporter deck they have the ability to take us out of our everyday lives and give us a glimpse of something else. They seem to do something to us subliminally, something we can’t easily describe, and that something feels good. It can be hard to pin down why this is so, and that in itself is part of the pleasure of Missa L’Homme armé sexti toni by Josquin des Prez. On a technical level, Josquin’s music is mind-bendingly sophisticated, but we don’t need to know anything about Renaissance contrapuntal technique to enjoy the magical sonic architecture he constructs. To me, it feels like a beam of light straight from the 16th century, shedding a little light on our troubled times.I’m generally pretty relaxed and very rarely suffer from stress. I see my role as more of a “stress enabler” in others. The last thing I would do if I was stressed would be to read a book. I’d rather write one.I often find myself listening to the Shipping Forecast on Radio 4. At first, I am usually wondering what time it is, but then, because often I’m on the other side of the bed and I can’t be bothered to turn it off, I just listen and it becomes very relaxing. I think it’s something to do with not understanding it and just hearing words that sound nice, and also because it is so repetitive. In terms of music, it depends on what kind of stress it is. If it’s a heartbreak-related stress, I like to listen to Lauryn Hill’s Forgive Them Father the most, especially the harmonies. If it’s a Clean Bandit-related stress, there are smooth things they play on Classical FM that can help, such as Barber’s Adagio for Strings, or there is a choral version of it too that is very relaxing.Interview by Michael CraggI like returning to the familiar to unwind – rereading is like rewatching an old movie. You’ll always find something you haven’t found before, but the mix of the familiar and the new helps you to relax.Books that I’ve returned to several times? Zora Neale Hurston’s Their Eyes Were Watching God, anything by Toni Morrison but particularly The Bluest Eye and Sula. The short stories of Anton Chekhov and Katharine Mansfield: they are like a shot of caffeine taken before a nap. Their tautness demands complete concentration and so, after reading one and being immersed in its world, letting go is a piece of cake.On the other hand, I find books designed to help relaxing an enormous wind-up because all the time my mind will drift when I’m supposed to be practising mindfulness or something. Those kind of books actually make me anxious.The sort of music I listen to when I relax really depends on who I am around. If we’re on tour in the van, I’ll put on some reggae. You can be engaged with it or drift off. It is normally pretty positive and uplifting, so that’s always a good spirit to let in.Weirdly, sometimes if I want to relax, I put on extreme metal. It’s a bit like surrendering – it provides a bed for all that residual darkness inside. I’d only ever do it alone, but I feel as though I am being sensitive to myself by letting it absorb me.Then there is Alice Coltrane. She has a song called Turiya that is otherworldly – she plays the harp in it, and it is so musical and ecstatic and pure. Her intent really flows through. You feel like, where did this music come from? That music is good for me when relaxing is crucial and I really need an antidote. It’s magic.Interview by Poppy NoorWhen I am lazing around in my pyjamas, I reread the novels of my favourite author, Anne Tyler. She writes such absorbing, wise, tender books, devastatingly acute about human nature – and wonderfully easy to read. I might go back to an early novel such as Celestial Navigation, pick up a well-thumbed masterpiece such as Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant or reread her latest book Clock Dance. She never fails.I don’t really turn to rock music if I want to relax because it’s kind of like my work. If I start listening to music, I’ll start deconstructing it and thinking: “Why did he put that snare hit right there?”, which is stressful in itself. But for myself and my cat, whenever I need my house to be lovely and stress-free, I put a classical radio station on. My cat likes me to leave it on when I leave the house too, because we both agree that it is the best. Why? With classical music, you just can’t guess where it’s going to go next. Perhaps it’s because I don’t know as much about classical music, but with a pop song you can always tell. I like how classical music takes me on a journey.PNTo relax, I like to watch something that feeds the soul and makes me feel all warm inside. Anything with David Attenborough gets a big thumbs up. So do dark comedies such as Search Party (I’m obsessed) or Inside No 9. To wind down from a stressful week, it has got to be something like Dave Chappelle or Ali Wong, preferably with a nice bottle of red. On Sundays, we like to watch old westerns while the spuds are in the oven: cowboys and pretty palominos – who could ask for more?The album I’d want to listen to with a cup of coffee at sunrise would be Blue by Joni Mitchell, or Jeff Buckley’s Sketches for my Sweetheart the Drunk. I also have this playlist on Spotify called “I feel sexy” that is great for relaxing. It is all R\u0026ampB throwbacks such as TLC, Aaliyah and 3LW. Sometimes I just want to go back to what I listened to as a teenager – not because it was a better time, just that you have such strong connections to those songs. As a young gay man, I was really grasping around at what I could identify with, and for me it was these female musicians. I like it more now because I can try on this element of confidence or sexiness with it that I wasn’t able to when I was younger.PNMy ultimate comfort TV has to be David Attenborough, with his calming voice, or any wildlife show. I adore animals, and like most children wanted to be a vet and spend my days caring for them. So the idea of watching people going to sanctuaries and helping wildlife thrive or just observing them in their natural habitat is a huge de-stresser for me.When I am losing my sense of humour, I turn on RuPaul’s Drag Race for instant fun and frivolity. Underneath the sequins and glitter is a touching message about self-belief in times of adversity.There is something really comforting about watching the preparation of food, and Chef’s Table adds adventure and travel into the mix.

I also read, and listen to calming music every day. When I start to overthink things, or believe I am way more important than I actually am (a leading cause of stress in all of us), I read a verse from the Tao Te Ching, which is said to be the wisest book of all time.

Selected by Sarah Gilbert10 December This was the day the supreme court in India repealed section 337 of the Indian penal code, which criminalised homosexuality. It was a momentous occasion. At the celebrations in Bangalore they were tossing activists in the air, bursting confetti and balloons. I didn’t see any hostility or fear. For me this photo depicts relief and immeasurable joy. The activist in the photo, Akkai Padnashali, said this was the happiest moment of her life. I think it speaks volumes of her belief that everyone is equal and deserves to be treated as such in the eyes of the law.22 October I took this picture at a dangerous time in the confrontation between Palestinians and the Israeli army in Gaza City. I certainly endangered my life – I was on the front lines. It was intense. The Israeli army were firing gas and bullets. But I think it was worth the risk. The protesters are fighting back against years of siege and it is startling to see their anger. They are still there, fighting back. For me, this man brandishing the Palestinian flag shows that they still have a sense of freedom.Morning in a cattle camp, South SudanStefanie GlinskiAFPDuring dry season in South Sudan, cattle herders seek lower ground for water and pasture. I took a flight, a helicopter and swam through a river to get to this cattle camp. The animals, cattle herders and families are waking. The herders are on the road and sleep between the animals. Photographs from South Sudan normally capture problems or civil war. This was more positive. The peoples’ relationship with the animals is close. They drink cow’s milk and wash their hands and hair with cow urine. They use cow dung to keep mosquitoes and flies off, burning it to ashes with which they cover their skin. It was incredibly dusty when I got there as overnight fires had just been extinguished. That’s what makes the beautiful colour.Mugshot of Bean, the lost dog, New JerseyCape May Police DeptAP17 July Somebody reported that this dog, Bean, was running loose. We took the mugshot to add a bit of levity and fun to our job – in most cases it’s not appropriate. Eventually someone saw the photo on social media and sent a message to the owners, so they got Bean back. He’s a really famous dog now. We’ve seen news articles from Japan and Germany about him and we had a million views on the Facebook page. We have a national night out against crime when the community gets together and Bean’s owners sent us 150 Bean photos for the kids, which they loved. We didn’t expect the response we got at all. The perception of law enforcement tends to be negative, so any chance we get to show people we are just normal people really helps.Woman in the aftermath of an earthquake, IndonesiaJorge SilvaReuters7 October Central Sulawesi was one of the most affected areas during the tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia. Everything was totally upside-down. It looked like the earth was melting. The liquefaction was turning soil to water, so it appeared like the earth was alive, running. The mosque is destroyed and toppling over in the background. This family was searching for their home in the rubble. They didn’t even recognise it – it had moved 150m away from where it normally stood. She’s holding a stuffed rabbit and you wonder: who owned that rabbit? That woman had lost her three children. I asked her to stop and I took the portrait in one frame. Then she turned around and kept walking.15 October I took this on the day Turkish investigators entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to search the building, following the death of Jamal Khashoggi. The only entrance for cars was in front of the main entrance – so the media would part to let them through, then congregate again. The security guard is trying to hold us all back. I got the photo by standing with one foot on a tree stump and the other on a steel barricade so I could see over the crowd. You only have 10 seconds to take that kind of photo, but looking back I was like, wow. It pretty much sums up the story: Khashoggi was a journalist and his death was linked to press freedom. Saudi is a closed country and here there was a security guard blocking the press from taking photos.16 May I was covering the Kilauea volcano eruptions and I’d heard that this golf course had a good viewpoint. I was trying to photograph when someone yelled: “Get out of my way, we’re tryna play here!” It was incredibly incongruous – and surprising to me, how unfazed the golfers were. To people living in Hawaii, these events are a part of life. People are accustomed to the power of nature around them. Often we go ahead with our daily activities amid these incredible things happening alongside us.Stuck in the mud at the Dakar rallyFranck FifeGetty Images13 January I’ve been photographing the Dakar rally since 2013. It’s more than a job, it’s a passion. I cover most of it by helicopter, strapped into my seat with the door open and my feet dangling in mid-air. We were flying over the Bolivian plateau when we saw this very muddy spot with little lakes on either side. Cars were struggling to get through, and we realised it would be even harder for the motorbikes. So we landed nearby and set up. It was completely crazy. While some avoided the mudhole, others were stuck there for 40-45 minutes. Franco Caimi, pictured here, was one of the luckier ones. He almost went over his handlebars, but then fell back into his saddle. We decided we ought to warn them, but some still carried straight on in. Interview by Phil DaoustUS border agents detain a Honduran mother and childJohn MooreGetty Images13 June Trump had recently implemented the policy of child separation when this photo was taken. The families were in darkness after a harrowing journey. They had no idea the policy had changed and they might be separated. They just knew they were escaping something dangerous and moving into an unknown future. Immigration is often discussed in terms of statistics, but the little crying girl is the reality of the zero tolerance policy. Her mother’s documents were being inspected, and when she was asked to set her child down, the little girl burst into tears. Later I discovered they weren’t separated. That was a relief, but others were. You can only imagine the terror.The gunwomen of PennsylvaniaSpencer PlattGetty ImagesThe running of the bulls, Pamplona, SpainPablo Blázquez DomínguezGetty Images7 July The running of the bulls at the San Fermin festival is an integral part of culture in Pamplona. It lasts for nine days and even people who don’t like the bulls go, for the music, dance, food and drink. The picture is taken from the balcony of Carmen, a woman who lives on that street. I knew it was a good spot because Pedro Armestre captured the festival from the same balcony in 2013 and it was a really nice photo. It’s one of the best views of San Fermin you can really see the vibrancy and the atmosphere.Mass start of the Ironman BarcelonaCharlie CrowhurstGetty Images for Ironman20 May I’ve been to the Ironman Barcelona race before and I knew I could get a sunrise-esque photo if the conditions were right. I went down to the beach and tested it. Walk two metres in and you’re already waist-deep in the water. It’s a real steep drop. On the day, I wore trunks, stood in the water with my camera and waited for the start. No one else was in the water. I was so close to them – maybe five metres away. Suddenly they were sprinting into the sea at full-pace, with spray going everywhere. It’s an inidual sport, so this is the only moment you can capture the high energy of everyone together. At the start I was thinking “Just start now!” because the conditions were perfect. With every second the purples and the oranges that give it that hue were fading. Everything came together perfectly.Road destroyed by earthquake in AlaskaMarc LesterAP30 November We are pretty used to eruptions in Alaska, but this was different. We wanted to visibly tell the story of the structural damage that is hard to see. The quake had caused traffic to grind to an absolute halt, so it was impossible to photograph this spot on foot. I knew I’d have to fly. The viewpoint from the plane captured the enormity of the damage. The subtle cracks and splinter patterns in the ice and the lakes around it – it’s so unusual to see it from that perspective. It’s surreal. The earth looked like it was prepared to swallow the surface. The earthquake was ranked as potentially deadly. It’s amazing there were no deaths.California wildfire: ‘Oh my gosh bro, this is crazy’Stuart PalleyZuma Presseyevine9 November I’ve photographed over 100 wildfires, but the California wildfire was one of the most intense. This was a few days in and it was wholesale destruction. For 12 miles there was a line of people evacuating amid a backdrop of this huge, ominous, orange-grey fire. People were crying and screaming, watching their homes burn down, running for their lives. All hell was breaking loose. And then, almost like a movie, this guy rolled past on his skateboard saying: “Oh my gosh bro, this is crazy,” with his phone in his hand filming. That would only happen in Los Angeles. The photo really puts the fire in the context of the location.Sea of plastic waste, Panggang island, IndonesiaLaurent WeylPanos Pictures20 July Panggang is a small island in north Jakarta where there’s not enough land for the inhabitants. They are making space by throwing the plastic waste they have accumulated into the sea. Society has changed a lot there. Food used to be wrapped in leaves it was natural, biodegradable. Now everything’s wrapped in plastic, but there’s not much education about plastic disposal – there are health problems because the community are burning soft plastics and breathing in the air. They just don’t realise it’s a problem. The girl looks so happy because it’s normal for her. I ed in the sea near this island and it was awful. It’s full of litter: furniture, bags, whatever, they just throw it in. This photo shows the worst-case scenario of overusing plastics. That level of consumption is crazy. You could walk on the plastic there.Horses and riders in South DakotaStephanie KeithReuters3 August I covered the Standing Rock pipeline protests and met Ivan Lookinghorse, a tribal leader on the Cheyenne River Indian reservation. A year later he invited me to this 400-mile horse ride from South Dakota to Fort Laramie, which marked the 150th anniversary of the Sioux nation’s treaty rights. I became part of their community on that ride. Without our relationship, I wouldn’t have got the photo – I was part of the action, riding around in the tall grass, doing fun thing like kids do. I wanted to show them having a fun life. That group of kids are so special. The treaty gave them some bare-minimum rights over sustenance, but it’s a bitter pill. The Sioux people used to have so much land and now their community is in crisis. They are living on reservations in the poorest counties in the US.Snapping the crocodile: ‘People ask how I didn’t get eaten’Sean ChinnCaters News26 September I lived on a boat in the mangroves in Cuba for a week before taking this shot. Between some ing we went to an area where they’re familiar with crocodiles. Guides called out “Nino” – and a minute later this crocodile came up to the boat. I was waist deep in the water. I shot this with a dome port, which gives the half-in, half-out, composition. I wanted to show the two worlds together – that we can coexist alongside apex predators. Films portray crocodiles as man-eating monsters, but they’re not. I was scared before taking this photo because I hadn’t been in the water with a crocodile before I mainly photograph sharks. People ask how I didn’t get eaten, but the crocodile was relaxing with its mouth wide open. I was lighting it with two strobe lights and it wasn’t bothered – they’re quite chilled creatures.Hondurans march towards the USGuillermo AriasGetty Images27 October This image of the migrant caravan travelling to the US border was used by Trump as propaganda, to label them as criminals and invaders. But you can see here that they’re just trying to walk. They are in unity, marching over that bridge, next to this beautiful landscape. The danger for photojournalists is that no matter how hard we try to be accurate, others might use our work to push their agenda. People decided to leave Central America in huge numbers because they have no basic safety there. In some ways they were naive, hoping they’d get to the US and Trump would say: “Come in! Let’s come together and we’ll give you visas,” once he saw their pain. On these first steps they were very hopeful, but when they got to the border they realised it was going to be pretty dark for them going forward.12 December I was covering this neo-Nazi rally in Georgia and had heard they were going to have a secret ritual after dark. We all met at this bar, and were told they were planning to set up a big swastika on a cross and burn it. There was a moment when the organiser turned on me because he thought I was there for a leftwing organisation. As the torch was burning and the men were chanting, I got a little nervous – almost high on the adrenalin. It’s a frightening photo because most people, myself included, don’t realise these secret rituals still happen until they see it. I am not Caucasian so I was surprised at how nice the organiser was to me. He thanked me for coming. I don’t know why they let us photograph.7 February This was taken during the release ceremony for child soldiers who had been fighting in South Sudan’s war-torn region of Yambio. The boy was the youngest there. He was nine. He is standing in a line with the other soldiers who are also children, but much older and taller. It’s a powerful image because he’s so young, and what happened to him is so unjust. He’s been around these big guys for way too long, doing things he didn’t want to do. You can see how his innocence has been taken away from him. He was really shy and quiet. We talked about games he liked to play and it struck me that he’s just a little boy who really wants to be home with his siblings and his family.Car submerged in floods, Bucksport, South CarolinaSean RayfordGetty Images26 September I was covering hurricane Florence and it had hit landfall. There was a cemetery on the street and coffins were floating around. I’d never seen that before, and I’ve covered a lot of floods. Then I saw this quaint little old car, submerged in the water. It’s incongruous: this modern invention that still can’t reckon with nature. The photo sums up how powerless humans are to stop mother nature once it gets going. People know these floods are coming each day it creeps up and yet for the most part no one can do anything about it.Daniel Ricciardo celebrates F1 victory in MonacoDan MullanGetty Images27 May This was my first grand prix in Monaco. Red Bull had built this massive station for the media with a swimming pool on top. Daniel Ricciardo had just won his first Monaco grand prix. Everyone was flooding the station, knowing that’s where he would go: he had to fight his way through the crowd to get in. The media were all around the pool, like a natural amphitheatre and then he jumped in. I was opposite Ricciardo on the other side of the pool. It was as much about positioning as the technical skill. If I played it wrong, I could have been on the edge, soaking wet, holding a camera above everyone’s heads, trying to get a good shot and failing miserably."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41540d92b2c077e78bb10eb165a4dcc35c209fc2/0_162_3412_2047/master/3412.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1203407b76cf6cfc00f0adbe3b39906e","title":"santander didnt give a refund after 15000","story":"My elderly father has had £15,000 stolen from his Santander account by fraudsters masquerading as his bank. I don’t believe Santander’s security measures were adequate for an elderly customer who is not particularly technologically competent and who suffers from epilepsy. During the crime, he was in the grasp of an epileptic fit and his consultant neurologist has submitted a report, at the request of Santander, stating that if he was telephoned during a seizure it would be possible for him to answer questions without being aware of it. We have asked Santander why it didn’t hold the money until it had confirmation from my father, but it has failed to answer and has declined to refund the money. The worry about not being able to pay his bills has seriously affected his health. £15,000 is a drop in the ocean to a large bank, but to my father it is everything. Your father was victim of a proliferating crime that can catch out even the savviest of customers. It’s known as authorised push-payment fraud because the victims authorise the transaction after being deceived by the scammers masquerading as their bank or another trusted body.Last year nearly 44,000 people were defrauded in this way to the tune of £236m.Victims are not automatically entitled to a refund from their bank as they are if their card or account details are stolen and misused.Since September, the Payment Systems Regulator has required banks to take adequate steps to prevent fraud and, if they fail to do so, to reimburse victims, provided they were not unreasonably negligent with their security information.Santander says it duly warned your father before allowing the payment to proceed.Its fraud detection system sent a warning text and told him the payment would be suspended and he would be contacted again in an hour and asked to verify it which he did.“We are sympathetic to the customer, but unfortunately, despite clear warnings, he authorised payments to be made to the fraudsters,” says a spokesperson.“We were unaware of his condition ahead of this scam.”As a last resort you could take the case to the Financial Ombudsman Service who can investigate whether Santander’s provided an adequate duty of care.Regulators are meanwhile struggling to keep up with the scale of push-payment fraud.This month the Financial Conduct Authority announced new rules to pressure banks into identifying fraudulent incoming payments.From 31 January 1,019 fraud victims will be able to complain to the bank that received the stolen funds if their own bank fails to cooperate adequately and to appeal to the ombudsman if they are dissatisfied with the response. There’s no knowing whether this would have helped your father given how quickly funds can be moved onwards.“It remains to be seen whether that will have any real impact on the amount of money consumers are able to recover,” says Ben Johnson, Finance Litigation Partner at DWF.If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

Laws that came into force in April exposed the different treatment of male and female employees, finding that eight in 10 firms paid men more than women.Theresa May launched a consultation in October seeking views on whether there should be mandatory reporting of ethnicity pay gaps at work.The thinktank noted that while ethnic minority workers have long earned less overall, on average, than white male workers, its pay penalty calculation was controlled for factors such as occupation, contract type, industry and qualifications.Kathleen Henehan, research and policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “Black, Asian and minority ethnic workers have made important gains in the labour market in recent years. A record number of young BAME workers have degrees, and a record number are in work.“However, despite this welcome progress, many of Britain’s 1.6 million black, Asian and ethnic minority workers face significant disadvantages in the workplace.“After the successful steps taken to expose and tackle the gender pay gap in 2018, we now need greater accountability on the ethnic pay gap in 2019.”A government spokesperson said: “Diversity is good for businesses and this government is committed to ensuring the workplace works for everyone. We’ve introduced new laws to help companies ensure the make-up of their boards and senior management is representative of their workforces and we’re currently consulting on proposals for mandatory ethnicity pay reporting as part of a series of measures to help employers tackle ethnic disparities in the workplace.”Gender pay gap legislation, which came into effect in April this year, requires employers with 250 or more staff to publish annual calculations of the disparity between male and female pay."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4a95db38d9779ad3bdd19c05f5db4ec424b0721/0_91_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c8f95cd5b348934776c52033c5ef11f","title":"tell us whats the rail service like in your area of the uk","story":"We’d like you to help us document the state of train services across the UK.

The female rapper Cardi B came second, and British-Kosovan pop singer Dua Lipa third, while Jess Glynne, Ariana Grande and Anne-Marie all featured in the top 10.The data is slightly complicated by the fact that some of the music tracks on which the women performed were produced by men: Dua Lipa’s hit One Kiss was made in collaboration with Calvin Harris, so both would be credited in terms of chart weeks Electricity was produced by the duo Silk City 22 of Jess Glynne’s weeks on the chart were from her track with Rudimental and Macklemore, These Days and Anne-Marie’s Friends was a hit with the EDM producer Marshmello.Cardi B also had three charting tracks as a guest star to male acts: Taki Taki with DJ Snake alongside Selena Gomez and Ozuna, Girls Like You with Maroon 5, and Finesse with Bruno Mars. But the New York rapper had another three hits under her own name, plus a guest spot for Rita Ora on the controversial track Girls.Dua Lipa’s success follows on from her breakthrough year in 2017, when she scored 60 weeks on the chart. As well as her and Drake, the other artist to reach the top 10 in both years was Post Malone, whose five hits (including one guesting for Tiesto) spent a total of 63 weeks in the chart this year.The top 10 featured four female acts of 2017 plus the mixed-gender trio Clean Bandit, though their total number of weeks on the chart was markedly lower, thanks in part to the domination of Ed Sheeran. The singer-songwriter, who spent much of 2018 on what became the year’s biggest-grossing tour, spent 167 weeks in the charts in 2017, and ended up with four of the 10 biggest-selling singles of that year.The chair of UK Music’s taskforce on ersity, Keith Harris, said the findings showed “some of the initiatives put in place across the industry are bearing fruit, things are changing for the better”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9fc5389120eb74e7946aadbd0db9621fea3c4e89/74_117_2739_1643/master/2739.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cde20d8231e54e350b5cef27a599930a","title":"the best of the long read in 2018","story":"Our 20 favourite pieces of the yearMillions are robbed of the power of speech by illness, injury or lifelong conditions.

He was brought to a standstill when arriving with what looked like a winning run, is only 3lb higher here and has been kept to hurdles for his two runs since.Dangers abound, including Ladbroke Trophy runner-up Elegant Escape, but that race was perhaps not as strong this year as in the past. Baie Des Iles needs to be forgiven a poor return but also looks to have been aimed at this from a long way out, while Kansas City Chief, in the Tony Bloom colours that often catch punters’ eyes, could be worth an each-way saver at 25-1 on his first start over fences since joining Neil Mulholland.Chepstow 1.05 At Newbury last time Touch Kick was no match for the front-running Aso but he finished clear of his remaining opponents and the seven-year-old has fewer questions to answer than most of the field here.Kempton Park 1.20 A serious test for the Arkle claims of Kalashnikov, with Dynamite Dollars in particular looking potentially top-notch, but Amy Murphy’s chaser won with any amount in hand at Plumpton last time and can continue his march towards the Festival.Chepstow 1.35 A potential match between the Triumph Hurdle favourite Adjali and the more experienced Quel Destin. The former made short work of his field when odds-on on for his British debut at Market Rasen but Quel Destin has seen off a series of promising opponents while winning three of his four starts this year and at the likely odds he is worth backing to do so again.Kempton Park 1.55 Momella was closing in on the winner when she fell two out at Newbury last time and has an obvious chance. She is giving weight away all round, though, and Sainte Ladylime, who has also been competitive at Grade Two level, could well improve significantly for her recent run at Southwell, her first start since March.Chepstow 2.10 Another Emotion ran with promise on his return at Sandown earlier this month but looked very tired by the end and he could “bounce” here. Truckers Lodge looks like the safer option.Kempton Park 2.30 The great Sprinter Sacre surrendered his unbeaten record over jumps five years ago in this race when he set off at 2-9, and his stable companion Altior could be even shorter in the betting today. That slightly unnerving omen apart, however, Altior has the best part of two stone in hand here and it should be a stroll to a 16th straight win in hurdles and chases.Kempton Park 3.05 At Exeter last time Just A Sting got home by just a head but an uneven gallop did not play to his strengths and he is open to plenty of improvement. A 6lb rise is unlikely to stop him extending his unbeaten record over the bigger obstacles here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f052d1457439edd6feff2614f1f0bddd1deb49dc/0_314_4160_2496/master/4160.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0aa1db42f0e7b7008eb5825e40045465","title":"readers best travel discoveries of 2018 your top tips","story":"What an adventurous lot you are!

The Gjaargardur Guesthouse (doubles £120 B\u0026ampB) is a cosy home in this remote corner of the North Atlantic, with wonderful walking routes in every direction. It serves hearty, rustic food (roast lamb, beef etc) and has plenty of advice for walkers (including the Slaettaratindur hike, the highest peak on the Faroes at 882 metres). The town also has a beautiful Scandinavian church by the sea. Pack for wild weather, as it changes by the minute! Gjogv is accessible by hire car (one hour) from Vagar airport.Nick ReevesWe’ve seen a lot of Brussels on our TV screens this year! Much less well-known is Leuven (Louvain in French), a gem of a 15th-century university town less than 15 minutes’ train ride from the capital. It bowled me over, with its exquisite architecture at every turn, culminating in its magnificent town hall. The statues of Erasmus, and of a student pouring a glass of beer into his empty head (above), personify the historic and modern aspects of a city with classy shops, buzzing bars, and churches filled with Flemish art.

She had resigned from an order of Catholic religious sisters, but subsequently combined two Catholic traditions by becoming a “consecrated virgin” (a non-nun who remains celibate and serving God) and a hermit.Her engagement with the external world came largely through art, and her writing on the subject led to gallery talks, one of which was seen by a producer, for whom she fronted Moving Art (1991), made by her local ITV station, Anglia. This led to employment by the BBC to make series including Sister Wendy’s Odyssey (1992) and The Story of Painting (1999).Journalists and academics recruited by TV are often pressured to change their clothes, teeth, and spectacles for more screen-friendly versions. But Sister Wendy’s habit, wimple and veil were as non-negotiable as her prominent upper incisors and large-framed spectacles. And, in fact, her producers understood that not looking like a TV personality was a large part of her appeal.Where she exactly fitted the TV arts template was in the medium’s preference for enthusiasm and positivity. For her, art appreciation was an extension of her faith – one of her specialist subjects was artistic depictions of the Virgin Mary – and her broadcasting a form of worship, of both God and art. Her substantial TV earnings benefited religious orders, and charities.But, unlike some others who have periodically been brought in by the BBC to popularise the arts, she did know her stuff, and sometimes in surprising areas. One of her pre-TV books was Contemporary Women Artists, which, in its assessments of painters including Bridget Riley and Gillian Ayres, showed a broader critical palette than might have been suspected of a woman within hierarchically male Catholicism, whose TV shows often focused on sacred and famous pictures.In the 1990s, her work made her very famous, not just in the UK, but the US, where religious figures were a less unexpected presence in the schedules. But she was protected from the frequent risks of sudden TV fame – such as addiction, egomania and questionable tax avoidance schemes – by her secluded and spiritual lifestyle. Viewers always felt that she was a bigger deal for television than television was for her."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cebe8d59ad8d260aba8e9444eebd7b7fe67820f6/368_15_1272_763/master/1272.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8a582a89ec3cc16dca610bcc73d4f76","title":"morecambe wise in america how the duo made it in the us","story":"Many who followed them failed, but Eric and Ernie were a hit in the US. Gold’s new three-part series, which features new footage, explains whyRepeats of old Morecambe \u0026amp Wise episodes are a British TV Christmas tradition. But this year’s schedule includes material from the comedy pair that is new to UK viewers. Morecambe \u0026amp Wise in America, a Gold three-parter hosted by Jonathan Ross, includes numerous sketches of theirs performed in the 1960s on the CBS variety series The Ed Sullivan Show.The career in America of the double act is summed up by the treatment of Morecambe’s stage surname. Introducing the act from England, for the first time in 1963, Sullivan pronounces the second syllable to rhyme with “ham” rather than “some”. But the double-act proved so popular – returning a dozen times in the 1960s – that Sullivan was soon saying the word as naturally as a Lancastrian.Superior to other British TV comics in every other respect, Morecambe and Wise also stand alone in having had sustained success in the US. Bruce Forsyth, who admits in his memoirs to having desperately wanted to break the defining entertainment market, made only one American show, Bruce Forsyth’s Hot Streak, which lasted for a brief season in 1986.Graham Norton, the UK’s most successful contemporary talk-show host, has twice tried to take on David Letterman, the American host who most influenced him, on his home turf. After rehearsing the move with a series of 10 New York-based shows, entitled NY Graham Norton, towards the end of his time at Channel 4, Norton fronted The Graham Norton Comedy Effect for Comedy Central.He proved happier, though, bringing Americans over to talk to him on BBC One. Piers Morgan, briefly poached by CNN, also came home after audiences in the States found him “too English” (especially on the issue of gun control). It was ironic, as many British viewers said they found Morgan “too American”.Morecambe \u0026amp Wise in America suggests that the comedians broke through the usual export barrier because they benefited from particular conditions not available to later acts. The well-developed Anglophilia of Sullivan, who made regular talent scouting trips to London, gave them a first chance, and their latter appearances on his show coincided with a general enthusiasm in New York for UK culture, including the Beatles, also championed by Sullivan.As Michael Grade, once the pair’s agent, points out in the series, Wise, in particular, always had the US as his benchmark, his heroes being Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire. Morecambe’s weakening health made it impractical to go on commuting to the US after the late 1960s, but, these programmes convincingly suggest, exposure to the lavish production values and “special guest star” tradition of American TV shaped Morecambe and Wise’s later, greatest, British work: their Christmas specials. As their biographer Graham McCann put it: “Instead of taking Morecambe \u0026amp Wise to Hollywood, they brought Hollywood to Morecambe \u0026amp Wise.”Family and collaborators also remember the pair tailoring their act for the US for example, changing the word “trousers” to “pants” in a tailoring sketch. (Language seems likely to have been the most frequent barrier to attempted transfers to the States.)Ronnie Barker and Ronnie Corbett had some success in Australia, but the US eluded them, probably because many of their jokes depended on specifically English place-name double-entendres (“Bognor”, “Little Hampton” and so on) or, in one famous sketch, pronunciation: the “four candles”“Fork ‘andles”, and other verbal misunderstandings between customer and salesman in a hardware store, arise from the stress patterns and dropped aitches of London cockney speech.Similarly, speedy Enfield-inflected speech of the host on Bruce Forsyth’s Hot Streak, also seems to have caused problems the show was a word game in which easy comprehension for competitors and audience was crucial.The most durable UK exports to the US have been those who were almost “honorary” American broadcasters, including Alistair Cooke (1908-2004), born in Salford, but whose adoption of US citizenship and delivery led British viewers and listeners to assume he was American. In this respect, the heir to the host of Letter From America could be John Oliver, the Brummie whose success as the UK correspondent on The Daily Show, with Jon Stewart, led to his own continuing HBO show, Last Week Tonight With John Oliver.The American TV fate of another post-Morecambe and Wise British double-act – Fry and Laurie – is instructive. Hugh Laurie, who switched accent and genre, became a superstar in House, while Stephen Fry, staying close to his home persona, flopped in the sitcom The Great Indoors.Crucially, broadcasting manner has to be adapted as much as vocabulary and accent. Jeremy Paxman fronted an international, USA-themed, edition of Newsnight on BBC America for 10 months in 2008, but, at least pre-Trump, Americans were not ready for politicians to be treated with such sceptical disrespect.The BBC’s co-ownership (with AMC) of an American network, however, has progressively made it easier for British talent to travel. Screening on BBC America of Ricky Gervais’s The Office and Extras gave Gervais a visibility in the US that led to a movie career. Phoebe Waller-Bridge has similarly benefited, with the showing of Fleabag in the US leading to Killing Eve, a US-UK co-production shown in both countries.If a BBC America had existed in Morecambe and Wise’s time – or they in its – the pair’s British shows might have been screened on the network. But in their day they had to make the choice. Those for whom Christmas is a largely a celebration of television will be glad they made the choice they did.Morecambe \u0026amp Wise in America – Gold at 8pm, 27 December, 3 January and 10 January"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ec31b1c1ff77353216b827d86250085f7aa0dff/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ac8534f00ddd35b511969d42d8fffbd","title":"sorry episodes the most disappointing tv shows of 2018","story":"From the squandered promise of Who Is America? to the glacial pacing of McMafia, this year featured plenty of turkeys that failed to take flightIn theory, McMafia had lots going for it. A captive January audience. A topical edge involving dubiously financed Russians in London. James Norton’s glowering charisma. Plenty of viewers bent over backwards to give it a chance. But, dear God, it was dull. The sterility of these lives was probably partly the point, but it didn’t lend itself to empathy. The storytelling was unforgivably sluggish. Watching it crawl towards its resolution was like watching a puddle evaporate. Taking rich, handsome, ruthless gangsters and surgically removing every ounce of their picaresque charisma might be a worthy pursuit, but it’s not much to look at. PHWas anything in 2018 as gruellingly portentous as Westworld? Every single second of this damp fart of a season dripped with unearned seriousness. The dialogue was delivered exclusively in a concussed monotone. The action was suffocated by six inches of intellectual detachment. Any trace of characterisation was bulldozed in favour of a witless cat-and-mouse game with the most insufferable Reddit percentile. Midway through this year’s season, I began to hate Westworld for existing. You are supposed to be a show about crazy robot cowboys, for crying out loud. Lighten up a little. SHMaisel’s second series swapped storyline for absurd set pieces in Paris and the Catskills that did nothing but show off Amazon Prime’s Emmy-abetted budget. Its fatal flaw? Empathetic characters such as Susie – battling not only mobsters but also, potentially, life as a queer woman in 50s New York – are treated like cyphers. The lead – brittle, babbling, blithe Midge – is framed as a saint, but somehow manages to steamroller everyone else. Hence, perhaps, the sickly surrounds: they are the only thing that can withstand the grating charm offensive. And yet, like a trip to Disneyland or a mouthful of Quality Street strawberry creams, it’s seductively sugary. LSThe Romanoffs was Matthew Weiner’s first creation since Mad Men. In theory, it contained all the elements that might replicate the latter’s greatness. It had the kind of luxurious movie aesthetic that streaming services love to pay for it was an anthology series at a time when anthologies are thriving and its cast, from Isabelle Huppert to Aaron Eckhart, exuded elegance. But it took those ingredients and cooked up a bloated series too heavy with self-importance to be worth the feature-length running time. RNUnderstandably, there was much fanfare after the announcement that Sacha Baron Cohen was returning to TV to take aim at the US political class. “The most dangerous show in the history of television” was how Showtime billed Who is America?, while we wondered whether it would be “the TV event of the year”. In the end, both assessments proved optimistic for a series that acted as a limp rehash of the sort of prankery Baron Cohen has unleashed on public figures for much of the past two decades. A much-trailed segment with Sarah Palin failed to materialise in the show itself, but there were a couple of high points – a segment in which Republican lawmakers were coaxed into calling for the arming of kindergarten kids, and the resignation of the Georgian politician Jason Spencer after he screamed racial epithets while baring his backside on the show. For the most part, though, this was a confirmation that much of our current politics is just too farcical to satirise. GMEverything was in place until it all fell apart. There was the traumatised soldier-cum-security-officer conflicted by his appointment guarding a government minister who represents all he hates. The irresistible sexual attraction between them. The political wheels-within-wheels set in motion. A bit of terrorist skulduggery, then an unexpected bomb at the end of episode three, blowing up one of the leads – and the whole thing wide open. However, it didn’t coalesce into something compelling that made sense or used all that had gone before. National goodwill kept it going, but, as far as Jed Mercurio dramas are concerned, it went out with a whimper. LMIt looked so promising. Sean Penn taking on his first TV role, all about a mission to Mars, made by the same studio that brought the world The Handmaid’s Tale. But what we got was a glacially paced drama featuring Penn either jogging, sweating or hugging an almost unfathomable amount of people. It started with a huge bang, but failed to carry any propulsion and disappeared without trace, another victim of the endless stream of great TV. LBAfter the removal of Kevin Spacey while filming for the final season was underway, Netflix scrambled to concoct a satisfying conclusion to the series. The plot threads were kept but retooled, while – in a fitting and welcome move – Robin Wright’s Claire Underwood became president. An increase in her screen time was a silver lining (she was always the better actor and the more interesting character), but the rush to patchwork together the rest of the season led to a messy, cheap-looking swansong. The show’s far-fetched soapy theatrics took centre stage, but without the fun that would suggest. In the dismal final episode, a garbled race to the finish line made us feel like losers for sticking with it so long. BLIf only Margaret Atwood had written her sequel sooner, perhaps we wouldn’t be in this mess. Having followed the feminist dystopia of our time faithfully in the outstanding first season, Offred and the red cloaks found themselves cast adrift in a rudderless Gilead created by a misguided writers’ room. The second season started well, with a sickeningly tense mock-execution scene. But as the season wore on it became ever more gruelling. It reached its nadir in the episode that showed Offred giving birth, alone, in a snowstorm, in real time. Then the final scene came along and made me want to hang it from the Wall. At least next year we get to read a do-over in novel form. KAWhich clangers did our critics miss?

A holder for a watermelon slice. A metal contraption that makes flicking someone on the forehead more painful.These are just a few of the creations designed and made by China’s “useless inventor.”Geng Shuai, 34, also ironically called “Edison” by his fans, broadcasts his work from his home studio in a village in Hebei province on a live-streaming app almost every day. With more than 2.5 million fans on the platform, Kuaishou, he is one of China’s latest live-stream celebrities.Geng is part of an industry that generates as much as $4.7bn in revenue, and one that has few parallels outside of the country. In China, the most popular live streams are not of live events or the feeds of friends, but performances or shows held by strangers. Popular live-streams range from people playing video games, singing karaoke, to studying or farming.Unlike Youtube stars, perhaps the closest comparison, China’s live stream celebrities interact with their fans, who make comments, ask questions, and, most importantly, send virtual gifts that can be turned in for cash. Top live-streaming celebrities can make as much as 10mn yuan (about $1.45m) a year.Geng, who dropped out of school after middle school to go work with his father welding pipes and doing other metal work, started to become popular this autumn after a few local media profiled him. Geng had been building his contraptions and recording videos for more than a year.“Once after chopping some vegetables, I put the knife to the side and answered a phone call. After hanging up, I put my cell phone on the knife and then it occurred to me. I could make a cell phone case out of a knife. I thought it would be interesting and I wanted to share this with other people. I never thought it would become so popular,” Geng says.Geng now earns most of his income from donations given online, advertisements, and selling his items online.His other inventions include a 66-cm long comb made out of iron, a device that pushes food up on a skewer to aid eating street food, or an alarm that goes off if your fly is open. “I like things that are unique. They bring novelty to your life, and these new things in everyday, boring life can make you happy,” he said.The popularity of live-streaming in the country, and people’s willingness to spend money on a free platform, has been attributed to the sense of community that the videos give to isolated youth, busy young professionals, or the so-called diaosi or self-identified “loser” class of Chinese who feel left behind..Others say the shows offers unedited entertainment in a country where official channels are so tightly regulated. In his live-stream, Geng tries to listen to his fans. He asks them what they would like to see him make and their requests are often more extreme than his own ideas: iron pants, underwear, or swimsuits. One asked if he could make a spaceship.“It’s not only children who are playful,” he says. “Everyone has a childish heart, no matter how old they are.”Additional reporting by Wang Xueying"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3482ff8892d6ff796e5b31e22c2b18d45570bc18/217_0_2448_1469/master/2448.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=793c2ff5efd8f1833a34d194a0ba9146","title":"families pray for indian miners trapped underground for 13 days","story":"Floodwaters hamper rescuers after 15 workers marooned in illegal ‘rat-hole’ pit in north-eastern Meghalaya state Indian rescue workers have renewed their efforts to reach 15 coal miners trapped underground for 13 days as families prayed for their safe return.But hopes of finding them alive looked slim on Wednesday after floodwaters rushed through the illegal “rat-hole” pit.The group went to work in the mine in the north-eastern state of Meghalaya on 13 December and have been underground ever since. “Only God’s grace and some miracle can help them to be alive,” Kyrmen Shylla, Meghalaya’s disaster management minister, told Reuters by telephone from the state capital Shillong. The operation to rescue the miners from the 100m-deep shaft in Ksan was suspended on Sunday following flash floods from a nearby river, officials said. A team of about 100 national disaster response force (NDRF) experts have been camping at the mine site but their operations have been hampered by lack of sophisticated equipment, SK Shastri, NDRF commandant leading the operations, said. “The water level hasn’t gone down an inch - it increased after it rained,” Shastri said. “The two 25-horsepower pumps were ineffective. We need up to 12 100-horsepower pumps to drain out water.”Mining was banned in the mineral-rich state by a federal court in 2014 after local communities said it was polluting water bodies.But the practice continues with locals illegally extracting coal using dangerous “rat hole” mines. This involves digging into the side of hills and then burrowing horizontal tunnels to reach a coal seam.Workers, including children, descend hundreds of feet on bamboo ladders to dig out the coal, often leading to accidents at such mines.At least 15 miners were killed after they were trapped in another flooded rat-hole mine in Meghalaya in 2012. Their bodies were never recovered.Associated Press and Agence-France Presse contributed to this report."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c00275c62a58522adeb0ddb9e5040a4c517b09c/0_0_4127_2476/master/4127.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a99dfcb6aaa23177b145ff0635e7f273","title":"gifts for fascist friends mussolinis calendar comeback","story":"Il Duce and Hitler memorabilia are for sale in Rome, as rightwing populism dismantles taboos There is no hint of embarrassment as the woman clambers on a chair to reach the high shelf of her newspaper kiosk opposite the Italian interior ministry in Rome. “This is just part of the job,” she says as she hands over the final copy of a 2019 calendar dedicated to the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini.A flick through from January to December reveals various images of the rotund man known as Il Duce (the Leader): addressing a crowd bare-chested punching the air in triumph after signing Italy’s 1939 pact with Germany and striding through Rome in military garb.Nostalgic factions of the Italian population have long helped keep the spirit of Mussolini alive, but thriving rightwing populism has been further dismantling the taboo. Matteo Salvini, the interior minister and leader of the far-right League, sometimes quotes Mussolini, while League supporters have attended rallies carrying signs featuring photographs of the dictator alongside the name Salvini. Marches organised by the neo-fascist groups Forza Nuova and CasaPound have become a regular occurrence.Gamma 3000, a Rome-based printer, was the first to start producing Mussolini calendars in the early 1990s and now competes with three rivals. Around 10,000 are printed by the company each year and circulated to newsstands across Italy regardless of whether copies were ordered.“They are included among the newspapers delivered, due to a regulation that allows it,” said Renato Circi, the company’s chief. “But there is no obligation for the newsstand owners to sell them.”Circi noted that demand for the calendar, which costs €9.90 (£8.90), had gone up alongside the rise in populism.“Populism recalls historical personalities,” he said. “In particular, we have noticed more of a presence of young people among the new Mussolini fans.”Steps away from the newsstand is a shop selling bottles of red wine emblazoned with photographs of Mussolini and his murderous counterparts Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin. “People buy them as gifts, perhaps for their fascist friends,” said the shop’s owner, who asked to remain anonymous. “Yes, customers do take offence, but I see it as nothing more than nostalgia.”Italy’s former centre-left administration brought in a law in 2017 intended to curb the distribution of fascist paraphernalia, but failed to get it approved by both chambers of parliament before the end of its term.Circi feels no shame in printing the calendars, which can also be found on Amazon. “We produce calendars that range from cats to Pope Francis and Padre Pio to Barbie, because that’s what the market wants. The same with Mussolini – we’re a publishing house that serves the demands of the market.”During Mussolini’s 20-year dictatorship he sent thousands of Jews to their deaths, interned gay people on the Adriatic island of San Domino, gagged the free press and executed political opponents. Mussolini and his mistress, Clara Petacci, were shot dead by partisans in the final days of the second world war before their bodies were strung up on a meat hook in a Milan square.One of the reasons his spirit lingers is because some Italians consider him to be the country’s last “strongman” leader, who not only restored law and order but who built better housing, roads, transport systems and schools, while also investing in industry.Silvio Berlusconi, who arrived on the political scene in the early 1990s and went on to lead Italy three times, was the first to help rehabilitate Mussolini’s image by praising the dictator and allying with National Alliance, which emerged from the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement (MSI).Salvini, who mimics the dictator’s direct but polarising communication style, now keeps him a presence in Italian political life. “Salvini supporters are not necessarily fascist but they don’t accept the pre-emptive rejection of fascism,” said Antonio Scurati, the author of M, a novel about Mussolini’s rise to power. “So they are not outraged if their leader quotes Mussolini as for them it’s more about rejecting the moral superiority of the left which condemns fascism.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da6ffad688ff7a9c0007c7d763f3d462ae9bddea/0_211_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=717a0855add9f1d5bdd13712f363d43b","title":"us explorer colin obrady completes first unaided solo traverse of antarctica","story":"The endurance athlete took 54 days to walk 1,500km across the frozen continent, dragging a 170-kg sledAn American has become the first person to traverse Antarctica alone without any assistance, trekking across the polar continent in an epic 54-day journey that was previously deemed impossible.Colin O’Brady, of Portland, Oregon finished the bone-chilling, 930-mile (1,500-km) journey on Wednesday as friends, family and fans tracked his progress online.“I did it!” a tearful O’Brady said on a call to his family gathered in Portland for the holidays, according to his wife, Jenna Besaw.“It was an emotional call,” she said. “He seemed overwhelmed by love and gratitude, and he really wanted to say ‘Thank you’ to all of us.”O’Brady could not immediately be reached for comment.The 33-year-old O’Brady documented his journey, which was almost entirely uphill and which he called The Impossible First, on his Instagram page . He wrote on Wednesday that he covered the last roughly 80 miles (129km) in one big, impromptu final push to the finish line that took well over an entire day.“While the last 32 hours were some of the most challenging hours of my life, they have quite honestly been some of the best moments I have ever experienced,” O’Brady posted.The day before, he posted that he was “in the zone” and thought he could make it to the end in one go.“I’m listening to my body and taking care of the details to keep myself safe,” he wrote. “I called home and talked to my mom, sister and wife I promised them I will stop when I need to.”Though others have traversed Antarctica, they either had assistance with reinforced supplies or kites that helped propel them forward.In 2016, British explorer Henry Worsley died attempting an unassisted solo trip across Antarctica, collapsing from exhaustion toward the end of the trek. Worsley’s friend and fellow English adventurer Louis Rudd is currently attempting an unaided solo in Worsley’s honor and was competing against O’Brady to be the first to complete the feat.O’Brady described in detail the ups and downs along the way since he began the trek on 3 November. He had to haul 170kg of gear largely uphill and over sastrugi, wave-like ridges created by wind.“Not only am I pulling my ... sled all day, but I’m pulling it up and over thousands of these sastrugi speed bumps created by the violent wind,” he wrote in an Instagram post on 12 November. “It’s a frustrating process at times to say the least.”On Day 37, or 9 December, O’Brady wrote about how much he’s changed, along with a selfie in which he looks almost in pain, snow gathered around his furry hat.“I’m no longer the same person I was when I left on the journey, can you see it in my face?” he wrote. “I’ve suffered, been deathly afraid, cold and alone. I’ve laughed and danced, cried tears of joy and been awestruck with love and inspiration.”Though O’Brady had initially thought he’d want a cheeseburger at the end of his nearly impossible journey, Besaw said her husband has been fantasizing about fresh fish and salad because he has mostly been eating freeze-dried foods."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3741803.1545850569!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin metrolink application unlikely before 2020","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t  link opposition group   Rethink link stage a protest on December 22nd at Beachwood Luas Stop, Rathmines, Co Dublin. Photograph: Nick Bradshaw An application to build the Dublin link rail line is unlikely to be made until 2020 due to delays in determining a revised route for the line, it has emerged.Transport authorities had been due to announce the redesigned route of the line last August, but postponed their decision, and had been expected to publish the route details by November.However, publication of the revised route was further delayed until the new year to allow time to design an extension of the underground section past Ranelagh in south Dublin. The additional tunnelling was likely to add more than €100 million to the cost of the €3 billion line.Construction of the line was due to start in 2021 for completion in 2027 and it is not yet known if this schedule will be affected.The preferred route of the metro line, which combines the previously planned  North from Swords to the city centre with an upgrade of the Luas Green line between Charlemont and Sandyford, was announced last March.However, in the subsequent months the transport authorities came under pressure from senior politicians – including Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy – as well as the GAA to alter the route.The route had involved the use of Na Fianna GAA club and adjoining school pitches on Mobhi Road in Glasnevin for a major construction site. Mr Varadkar last May said the proposals would cause “enormous damage” to the schools and sports clubs that use the Glasnevin lands.It had also required the closure of a road linking Rathmines and Ranelagh in south Dublin. Mr Murphy asked the transport bodies to scrap plans to close the level crossing from Dunville Avenue to Beechwood Road in Ranelagh, which would force motorists into a 1.2km detour.The transport authorities initially prepared two solutions for the Dunville Avenue crossing one involved the construction of a rail bridge over the road, the other would see the construction of a railway “cutting” allowing the train to travel under the road. These options would have added in the region of €25-€35 million to the line’s €3 billion budget.However, these options were not acceptable locally, and the authorities are planning to extend the tunnel, which was due to end at the current Luas Charlemont stop north of Ranelagh, south, past the Dunville Avenue junction.Lands belonging to Home Farm Football Club are expected to be used instead of the GAA lands.A spokesman for the National Transport Authority said there were a “number of very important public concerns and engineering elements contained within a project this scale and complexity” which it was working to resolve."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3741798.1545850476!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"opposition to metrolink plan for south dublin continues","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tlink opponents Rethink link at Beachwood Luas Stop.

Photograph: Nick Bradshaw Last March, when the National Transport Authority (NTA) published its preferred route for the link rail line, there was consternation in south Dublin over plans to replace the existing Green Luas line.The contentious element was the proposal to have the new underground line pop up at the Luas Charlemont stop and run south, above ground, along what is currently the Green line.Unlike trams the metro trains run at high speed and require segregation from other traffic, which isn’t a problem on most of the line south of Charlemont, with a handful of exceptions, most notably at the Beechwood stop where the NTA proposed to close the through-road from Dunville Avenue to Beechwood Road.This proposal met strenuous opposition from almost 30 residents groups, in addition to inidual residents, and politicians, including Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy and former minister for justice Michael McDowell. It was claimed the project would split communities, would compound already terrible traffic, and force motorists into a 1.2km detour through Ranelagh village.Following this pressure, the NTA last summer agreed to review the line to avoid the road closure, and it is now understood to be planning to keep the line underground until it has travelled south of the Beechwood stop.Road open – case closed, some observers might assume, but for the Rethink link campaign the battle against the “Berlin Wall” of the southside rages on.“Dunville Avenue was our initial concern, but we are of the view that the route needs to stay underground until it has passed all established residential neighbourhoods,” Rethink link spokesman Pat Galvin said.Mr Galvin said he was particularly concerned about the lack of awareness by Luas users of the impending disruption to the line.“We have been distributing our information leaflet early mornings at Luas stops and most people did not know the line would be segregated and did not know the Luas would be closed for between nine months and two years of construction work.”A spokesman for the NTA said it had not issued any timelines in relation to stop or line closures. Mr Galvin said these estimates were based on the construction of similar projects.“It is not acceptable that a heavy rail line would come up in a Victorian neighbourhood like Ranelagh and Rathmines, but this is more than just a local issue,” he said. “We are all for transport infrastructure, but this plan simply replaces an existing line, when other areas such as Templeogue to the west, or UCD to the east, could be served by an underground line.”Green Party leader Eamon Ryan agrees the NTA should consider alternative routes.“We are in a crisis in transport in the the city. Even in the last six months gridlock has shot off the Richter scale. I just think we should grasp the opportunity to think bigger.”He said instead of replacing the Luas Green line with the metro, the NTA should consider two options: one to keep the line underground and run it from Charlemont to Rathmines, Terenure and Rathfarnham or otherwise to head east underground to UCD and then south on land reserved for the Eastern bypass towards Sandyford.Either option would relieve “terrible traffic congestion”, with the Rathfarnham option in particular tackling what was “the worst public transport black spot in our city”.While Mr Ryan’s proposals would likely cost more, he said the outlay would pay idends in the long run.“Getting the tunnel boring machine into the ground is where the real costs lie, so just keep it in the ground. It’s not good enough to say it will cost more. It’s a win-win situation. It may cost €500 million or €600 million but in the long term you get huge bang for your buck.”These large scale changes would not necessarily create delays for the project, Mr Ryan said as the NTA could pursue the northern sections of the line and give an indicative outline of the southside which could then be subject to more detailed designs.The NTA’s revisions of its route would not include consideration of entirely new lines. the authority said. However Mr Ryan said: “The NTA does not have the final call – they have to get political direction.”In the city centre, the residents of the College Gate apartment complex remain hopeful that the NTA will reverse plans to demolish their homes. The block of 70 apartments, and the Markievicz leisure centre beneath them, were earmarked for demolition in the plans published last March“There are alternatives to demolishing our apartments and we are still hopeful the NTA will use them. We are waiting to see what they will produce in January or February, but if there is any more delay than that we will make our voices heard,” Nicola Brait of the Save College Gate campaign said.A spokesman for the NTA said public consultation following the publication of the preferred route “informed the process and the issues raised need to be worked through”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3741854.1545856218!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar remarks on health staff leave spark public response","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar on Christmas Day  with staff at the emergency department at Cork University Hospital. Nearly three dozen people – many of them nurses – wrote to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to complain about his comments about healthcare staff taking leave in the busy period after Christmas.However, a small number of people wrote to the Department of An Taoiseach supporting Mr Varadkar’s comments in the Dáil last month. On November 7th, the Taoiseach said the health service needed to make sure this winter that consultants would “not be on holidays in the first week of the year, particularly those who work in emergency departments, and that nurses will not be on leave in the first two weeks of January”.He said in the busy period after Christmas “we need to make sure that every bed will be open” and that radiology facilities and laboratories were fully operational.The department released 35 emails and letters, with the identification of the writers redacted, which it had received from members of the public on foot of Mr Varadkar’s remarks.Various writers said they were “outraged” or “stunned” at his comments.A number argued that Mr Varadkar should use his medical training to help out doctors working in an emergency department over Christmas.“As a very hard-working nurse, I am absolutely disgusted and furious with your comments regarding nurses and Christmas holidays,” wrote one. “Firstly if you knew anything, nurses do not take extended leave over Christmas. We are lucky to get an extra day off. Do you want us to come in on our days off!!!!”Another wrote: “Last Christmas I left my family at home (as I have done many years) and I went to work. Night duty on 2526 December. Neither I nor any of my colleagues had so much as a coffee break as we were working so hard to keep up with the workload. In my hospital there is no annual leave for nurses over the Christmas period and all beds remain open.”A parent of a nurse told Mr Varadkar that the problem in the health service was not money but rather leadership and moral courage. The letter writer called for nurses’ pay to be doubled through the provision of additional allowances and for them to be provided with meals and car parking spaces.“My daughter would often get no time off because on her days off ‘management’ would regularly hound her to come in to cover for someone who did not show up due to sickness. Thus on her days ‘off’ she had no peace of mind. She aged seven years in one single year.”One doctor wrote to the Taoiseach highlighting how various medical, nursing and other staff would be at work.“May I mention too that during this time I will be missing an important and special family holiday as we are prohibited from taking leave during this period.“I hope you think of us as you tuck into your turkey. We will certainly remember your offensive and disillusioning remarks on election day as we consider greener pastures.”However there were some messages supporting Mr Varadkar’s comments.One letter writer maintained a relative had had to spend the Christmas period in hospital a number of years ago “because her consultant, his whole team and indeed all consultants and teams were on extended Christmas holidays. During this period, there was one nurse on duty in the isolation ward and one A\u0026ampE doctor on call.“The Taoiseach is perfectly right to call out hospital staff taking extended Christmas holidays at one of the busiest times of the year.”One administrative healthcare worker also wrote to agree with Mr Varadkar. “Since starting my employment in the hospital years ago, I was always told that I had to keep holidays in order for me to be off during the Christmas period. However last year and this year, we have now been told we have to cover the administrative duties during the Christmas period.“We did have objections to this but our main point was, what was the point of administrative staff coming in to cover the Christmas period when there were no clinics as the nurses and doctors were not coming in.“I am right behind you as I always believed this was unbelievable in a setting where we are meant to be caring for Ireland’s most needy and vulnerable people.”Mr Varadkar visited Cork University Hospital on Christmas Day where he acknowledged the work of frontline staff. Staff members in hospitals around the country have taken to Twitter in recent days posting images of themselves at work with the hashtags #WeAreWorking and #IAmAtWorkLeo."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Living organisms can be used in the construction of buildings and to heat and light themResearch Lives: Prof Gianpiero Cavalleri, associate professor of human genetics and deputy director of the SFI FutureNeuro Research Centre of Excellence at RCSIS\u0026eacuteamus Woulfe questions if planned graduated speeding penalties are \u0026lsquoproportionate\u0026rsquoState may sell off the name of the flagship buildingHarris considering sponsor opportunities for overall and sectional nomenclature at site\u0026lsquoDeer management units\u0026rsquo to curb population of animals over associated problemsDelays in determining revised route for rail line force authorities to push back projectResidents vow to continue battle against \u0026lsquoBerlin Wall\u0026rsquo rail lineCriticism of festive holiday-taking comments include invitation for Taoiseach to help outTrio in unfit Coombe flat say alternatives on offer are \u0026lsquohumiliating\u0026rsquoWomen\u0026rsquos Aid reminds victims of available supports after receiving 688 calls in 11 daysGroup criticises attempt to gauge public opinion on exemptions from Irish at schoolGovernment says body would oversee political advertising on internet and social mediaIf Britain did not abolish daylight saving time with EU, Ireland could have two time zonesChange in circumstances could trigger election next year, says TaoiseachActor, balladeer, folklorist and trade unionist appeared in 42 films, debuting in \u0026lsquoMy Left Foot\u0026rsquo\u0026lsquoUnprecedented\u0026rsquo crowds enjoy unseasonal weather as Ellie Mac makes Grade One debutCase was one of the emergency applications before Dublin family court on December 24thSt Mary\u0026rsquos Pro-Cathedral issues appeal for presents it can give to those in needBrown Thomas says more Irish buyers are shopping this year for luxury handbags"},{"url":null,"title":"most","story":"Babies in cages were no \u0026lsquomistake\u0026rsquo by Trump but test-marketing for barbarismReview: Cinema\u0026rsquos dullest couple adjust to married life in this tedious instalmentExit poll result suggests huge majority of younger people voted YesPolice say they are treating death of singer at London hotel as \u0026lsquounexplained\u0026rsquoAccused Paddy Jackson, Stuart Olding, Blane McIlroy and Rory Harrison not guilty on all countsAnn Lovett died in 1984 after giving birth at a grotto in Granard, Co Longford \u0026ndash a tragedy that continues to resonate.

But the key test is: can you actually deliver? Can you get your legislative programme through? Can you get your policies implemented?” he said. “And so far in co-operation with Fianna Fáil we’ve been able to do that. But there are many reasons why that may change.”"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Fire, danger, health and air quality warnings issued across the countryJapanese prime minister Shinzo Abe describes demographics as a national crisisCrater collapse on volcanic island triggered a tsunami that killed at least 430 peopleMoves follows decision to withdraw from International Whaling CommissionAnak Krakatu volcano continues to spew ash as search and rescue efforts continueDoubts over whether whaling can be economically viable given low demand for meatAuthorities tell residents to stay 500 metres from coast amid concerns over high wavesPresident vows to have all tsunami-detection equipment replaced or repairedMore than 1,400 people injured as about 12,000 forced to move to higher groundNawaz Sharif fined $25m on corruption charges he says were politically motivatedEngineers to enter Opal Tower complex to examine if building in danger of collapseCoastal residents reported not seeing or feeling any warning signs before 3m waves hitAkihito (85) will abdicate ceremonial role in April after 30 years on the throneWorkers were trapped by smoke after blaze underground in SolikamskZamanbol (14) is part of a generation of nomadic youth embracing ancient customs as they seek connection with their roots and the wildTwo Chinese nationals charged in relation to campaign across Europe, Asia and USCountry maintains most whale species are no longer endangeredHigh-profile arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou continues to sour relationsOne section dedicated to role of president\u0026rsquos pivotal crackdown on corruptionChinese leader hails four decades of reform in speech at the Great Hall of the People"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3742159.1545893877!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"indonesia orders flights to avoid erupting anak krakatau volcano","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA child holds a chicken while standing among debris at an area affected by the tsunami in  Banten province, Indonesia. Photograph: Jorge SilvaReutersIndonesia on Thursday raised the alert level for the erupting Anak Krakatau volcano to the second-highest, and ordered all flights to steer clear, days after it triggered a tsunami that killed at least 430 people.A crater collapse on the volcanic island at high tide on Saturday sent waves up to 5 metres (16 feet) high smashing into the coast on the Sunda Strait, between the islands of Java and Sumatra.Authorities have warned that the crater of Anak Krakatau, or child of Krakatau, remains fragile, raising fears of another collapse and tsunami, and have urged residents to stay away from the coast.The volcano has been rumbling on and off since July but has been particularly active since Sunday, spewing lava and rocks, and sending huge clouds of ash up to 3,000 metres into heavily overcast skies.The national geological agency, in raising the alert level to the second-highest, set a 5km exclusion zone around the island.“Since December 23rd, activity has not stopped . . . We anticipate a further escalation,” said Antonius Ratdomopurbo, secretary of the geological agency.A thin layer of volcanic ash has been settling on buildings, vehicles and vegetation along the west coast of Java since late on Wednesday, according to images shared by the national disaster mitigation agency.Authorities said the ash was not dangerous, but advised residents to wear masks and goggles when outside, while aircraft were ordered away.“All flights are rerouted due to Krakatau volcano ash on red alert,” the government air-traffic control agency AirNav said in a release.The civil aviation authority said no airports would be affected. The capital, Jakarta, is about 155 km east of the volcano.In 1883, the volcano then known as Krakatoa erupted in one of the biggest blasts in recorded history, killing more than 36,000 people in a series of tsunami and lowering the global surface temperature by one degree Celsius with its ash.Anak Krakatau is the island that emerged from the area in 1927 and has been growing ever since.Indonesia is a vast archipelago that sits on the Pacific “Ring of Fire”. This year, the country has suffered its worst annual death toll from disasters in more than a decade.The latest tsunami disaster, coming during the Christmas season, evoked memories of the Indian Ocean tsunami triggered by an earthquake on December 26th, 2004, which killed 226,000 people in 14 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia.Tsunami warning systems were set up after 2004 but they have failed to prevent subsequent disasters, often because apparatus has not been maintained properly, while public education and disaster preparation efforts have been patchy at best.Ramdi Tualfredi, a teacher in the village of Cigondong, on Java’s west coast, said he had never got any instructions on safety steps and efforts to prepare communities for tsunami had “totally failed”.“There were no preparations. I didn’t get information from anywhere,” he said, adding there had been little help for residents since disaster struck.Nearly 22,000 people were displaced by the tsunami, while 1,495 were injured and 159 are missing.Most of the displaced are staying in crowded shelters.Aid is getting through and the government has declared a state of emergency until January 4th, to help with the distribution of assistance. – Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3741680.1545841202!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us mexico border they treat us like we take and all we ve done is give","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tActivists at the gate near the border crossing fence at the Tornillo Port of Entry near El Paso, Texas,  during a protest rally by several American mayors against the US administration’s family separation policy. Photograph: Brendan SmialowskiAFPGetty ImagesTravelling from the central capital of Austin to the western reaches of El Paso takes two flights and nearly four hours of travel. Such is the scale of Texas. From the air, after stretches of flat, almost extra-terrestrial expanse, high desert mountains emerge out of nothing.Yet on the streets of El Paso, the idea of a barren border frontier is not reality. The fence runs directly beside the highway, along the Rio Grande, the historical border established in 1848 after the Mexican-American War (or what Mexicans call the War of North American Aggression). Now in drought, this stretch of the Rio Grande is more of a thin stream.Walking up to the border fence at mile marker 357, three young children approach from the Mexican side. This is something they are accustomed to, and they know what they’re after. With a cheeky smile and easy manners, a nine-year-old boy offers to climb the 8m fence for a dollar. He is gently warned against it.After years of over-reliance on an industry of cheap labour, El Paso is now experiencing a boom, with the resulting influx of young professionals from around the country. Through the fence, in Juárez, the children stand before poor structures and ground strewn with uncollected rubbish.When asked what they want to be when they grow up, the children answer in soft Spanish, “a doctor”, “a lawyer”. They look through metal bars that might make these dreams impossibilities.These kids can see the products of privilege – winners of the geographical lottery – right in front of them: a veteran border reporter, a cameraman, and a visitor from Ireland. They can reach out and take our hands. Yet day by day it seems less likely that they will make it to the other side of the ide.As the three children talk through the fence, showing off their companion, a stray dog, a Border Patrol truck rolls slowly down the hill toward where we stand. The interaction is surprisingly pleasant. The agent, who tells us he is from Chicago (it is in fact common that Border Patrol agents are from nowhere near the border), chides the kids. In Spanish, he tells them they ought to be studying. Again, they suggest a dollar might induce them to abandon the fence and hit the books. Laughing, the agent checks that everything is okay, that nothing is being passed between us through the fence. He nods and drives on, resuming his perch on the sloping hill above mile marker 357.When the Trump administration sent hundreds of active-duty military personnel to the border, it was not to fend off Mexican children living in Juárez. The intention was to stop what the president called an “invasion” of Central Americans travelling from Guatemala and Honduras through Mexico to the US border, seeking asylum.The administration implemented a policy of family separation, splitting children from their parents. The policy is meant to be a deterrent the UN has characterised it as child abuse. Hundreds of children have still not been reunited with parents or s, instead remaining in temporary tent cities under guard. On December 8th, seven-year-old Jakelin Caal Maquin of Guatemala died of dehydration in Border Patrol custody in El Paso, after being apprehended on the US-Mexico border. A second Guatemalan child (8) died of causes not yet known in US government custody in Alamogordo, New Mexico, on Christmas Day.John Morán González, director of the Center for Mexican American Studies at the University of Texas at Austin, says “The quasi-militarisation of the border has only highlighted how the movement of commodities – including illicit drugs going north and illicit arms going south – have taken precedence over the movement of migrants, the vast majority of whom have the right to seek asylum in the United States.“The tragic death of Jakelin Caal Maquin should be fully investigated, especially when viewed in the context of a decades-long project by the Border Patrol to funnel migrants into extremely hostile desert terrain while denying any responsibility for the predictable ensuing tragedies.”President Donald Trump claimed that he would be “proud to shut down the government”, and then did so, to try to force the Democratic minority to approve spending on his proposed border wall. While it is doubtful that such a project would have any impact on the numbers of migrants travelling through Mexico seeking asylum in the United States, it is certain that enhancing the physical structures separating border communities like El Paso-Juárez would further scar this landscape, separating families and communities that hardly recognise the ision.As González points out, these policies continue to “diminish or disrupt the historical ties between people on both sides of the border”.In Benjamin Alire Sáenz’s apartment near downtown El Paso, almost every surface is covered with books and arresting art. Many of the paintings and books are Sáenz’s own work.Sáenz is acknowledged as one of the great poets and novelists of these borderlands, and his life’s work demonstrates the internal isions symbolised by the border fence that runs through his city.Over a dinner of homemade tamales, beans and red wine, Sáenz begins a conversation that carries over into the next day.“El Paso would not exist without Juárez,” he says. “No border town can do without the sister city. How can we conceive of one without the other? We took its name. Juárez used to be Paso del Norte. Then it became Juárez, and we became Paso del Norte. We give each other identities.” The poet’s tone turns from matter of fact to grave.“I know one other thing we should all tell the truth about: borders exist for the poor. There are no borders for the rich. That’s why we say we need borders: we know who we are keeping out.”Tears well up in Sáenz’s eyes and his voice shakes. “The Mexican-American people have helped make this country great, and they have never been properly thanked. They treat us like we take, and all we’ve done is give. That’s the truth. I work out of that truth. When I write about the border and its people, I want to say, ‘do not dismiss us”. And I don’t give them an opportunity to dismiss me.”In the mid-2000s, in the midst of devastating drug cartel violence, Juárez was known as the murder capital of the world. Today its sister city El Paso, just hundreds of yards across the bridge known as El Paso del Norte, is the safest city in the United States, and Juárez has seen a revitalisation. Paying 50 cents to cross the footbridge into the Mexican city, I walk to the famous Kentucky Club, reputed to be the birthplace of the margarita.On the street, Mexican music blares from shop fronts. A mariachi band of elderly men plays on the footpath. Only a decade ago, I would have been accused of having a death wish for making this journey, but today, walking from the Kentucky Club deeper into Juárez to its stately cathedral, I am as relaxed on this side of the border as on the other. There are poor people here, but I see no invaders.Back in El Paso, a Mexican-American native of these borderlands, Joel Barron, drives through the streets of his beloved city. He is stout and strong, a former security professional. “I am incognito,” he says. “People think of me as just a driver. I am a single father. I do this job to raise my 10-year-old daughter. But I’m an English major.” He warns of the shortcomings of monolingual people and cultures.“One’s perception is one’s truth,” Barron says. It is a reminder that “reality” here on the border is too often shaped to fit political ends and ideologies. The truth is something quite different.Read more about the Donald Trump administration"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

Italy\u0027s national seismology institute said it registered a magnitude of 4.8 and occurred at a relatively shallow depth, 1 kilometer (0.6 mile) under the mountain\u0027s surface.The temblor damaged some rural homes, including structures that had been abandoned years ago, toppled a Madonna statue in a church in the town of Santa Venerina and opened up cracks on a highway, which was closed for inspection, Rai state radio said.One 80-year-old man was safely extracted from the rubble of his home, the Italian news agency ANSA said.A woman told state radio that a heavy armoire in her home had toppled over, trapping her sister, who was then safely pulled out by her father. In another house, a ceiling collapsed.Etna remains a dangerous volcano, and this country of ours is unfortunately fragile, government undersecretary Vito Crimi said, adding there were no fatalities and 10 slight injuries.The quake was also felt in the upscale Sicilian resort town of Taormina.The Civil Protection agency said temporary shelters were being set up for people whose houses were damaged or who were too alarmed to return to their homes.In recent days, Etna\u0027s latest eruption has been shooting volcanic ash, heavy smoke and lava stones into the air, coating roads and homes nearby with ash. A new fracture has opened near Etna\u0027s southeast crater and lava has been flowing down an uninhabited slope.Etna, the largest of Italy\u0027s three active volcanoes, has been particularly active since July. Politically correct European Parliament urges end to words like \u0026#39man-made\u0026#39, \u0026#39mankind\u0026#39 and \u0026#39layman\u0026#39Gurkha’s son threatens to sue UK government for discrimination amid passport delay rowComment: A soldier\u0026#39s life doesn\u0026#39t stop at ChristmasTributes to British couple who died within hours of each other in AustraliaIndonesia reroutes all flights around Anak Krakatau volcano after raising alert levelAmerican beats British army captain in becoming first person to cross Antarctic unaidedHow extreme weather in 2018 cost the world billionsPicky millennials most likely to be disappointed by their Christmas presents, research findsGender gap in pop music charts nearly closed after string of hits by female singers, new data showsChildren\u0026#39s hospices to receive funding boost under NHS plans Parents told not to wrap children\u0026#39s sandwiches in cling film as part of crackdown on plasticHospitals accused of putting a \u0026#39tax on the sick\u0026#39 as some double parking feesTV ratings for Queen\u0026#39s Christmas Speech drop by one million, amid suggestions Netflix could be to blameSearch for British cruise entertainer who fell overboard from Royal Caribbean ship on Christmas DayComment: While politicians posture and panic, the \u0026#39little people\u0026#39 will get us through a no deal BrexitDonald Trump makes surprise visit to Iraq over Christmas to meet US soldiersFraud victims face a postcode lottery in their battle for justiceRail travellers face delays into New Year as festive track works spill overMigrants sail dinghy into Dover before walking to police station to seek asylumWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/12/27/TELEMMGLPICT000184369688_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"indonesia reroutes flights around anak krakatau volcano raising","story":"The Anak Krakatau volcano erupting, as seen from a ship on the Sunda StraitsIndonesia on Thursday raised the alert level for the erupting Anak Krakatau volcano to the second-highest, and ordered all flights to steer clear, days after it triggered a tsunami that killed at least 430 people.A crater collapse on the volcanic island at high tide on Saturday sent waves up to 16 feet high smashing into the coast on the Sunda Strait, between the islands of Java and Bali.Authorities have warned that the crater of Anak Krakatau, or child of Krakatau, remains fragile, raising fears of another collapse and tsunami, and have urged residents to stay away from the coast.There are also fears of a bigger eruption.The volcano has been rumbling on and off since July but has been particularly active since Sunday, spewing lava and rocks, and sending huge clouds of ash up to 3,000 metres into heavily overcast skies.Indonesia tsunami after eruption - in picturesThe national geological agency, in raising the alert level to the second-highest, set a 5-km exclusion zone around the island.Since December 23, activity has not stopped ... We anticipate a further escalation, said Antonius Ratdomopurbo, secretary of the geological agency.Satellite photos aren\u0027t available because of cloud cover but radar images from a Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency satellite taken before and after the eruption show the volcano\u0027s southwestern flank has disappeared.Dave Petley, head of research and innovation at Sheffield University who analyzed similar images from a European Space Agency satellite, said they support the theory that a landslide, most of it undersea, caused the tsunami.The challenge now is to interpret what might be happening on the volcano, and what might happen next, he wrote in a blog.This combination of images taken by JAXA\u0026#39s ALOS-2 satellite shows Indonesia\u0026#39s Anak Krakatau volcano, centre in images, before and after the tsunamiA thin layer of volcanic ash has been settling on buildings, vehicles and vegetation along the west coast of Java since late on Wednesday, according to images shared by the national disaster mitigation agency.Authorities said the ash was not dangerous, but advised residents to wear masks and goggles when outside, while aircraft were ordered away.All flights are rerouted due to Krakatau volcano ash on red alert, the government air-traffic control agency AirNav said in a release.The civil aviation authority said no airports would be affected. The capital, Jakarta, is about 155 km east of the volcano.The status change sparked new fears with many local residents already scared and refusing to return to their communities over fears of another tsunami.This worries me, said Ugi Sugiarti, a cook at the Augusta Hotel in hard-hit Carita.

Children now drink out of beakers which they can wash up and re-use.Julian Thomas, the headmaster, said there used to be an “awful lot” of children who arrived at school with plastic water bottles and sandwiches wrapped in cling film in their packed lunch boxes.But since the school’s drive to become single use plastic free, parents have started giving their children washable sandwich bags made from cotton and reusable water bottles.Our school cook has done a huge amount of work with all the produce that comes into school,” he told The Daily .Plastic consumption | The war on strawsWe spoke to all the suppliers about sending things in cardboard boxes or unwrapped, or we said we can send the wrapping back. We have even refuse deliveries, and we are doing an awful lot of unpacking and sending back wrapping.“We were the first plastic free school in the country, but there was one in Cornwall which was only about a week behind us, and now there are another 20 or so around the country.”The new 10p charge on plastic bags aims to slash the 3.6bn single-use bags supplied annually by smaller retailers. Classed as those with fewer than 250 employees, about a fifth of the 253,000 smaller retailers have so far introduced a voluntary 5p charge.They will, however, be exempted from the current rules for bigger stores that require them to report on their reduced use and what they have done with the money saved.Failure to comply can lead to fines of up to £20,000 and local authorities can send inspectors into shops to carry out secret shopper exercises to make sure bags are being charged correctly.Announcing a consultation on the plans, Michael Gove, the environment secretary, said: The 5p single-use plastic carrier bag charge has been extremely successful in reducing the amount of plastic we use in our everyday lives.But we want to do even more to protect our precious planet and today\u0027s announcement will accelerate further behaviour change and build on the success of the existing charge.The move was welcomed by Association of Convenience Stores chief executive James Lowman. This has been shown to be highly effective at reducing waste, whilst also raising money for local, national and environmental charities, he said.Mr Hinds said: “On my first school visit as Education  Secretary almost a year ago, the very first question I was asked by a pupil was what we can do to limit the damage of plastic on the environment.“Reducing our use of plastic clearly is an important and timely issue which has captured the interest and the imagination of everyone in society. Plastic can harm our precious environment and be lethal to wildlife.”Go plastic-free | Eight easy ways to reduce useHe went on: “It’s not always easy but we all have a role to play in driving out avoidable plastic waste, and with more schools joining others and leading by example, we can help to leave our planet in a better state than we found it.”A poll commissioned earlier this year by BRITA UK and Keep Britain Tidy found that young people were more committed than older generations in mitigating the effects of single-use plastic.According to the YouGov survey, 68 per cent of 18 to 24 year olds currently own a reusable water bottle, above the national average of 55 per cent.Mr Thomas said he welcomed the Government’s push for all schools to become plastic free, but added that this may be difficult to achieve in practice since there are no incentives to make changes, and no penalties if they decline to act.“Some schools will be in a situation where they think it is important - but there is no incentive, there’s no push,” he said.“Schools have got an awful lot of their plate so unless they really want to do it, it might be hard to prioritise.”Department for EducationPlease review our commenting policyPolitically correct European Parliament urges end to words like \u0026#39man-made\u0026#39, \u0026#39mankind\u0026#39 and \u0026#39layman\u0026#39Gurkha’s son threatens to sue UK government for discrimination amid passport delay rowComment: A soldier\u0026#39s life doesn\u0026#39t stop at ChristmasTributes to British couple who died within hours of each other in AustraliaIndonesia reroutes all flights around Anak Krakatau volcano after raising alert levelAmerican beats British army captain in becoming first person to cross Antarctic unaidedHow extreme weather in 2018 cost the world billionsChildren\u0026#39s hospices to receive funding boost under NHS plans Picky millennials most likely to be disappointed by their Christmas presents, research findsGender gap in pop music charts nearly closed after string of hits by female singers, new data showsHospitals accused of putting a \u0026#39tax on the sick\u0026#39 as some double parking feesTV ratings for Queen\u0026#39s Christmas Speech drop by one million, amid suggestions Netflix could be to blameSearch for British cruise entertainer who fell overboard from Royal Caribbean ship on Christmas DayComment: While politicians posture and panic, the \u0026#39little people\u0026#39 will get us through a no deal BrexitDonald Trump makes surprise visit to Iraq over Christmas to meet US soldiersFraud victims face a postcode lottery in their battle for justiceRail travellers face delays into New Year as festive track works spill overMigrants sail dinghy into Dover before walking to police station to seek asylumWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/12/25/10/istock-926379132.jpg","title":"amazon echo christmas features update how enable alexa santa commands","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

But is that reasonable?In 2017 Liam Fox famously claimed that concluding a trade deal with the European Union after Brexit would be the “easiest in human history” because we’d start from a position of already being fully aligned on tariffs and regulation.Such bullishness is notable by its absence now.Indeed, one of the reasons Brexiteers are so alarmed by the Irish “backstop” provision of the withdrawal agreement is that even they doubt that there will be a free trade agreement between the UK and the EU in place by January 2021\u0026nbspwhen the transition is supposed to end.But what are the prospects for trade deals between the UK and the rest of the world after Brexit? What deals could we strike with the likes of China, India, Brazil and other emerging markets?A glance at the international trade secretary’s Twitter feed\u0026nbspshows he remains upbeat on such prospects. Is this warranted?The answer is that it will depend\u0026nbspto a significant extent on what sort of trade deal the UK can get with the EU.Brexit is a mess, so why are MPs not postponing their Christmas break?Other countries are very likely to wait until they see how close we end up to the EU’s single market and the customs union before deciding, as that will impact the cost-benefit calculation of any bilateral UK trade deal for their firms and industries.If we end up closely aligned on customs with the EU that might limit our government’s autonomy to even forge independent trade deals on goods with third countries since we could be imposing the EU’s common external tariff.What about services? Well, presuming we’re out of the single market, that would give us more scope for services trade deals. And it’s true that services are a large and growing share of UK total exports.Yet the problem here is that international trade deals in recent years have been essentially about goods, rather than services.Another snag, at least from the perspective of sovereignty-obsessed Brexiteers, is that a service deal worth having would entail some degree of regulatory harmonisation, for instance recognising each others’ professional qualifications. Is that “taking back control”?Associated to that question is immigration. “A big ask of emerging markets when it comes to trade deals is UK visas for their nationals,” says Sam Lowe of the Centre for European Reform.That may not go down well with those Brexiteers who want less immigration from developing countries, not more.Finally, there’s “gravity” to think about. It’s an empirical reality that countries tend to do more trade with big economies that are closer to them than those that are further away.Even if we did successfully forge goods and services trade deals with lots of emerging market economies the results might well be disappointing to Brexiteers, like Fox, who have assumed big increases in trade flows.It’s for this reason that almost all Brexit modelling exercises, including the government’s\u0026nbspone, show only a modest gain to UK GDP in the long term from hypothetical post-Brexit trade deals with the rest of the world, with the damage far outweighed by the macroeconomic costs of introducing trade frictions between us and the EU.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

He was holding a print-out of the draft of an article I’d written. “You did law, didn’t you,” he stated. It was true, my degree was in law. I nodded.\u0026nbsp“What’s this?” He asked, pointing to his desk. “It’s a desk,” I said. “Well f*****g well say so. Don’t say, ‘it’s got a flat top and four legs, and therefore might be a desk.’ It’s a desk.”I can’t tell you how often I’m reminded of Bambridge’s words. There is hardly a day that goes by when I don’t see a piece of writing or hear a speech that is pure verbiage, and can only have been produced by a lawyer or a robot, or both.\u0026nbspThe latest example is particularly shocking. When I last looked, BT was supposed to be a communications company. Okay, telecommunications. But a corporation, nevertheless, that ought to pride itself on directness and speed of delivery. In that context, the ability of the receiver to comprehend should be paramount.\u0026nbspUnited Airlines mocked for corporate speak response to passenger rowSo, take this, from BT as it promises to overhaul its pay policies after the investor backlash following the £2.3m package handed to departing boss Gavin Patterson. The company will consider “a broader range of performance factors and wider circumstances” when determining executive remuneration. It also pointed to “a more structured process to help it step through the application of its discretion in the future.”Eh? Who writes this stuff? Clearly, not someone who believes in telling it how it is, and is unable to say something for definite without suffocating it in qualification. That has to be a lawyer, or as I say, a robot, or both.\u0026nbspThe problem with this approach is that it suggests an organisation that is hidebound, stricken with fear, unable to proceed without a high degree of caution, incapable of saying “we screwed up, and we’re sorry”. Patterson received too much –\u0026nbspperhaps not under the strict terms of his contract –\u0026nbspbut, given the company’s poor showing, too much.\u0026nbspDecisions must be taken, conversations must be had and understood. Running to lawyers, sheltering behind legalese, is a default, a cop out.But BT cannot admit that, oh no. It won’t try to claw back the money as that would be unseemly, and besides, the lawyers have probably advised that would be difficult. Instead, it attempts to sooth and gloss over with words straight out of the lawyers’ lexicon of “safe” twaddle.\u0026nbspSlight as it is, in the overall picture of a multi-billion pound global empire, BT’s announcement about leaders’ pay is indicative of a loss of way, a lack of confidence. Intuition has succumbed to process.\u0026nbspWith any management there should be room for both, for the heart and the head. Of course, things have to be done properly and carefully, but they also need to be done. Decisions must be taken, conversations must be had and understood. Running to lawyers, sheltering behind legalese, is a default, a cop out. It is not the answer.Too often, I’ve seen the lawyers rule the roost. On a product safety issue, where fatalities had ensued, they were reluctant to let the management meet the relatives and express their condolences, because this could lead to an admission of liability. In another episode, involving a food company, they took the same line. Again, after a tragedy, a holiday operator was told on no account to contact the family.\u0026nbspWhile lawyers may give their advice for the best of intentions, to avoid the client being shredded in the law courts, and having to pay out vast sums, they do not afford enough attention to that other court, the one of public opinion –\u0026nbspand the one that these days, especially with instant relaying of news, 24-hour bulletins and social media, is increasingly vital.\u0026nbspThere’s little point in shoring up a legal defence, in cloaking a company’s actions in legal procedure and its outpourings in law-speak, if it simply makes the company the subject of derision, and harms its reputation.\u0026nbspSurely\u0026nbspit’s not beyond the wit of any intelligent C-suite member to say they share the loved ones’ pain, without stating there and then, it was the company’s fault? Likewise, is it really impossible for BT to say it recognises, and is concerned about investors’ frustrations, and will do its utmost to prevent a recurrence?Ask any business chief what keeps them awake at night, and they will say loss of reputation –\u0026nbspto the business, and to them, personally. It’s humans who determine how they and their organisation are judged, the basis for that\u0026nbsp reputation. Be human in everything they do, is the easiest way of achieving plaudits. That means being human in how they communicate, and in their actions.\u0026nbspPlease BT, in future, before you press “send”, stand back and read what you’re about to convey. Listen to the lawyers, but, remember, you’re human and you’re talking to humans.\u0026nbspChris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

A redesign sets out to show that to consumersClick to followThe IndependentWorkers at Suma in Elland, YorkshireWhen Sheree Hatton started working at the whole foods distributor Suma six years ago, she knew it was different to anywhere else she’d ever worked.Hatton lives in Halifax with her husband and young son. In her previous job in advertising and sales for a newspaper, she was\u0026nbspused to a hierarchical business with targets for workers. Suma,\u0026nbspa worker’s co-op where each employee owns a share of the business, offered her a chance to have a say in everything from overall strategy to day-to-day operations.\u0026nbspEating organic food lowers risk of certain cancers, study suggestsCould co-operative shops be the answer to expensive organic foods?Organic food healthier than farmed products, says new research“I knew Suma was different from what I had been used to,” Hatton says. “But the more I learned about co-ops, the more I realised that by feeding into business decisions\u0026nbspyou have an equal opportunity to say how the business should be run.”Suma is known as the largest whole food distributor in the UK. But fewer people know that Suma is also Britain’s biggest workers co-operative, with an annual turnover of £55m. More than 200 people now work at Suma after rapid growth in the last few years.\u0026nbspAll of them are considered equal. Every worker at Suma is paid the same salary of £33,000. They get the opportunity to work in every part of the business – including the canteen kitchen – on rotation at the company offices in Elland, Yorkshire. And they get to vote on business decisions. “We are an equal business and we’re very proud of what we’re doing here,” Hatton says.\u0026nbspBut customers, like Hatton, often aren’t instantly aware of Suma’s co-operative status or what that means, according to a survey they commissioned in 2017. “One of the embarrassing points was that not everyone knew that we are a co-op,” Hatton says. So in 2017, Suma workers decided it was time for a rebrand.\u0026nbspSuma was started over 40 years ago in the kitchen of a house in Leeds. Reg Taylor, owner of a small retail shop, proposed at a meeting attended by other wholefood shops in the north of England that they set up a wholesaling co-operative, to supply to each other, in 1975.The name Suma was first used when the business moved to a lock-up garage in Leeds. In 1977, the business was sold to seven employees who became the founder members of the Triangle Wholefoods Collective Ltd, trading as Suma.Suma has recently benefited as consumers have become more conscious of their health and the ethics of food, plus the growing popularity of veganism. The business introduced its own vegan line in September 2017. New vegan products, including the 2018 introductions of meat-free mini-burgers in tins, have helped sales grow in the last decade.Suma now sells over 7,000 products. The branding has evolved\u0026nbsphaphazardly as lines have been added. Workers knew from customer feedback that they needed a redesign to create a single identity across all ranges, including essential, body and home. Designers also wanted to position Suma at the forefront of the new movement for sustainability and contemporary food.“We really wanted to show off that it was a co-op,” says Harriet Ferguson, senior designer at Pearlfisher, the agency commissioned to do the work. “The existing identity didn’t really do that.” Pearlfisher designers added a tagline to the logo\u0026nbsp“Co-op since 1977” to make Suma distinctive against competition against younger brands. Then they designed a logo out of different shapes to show the different personalities in the co-op.“We called this our Suma of parts and used these shapes to create the logo type. This\u0026nbspdynamic pattern can be used on the packaging at\u0026nbspdifferent levels,” Ferguson says.Suma’s inhouse design team picked some of the trickiest products for Pearlfisher to work on in the redesign, including fiddly products with small labels, like pate tubes, and some that didn’t obviously fit into one range, like coconut products.Pearlfisher turned their designs into a set of packs for Suma’s inhouse designers to roll out across old and new lines. The agency also introduced colour palettes to make different products more identifiable. They used earthy tones for the basic products, simple colours for unprocessed food and bright, natural colours for processed pastas and peanut butter. For the premium products, like speciality coffee, they used a charcoal colour palette with pops of colour.The most important thing, says David Jenkinson, creative designer at Pearlfisher, was creating a sense of the collective in all the elements. “The new identity embodies the idea that this is a collective of iniduals,” he says. “They are aligned, they sing from the same hymn sheet, but they are different.”The new\u0026nbspcolourful logo, with its tessellating shapes, will be seen on lorries up and down the country and on tins and tubes of Suma products in wholefood stockists\u0026nbspfrom January.\u0026nbspWhole Foods releases its 2019 list of new food trendsA key part of Hatton’s job has been communicating the new design to staff internally. In a company where 200 people can vote on every small change, Suma needed a process to make sure the redesign wasn’t delayed by disagreements. “We didn’t want 200 people deciding what colours to use!” says Hatton. Instead the branding team built a case for the rebrand and wrote a business plan. They took the plan to workers, who voted it through. Then the designers were free to make decisions, with in-house work making sure workers were happy with the results.“It’s probably been a little slower, just generally because we’re trying to get consensus and make sure people are behind everything before we proceed,” Hatton says. Some longstanding members wanted to stick with the existing designs, because they saw that it had worked. Hatton and other Suma members listened to them and tried to alleviate any concerns. “In a typical commercial industry people just get told what is happening,” she says. “The difference is that we want people to be passionate about it.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

That tweet raised concerns that the Trump administration is aware of something that markets are not privy to.President Donald Trump has been publicly supportive of Mr Mnuchin, but reports from CNN indicate that he may be frustrated with his Treasury Secretary. Mr Mnuchin supported the appointment of Jerome Powell as chairman of the Federal Reserve. Mr Powell has implemented monetary policies that Mr Trump has criticised.“They’re raising rates too fast because they think the economy is so good. But I think they will get it pretty soon. I really do,” Mr Trump said on Christmas of the Fed’s decisions to raise interest rates. Mr Trump was in Iraq during a surprise trip to visit American troops when markets closed on Wednesday, and had not tweeted the entire day.Analysts suggest that the administration’s comments about the economy may be driving some of the declines that have been seen recently.Callers to White House get automated message apologising for shutdownMichael Bloomberg warns the ‘beginning of the collapse’ has begunWhat does the US government really mean and why is it happening?Children will still be able to track Santa\u0027s progress on Christmas Eve“The president’s angry talk about his displeasure with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is a great example of the old adage ‘loose lips sink ships,’” Tom Block, the Washington policy strategist at Fundstrat Global Advisors, told MarketWatch. “Markets would not take well to the overt politicization of the Fed with the firing of the chair over displeasure with interest rate policy”.Others, meanwhile, have raised concerns that the declines represent real stresses on the markets.“The market’s volatility still seems to us to be more of a ‘run’ on the equity market based on fear rather than fundamentals,” said Dan Suzuki, portfolio manager at Richard Bernstein Advisors, told that website.Mr Suzuki noted that the ongoing government shutdown could be impacting stock market rates.“The difference between a run on the banking system and a run on the stock market is that the banking system has an explicit government backstop (FDIC),” he said. “In stark contrast, not only does the stock market not have a government backstop, but many of the drivers of the current volatility directly stem from government policy (trade, oil prices, the Federal Reserve, the government shutdown)”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

A smart script kept us guessing right up to an ending that denied us the closure we had expected. A second series has been commissioned.  210 9) Cunk on BritainHow much you enjoyed Philomena Cunk\u0027s history of Britain depended on how funny you find Diane Morgan\u0027s resting confused face. I find it hilarious. Her interviewees are kind of in on the joke but clearly briefed to take it as seriously as possible. They’ll be mid-flow and she will cock her head and drain all the interest from her face. “What\u0027s the most political thing that\u0027s ever happened?” she asked Robert Peston, who did his best to answer with a straight face. Co-producer Charlie Brooker\u0027s fingerprints are everywhere in the way Morgan\u0027s vain, poorly informed, easily distracted Cunk operates within a ruthlessly satirical production, which sends up the tropes and cliches of every dodgy documentary and history programme. She might not be the comic creation we need, but she is the one we deserve right now. You either love Julia Davis or think her sick filth ought to be banned. Sally4Ever proved yet again that there is nobody working today – or at least nobody with the same platform – with a blacker sense of humour. Sally (Catherine Shepherd) was already surrounded by monsters: her loser of a boyfriend (Alex MacQueen) and tricky colleagues played by Julian Barratt and Felicity Montagu. Then Emma (Davis herself) arrived, a tornado of sex and bad intentions. Beneath the shagging, drugs, excrement, manipulation and malice were pockets of tenderness, but you had to look pretty hard to see them. Luckily there were also gales of laughter. N.b. If you have yet to see it, please do not watch it with your parents or children on Boxing Day and then write in to complain.This was a spiritual successor rather than a sequel to The Night Manager. It was still a Le Carré adaptation on the BBC sprinkled with famous faces, but the differences were as pronounced as the similarities. Park Chan-Wook, the Korean auteur, directed with a high sense of style. Florence Pugh was dazzling as the ingenue actress Charlie, recruited for a dangerous mission across Europe, ably supported by Alexander Skarsgard and Michael Shannon as her spook handlers. Some viewers switched off after the first episodes, which took time to set the scene. They missed out on a vivid, beautifully told thriller. Hugh Grant… can act? That was the first surprise in this smooth, stylish BBC retelling of the Jeremy Thorpe scandal. He burst convincingly out of the charming fop mould he has slept in so comfortably for thirty years. What have we been missing all this time? The other shock was remembering how recent it all was. The government is still up to a lot of nonsense, but the days of this kind of cover-up, for these reasons, is surely over. Or is it?Edward St Aubyn\u0027s Patrick Melrose novels have the kind of precisely drawn interiority that makes any kind of adaptation seem doomed to fail. Instead, the Sky Atlantic series brought them convincingly to life. It is not a happy tale. In flashback we saw Patrick\u0027s childhood in the shadow of his monstrous father David (Hugo Weaving), and the decades of self-loathing and substance abuse that followed. At the centre of all this was Benedict Cumberbatch, as good as he\u0027s ever been. His Patrick could be brilliant, witty, cruel and pitiful, sometimes in the same smack-addled sentence. Weaving, Jennifer Jason Leigh as David\u0027s wife Eleanor and Pip Torrens as his ghastly friend Nicholas Pratt all put in memorable performances, too. At an age where most of us are long past doing anything, David Attenborough is still changing our expectations of what a nature documentary can do. Like The Rolling Stones, he has been on his farewell tour since about 1970, but unlike Jagger \u0026amp Co, the returns are not diminishing. Is he fuelled by anger at the world\u0027s response to climate change? Or simply driven by some massive internal dynamo, a soul-quest to improve our ability to relate to penguins? Whatever the motivation, Dynasties was wonderful, telling complex stories of the animal kingdom with beautiful photography. It\u0027s unusual for a TV writer to attract more attention than the stars or director. Perhaps the world is changing. Or perhaps it\u0027s simply that the writer of Killing Eve was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, star of Fleabag, Star Wars and one of the country\u0027s outstanding new talents. Here she turned her hand to a spy thriller, an adaptation of Luke Jennings\u0027 novels about a beautiful assassin, Villanelle (Jodie Comer), and the MI6 agent given the task of hunting her down, Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh). Both leads demanded attention: Comer the magnetic murderer, Oh the harassed but brilliant spy. The script swerved between comedy, action and drama often enough to keep everyone guessing.  Yes, the national team have played on television in a World Cup before, but I\u0027m including this because the outcome, an England penalty shoot-out victory, was so unusual as to count as a whole new format. At a time when we all watch things at different times, here was something unmistakably live. We watched Gareth Southgate\u0027s men knowing that the rest of the country was, too, poised in living rooms and pub gardens, ready to bury their heads in a sofa or throw their pints in the air. No other TV programme sold as many waistcoats. The ageing patriarch and his scheming children. Not an original concept. Trust, the drama about the last days of Getty family, proved that it was possible for a series built on this premise to have actors, scenery, direction, script, etc etc, and still somehow fall short. Succession, by comparison, felt alive. If US production values and ambition gave it its scale, its heart was dark and British. We can thank Jesse Armstrong, co-creator of Peep Show, and his all-star line-up of British writers, including the Lucy Prebble, Tony Roche and Georgia Pritchett. They made the Roy family expats themselves, and you could hear the old aristocratic froideur in every withering put-down. But we cared for them, too. One of the many TV professionals I consulted for this list thought Succession was so much better than everything else this year that the top 10 should just have it listed in bold and then nine blank spaces.

The measure may well have backfired, as European markets fell further on Monday.The FTSE 100 dropped 0.5\u0026nbspper cent to 6,686, meaning £76bn has now been wiped off the index in December, its lowest level in two years.

It’s immense.”Created with Sketch.The 40 best albums to listen to before you die Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.It was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all.

ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHHe said that his own love of music was encouraged by his grandmother, the Queen Mother, who took him to see the\u0026nbspBolshoi ballet at the Royal Opera House when he was seven. “I remember being so completely transfixed by the magic of it. I’ve loved Covent Garden ever since,” he said.Private Passions is now available on BBC Sounds\u0026nbspand will be broadcast on Radio 3 on 30 December.\u0026nbspFollow\u0026nbspIndependent Culture\u0026nbspon Facebook for all the latest on Film, TV, Music, and moreEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Our main concern is not having staff available.”Current rules state that to bring a chef from south Asia, an employer must provide a salary of £30,000 to secure a visa,\u0026nbspa figure that is far higher than the average curry house chef’s pay.May to hold press conference in Brussels after bruising EU summitDUP tells May not to ‘roll over’ to the EU in fresh warningNo-deal Brexit will leave UK ‘near bankrupt’ warns Richard BransonBritish tourists will pay €7 to visit Europe post-Brexit, EU revealsMr Junue\u0026nbspcontinued: “At the moment the industry is dying due to staff shortages. The next generation are not coming into this business, so if we do not get skilled workers from abroad you will not see Indian restaurants on the UK streets.\u0026nbspWe can’t get staff from the UK because people just don’t want to do it.”He said a 2013 scheme to train homegrown chefs barely had any applicants, forcing the plans to be halted.He added that in the run up to the Brexit referendum the BCA met with senior politicians who they claim gave assurances that the immigration rules would be changed if they supported Brexit. \u0026nbsp“We supported Brexit because we were promised we would be allowed to bring our skilled workers from the subcontinent,” Mr Junue said. \u0026nbsp“Prior to the referendum we were promised by Boris Johnson, Priti Patel and Michael Gove that if we came out of Europe that it is likely they will be open for people from the sub-continent to come.”Redoan Pasha, who owns Taste of India in Euston, London, said not only were staffing issues a concern but Brexit had resulted in fewer\u0026nbspcustomers and higher prices for ingredients.He noted that certain imports had to be made from the EU and they had vastly increased in price since the referendum.“Brexit is a disaster for the curry industry. Two years ago we thought it would be good but it certainly has not been,” Mr Pasha told The Independent.“We have already lost 75 per cent of our business in total.”The concerns about Brexit have led to many in the industry to say they feel “cheated” by Brexit.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Team Dash and Splash swimmers, some in fancy dress, getting into the Irish Sea at Bangor beach in Northern IrelandMembers of the Shakti Sings choir sing as druids, pagans and revellers gather in the centre of Stonehenge, hoping to see the sun rise, as they take part in a winter solstice ceremony at the ancient neolithic monument near Amesbury.

There are a variety of options, but all have serious problems and would be unlikely to keep everyone happy.Here are the main possibilities – and what’s wrong with them all.The most obvious option is to rerun the 2016 EU referendum question and simply ask people whether they want to remain in the European Union or leave it.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut this question repeats the same mistakes as the last vote: what does “leave” actually mean? The government is currently in deadlock and the referendum is supposed to let the people decide,\u0026nbspbut this question simply doesn’t solve the problem the government is facing. If Leave wins again, we’re back to square one. As a result, it’s unlikely to be asked.\u0026nbspRemain vs Theresa May’s deal vs no dealSplitting out no deal and May’s deal seems to be a logical response to the problems with the last question. Voters would be able to choose between any of the three options.But this would split the Leave vote, leaving Remain to almost certainly win. Most unsustainably, it could even produce a Remain win when the majority of people actually vote for Leave options. Democratically, this is a non-starter\u0026nbspand would reasonably be seen as a stitch-up.‘Do you approve of the Brexit deal negotiated by the government?’The government could simply ask voters to approve or reject the Brexit deal. This suffers from similar problems as the first question: if the deal is rejected, what happens? Do we leave with no deal? Or remain?\u0026nbspIt might prove attractive as a roll of the dice for a government trying to ram through the deal without its MPs – or then again it might not\u0026nbspbecause the public would probably vote it down, according to current polls. This also has no ‘remain’ option so would surely disappoint the main people who want a second referendum – remain voters.One proposal is to ask the questions in two rounds: first, whether voters accept or reject the deal. Then, if it’s rejected, whether they want to remain or leave without a deal.\u0026nbspYou could also ask the questions in a different order if you wanted – leave vs remain first, and then pick between no deal and Therea May’s deal if it’s a Leave vote. But whatever order you ask the questions in, there is a fundamental issue here.Is it really a good idea to put no deal on the ballot paper, and risk giving the government an explicit binding mandate to create food and medicine shortages?\u0026nbspCurrently, parliament can stop a no deal and credibly claim it isn’t what people voted for. But holding this referendum puts economic catastrophe back on the table and could make the situation infinitely worse – which raises the question of why you would want to hold it at all.\u0026nbspPolling suggests that no deal is more popular than May’s deal – it is not impossible that it could win, given voters chose Leave last time.\u0026nbspThis no-deal problem\u0026nbspis a thread that runs through many second referendum options. Explicitly putting it on the ballot paper is probably not a good idea. But not putting it on the ballot paper doesn’t solve the problem.You could ask the three-way question and give\u0026nbspvoters the options of\u0026nbspranking the options, then tally them up using\u0026nbspan alternative vote\u0026nbsp(AV). This is practically the same as two-round voting and has the same problem – no deal is on the ballot.There are also extra problems, such as the fact that AV can produce some quite unintuitive results – and the fact that the system was explicitly rejected for parliamentary elections at a referendum in 2011, so its use would certainly be contested.This is the option favoured by the People’s Vote campaign. In some ways it is the least worst: it rules out no deal. Remainers will like it because it offers them the option of staying. It is also explicit about what each option means, so it solves the deadlock.But it runs the risk of being seen as illegitimate: the fact remains that a not insignificant number of people are actively campaigning for leaving on World Trade Organisation terms without a deal. Many Brexiteers say they see Theresa May’s deal as “no Brexit at all”. They would consider this question a betrayal – forced to choose between two things they don’t want, despite having won the first vote.There is also the question of political deliverability. The country has a Tory government, and if there are two things that the vast majority of Tory MPs don’t want to vote for, they are: Remain, and Theresa May’s deal. So why would they pass a referendum that forces them to choose between two options they hate?Any question with ‘negotiate a different deal’ or ‘Norway’ as an optionThe EU has said it will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement, so putting it as an option in a referendum would be meaningless. If it was voted for the government would be stuck.Similarly, suggestions that a soft Brexit like the Norway option\u0026nbsp(entry into the European Economic Area) or similar could be on the ballot papers misunderstand the situation. The government needs to pass the withdrawal agreement before April or extend or revoke Article 50. Having a referendum on the future relationship is fine, but it wouldn’t solve the problem\u0026nbspand isn’t an alternative to working out what to do with the withdrawal agreement.So in summary…You either risk causing an economic catastrophe by putting no deal on the ballot paper, you exclude no deal as an option and risk the referendum being seen as illegitimate by the people who won last time, or you don’t solve the actual dilemma the government is currently facing.\u0026nbspThat isn’t to take away from the compelling case for a Final Say referendum, which The Independent\u0026nbsphas campaigned for at length\u0026nbspand collected more than a million signatures in favour of. Done right, another vote\u0026nbspcould solve the UK’s political deadlock, check whether the public still want to leave, and spell out what’s really on offer. But if one is called, the question will have to be chosen carefully, with an awareness of the tradeoffs.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Parliament has taken it. We know the options for Brexit. Parliament will have to decide on one of them. If parliament can’t then it should decide to go back to the people.“Now should be the time of preparation – parliament to make sure it can canvas the options in sensible manner, one by one, to reach agreement on an option or a referendum Europe to ensure that if Britain is ready to think again, Europe is ready also to think again.“All that is necessary is for leadership: in parliament if not in government, and in Europe where despite all the myriad of challenges European leaders have, they should understand that changing Brexit would be the greatest boost to Europe’s economy and politics and that therefore, they need to focus on the part they can play and play it.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The prospect of a no-deal in the near future will be weighing heavily on directors’ minds.“Uncertainty is already causing businesses to delay investment, hiring decisions and product launches, which also acts to weaken our international competitiveness further down the line.“The longer this state of affairs continues, the more we lose by it, even if these effects aren’t apparent in the here and now.”Another think tank, the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR), specifically suggested France will indeed overtake the UK to become the world’s sixth biggest economy next year.The finding appears to mirror the fear and concern highlighted in the IOD research among the business community, about operational systems that firms will be forced to change after Brexit.The CEBR said “disruption” to the British economy was inevitable due to lower inward and business investment, as firms hold fire from spending money until things have stabilised.But again there is hope, as the CEBR’s world economic league table report says Britain will return to the sixth spot by 2020.The think tank goes on to say\u0026nbspit believes the UK will retain its sixth position ahead of France through to 2033 at least.The data suggests that the underlying confidence in the economy could return if the shock of Brexit passes.Whether it is worth the risk of giving the economy an inevitable shock, and then betting on the return of confidence, will undoubtedly end up being a political rather than an economic question.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Looks shocking on the film, unacceptable in any environment.”However, shortly after prime minister’s questions, Mr Corbyn’s spokesman denied the allegation, insisting: “He did not call her a ‘stupid woman’. So I don’t think there is a basis for an apology. As I understand it he said ‘stupid people’.”The spokesman told reporters: “Lip reading in such circumstances is always open to doubt.”As tempers flared, John Bercow, the Commons speaker, said he did not see or hear the alleged remark, but made clear: “Is that language unacceptable? Yes.”He also urged Mr Corbyn “to return to the chamber” to hear his verdict on what happened later this afternoon, after watching the TV footage.Corbyn\u0027s barely there leadership could lead to mutiny – againLabour \u0027would fall behind Lib Dems\u0027 if Corbyn backs May\u0027s Brexit dealJeremy Corbyn accuses May of presiding over \u0027government in chaos\u0027In a BBC TV studio, Barry Gardiner, a Labour frontbencher and Corbyn ally, said he was “not a lipreader” but agreed it appeared that Mr Corbyn had said “stupid woman”.The row blew up after Ms May likened Mr Corbyn’s attempt to force a confidence vote in her earlier this week to a Christmas pantomime – accusing him of dithering.First he said he would call a no confidence vote, Then he said he wouldn’t. Then he did, but it was not effective. “Oh yes he will, oh no he won’t,” she taunted – saying the Labour leader should “look behind him” at his own despairing MPs.But Mr Corbyn hit back, saying it was the prime minister’s job to deliver the negotiation and, if she was incapable of doing so, she should step aside for someone who can.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereVote of no confidenceOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

When darkness falls, the Wilsons discover the silhouette of four figures holding hands as they stand in the driveway – doppelgängers of themselves.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialCreated with Sketch.Films to watch before you die Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.142 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film. Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO242 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history.

But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO742 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO942 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1542 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant. 142 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film. Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO242 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film.

And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO742 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO942 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1542 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister.

Russia’s defence ministry\u0026nbspwarned in a statement that the Israeli airstrikes “directly” imperilled two civilian planes landing at nearby Damascus international airport, a sign of continuing friction between Israel and Moscow since the accidental downing of a Russian reconnaissance plane in September.

Israeli residents in the north reported hearing loud explosions and seeing trails of smoke in the skies. Residents on the western outskirts of the Syrian capital, Damascus, were rattled by the roar of incoming and outgoing rocket fire, and flashes of light and fireballs in the night. The attack was the first since Donald Trump’s announcement of an abrupt withdrawal of 2,000 or so American troops from Syria. That move severely disappointed Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other members of Israel’s national security establishment hoping to enlist American help in their aim to curtail Iran and its allies’ influence in Syria and Lebanon. But the latest strike showed the controversial withdrawal, along with the tensions with Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad’s Russian patrons, were unlikely to alter Israel’s security posture towards its northern neighbour. “Israel is sending a message to Russia and Iran that the US withdrawal doesn’t mean that Israel can’t act in Syria, and that it shouldn’t be ignored,” Michael Horowitz, deputy director of intelligence for Lebeck International, a Gulf-based consultancy, told The Independent. “These airstrikes relate to the US\u0026nbspwithdrawal,” he said. “They came right after Netanyahu warned Israel would extend its activities in Syria after the US withdrawal.” The exchange of fire began with what Syria’s official news agency described as airstrikes launched from Lebanese airspace against a position west of Damascus, targeting a weapons depot in the town of Qatana, about 25 kilometres from the centre of the capital.Syrian forces responded with anti-aircraft missiles that were shot down by Israel’s air defence system, Israeli army radio reported. “No damage or injuries were reported,” said a statement issued by the Israeli army.Syria, equipped with Russian S-300 anti-aircraft batteries that could be seen firing ferociously in video posted to the internet, claimed it intercepted “most” of the Israeli missiles. Russia’s defence ministry said Syrian air defences destroyed 14 of 16 missiles. Israel has not confirmed firing the original air strikes as per its usual protocol, but it is widely assumed it launched the attack as part of its ongoing efforts to roll back what it describes as Iranian efforts to use Syria as a weapons and personnel conduit to Lebanon’s Hezbollah and other allied militia groups arrayed along Israel’s northern front. “We will do everything to prevent an Iranian entrenchment in Syria, and we are doing it,” Israel’s minister of infrastructure Yuval Steintitz told Israeli army radio on Wednesday. It remained unclear what Israel\u0026nbspwas targeting, but some media alleged senior members of Hezbollah were injured in the strike, citing unnamed sources. Former Director of Israeli army intelligence Amos Yadlin told Israeli army radio on Wednesday he assumed the targets were military hardware.“Israel does not attack Hezbollah officials, but advanced weaponry and munitions being transferred to Hezbollah and Iran\u0027s establishment,” he said.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

He knows the vote will have a direct impact on his life.The father of four always joins the crowds from across the world who converge each year for Christmas Mass in Manger Square, the alleged birthplace of Jesus Christ.But this year the famed gathering is only half full and there is a muted despair edging the celebrations. It has been a particularly hard year for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the spectre of new elections in Israel have only added anxiety about everyone’s futures.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThere have already been fears of a fourth war between Israel and Gaza in less than a decade after intense cross-border exchanges of fire this year.In the last month many have speculated there may even be a third Intifada after Palestinian shooters in the occupied West Bank killed at least five Israelis, sparking mass raids by security forces.The stories behind a painful year in the Israel-Palestine conflict“Peace is far from being achieved, I really feel that the void between the Palestinians and Israelis has never been so wide, it’s the worst year yet,” Sami told The Independent, close by a towering Christmas tree in holy city.“And now we have to hold our breath for the Israeli elections. I hope the left win as that is our last chance of there being some form of peace. If the right win we will never see a Palestinian state ever,” he added.Embattled rightwing Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has tried to rule Israel with a knife edge one-seat parliamentary majority since November, when defence minister Avigdor Lieberman quit – taking his political party and seats from the ruling coalition with him.Mr Lieberman left his job over Mr Netanyahu’s decision to accept a tentative ceasefire with militants in Gaza to stop another war.Trew  The Independent)But on Monday, Christmas Eve, heads of parties in Mr Netanyahu’s coalition agreed to hold early polls in April “in the name of budgetary and national responsibility”.Mr Netanyahu, eager to portray the move as positive, said he hoped Israel would be led by a similar coalition to the current one, seen as the most rightwing in Israel’s history.“The current coalition is, in my eyes, the core of the next coalition,” Mr Netanyahu said.“We ask for a clear mandate from the voter to continue to lead the state of Israel in our own way.”At the Christmas celebrations in Bethlehem they fear the next administration will only be more right-leaning and more hawkish, leading to a more aggressive policy of settlement building in the West Bank, and a less peaceful stance towards Gaza.Trew  The Independent)This year was marred by president Donald Trump’s May decision to move the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, thereby recognising the contested city as the Israeli capital.It sparked 10 months of protests in Gaza along the Israel Gaza border during which over 200 Palestinians were killed.Israeli soldiers defended their use of force saying that the Palestinians were launching incendiary kites and balloons laced with explosives at Israeli land.At the end of the year violence also exploded in the West Bank eroding hopes of a peace deal. Little have faith in Mr Trump’s promise of a “deal of the century” agreement which has been postponed multiple times into next year.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An aerial photo shows damaged buildings in Carita after the area was hit by a tsunami on December 22 following an eruption of the Anak Krakatoa volcano.

Every year gets worse and that is the way it is,” he added.Across the square Ahmed, 25 who works with the Palestinian Red Crescent agreed. “I feel like we have got to the point where we are so far apart, we are speaking in entirely different languages,” he said. “I just can’t see how we can move on from here,” he adds.Mohamed, 24, a Muslim who joined the Bethlehem celebrations to show solidarity for his Christian friends, says he cannot see a solution to the crisis. “You can’t make two states out of one, and the Israelis won’t give us any space,” he concluded.“I’m against the shootings in the West Bank, I’m against violence. I’m for peace, but how we can build this.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

We have minds of our own, and we need to take responsibility for our own actions.The reappearance of naked prejudice on the terraces can’t be blamed on anyone other than the racists themselves — and the other fans who stay silent instead of calling out the racists.These people should be named and shamed. Social media could be put to good use by posting a rogues’ gallery on every  and the faces of the bigots should be prominent, so that their wives, mothers and children can see what they’ve done. Roll on #stampoutracism.But the mystery is why there is an upsurge in such incidents right now.I, for one, thought that with the determined efforts of the clubs, led by the Kick It Out campaign, such scenes would cease. But I should have known better. Back in the early Seventies I lived ten minutes from Stamford Bridge — but I never went to home games.When it became fashionable to throw darts at our own fans, a black face standing in the Shed was nothing less than a walking bullseye.By the mid-Nineties I hoped it would be OK to bring my seven-year-old daughter and her pals to a game.Surely, there could be no danger in seats below the directors’ boxes, away from the common herd It took  minutes for me to learn the truth as two men in front of us leapt up to abuse the Sheffield Wednesday midfielder Carlton Palmer, screaming “You lanky-legged black ****”.I tapped one on the shoulder. He looked around, saw my face, and immediately apologised profusely. But the damage was done.Three weeks later, I attended a dinner at the City of London’s most glittering venue, the Guildhall.Suddenly, I found myself confronted by a familiar face — one of the same two men who had sat in the stand in front of us.A true racist, yet here he was, suave, suited and booted, at the heart of the British establishment. So much for the idea that all racists are ignorant, lower-class idiots.So what’s happened It seems bizarre that the Premier League, dominated by foreign players, many of them black, should still suffer from prejudice.And with top teams regularly playing in Europe, plus a successful England team nearly half of whose members are black or mixed race it’s hard to see why fans should start throwing bananas on the pitch again.But the truth is that many of the factors that drove racism on the terraces have never gone away, and have never been challenged effectively. Yes, recent political arguments about the EU and about immigration have allowed some of the scumbags who the game thought it had chased away to resurface with renewed bravado.It’s also possible that the increase in the number of fans from Eastern Europe, where attitudes to ersity are decidedly less tolerant, may have had an effect.Perhaps some of the brilliant players from Europe who now grace the English game might put themselves in the front line of their re-education.Butthe game wants to stamp out racism for good it needs to take a long, hard look at itself.In the Premier League, around one in five players are black.The number of black owners and coaches is negligible. This is sending out the worst message imaginable.I welcome the advent of great players like N’Golo Kante, Romelu Lukaku, and Dele Alli. But this is a sport owned and run almost exclusively by white men, who buy and sell black men at will.Yes, of  course, the heaviest weight that the players have to lt is their own multimillion-pound pay packets, so I don’t seek sympathy for them.But basically, football looks like the th-century plantation economy of the American South.It’s time for the game to start taking steps to make sure that its owners, their boards of directors and their executive and coaching staff look more like modern Britain.Arsenal v BurnleyAFC Bournemouth v BrightonCha v Leicester CityHuddersfield Town v SouthamptonManchester City v Crystal PalaceNewcastle United v FulhamWest Ham United v WatfordCardf City v Manchester UnitedIf the people at the top of the game seem to think that it’s OK to treat black people like field slaves, why would they expect the fans to treat the players with respect I saw my first game — Arsenal vs Leicester City — at the old Highbury ground.My dad wanted me to see his hero, the great inside-left George Eastham, in action.He realised that I was too small to see over the parapet, so we took the biggest book we had in the house for me to stand on. I watched Eastham while standing on Uncle Tom’s Cabin, the bestselling anti-slavery novel that had touched off the American Civil War.Maybe every owner needs to be sent a copy of Harriet Beecher Stowe’s book to remind our contemporary plantation bosses that it’s time for them too to confront the bigotry written into the game’s soul.Football’s racism hasn’t gone away, and it never will until we all look at its evil full in the face.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They represent a credible threat to our economy, our institutions and our way of le.But unless the Government rediscovers its Tory values — of inidual responsibility, and good but small government — we could be on the road to socialism.THREE cheers to the great Harry Kane, whose Golden Boot-winning World Cup will be rightly honoured with a gong.We’re all familiar with his on-pitch heroics, but he is just as deserving for what he does beyond the beautul game.He spoke eloquently in the run-up to the Armistice centenary commemorations, and he has taken time out to do plenty of inspirational charity work.Here’s to you, Harry, an England hero we can all believe in.WE asked you to put a festive smile on the face of kids with cancer this year, and boy did you deliver.Thanks to your generous donations, we were able to send Father Christmas into hospitals around the country and give youngsters going through tough times the chance to forget their worries for a while.And it’s all down to you.

This might not be good news to those who, like me, believe she has made a dog’s Brexit of EU negotiations, but it would be unchristian on Christmas Eve to ignore Mrs May’s transformation.She seems almost to have shrugged off the crushing burden of responsibility and begun to enjoy herself. Voters have noticed. At ious pre-Christmas gatherings, I have been struck by expressions of warmth for Mrs May personally, even among hardened Brexiteers.So, in the spirit of Christmas, let’s put dferences aside and raise a glass to the PM’s health and happiness.She has benefited from the ghastliness of her enemies — the thuggish European Commision, drunken groper Jean Claude Juncker, biased Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow and snide Jeremy Corbyn. Their mean-spirited sneers have stirred a passion for the underdog among fair-minded Brits — surprisingly, more among men than women.It is refreshing to see bellowing toad Bercow, a toxic stain on the centuries-old tradition of Speaker impartiality, finally at bay over allegations of abuse of his high office. Bercow’s blatant contempt for Parliament coincides with Corbyn’s disintegration and Labour’s irrelevance.Only last week Corbyn was held up as the scary monster who would eat us alivegiven the chance. Today he stands shredded for all to see, as a pathetic non-entity who somehow became Leader of HM Opposition.Corbyn feebly denies live TV evidence of him branding Theresa May a “stupid woman”.  He is entitled to his opinion but it is demeaning to lie about it. No wonder two of his closest MPs, Fiona Onasanya and Kate Osamor, have also been caught lying through their teeth. And they are just the ones brought to the attention of police.Suddenly, far from Corbyn sweeping to power as Britain’s first Marxist PM, polls suggest he would be thrashed in a snap Election, with the Tories regaining their outright majority.  But perhaps not under this leader.Which brings me to another reason to be cheerful. Boris Johnson has been cleared of trumped-up charges of Islamophobia levelled by Tory chairman Brandon Lewis, spurred on by Mrs May herself.In an article supporting the right of Muslim women to wear what they like, Boris warned hijabs made them look like bank robbers or “letter boxes”.As with much of the ridicule hurled at Boris since Brexit, this was calculated to undermine his chances of winning any future leadership battle. But the really good news this festive season is the panic beginning to grip those who want to reverse the  referendum and keep Britain in Europe at any cost.Project Fear has become Project Farce. Fanatical Remoaners, not Brexiteeers, can be seen as the real swivel-eyed loonies.Time is running out — and it isn’t on their side. Either they accept Mrs May’s dodgy deal by March  or we’re OUT. As Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom explains, MPs cannot block Brexit.Far from being frightened off, foreign firms are pouring cash into UKplc. Savvy tech giants Apple, Google and Amazon have bet billions on post-Brexit Britain.  More firms are setting up HQs in London than any other EU capital and Britain has been voted the best country in the world to do business.We have just marked the wintry Shortest Day, a symbolic turning point, with the best jobs record in jobless Europe while the Eurozone faces an economic disaster. We are a long way short of high summer.But every day from now until the end of daylight- saving in March, things should get brighter and brighter. Have a wonderful Christmas and a terric New Year.AND finally, the best news of all. Ex-Chancellor George Osborne was filleted live on Saturday’s Today programme by BBC veteran David Dimbleby.Perhaps expecting an easy ride from a fellow Remainer, Georgie Boy was accused of cutting and running after the  referendum – and using his Treasury job to feather his nest.Comparing Osborne to greedy ex-PM Tony Blair, Dimbleby asked: “Why are you following in his foot-steps by taking job after job and earning millions of pounds a year  You became prominent because you were Chancellor.It’s as though going into politics – which you aban-doned when it turned against you – was a pathway to what you do now, making a buck.”The sound of spluttering could be heard.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And now it appears asthe police have made a quite colossal error in arresting an innocent couple.We’re now told that there might not have been a drone at all.What is going on  Are we completely incapable of protecting our airfields It is staggering — and anybody using our airports deserves an answer.MERRY Christmas to Sun readers — we’re delighted to celebrate with you.Your donations to our Christmas campaign for premature babies have been warmly received, and you’ve helped us spread a little festive cheer in specialist maternity units across the country.Every year we are impressed, but never surprised, by your generosity.

Shoppers were outside Selfridges in London at .am.Its well-heeled customers were after deals such as a YSL bag down form £, to £.Elsewhere, SportsDirect reduced a men’s long-sleeved polo shirt from £. to £.. The Entertainer cut some prices by  per cent. There was  per cent off at Gap and Topshop and  per cent off at Next, Oasis, Dorothy Perkins and Miss Selfridge.Online retailers including eBay and Amazon are also set to delight shoppers with reduced prices on Boxing Day, offering a wave of discounts.Those waiting to get into Harrods for their am opening today were also treated as they queued - offered refreshments and entertained by a nine-piecfe Motown band.An eight-metre Christmas tree on Hans Crescent, adorned with more than  oversized gourmet delights, including cranberries, candy canes and Brussels sprouts, served as a backdrop to the performance.Ipsos Retail Performance revealed retailers were holding out hope for a busy stretch over Christmas.It was already a good start, with . per cent more trips were made to non-food stores in the UK on Christmas Eve this year compared to last.Tim Denison, director of retail intelligence at Ipsos Retail Performance, said: A busy Christmas Eve is a handy bonus for retailers this year, as shoppers headed to the stores to find those last-minute stocking fillers and to substitute for presents bought online that failed to arrive in time.Of course, opening hours were curtailed last year as Christmas Eve fell on a Sunday, but the week-on-week results speak for themselves: Christmas Eve delivered strong growth this year.The surge in shoppers to stores seen over the final few days before Christmas will give some solace to those in the sector, when they sit down to enjoy their roast turkeys today, after such a torrid year.For Boxing Day itself, three in  Brits are expected to hit the shops today, according to Barclay.Research from Barclaycard shows that four in  adults plan to shop in the sales over the period, anticipating an average spend of £ each.And men will be the biggest spenders, with findings showing they expect to shell out % more than women at £ compared with £.Konrad Kelling, managing director of customer solutions at Barclaycard, said: Whilst most plan to spend Boxing Day with friends and family, Brits also dont want to miss out on the best deals to be had.Surprisingly, men plan to spend more than women in the sales this year - whether that be staying up late to buy that must-have item or even browsing online during the family festivities.But its a stressful day for retail workers too as they face a wave of feisty bargain hunters.According to Adoreboard, an analytics firm based at Queens University, Belfast, retail workers are filled with apprehension and worry as they gear up for the busy period.Rude customers were the chief source of stress for shop staff, with % of respondents saying bad manners were most likely to put them in a foul mood.Long queues and panic shoppers were the two other main causes of concern.Chris Johnston, chief executive of Adoreboard, said: The study shows that emotions not only play a role in the decisions that customers make but also how people treat customers.Understanding the emotions of both employees and customers is key to unlocking how businesses can help people improve how they treat customers to achieve better results.Meanwhile, shoppers fled in fear when they were spooked by a loud noise at Westfield shopping centre in Stratford, East London.Dozens were filmed dashing for the exits after a countertop in the food court was broken.Police  arrested a man they suspected of carrying a kne.No injuries were reported."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT0004581907171.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"christmas meghan markle sister samantha dad thomas feud","story":"The -year-old today revealed the Duchess of Sussexs estrangement from -year-old Thomas had been ongoing before even he pulled out of attending her fairytale wedding to Prince Harry.Taking to Twitter, Samantha wrote: My le is great and after having a heart attack the wedding and now two Christmases she does not even call him.

Wow.Thomas Markle spent Christmas Day handing out food and toys to homeless kids, , miles from his daughter.But he has previously revealed he has held out hope he will reunite with his daughter and meet his future grandchild, due in Spring next year.The former American actress has had a whirlwind year - marrying Prince Harry in May before the couple they would become parents.But Meghans family drama has seen goodwill with the public slide a royal author has claimed. Penny Junor warned the Duke and Duchess of Sussex had lost some of their popularity since their May wedding.She put it down to Meghans ongoing rt with her father, with -year-old Thomas Markle recently revealing he had been texting his daughter everyday - with no reply.Junor told the Press Association: I think it has been a mixed year for Harry and Meghan.They seem to have lost some of the goodwill and admiration that was so wholehearted when they married, and Meghans failure to sort things out with her father has been a huge mistake, in my view.We obviously dont know the truth about her relationship with him - it seems beyond extraordinary that Harry has never met him - but having him give interviews in which he says that she hasnt spoken to him or made contact with him since the wedding is incredibly damaging.And she said speculation that the -year-olds rumoured rt with Kate Middleton also hadnt helped.It has been suggested that Meghan was involved in a ghastly row with the Duchess of Cambridge, with Kate rumoured to have been brought to tears during her brother-in-laws wedding preparations.Prince Harry, , moving to Frogmore Cottage next year with Meghan also hasnt helped the speculation there is tension between the couples.Junor added: The more the press write negative things, the less charming Harry is prepared to be and so the more negative the stories.It is all very sad because Harry and Meghan are a great double act.Kensington Palace declined to comment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000458352364.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"family wait christmas dinner hotel exeter","story":"Lora Gosling, , went with  family and friends to the plush Woodbury Park Hotel for what they hoped would be a decadent festive meal.But they were left waiting for hours and staff at the hotel near Exeter, Devon, offered no explanation.Many people took to social media to complain about the service, with some calling it a Fawlty Towers experience.Simon Grfin wrote on the hotels Facebook page: Our Christmas dinner  experience was at best Fawlty Towers! which is not what you expect when you pay £.Sharon Simpson added: Shambolic Christmas dinner, what a disappointment.Did you have a similar experience  Contact The Sun Online - email: brittany.vonow@the-sun or call   In the end, Lora and her family left without eating their pre-paid dessert and said the terrible experience ruined their Christmas.She said: We arrived at ten past  for a .pm lunch.

Nine minutes und kounting!”Here in Brexit-crazed Westminster, that scene sounds all too familiar.There are now fewer than  days until we are scheduled to leave the European Union on March .As European Commission bigshots like to say: “The clock is ticking.”Heaven knows what is going to happen: Will British Prime Minister Theresa May — still alive, and even a little stronger than she was a couple of weeks ago — elicit assurances from Brussels that will help her sell her Withdrawal Agreement deal to a sceptical House of Commons Will pro-Remain MPs somehow force a second referendum that could stop Brexit  Will we sail out of the EU without a treaty The only thing anyone knows for sure is that this particular thriller must soon end.By March , we will knowthe villain has succeeded in his dastardly plot or  can again save the world.Because, let’s face it, we’re not going to let the baddie win.Pessimists tend to prosper in uncertain times, and British politics at present is very much a catastrophists’ market.Critics and doomsayers are agitating more noisily as the prospect of the UK leaving without a deal becomes more likely.We’re being told British shops will run out of food and medicines, aeroplanes will be grounded and the economy could shrink by as much as eight per cent that’s the Bank of England’s worst-case scenariowe leave the EU without a deal in place.Officials in both London and Brussels are talking publicly about contingency planning, while Labour and pro-EU Tory MPs have repeatedly pressed May to rule it out.In the last Cabinet meeting of the year, Work And Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd supposedly compared Brexit to a car crash and Justice Secretary David Gauke said the concept of a “managed no-deal” was as mythical as a unicorn.But doomsayers should hold their fire — Britain will be just fine.Evensome instability does follow a no-treaty withdrawal, it would be short-term. Le would continue. Chickens would continue to lay eggs.Trading restrictions work both ways, so any attempt by Brussels to punish the disobedient Brits by preventing them exporting agricultural goods to the EU might encourage the British government to find sudden reasons to stop the importation of German motor cars. Or Irish beef. Or French wine.Have you tried new-world merlots  They can be rather good. And good value.No-deal would, in fact, have tremendous advantages.It would allow Britain immediately to negotiate and sign trade deals beyond Europe.It would force May’s government to cut taxes to make us more competitive.It would result in a tremendous boost to national unity.Before the EU starts feeling too sorry for us — or too eager to see the back of us — it might consider that in the long term, it has far greater problems on the horizon than we do.When none of the doomsday Brexit predictions comes to pass, the EU will find itself in deep trouble — our survival, and success without the bloc, will highlight the intransigence of the Commission and may well tempt other EU members to contemplate quitting the troubled union.Because there’s no denying it is deeply troubled.Belgium’s government is in turmoil — yet again.France’s peacock president is having his feathers plucked by a bolshy populace.The German chancellor is soon to depart this political le.Italy and Brussels may have papered over their rancorous dispute over Rome’s spending proposals, but neither is likely to play nice for long.Spain has a hideous unemployment problem and poor Greece, the crucible of Western democracy, has lost control of its own affairs and is turning into a Third World country.Poland and Hungary, of course, are pursuing non-liberal policies that have earned them the contempt of the European institutions.And all this before we even start contemplating Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker’s hiccups.Britain’s political class may be in agony over a “Leave” instruction it resents, but the country’s electorate is markedly more relaxed.January and February  are likely to prove noisy in Westminster, but by the end of March — one way or another — we will be out.That James Bond countdown will end and our ab-dabs will start to abate.The EU’s nightmare, alas, will continue.The question in Britain will then not be “why did we leave ” but “why did it take us so long ”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

but its unlikely to be so low that you wont see the festive celebrations in the sky.Helen Roberts, a Met Office meteorologist told The Sun Online: Were just on the cusp of how much detail we can give at this early stage but its looking like there will be high pressure across the south of the UK and will be quite quiet.It will probably be quite cloudy, so not dissimilar to now.Were not expecting any signicant rainfall.There is potential for rain to push in around northern Scotland, but its too early to tell how far south this rain could travel.It will probably be dry but cloudy.Expansive clouds wont be ideal for fireworks displays but the temperature wont be too cold.Its just the low cloud that could scupper the displays on New Years Eve."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000458409103.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"embarrassing children cringeworthy said kids","story":"A study of , mums and dads shows  per cent are genuinely worried about what will come out of their child’s mouth next.And they have every reason to be concerned, according to the study, as one quarter of kids have repeated something their parents have said in public, when they really shouldn’t have.The survey threw up some hilarious examples such as one child who announced to her mum’s mother-in-law “mummy doesn’t like the fact you’re always moaning her house isn’t clean enough”.More common embarrassing phrases include “look there’s a baby in that man’s belly” and “my daddy is really hairy”.While kids have also been known to shout out “why have you got yellow teeth ”, “I don’t like this present” and “why does that person smell ”The study also found parents have also been left red-faced after their child announced to a friend “I don’t like you”.Siobhan Freegard for ChannelMum said: “Out of the mouth of babes comes the funniest things.Children have no filter and simply say things as they see it and don’t mean to leave you red-faced.”The survey also found two in  kids have said “you’re old” to members of the public.The age at which children are most likely to say or do something embarrassing was revealed as four.And the most common place where children are likely to humiliate their parents is the supermarket for  per cent, followed by a friend’s houseand the shopping centre .Over half of children have left parents feeling uncomfortable when they repeated swear words they’d overheard.A further two in  parents have been left to explain what their child meant when they’ve said something cringeworthy in public.One respondent said their child repeated to their parent’s friend “you’re an awful driver and shouldn’t have a license”.Another mum had to explain what their child meant when they said “mummy wears a nappy sometimes” – in reference to sanitary products.The study also found one in  parents said their child has even drawn something at school to embarrass them, including a picture of the mum in question being sick after a night out.Calling the postman a “baldie”, telling a policeman “my mummy has handcuffs like yours in her bedroom” and “my daddy’s willie has a beard” are among other faux pas made by the nation’s children.The spokeswoman from Channel Mum, which carried out the study via OnePoll added: “If you’re worried about what you child may say next, remember where they are learning their information.If your child has said a few of the top phrases, maybe it’s time to watch what you say too”"},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/11/2048x1152/skynews-delivery-courier_4496646.jpg?20181123101056 ","title":"miley cyrus confirms wedding to liam hemsworth on instagram and twitter","story":"Cyrus also shared a video of her producer Mark Ronson whistling Here Comes The Bride."},{"url":null,"title":"labour mp kate osamor not","story":"NewsLabour MP Kate Osamor not ashamed to be in council house despite £k salaryKate Osamors son Ishmael Osamor was found with drugs worth £, at the Bestival music festival in Dorset in  and in October was sentenced to a two-year community orderShareCommentsByDanya BazaraaNews Reporter:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsKate Osamor tweeted that she is proud to live in social housing \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLabour MP Kate Osamor has said she remains proud, not ashamed to be living in her council house despite reports she earns pound, a year.The -year-olds council home is believed to be worth pound,, according to reports.

The Home Secretary insisted it was not his job to worry about offenders being sent to a country like Pakistan, where fewer checks existed. He spoke after three members of a Rochdale gang found guilty of grooming and sexually exploiting young girls lost an appeal against a shydecision to strip them of their British citizenship. Mr Javid said: “My job is to protect the British public.” But he insisted offenders would only be deported in serious cases where they already had dual nationality. He added: “There should be a very high bar. It is not a decision that should be taken lightly at all.”  Mr Javid admitted he took the shyRochdale grooming scandal personally because he was born in the Greater Manchester town and is of Pakistani origin, as are some of the gang. He said: “When I heard about grooming gangs where almost every inidual involved is of Pakistani heritage… I can’t help noting the fact that Rochdale is a town that means something to me.” Mr Javid came under fire in October for tweeting about “sick Asian shypaedophiles” but insisted yesterday he had been right to speak out, arguing that ignoring their ethnicity would give a boost to extremists. He said: “There could be, and I’m not saying there are, some cultural reasons for the communities those men came from that lead to this type of behaviour. “To rule something out because of it being shysensitive would be wrong. That is exactly what I think extremists would like to see in this country. It would give them oxygen.” But Mr Javid hit back at Theresa May’s plans to crack down on low-skilled migrants after Brexit and is understood to have concerns about the move.

Its all very well to have the ideas - its about backing those local plans with the money to do so.

Lydia Scott, , said she and her partner had no idea they would be living beneath a large family - but they found out the moment they moved in together in Stoke Newington in north-east London. She said they noticed the loud, constant noise on their first night and it hasnt stopped - with some of the children running around until am. Lydia told MyLondon that she has complained to the father, but its still loud and the noise has made it impossible to settle in their pound,-a-month, one-bedroom flat.   She said her dream of making a home with her boyfriend Tristan, , has been made impossible because of the children, and they are planning to move out. She claims her landlord had no idea such a large family was living upstairs. Lydia, who works part-time for a charity and part-time as a pet-sitter, said: When we first looked round I thought it seemed too good to be true. Its a pretty big space and has a balcony. We were both really excited when we got the keys, but then on the first night we moved in the noise began. We heard thumping and running about upstairs, it sounded like someone was moving furniture around too.  Lydia and Tristan, who works for a charity, went to meet the neighbours and to complain about the noise.She said they were really nice but that not much has changed since. She said: The noise starts around pm every night when I get home from work. You can hear the kids running about, sometimes it goes on until am. We asked them to try and keep the kids from running about above our bedroom. And thats got a bit better.  The dad even gave me his number so I can text him when it gets too out of hand, hes really nice about it. But theyve got  children - its going to be noisy no matter what. Lydia and Tristan pay pound, a month for their ground-floor flat with a balcony in trendy Stoke Newington and have been living there since May. Being unable to relax at home has been really hard on Lydia, whose mum died of cancer in September. She said: I was literally splitting my time between caring for my mum and being in the flat, so when I couldnt relax in the flat it was super stressful.  The noise has really affected our experience living in this flat. Were going to move out when the lease runs out in May. But finding somewhere in London takes so much time and energy, and with everything thats happened in the last six months we cant face it right now. Despite everything, Lydia is stoic about their situation.

Roxy, a Staffordshire bull terrier, is described as highly intelligent but despite her smarts the poor pooch has spent almost a decade in an animal shelter. Staff at Teckels in Whitminster, Gloucestershire, would bring specialist games to keep Roxy entertained and were amazed at how quickly she could figure them out. And now Roxy has finally found a home and has spent her first Christmas there after being adopted by dog groomer Leanne Wenban, Gloucestershire Live reports.  Leanne said: We saw her on the Teckels website and we saw that she had been at the kennels for a long time. We thought that we would see how it goes and it took around six months to get to where we are now. At first she ignored us but we went up to see her every Thursday and Sunday. At first we would sit in the cage with her and then eventually we were able to walk and cuddle her.  It does not usually take a dog that long to get used to someone but she needed extra time. Roxy now has her own bedroom complete with toys and treats, but she is still settling into the new home. After spending so long in the animal sanctuary, Roxy is still anxious and is not used to the peace and quiet. Leanne said: At first Roxy came to our house on visits. She is so good and she sleeps a lot. She loves to be tucked up into her blanket.  She also has her own bedroom which is like a small childs bed. Before she was so used to all the noise from the kennels which was fine and what she is or was used to but now I think that she is catching up on the peace and quiet. Leanne said that she loves all dogs and her partner Sam Green is what she describes as a bull breed fanatic. Leanne added: We have bought her lots of games. Board games for dogs, a snuffle mat, she is very clever. She works them out in minutes and we have to mix the games up each day as she remembers and figures out where the treats are. Teckels have been really good and have worked around us. They have made sure that there is always someone from there to be on hand to help Roxy visit. After a while, they did not have to supervise us being with her when we were making our visits. We were able to just sign in and go to see her. She is now starting to say hello to other dogs and is still a little nervous as it is like she sees it as her territory.

Lora Gosling, , went with  family and friends to the plush Woodbury Park Hotel for what they hoped would be a decadent festive meal. But they were left waiting for hours for their dinner and staff at the hotel near Exeter, Devon, offered no explanation, she claims. Many people took to social media to complain about the service, with some calling it a Fawlty Towers experience, Devon Live reports. The hotel says one of the ovens stopped working just as guests started to arrive.   Simon Grfin wrote on the hotels Facebook page: Our Christmas dinner  experience was at best Fawlty Towers! which is not what you expect when you pay pound. Sharon Simpson added: Shambolic Christmas dinner, what a disappointment. In the end, Lora and her family left without eating their pre-paid dessert and said the terrible experience ruined their Christmas. She said: We arrived at ten past  for a .pm lunch. We were the first ones there. At least we got our main course in the end but we waited an hour for our starter and another three hours for our main course and by then we had to leave at pm without our dessert.  Other people were just getting their mains when we left. I felt for the waiting staff who were copping it. They just kept telling people it would be another  minutes. People were not angry - just deflated. It was Christmas Day and they were hungry. There were about  people with young children who all left at about four without getting their main course. They need to offer a refund to everyone who was there. We were told we had to send an email to ask for a refund. They just said not to pay our bar bill. Related video: Shopper left fuming by smelly and revolting supermarket turkey  We asked to see the manager and he was as good as gold and held his hands up and admitted they had done really badly and it wasnt good enough. There were more than  people and everybody was just totally deflated. Her partner Darrell Willis said: It was awful. There were so many upset people. It was a shambles. Christmas dinner at the -bedroom hotel were sold at pound per person, and in some cases were paid for in advance. John Bishop, from Pinhoe, Devon, said he went with three others and paid full price as a gt to his mother in law, but they all left after the first course. He said: She was really looking forward to it and it was awful. There were a few tears on the way home.  We spent pound each and walked out after two and a half hours with only having our first course. Loads of unhappy customers waited longer than us. It was disgusting - mind you the soup was nice! But a bit pricey. My wes salmon starter was lovely - but by then she would have ate the plate as well. What a waste of a day. We are having a second Christmas day on Boxing Day to make up for it and trying to see the funny side of it. But for a professional organisation like that who cater for all the rugby teams, it was a shambles. The restaurant manager who was there was new and he was so polite but the lack of information was part of the problem. People were offering to put on a pinny and go and help.  Calum Colquhoun, general manager at the hotel, said he would be speaking to inidual diners personally to apologise. He explained that one of the main ovens had stopped working just as people began to arrive for lunch and said it was incredibly disappointing. He said: I have been doing this job for a long time and I have to say in terms of things going wrong it could not have been worse timing. I am incredibly disappointed that we have gone through the whole festive season serving literally thousands of covers and we got to the most important service of the whole month and this happened. Some people began to arrive early and there was no going back. The oven was out of action for an hour but it was in that critical time when it was incredibly bad timing for the kitchen and everything began to snowball. There was nothing  we could have done. A few people I have spoken to had a great meal but for many we simply did not get their food out quickly enough. It was dficult for the front of house staff. We have asked those people who were affected to contact us.

But as soon as the little prince, who was at the time fourth in line to the throne, arrived things changed dramatically. Speaking before her tragic death, Diana revealed the first comment Charles made about his second son made her close off. During an interview in , published in a book by Andrew Morton years later, she said: Then suddenly as Harry was born it just went bang, our marriage, the whole thing went down the drain.  Diana claims to reveal the first words out of her husbands mouth were oh God, its a boy, followed by: and hes even got red hair. She said: Something inside me closed off. Harry would have been around the age of seven at the time of Diana interviews. She said of the young prince: Harry was a complete joy and is actually closer to his father than perhaps William at the moment. She also admitted that she hid Harrys gender from Charles because she knew how much he wanted a little girl.  She said: I knew Harry was going to be a boy because I saw on the scan. Charles always wanted a girl. He wanted two children and he wanted a girl. I knew Harry was a boy and I didnt tell him. Harry arrived, Harry had red hair, Harry was a boy. Diana didnt stop there. She claimed that Charles took his discontent over not having a boy to her own mother at Harrys christening. She said: [Prince] Charles went to talk to my mother at Harrys christening and said: We were so disappointed - we thought it would be a girl.  Frances Kydd, who orced from Dianas father Viscount John Spencer in , reportedly wasnt best pleased with his comment.

Ever since that day the shutters have come down and thats what he does when he gets somebody answering back at him. Andrew Morton, unable to go to the palace to interview Diana in person, conducted by proxy interviews instead.  He enlisted the help of mutual friend James Colthurst to present questions to the princess and recorded her answers on secret tapes. It is widely thought Diana wanted to get her own story out before she was solely blamed for the orce. According to the book, Charles and his we had been in total darkness between the births of William and Harry and she had blotted it out as it was such pain.

The Duchess of Sussex is expecting her first child with Prince Harry in the spring, and shes been proudly showing off her growing bump for the last month. But some of her staff are a bit worried about her as it seems she has no plans to slow down in the lead up to her due date. The Mirrors royal correspondent Russell Myers says the Duchess is a workaholic and claims she got where she got by being a certain way.  Speaking on Lorraine, Russell said: Certain members of staff and the aides are encouraging her to slow down a little bit, perhaps she is taking on too much. Meghan took on her first solo project, a charity cookbook for people affected by the Grenfell Tower tragedy, earlier this year and it was a huge success. Shes expected to announce her royal patronages in the new year after in-depth conversations with the Queen. The women met for tea at Buckingham Palace earlier this month to discuss Meghans potential new roles. Its likely that Meghan will take on causes which are in line with her interests, including female empowerment, education and the arts.  She is said to have secretly already met a rang of organisations and charities. They include the Campaign for Female Education, which supports marginalised girls in Africa, and the Association of Commonwealth Universities. The Queen is patron of more than  organisations and charities. Two years ago, she handed  patronages to younger members of the royal family. She gave the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club — host of the Wimbledon tournament - to the Duchess of Cambridge while Prince Harry received the Rugby Football Union.

Drivers are responsible for keeping up to date with the law and changes to the Highway Code. And with technology constantly advancing, cars and road travel rules must adjust to match. Only in the last year there have been changes to rules and laws concerning both car tax and learner drivers. Now for , there are to be a whole host of changes including new motorway, MOT and learner driver rules. To coincide with this Wales Live and Grimsby Live have put together a list of the all the changes coming next year. Passing cyclists It has always been inadvisable to pass too closely to a cyclist for safety reasons but you could now be finedyou come within a certain distance while overtaking. Following law changes in March, motorists could be fined for not leaving enough space between a vehicle and a bike. Failure to do so could land you with a pound fine and three points on your licence. Police forces across the country are being encouraged to penalise those who drive dangerously close to cyclists. The Highway Code states drivers should leave at least .m , which is roughly a car door width.   Motorways For years, it was the law that new drivers could only use motorways once they had already passed their driving test. However, they are now allowed to use them as part of a lesson when they are accompanied by an instructor with dual controls in the car. However, this is only optional - it isnt compulsory for learners to have lessons on them. Smart motorways The government is also considering fines of up to pound for motorists who drive on lanes which have been closed on a smart motorway. These lanes are shown by red Xs on automated signs above the motorway, and are used when there is a blockage or accident to prevent further incidents. Any drivers who ignore the signs in futurecould face fines. The government is expected to announce that offenders will face pound fines and three points on their licence. It is believed they will be modying roadside cameras to help identy drivers who violate these restrictions. MOT rules There are new categories for defects with cars which drivers will have to understand, which are:Dangerous - Direct risk to road safety or the environment. Results in a Fail. Major - Could affect safety or the environment. Results in a Fail. Minor - No effect on safety, but should be repaired as soon as possible. Advisory - Could have an effect in future. Pass - Meets the current legal standards.  A iety of new requirements are also being included in the MOT for the first time. These checks include:Under-inflated tyres Contaminated brake fluid Brake pad warning lights and missing brake pads or discs Reversing lightsDaytime running lights .Some things wont change though - the government considered ening the wait for a vehicles first MOT from three to four years, but it will now remain unchanged. Diesel car tax The tax rates of diesel cars were increased from April  of this year. This applies to the Vehicle Excise Duty , usually known as road tax. Instead of being fixed at pound per year, VED rates will now be calculated based on the cars carbon dioxide emissions. The highest raise of first-year tax is pound, for cars which emit between  and g of carbon dioxide per year. However, those which emit the more environmentally-friendly  to g km will only see their tax go up by pound. Graduated driving licence Recently qualied drivers could also face changes once they have passed. The government has proposed bringing in a graduated driving licence. Currently, new drivers who have been behind the wheel for less than two years face stronger penalties for offences like using a mobile phone. However, a whole range of restrictions could also be imposed. The RAC believes these are likely to focus on:Curfews - Times when they are allowed to be on the road Passengers - Limits for how many passengers a new driver can have Speed - Separate, lower speed limits to other drivers Engine sizes - Limits on how powerful their cars can be Mandatory P plates - These are currently optional, but could be made mandatory for up to two years Alcohol - Lower limits than the general driving population.A pilot scheme for graduated licences will be tested in Northern Ireland from  to . This could lead to it being rolled out widersuccessful.

Taylor Barnes, , didnt enjoy Christmas as a child and her heart sank every time she heard festive songs on the radio. Growing up in the care system, she felt left out of the celebrations, and last year faced spending it alone with just her young daughter, Harper. But she was inspired to organise a massive dinner for dozens of people - including the homeless and a single dad and his four-year-old son - feeling equally lonely, and saw the joy it brought them.   Taylor, who is six-months pregnant with her second child, pulled out the stops and recruited Scottish comedian Hardeep Singh Kohli as her head chef for the day. They spent Christmas Eve preparing a three-course meal for  guests, including elderly widowers, single parents, struggling families and people living in a homeless shelter. And on Christmas Day everyone sat down at Gibbs Hill Community Centre, in Greenock, Inverclyde, to pull crackers, tell jokes, and eat a three-course meal. Taylor said: We did the prep on Christmas Eve, but it was a bit stressful trying to make sure everything was OK.   Everybody got presents - this year I went to Boots, and spent pound per person. There was a three-for-two offer on so I got presents for families, gt sets for adults, a selection box and candy canes. Some families coming this year were quite stuck - thats just the way le is. Last year there was a woman who said it was her first Christmas in  years.   It was pure emotional seeing her joy on the day. I bumped into her in town in November and she said how much she was looking forward to it, but sadly she passed away. Taylor had hoped to double her numbers for the dinner but felt she couldnt after finding out she is expecting a baby boy, who she will name Presley, in March. She said her hormones were sky-high but was determined not to let that get in the way - and found that many local businesses were willing to help. Guests ranged in age from one to  - and the majority of diners were elderly people, many of whom were widowed.   A single dad travelled from Glasgow with his four-year-old son, and  people living in a homeless shelter were invited. Diners enjoyed a three-course meal was served, starting with lentil soup and crusty bread, followed by steak pie with roast potatoes, parsnips, sprouts and gravy. A generous bakery made an enormous Christmas cake and a nearby cafe donated homemade ice-cream.  After the meal, everyone got on the dancefloor for a disco, and entertainment was provided by talented singers who belted out Christmas songs. Taylor made sure everyone had a gt to open, which she bought from the three-for-two range in Boots. Her two-year-old daughter Harper was too young last year to realise the magic that her mum was bringing to lonely people in the community. But this year Taylor sat her down and told her about their special day. She said: I was looking forward to it this year - the first time, I didnt know how it was going to go. I think every place needs something like this, I can see the dference it makes.

The story of how both sides put down their weapons to play football on Christmas Day  is well known. But the recently discovered journal of a Tommy, in an entry made a few weeks after the Christmas Truce, revealed another gentleman’s shyagreement in the trenches. The Tommy, of rd Battalion Northumberland Fusiliers, wrote on February , : “In one place the [soldiers] have a sort of understanding, and show their heads over the top.” But before a bombardment, each side would warn the other to take cover.He added: “When the Germans get word our trenches are going to be shelled, they sign to us. The Brits do the same. General HQ would be pretty sickthey knew.”  The soldier, name unknown, movingly describes his sadness that a wounded German had to endure an agonising, drawn-out death in No Man’s Land. He adds: “Thank God he is dead today as we could not get him in.” His -page diary shydocuments his battalion’s engagement at Neuve Chapelle and in the First Battle of Ypres. Professor Graham Seal, author of The Soldiers’ Press: Trench Journals in the First World War, said: “In some parts of the line, soldiers on both sides would let each other know of impending artillery attacks.The Christmas Truce is another manestation of the same human instinct to preserve le in the midst of the carnage in the trenches, and there were similar unofficial, though less-known, ‘truces’. “As the diarist says, the brass hats back at HQ would be very ‘sick’they knew about it – which, of course, many officers actually in the trenches did, though these mostly, and wisely, turned a blind eye.”  The diary was auctioned at shyBellmans, of Wisborough Green, West Sussex, for pound,. Denise Kelly, books specialist at Bellmans, said: “This shyincredible diary is so full of detail. I could not put it down, and I was instantly transported back to the trenches, asI was standing next to the writer.” “It is a fascinating, moving, historical record of horric battles fought by very shyshybrave men.” Denise added: “After the Christmas Day football game and truce they found it very hard to go back to fighting because they had bonded.” "},{"url":null,"title":"burglar dressed rudolph red nosed","story":"NewsBurglar dressed as Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer caught on CCTV raiding businessAn officer trying to find the suspect recorded a video of herself singing a special version of Rudolph the Red Nosed ReindeerShareCommentsByKelly-Ann Mills:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video police-hunt-rudolph-red-nosed-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA burglar wearing a reindeer character head has been caught on camera raiding a business days before Christmas.

She claims the total figure left her feeling sick and she admits shes been stupid. Explaining her situation, she says she was in hospital so ended up rushing a lot of the present buying.

Ive been in hospital and was in a rush to get things done. I have six children and a big family. I just kept spending without budgeting.Ive spent about pound each on the kids - lots of clothes and things they need - hot water bottle, duvet cover, water bottle, school pencils, pjs etc plus lots of toys. We buy hardly any clothes during the year and no toys whatsoever.We cant really afford it - although its manageable. I just feel a bit sick really.

Arslan Kaipkulov, , was allowed to step inside the Russian presidents Ilyushin Il-- - and was gted a camera by the leader. The teenager, who is an aviation fanatic, was granted his wish personally by the Russian leader. Putin also gted him a video camera to film on board his presidential Ilyushin Il-- - when he captured sensitive images of the leaders rumoured gold-plated toilet, private wine stocks and even his double bed. However the boy was not allowed to show certain “confidential” parts of the plane’s sumptuous interior. Arslan suffers from a rare type of primary immunodeficiency disease, a disorder of the immune system. He said: This is the top secret plane of the country, it is an honour for me to be on it.   The teenager is the only child registered with this condition in Russia. Arslan said Putin had made his “dream come true” after seeing a film the boy had made for a charity event. Putin was not on board his hi-tech flying palace aircraft during the visit - but instead spoke to him by phone from the Kremlin. The teenager was allowed to sit in the captain’s seat in the cockpit and saw the conference room from where Putin controls Russia from the skies on an aircraft officially called Board Number One.  However, in some parts of the lavish plane, he was prevented from filming. ”I visited other places, but you cannot shoot there,” he said. “It’s confidential there.” So there was no footage from the teenager showing Putin’s personal quarters including his bedroom and bathroom - even though images purporting to show these parts of the aircraft have been released before by Russian state TV.   The plane one of the most luxurious in the world and is said to boast a gold-plated toilet, a king sized bed fit for a tsar and a gym. The interior deacutecor has a neoclassical style and the huge conference table is gold trimmed and surrounded by cream leather seats. Putin is believed to have clocked up more air miles in high office than all other Russian leaders put together.  Arslan, from the Bashkortostan region of Russia, along with his mother Venera Kaipkulova, , was also shown how pre-flight checks are undertaken in a VIP section of Moscow’s Vnukovo airport. Security operatives gave him a fake device carrying the smell of explosives and asked him to hide it in a cone. A trained dog successfully snfed out the item. He was told about the medical examinations pilots must undergo before flying the Russian president.   The trip was organised by Russia’s Dream With Me project which aims to make dreams come true for children with le-threatening conditions. His mother said: “It is a real miracle. “We are very grateful to the Dream With Me project. Huge thanks to our president.  “When children get ill it is not always easy to find time, money and strength for joy. “But joy is as important as treatment, it boosts and encourages you to keep moving forward.” The Russian leader helped to fulfil the dreams of several ill children, including Regina, who interviewed the president on the RT channel, Artyom, who enjoyed a helicopter tour of St. Petersburg, and Veronika, who visited Mosfilm, the Russian Hollywood.

However, her introduction to sport through Dundee Dragons Wheelchair Sports Club has changed all that and she has never looked back – alongside playing sport at an international level, Gemma also coaches at a local level and was previously the Scotland under-s Wheelchair Basketball assistant coach. vw, px\"  In a video thanking National Lottery players for supporting projects such as Dundee Dragons, Gemma said: “Before Dundee Dragons I didn’t have a lot of ambition and didn’t really see myself as fitting in. At my school I was the only person with a physical disability, so I really struggled with my mood and I was quite down. I struggled to accept myself and saw my disability as a negative thing.“Sport has really given me something to aim towards. Dundee Dragons has changed my whole perspective and I wouldn’t have been able to get the opportunities I have without my disability so from having a negative perspective it’s completely changed everything for me. Through time and seeing other wheelchair users, what was possible for them and how independent they could be, I’ve developed my skills and got more involved.“I’m now employed by Dundee Dragons so it’s not just given me opportunities on the court but off court skills as well which are invaluable really. It’s changed my le and I’m so grateful for what they’ve done.” vw, px\"  This year has been Gemma’s most memorable to date, crowned sportscotland  Young Coach of the Year as well as being named Young Volunteer of the Year at the Dundee Sports Awards.

It was ‘who do you think it’s going to be  I’ve heard this or that’ and stuff like that.“I think with regards to the owners or the chairman, we don’t really see them that much on a day-to-day basis.“And the club has been running along smoothly, so it was not something we were speaking about too much.“There was a lot of talk about it in the week or so leading up to the takeover being confirmed last week, so it was mentioned but not all that much to be honest.”Now, though, Booth is keen to see just how much Minnesota-based Ogren is going to give manager Robbie Neilson to further strengthen the squad for the second half of the season.“January and the transfer window is coming and it will be interesting what happens, though it’s hard to say what will. We’ll get a view of the chairman’s ambition then and see what he does.“For us, Mike Martinwas a great guy but we didn’t see him too much and it will be the same with the new owner. We’ll talk about it a little bit but not too much and we just concentrate on the games coming up.”That focus on games made Booth well aware of the importance of United getting a win when Falkirk visited last Saturday.He believes the three points taken from that - victory were vital.“Obviously we’d not won in three games, so it was vital to get back to winning ways, especially at home.“Our last home performance against Ayr was disappointing, so it was huge to get the three points and I thought we played well and created a load of chances.“We probably should have been at least - up by the time injury time came and we gave away the penalty they scored from.“We were a bit slack for it and it meant the last few minutes were kind of ‘oh no’, but we managed to hold out pretty comfortably in the end and deserved the win.“It should have been dead and buried before that and I was really disappointed at not getting the clean sheet because we had defended really well during the game.“Overall, it was a good performance and a good win. We created good openings and we need to learn from that and put away more chances when we’re creating them like we did.”Booth also believes it was important United got back to imposing their passing game on teams again, just as they’d done in the draw at Inverness a week earlier.“That’s two good performances in a row. Four points from a home game against Falkirk and a trip to Inverness is not a bad .“We had a little dip and the Ayr United game took us by shock.“We didn’t really recover the week after down at Morton where it was a pretty poor performance but we feel back on track and long may it continue.”"},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-takeaway-launches-deep-fried-mars-bar-calzone","story":"A GLASGOW takeaway has launched one of the worlds unhealthiest pizzas - a deep fried MARS BAR calzone containing around , calories."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-and-meghan-expecting-first-baby","story":"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting a baby in spring , Kensington Palace has announced."},{"url":null,"title":"teen-bakes-grandads-ashes-into-biscuits-and-shares-with-classmates","story":"A high school student mixed her cremated grandfatherrsquos ashes into homemade sugar biscuits and shared them with several classmates, police in Calornia said on Wednesday."},{"url":null,"title":"airnbnb-glasgow-city-council-bans-estate-agent-from-running-holiday-let","story":"AN estate agent has been banned from running an Airbnb let in a residential block on Glasgowrsquos West End in a landmark case."},{"url":null,"title":"iona-turner-christmas-time-is-the-kick-start-our-wavering-high-street-needs","story":"FOR years now Irsquove heard complaints left, right and centre about the High Street being dead.

On-loan left-back Max Lowe missed out due to a calf injury with Dom Ball coming in.That meant captain Graeme Shinnie moved to left-back with Ball in central midfield beside Lewis Ferguson, however this ploy only last quarter of an hour with Shinnie soon moving into central midfield, with Ball at centre-back and Andy Considine shted to left-back.After only six minutes it was the visitors who took the lead. Former Reds loanee Ryan Christie found a pocket of space and released Callum McGregor down the left.McGregor drove towards the byline with Ferguson chasing and fired in a low cross, Ball was at the back post and attempted to clear, but his touch dropped for Scott Sinclair who tapped home from six yards.On  minutes Celtic had another chance but when the ball was headed on to Christie in the box by Mikael Lustig Christie could only stab a tame effort straight into the hands of Reds keeper Joe Lewis.At the other end Sam Cosgrove pressed Craig Gordon and almost forced the Celtic goalie into a mistake.But in the rd minute the Dons were level. Niall McGinn had plenty of joy down the right flank against Emilio Izaguirre.Another lobbed ball down the wing from Shay Logan put McGinn in behind and after the Northen Irishman had crossed he was clattered by Izaguirre # it was an easy decision for referee Willie Collum to make and he obliged by pointing to the penalty spot.Stevie May stepped up and fired the ball down the middle past Gordon for his second league goal of the season to make it -.Just after the half hour Lewis made a vital stop to bail out Scott McKenna. The Scotland international#s diagonal pass was wayward and went straight to Sinclair who slipped Christie in on the left side of the area.Christi#e low shot was saved by Lewis# right foot before McKenna hacked the rebound away.Soon after Lewis held a curling effort from Sinclair.With four minutes of the first half left Christie sent a curving shot wide from  yards.The Dons started the second half without McGinn, who was a constant threat on the right, Scott Wright was his replacement at half-time.Celtic replaced Izaguirre with former Don Jonny Hayes.The Hoops started the second period with more possession but they were finding it dficult to create any chances against a stubborn home defence.On one occasion when James Forrest jinked away from Considine on the right McKenna made a great block to stop the shot.On  minutes the Dons were wanting another penalty when Scott Brown seemed to barge McLennan right on the edge of the box, but Collum opted to wave play on.With  minutes left Lewis did well to beat Sinclair#s long-range free-kick to safety.In the th minute the Reds were undone and it was cruel on them.Sub Odsonne Edouard held the ball in and was able to turn, the French striker teased a ball down the right, which Forrest just reached before Considine and when he squared it Sinclair ghosted in between Logan and Ball to tuck home from six yards.But Aberdeen refused to go in and with eight minutes to play they had a second penalty and a second leveller.Shinnie lofted the ball over Lustig and as the Dons skipper went to cross the Celtic right-back appeared to trip Shinnie and Collum pointed to the spot.With May off strike partner Cosgrove stepped up and fired high into the right corner with his right foot.The parity only lasted until the th minute. Forrest advanced towards the penalty area, his ball into the box was cut out by the sliding McKenna, but the follow-up fell for Edouard who lted the ball into the right corner from  yards.Two minutes later it was - when Edouard bundled past Logan and Ball down the left and eventually squared for Sinclair to tap in for his hat-trick.The Dons weren#t done and in the th minute Ferguson volleyed home McLennan#s corner from the left, but they couldn#t find a stoppage time leveller.Aberdeen: Joe Lewis, Shay Logan, Andy Considine, Scott McKenna, Graeme Shinnie, Niall McGinn , Dom Ball, Lewis Ferguson, Connor McLennan, Sam Cosgrove, Stevie May .Subs not used: Tomas Cerny, Chris Forrester, Stephen Gleeson, Bruce Anderson, Dean Campbell.Celtic: Craig Gordon, Mikael Lustig, Dedryck Boyata, Filip Benkovic, Emilio Izaguirre , Scott Brown, Tom Rogic, Callum McGregor , James Forrest , Scott Sinclair, Ryan Christie.Subs not used: Scott Bain, Olivier Ntcham, Mikey Johnston, Anthony Ralston."},{"url":null,"title":"shinnie had no doubts dons would be back in the mix","story":"Skipper Graeme Shinnie insists he would have bitten your hand off six weeks ago for a top-of-the-table showdown with Celtic.Now the Reds have moved just three points off the defending champions, Shinnie aims to grab the chance to go level in today’s clash.At the turn of this month, the possibility of moving joint top looked remote as the Reds were in the Premiership bottom six.Aberdeen languished in seventh when they lost the Betfred Cup final - to the Hoops at Hampden on December .The Premiership was billed as the most competitive title race in years but the Dons, runners-up for four consecutive seasons, were in the unfamiliar territory of being outside looking in.Not any more.Aberdeen are right in the mix again after a four-game winning streak.Shinnie, , said: “If we were offered this six weeks ago, we would have bitten your hand off for it.“Six or seven weeks ago not many people would have seen that coming.“It is testament to how well the squad have done that we now have what could be called a top-of-the-table clash.“We have to make sure we are up for this and that we continue this run as much as we can.“That is the most enjoyable part that we have put ourselves back in that position.“We are going into this game full of confidence.”One person who did see the Reds revival coming was Aberdonian Shinnie who never flinched in his belief they would rocket back up the table.Askedhe was confident the Dons would rise up the Premiership, Shinnie said: “Definitely. We had some good results throughout the season.“There was the win at Ibrox , the one at Hibsin the cup and also Rangersin the cup.“We know what we have in the squad and it was just trying to build the  of clean sheets and being good defensively.“The strikers are now scoring goals, which is always crucial for us, and we are picking up the wins.“It was always there, it was just a case of going out there and doing it as a team.“We have done that and hopefully it will continue.”The Betfred Cup final loss was the first fixture of a congested run with nine games packed into this month.In the immediate aftermath of that final loss, Shinnie claimed Celtic lacked class for their over-celebrations.Shinnie blasted the Hoops as captain Scott Brown and Mikael Lustig appeared to goad teen Lewis Ferguson by celebrating in front of him just seconds before full-time at Hampden.It wasn’t the first time Celtic have failed to show dignity in victory against the Dons.Shinnie was furious at the time but insists their over-celebration will not provide any extra fuel to win today.The opportunity to move level on points with the league leaders is motivation enough.He said: “Celtic won the cup on the day and deserved to celebrate, albeit it was too much in my eyes.“It was frustrating at the time but in the next couple of days you get over that pretty quick.“That is what happens when you win a trophy and so be it.“Today will be a totally dferent game as it is at Pittodrie and hopefully we will have the crowd right behind us.“Then we will see how the game goes.”Should Aberdeen overcome Celtic today it will inevitably, and rightly, spark speculation of a title challenge from Pittodrie. On a potential title bid, Shinnie is remaining grounded, insisting: “It is very early days to be saying that from where we have just came from.“We are only just getting back to where we want to be and the focus is on just taking each game as it comes.“We always want to be as close to the top as we can andthat puts us in that position, good. But we never get ahead of ourselves.”Aberdeen set up the opportunity to move level with Celtic by seeing off Hearts - at Pittodrie, courtesy of a Sam Cosgrove double.Shinnie said: “It was important to try to keep the momentum going.“We knew it was going to be a tough game as Hearts were trying to bounce back after a dficult defeat .“We knew they were going to come up and fight and scrap.“However, the boys were brilliant.“It was a real professional performance as we dealt with Hearts very well and now we move on.”Shinnie’s contract expires at the end of the season and he is free to speak to any interested clubs when the transfer window opens on January .Boss Derek McInnes wants to tie Shinnie and Gary Mackay-Steven, who is also set to go out of contract, on new deals.McInnes ideally wants an answer on their Pittodrie futures before January but will not lay down a concrete ultimatum.Shinnie insists his concentration has been on the packed festive fixture list and not on his future.When quizzedthere had been any development with his contract situation, he said: “Not with the amount of games we have had in December. It will take its time and will develop when it does.“I am just trying to focus on recovering from these games and trying to go again.”"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen road to shut for crane works","story":"An Aberdeen city centre road is expected to temporarily close next month for crane works.Flourmill Lane in Aberdeen will shut between its junction with Netherkirkgate and the entrance to Marks  Spencer’s click and collect on January  at am.The closure will be in place until pm.There will also be a ban on parking on either side of St Catherine’s Wynd between its junctions with Netherkirkgate and Union Street.Aberdeen City Council said illegally parked vehicles will be removed at the owners’ expense.The existing one-way restriction on St Catherine’s Wynd will be suspended.The restrictions are in the interest of public safety during crane works being carried out by Cobra TM.A ersion is available via Upperkirkgate, Gallowgate, Littlejohn Street, West North Street, King Street, Castle Street and Union Street."},{"url":null,"title":"brave swimmers take the plunge in boxing day dip at aberdeen beach","story":"Dozens of brave souls have taken part in the annual Boxing Day swim in the North Sea.The Nippy Dipper, organised by The Aberdeen Lions Club, saw around  people run into the water at Aberdeen beach to raise money for charity.Even more people turned out to watch from the sand as the fearless fundraisers donned fancy dress to e into the waves.Inflatable donkeys, dinosaurs and Christmas onesies were just some of the outfits that took to the bone-chilling water."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/12/EE-DB-26122018-02-004-846x564.jpg ","title":"bumper boxing day as aberdeen shoppers flock to sales","story":"Shops across Aberdeen had a bumper Boxing Day as thousands of bargain hunters hit the high street with more of the same expected today.Shoppers were out in force in Aberdeen city centre as the traditional post-Christmas price drop lured them in.Boxing Day is one of the busiest days of the year for shopping centres in Aberdeen, with thousands visiting stores.Festive displays across the city centre have been swapped for huge signs promising hefty discounts.Ryan Manson, general manager at Union Square, said Next and many other retailers opened early to accommodate bargain hunters.He said: “The centre got progressively more busy as the day went on, with lots of people looking to spend their Christmas vouchers.“There’s also a lot of demand for our cinema and restaurants today, as consumers look for a day out after spending yesterday at home.“We predict another busy day today.” vw, px\"  Shoppers yesterday queued outside stores around Aberdeen before the sun had even risen, including Next at Berryden, where around  people waited for the shop’s am opening.Craig Stevenson, centre manager for Bon Accord Shopping Centre, said the mall had been busier than last year.He said: “It has been busier for longer as well.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 48","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCongratulations are due to a number of local people this week.We#re surrounded by heroes every day, most of whom are unsung, but David MacInnes was quite rightly recognised last week for his work in boosting the cause of stem cell research and donation.

No wonder he looked nervous.The boys got to grips with the dferent handling characteristics of Willie Senior#s car and started to up the pace in the afternoon bringing the car home in a respectable th overall and third in class three. This result was enough to secure second position in the overall championship in class.Jamie Miller continued the learning process with the little Citroen C-RMax with Ian McCulloch pointing him in the right direction. A very neat rally from Jamie with very few mistakes saw him finish a creditable th overall and second in class two, only beaten by the Scottish Tarmac Champion for  Michael Harbour in his similar Citroen, who was only one place above him after seven stages.Innes Mochrie was once again out on the stages in the Mightyand this time he had someone whom he might listen to in the co-driver#s seat. His daughter, Kirsty, had elected to fill the silly seat for this event and they, after a few first stage detours, managed to keep speaking right to the end and brought the class one pocket rocket home in th overall and a brilliant second in class. The mind boggles as to what the result could have been , as Kirsty was heard to remark, she had #someone who would listen to her#.Jonothan MacDonald and Chris Wareham were out in the beautully prepared Mull of Kintyre Cheese sponsored Peugeot . Their pace was good enough for th overall and fourth in class three.Mull pair Malcolm MacDougall and Stuart MacLean were out in the class one Vauxhall Nova and were getting visibly quicker as the day went on, a trend that had repeated itself over the course of the year with confidence and technique increasing with every stage mile covered. They finished th overall and a commendable fourth in class one.There were three Argyll co-drivers directing their pilots around the airfield. Ian Parker, recently announced as one of seven # and the only Scot # co-drivers to be selected to join the MSA Academy for , was back in the Honda Civic of Fraser Smith. The Civic screamed its way round the stages with minimal fuss, other than perhaps a lucky trip on two wheels after clipping a tyre, to finish in nd overall and fourth in class two.The final Argyll man out was Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan who was shouting left and right for Greg Inglis of Montrose in his quick and agile Lotus Exige. Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed. They were surprised, perhaps unjustly, to find out they were sitting well up the leader board after the first few stages. They got the hammer down over the last three and were to finish fth overall and first in class three.They were beaten only by the Kirkaldy brothers, both in Escort MkII#s of the highest calibre, and two WRC cars driven by Brian Watson and Reay Mackay.Last but not least, Oban#s Angus MacNeil was out with Sam MacFadyen in Brian Watson#s Mitsubishi Evo  binging it home unscathed in th overall.The event was won by Alan Kirkaldy in a freshly built Escort MkII, followed by his circuit racer brother Andrew in secondand Reay Mackay taking the last podium place in his WRC Fiesta.

Alternatively write to: Argyllshire Advertiser,  Argyll Street, Lochgilphead, Argyll, PA NBSir,As reported in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Christmas came early for local causes in Argyll recently when the Co-op revealed a £, festive funding boost.The money was shared by three organisations, all of whom are making a real dference to communities throughout the region. These are Argyll and Bute Youth Forum, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and Lochgilphead Phoenix Project, which wants to build an information point on the front green in Lochgilphead.This is the latest round of payouts from the fund generated by more than  , Co-op members in Argyll and Bute and means the Co-op has invested £, in nine groups in Argyll since the membership scheme launched in September .Co-op members, who receive a five per cent reward for themselves with a further one per cent going to local causes when they buy own-brand products, have a say in how the money is allocated, and are encouraged to select the organisations they wish to support online.Since the launch of the local community fund Co-op members have helped , organisations make a positive dference in their neighbourhoods and in the last  months alone £m has been invested in local causes.The fund is now supporting a wide iety of local organisations, from village halls and support groups to education providers and neighbourhood watch schemes, all of which are helping to make Argyll a better, happier, and healthier place to live.Rebecca Birkbeck, Co-op director of community engagement.Sir,I was pleased to attend the latest Argyll Islands Strategic Group meeting in Kilmory recently.I was able to speak to Scottish Government and Argyll and Bute Council representatives about the challenges facing our island communities.While we on the islands of Islay, Jura, Colonsay and Gigha are rightfully enjoying strong local economic growth, future growth will be stled by poor local infrastructure, at times unreliable ferry links and the never-ending troubles with the A.Regardless of what political stripe the leadership of the Scottish and UK parliaments have, all should be united in getting our vital links to the mainland and wider the UK economy back up to scratch.Without large scale investment from central government to fix Argyll and Bute#s roads and Transport Scotland#s trunk roads, our future prosperity is at risk and, as ever, it will be islanders that suffer the most.While political bun fights in the local press letters pages are entertaining,  what we really need is action from our MSPs and MPs.If we were talking about road and transport links between Scotland#s cities, it is highly likely these problems would already be fixed. The Scottish Government must in the future not be so urban-centric in its allocation of resources.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,I write following the release of the latest figures on alcohol use by the Office for National Statistics .The more you drink, the greater the long-term risk to your health and these ONS figures show a worrying increase in the number of alcohol-specic deaths in the UK, particularly amongst women and  to -year olds.From time to time, we are contacted by the families of people who have died as a result of alcohol and are only too aware of the heartbreak and utter sense of helplessness people feel when trying to lead someone to seek help for alcohol misuse.We must all do more to address the stigma that people feel in reaching out for support. For many of us, there are simple and effective ways for people to cut back on alcohol.Taking more drink-free days each week for example can reduce the overall amount of alcohol you drink and reduce the risk of developing serious illnesses. The Drinkaware website also provides information and resources for people concerned about their drinking or that of someone close to them and our DrinkChat online advisors can direct people, in complete confidence, to local treatment agencies.Elaine Hindal, Drinkaware chief executive."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll flower club hosts christmas special","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowMid Argyll Flower Club members welcomed Sandra Robertson from Dumfries to their annual open evening on Monday December .A packed house watched with interest as Sandra created amazing Christmas-themed displays.Lucky raffle winners left with beautul arrangements that, with care and attention, could see them through Christmas.Sandra, who won Best in Show  at Gardening Scotland with a James Bond inspired arrangement, was an excellent demonstrator and told many humorous stories of her #flower le# to an enthralled and appreciative audience."},{"url":null,"title":"the adventures of mr toad a ribbitting performance","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowBy Anne BeckittThe Mid Argyll Musical Society recently showcased their production of The Adventures of Mr Toad in Ardrishaig Hall to great acclaim.The praise was well-justied for the whole production was a shining example of what real teamwork can make from good material.The cast included primary and secondary students as well as adults, covering very ied levels of stage experience, yet they all worked together with a smoothness that appeared effortless but was, in fact, the result of much care and expert guidance.The chorus was as well rehearsed as the principal characters, and the evident enjoyment of every actor and singer meant the audience could relax totally and enjoy it all.Even lost lines, and the problems of dealing bravely with injuries were easily managed with good humour that won all hearts. That kind of team confidence comes from having the care and understanding of first class management.The staging was deceptively simple and the backstage staff produced a delightful cart and car for Mr Toad, plus his horse, and the costumes were not elaborate while most effective.All were well-rehearsed, and the singing was clearly the result of very careful expert teaching. It was a great pleasure to see how some of the young voices have been developing since their last appearance in #The Wizard of Oz#.We would have liked a couple of the characters to project spoken parts more audibly but overall the clarity of words should be complimented.The energy of Mr Toad himself carried all before him, just as it is written in the script and the original Wind in the Willows.No inidual names are here mentioned, quite deliberately, as the outstanding impression of this show was the seamless blending of the entire team involved, with each and every participant a star in their own right."},{"url":null,"title":"camanachd association agm reports income rise","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Camanachd Association#s annual general meeting took place in the Muthu West End Hotel, Fort William, on Friday November .The  accounts showed a £, increase in turnover and a surplus of £,, increasing the association#s reserves to £, at December .Having fulfilled its obligations and met its related targets, the association did not suffer any reduction in its £, funding from Sportscotland, its largest single contributor.

The combination of problems forced the family to live in the bedroom of their house where the damp was less severe.After seven months of negotiating, Gary and Lindsay have moved out of the house into a privately let property close to Oban.At the time ACHA chief executive Alastair McGregor said: ‘The association will provide compensation through our redress policy to Mr Smith for his inconvenience. The association is committed to getting this matter concluded as soon as possible and for Mr Smith and his family to enjoy the facilities in their new home in the very near future.’In a letter to Mr McGregor, Gary said: ‘I am disgusted the way me and my family have been treated.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

South Ayrshire ruling councillors in the SNP and Labour rejected a plan to build an underpass at Doonfoot in Ayr. But SNP Councillor Siobhian Brown defied her party to turn against their decision and call it in. In front of a packed council chamber, the Doonfoot politician spoke out against the Leadership Panel vote to install a Toucan crossing instead. She said: “Public safety is at stake here. I urge the  to send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking at the Audit and Governance Panel,she said: “I oppose the amendment on the strongest terms.” A police officer at the meeting backed her up saying the crossing and a mph zone extension would be unsafe. Citing a speeding concern, the police recommended an underpass as well. The Ayrshire Roads Allianceis also in favour of the underground crossing.  ARA head Stewart Turner said: “The best option is the underpass.” During a leadership  meeting last month, Councillor Ian Cochrane put forward an amendment for the crossing and mph extension. It deviated roads department recommendations to get planning consent for the subway this financial year. As a result external funding, which was available for the underpass, would go unused. Tory Councillor Hugh Hunter questioned SNP Councillor Cochrane on why he made the amendment. Councillor Cochrane said he had meant the Toucan crossing to be installed quickly while plans were being made to progress the underpass. The meeting heard how the Leadership Panel minutes did not reflect that. Councillor Hunter said: “The only thing we can do is send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking after the meeting, he added: “There is utter confusion in the Leadership Panel. I was astonished at that. It is a no brainer. What possessed people in a position of leadership to reject advice from the police and the roads department. It beggars belief. They turned down half a million pounds of external funding. There would be no defencesomeone died at that crossing.”  The Panel agreed to send it back to Leadership. Dozens of people donned visitor passes to pack into County Hall for the debate. Keen cyclist Clive Drummond said: “We are pleased that the council have directed the Leadership Panel to reconsider their decision to install a controlled crossing instead of an underpass at Dunure Road, Doonfoot.” He thanked people for firing off  emails to councillors to voice support for the underpass. He also thanked the Ayrshire Roads Alliance, Police Scotland and Councillor Siobhian Brown. Clive, of the South Ayrshire Paths Initiative , added: “SAPI hope the Leadership Panel will avoid further delay and move forward with construction of the underpass, which we believe is the only safe option to link the increasingly popular cycle paths.” He said the end result will be a “safe, easy to use, pleasant five mile walking and cycling route between Alloway and Ayr harbour. The issue was set to be brought back in front of the Leadership Panel yesterday .

And the health board have been asking young interns with additional support needs, and no training, to deal with the problem. Pictures seen by the Standard show dozens of ‘sharps’ boxes filled with hypodermic needles stacked up in full view of the public at a number of sites.  They also show hundreds of rubbish bags bursting from containers with incontinence pads, fluid bags, and materials soaked in blood and other bodily fluids not securely contained. That’s despite medical waste having to be dealt with under the strictest of safety and hygiene conditions. Now Chief Executive John Burns has been forced to issue reassurances to staff and the public, saying the problem had been “addressed immediately”.The Standard can exclusively reveal the extent of the problem faced by waste management operatives on a daily basis, with unions raising “grave concerns” at their exposure to a number of serious health risks. A dossier of evidence submitted to health bosses from UNISON showed project SEARCH interns had been tasked with dealing with the specialist problem. The project helps those aged  to  with additional needs – including those on the autistic spectrum – gain work experience and placements. In his submissions to senior management, Robert Rae, UNISON regional organiser, said the youngsters had been “primarily placed” to deal with disposal tasks. Mr Rae added: “We are calling upon John Burns to take immediate action to address the serious concerns we have with regards the potential risk to safety and wellbeing of staff and patients within NHS Ayrshire and Arran.  “Our members and the patients they serve should not be exposed to any potential risk of infection or injury due to the shambolic way the current waste crisis throughout the UK has been dealt with in NHS Ayrshire and Arran this past week.” Images show orange and yellow bags marked ‘clinical waste for alternative treatment or incineration’ overflowing from container cages at Crosshouse, Ayr and Ailsa hospitals. Another shows ‘sharps’ boxes piled up on top of an industrial freezer next to staff lockers. Cages containing ‘sharps’ boxes, cytotoxic, and used drug vials with the remnants of drugs, can be seen next to a perimeter fence with high banking, meaning anyone could lean over and access the boxes. Glass drugs vials, blood, incontinence pads, and other medical waste can also be seen on the ground.UNISON have raised concerns with the training, protocols, and risk assessments being applied to the disposal and handling of waste. Their report says that bags are being ‘inappropriately handled, stored and transported,’ citing instances where they have been thrown into cages or onto the ground, where they “cannot possibly only be handled by the neck” – the agreed safe method of handling such medical waste. Complaints to health bosses also show “blood spillages are often left untreated all day, despite being seen by supervisors”. Mr Rae added: “A supervisor was unable to advise of the procedure or cleaning agents used to clean this. “It is also concerning that the supervisor himself, when questioned, was unable to provide information on how spillages should be dealt with. “Staff have not been informed nor advised that they should be changing out of their work clothes which are clearly being exposed to spillages and they are travelling home in this clothing.

Headmaster Simon Johnston opened the new building, called Craigweil Lodge, last week. He believes it is a signicant step and provides extra classroom space and better single campus. He said: “It provides us with additional accommodation of the highest quality, but it also forges a link between the existing buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. “Wellington now has a single, coherent campus and the development potential of this wonderful seafront site has been well and truly unlocked.” The school is working in partnership with architects Austin-Smith: Lord on a long-term masterplan for the campus and this is very close to publication.  The new Lodge contains an additional P classroom and this year the school has three P classes for the first time. It also contains an additional social studies classroom, a staff work room and an attractive new Support for Learning Hub. Equally signicantly pupils will be able to move freely between buildings without having to go out onto the public pavement along Craigweil Road.

However, the change in use had gone unnoticed by Scottish Borders Council, until concerned neighbours began to complain about noise disturbances by rowdy hen parties.In November , Mr Cameron received a notice from the council outlining its grievances. It reads: ldquoIt appears to the council that a breach of planning control has occurred within the last ten yearsldquoIn terms of the character of the property, the house, while having nine bedrooms is advertised as being able to accommodate - guests, with the master bedroom being advertised with six double beds along with another of the bedrooms being advertised as having four double beds, which is not normally found in a residential property.ldquoThe characteristic of the use, where guests are generally visiting for a short period of time, and the numbers of guests being accommodated, has led to an increase in late night activity and disturbance within the area, to the detriment of the neighbouring residential amenity.ldquoAs stated above the use is having a detrimental impact on residential amenity, with regular reports of late night disturbances being made to ious council departments, including environmental health and the anti-social behaviour team as well numerous complaints to Police Scotland.Mr Cameron has subsequently appealed to the Scottish Governmentrsquos department for planning and environmental appeals , saying that because the property has been used for this purpose for more than ten years the council could no longer object to the change of use.Acting on Mr Cameronrsquos behalf, Edinburgh-based solicitors MHD Law have submitted an appeal statement to the DPEA.It reads: ldquoIt is alleged in the notice that a lsquomaterial change of usersquo of the property has taken place.ldquoHowever, Mr Cameron has been using the property as accommodation for short stay visitors since , and so for over ten years. In terms of the town and country planning act, no enforcement action may be taken by the local authority lsquoafter the end of the period of  years beginning with the date of the breachrsquo.ldquoMr Cameron therefore submits that the local authority is now barred from taking enforcement action, given that the use of the property as accommodation for short stay visitors has been in place for more than the period of ten years specied there.ldquoThe planning enforcement notice says that the use of the property for short term visitor stays lsquois having a detrimental impact on residential amenity.ldquoMr Cameron had been made aware of neighbour complaints and so reasonably assumed thathe addressed the causes of activities giving rise to those complaints he could reassure the council he was taking the matter seriously and minimising the impact of the behaviour complained of.The appeal statement also outlines the steps Mr Cameron has made in order to mitigate the noise disturbances from his property.This includes removing two hot tubs from the rear of the building, and instead installing a new one in the spa, which has triple-glazing to minimise noise impact.Mr Cameron has also proposed to remove the barbeque facility from the rear decking of the property, in an effort to stop groups of guests congregating outside.Finally, Mr Cameron has proposed employing a night manager to monitor the property and sound levels between pm and am on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and to give the four closest neighbours a direct line to the night manager to raise any issues immediately.However, the council has not backed down, and in their own submission to the Scottish Government, council planning officers state that because Mr Cameron still used the lodge as his main residence until , the ten year limitation on change of use enforcement had not come into effect.Ron Kirk, Scottish Borders Councilrsquos managing solicitor, wrote to the DPEA: ldquoBy his own admission, as set out in his e-mail to the council on  September , theappellant confirms that the property was still being used as a main residence up to a period of time within .ldquoThe council respectfully submits that an uninterrupted period of use could not have been established whilst the property was still the appellantrsquos main residence and therefore the relevant trigger point for the ten year period in terms of the town and country planning act was the date in  when the material change of use commenced.ldquoIt is acknowledged that the appellant has sought to address concerns surrounding the anti-social behaviour and the consequent effects this is having on the amenity of the residential area resulting from the use of the dwellinghouse, it is the view of the council that these matter are not a relevant consideration in respect of this appeal given that the appellant has accepted use of the dwellinghouse for short terms commercial visitor accommodation is a breach of planning control.Mr Kirk concludes his statement by saying that ldquoit is the position of the council that in order to remedy the breach of planning control in respect of an authorised use the only available route is to cease the unauthorised use and revert the back to the established use, meaning thatthe council is successful in its enforcement Mr Cameron will have to cease using the property for short-term lets.Having received both sides of the argument, the Scottish Governmentrsquosplanning officers will now conduct a site visit at Linton Lodge and make a judgement on the case, which is expected by March ."},{"url":null,"title":"community-rallies-to-support-the-family-of-amanda-cox","story":"A HUGE community effort to support the family of Amanda Cox will continue this evening.The

Irsquom all for what is being proposed but in the interest of fairness we need to go back to the public on this.However, some councillors have spoked out in opposition to introducing any anti-alcohol by-laws at all.In particular, Jedburgh and District councillor Scott Hamilton said the by-laws would contravene personal liberties, and tabled a motion calling for the proposals to be scrapped altogether.He told fellow councillors: ldquoBy agreeing to move these by-laws forward, we will be starting a process which barbarously pushes back our freedoms and personal liberties.ldquoIt is the freedom of choice which has underpinned the very ethos of le in the western world, and we this morning seek to change a liberty. Granted, it is a small liberty, but it must be treated with utmost care and consideration.ldquoWe need to have a real and considered debate before deciding on this.

It strengthens the case, very strongly, for extending the railway to Carlisle, so I am incredibly supportive, as yoursquod expect. I think this helps us grow the Borders on to success.ldquoThe stats sound almost academic and meaningless, but wersquore talking about a development here of hundreds of jobs.ldquoThat is a huge leap for the Borders, especially when these better, higher-paid jobs come in. It gives us a business space of a quality which we donrsquot currently have in the Borders, and it gives us control over a potentially fantastic housing site.ldquoThis is positive and a good news story.Council officers estimate that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, Tweeddale East councillor and opposition leader Stuart Bell claims the estate is valued at much less than the council paid for it.Mr Bell also revealed that Scottish Governmentrsquos district valuation service, a body offering impartial advice on how public money is spent, also told the council the property was not worth what it has paid for it.He told members: ldquoThe Lowood Estate acquisition, which we are undertaking by ourselves, remains a tortured tale.ldquoThe pound.m outlay, plus expenses, plus cost of maintaining the land and assets, plus the cost of borrowing, means wersquoll need to sell it all for over poundm just to break even. ldquoReports we have seen in private say there will also be signicant infrastructure costs to develop the site.ldquoI donrsquot believe this site is worth pound.m when you go into the detail of the terms and conditions of the sale, and that was the opinion of the district valuer, whose assessment with vacant possession, which we will not have, was much lower than pound.m.ldquoEven when adjusted up for a special assumption, the district valuer still valued the land at a price lower than we are paying.ldquoThis is a speculative and risky expenditure of public money at a time when, quite apart from Brexit, there is shuddering uncertainty in markets. ldquoHouse prices and land values can go down as well as up. We should not be spending public money on buying this estate at this time for more than it is worth.ldquoIn what alternative opportunities could we invest poundm ldquoThis council should invest enough in roads to signicantly improve the road condition index, but we cannot afford to do that.ldquoThis council should commit to four new high schools in  years, but you wonrsquot make that commitment.ldquoI will not tell the electors in Peebles, as you will have to, that they cannot have a new high school within  years when you have tied up poundm for  or so years in Tweedbank.ldquoWe canrsquot even cut the grass properly in our cemeteries, but this administration glibly spends poundm on buying a private estate.ldquoThis is a decision I fear you may come to regret.In reply, East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton defended the deal, claiming that pressures on local government spending made such projects necessary, saying: ldquoWersquove had several briefings on this subject, and officers have presented us with an excellent paper on the future benefits of developing this site, especially with the council in control.ldquoNow councillor Bell is scaremongering about service cuts, but this is a smokescreen to keep us away from the real issue at hand, which is the financial pressure being passed down to Scottish local authorities by his SNP colleagues.ldquoScottish local councils are currently expected to continue services while facing continuous cuts.ldquoIt will be very interesting to see what opposition councillors bring to the table for their budget proposals. No doubt there will be some vanity projects.The Tweedbank masterplan, going hand in hand with the Borders Railway blueprint programme, includes earmarking residential and business space on the estate, as well as expanding Tweedbank and rebranding the current industrial estate there as the Borders Innovation Park.The deal agreed with the estatersquos owner, Alexander Hamilton, is for the remaining  acres still in private hands to add to the  acres bought from then owner Constance Hamilton using compulsory powers by the former Roxburgh County Council in the early s to create Tweedbank.The land will now be owned by Lowood Tweedbank, a company set up and owned by the council."},{"url":null,"title":"royal-scots-history-is-on-parade-at-peebles-library","story":"AN historic link between Peebles and what was Britains oldest infantry regiment was further strengthened this week with a presentation at the towns library.The Royal Scots was raised by Royal Warrant in  and subsequently served with distinction for almost four centuries through many campaigns across the globe.The Regiment continued to recruit almost entirely from Edinburgh, the Lothians and Peeblesshire until its amalgamation just over a decade ago.During the First World War the Regiment expanded to  battalions in which over , men served.During the - conflict a total of , Royal Scots made the ultimate sacrice - many from the Borders, including  from Peebles,  from Innerleithen and  from Walkerburn.The Royal Scots served in most of the campaigns of the First World War, from the Western Front to Bulgaria.To mark the close connection with the area the Regiment was awarded the Freedom of Peebles in .As the centenary year of World War I ending draws to a close this month, a presentation was made on Tuesday by representatives of The Royal Scots Association at Peebles Library.Nick Edwardson and Alex Dockar presented a rare three-volume History of the Royal Scotsto head librarian Alison Tait.Mr Edwardson told us: \"The presentation of the volumes acknowledges the contribution made by the county of Peeblesshire to the story of Britainrsquos senior infantry regiment.\"The Regiment was amalgamated in  but its long history of proud service continues today as part of st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland.The Colours of the Regimentrsquos th Battalion which historically had a particular association with Peebles were laid up in the town in .And they are now displayed outside the entrance to the library in the Chambers Institute.The three-volume History of the Royal Scots will now be available for everyone to read in the library."},{"url":null,"title":"chance-for-parents-to-register-children-for-nursery-places","story":"PARENTS in the Borders are being invited to register their children for a place at nursery.Enrolment week takes place from Monday, January , to Friday, January .

attending the infant school before transferring to the primary school for P to P.However, both schools operated their own curriculums independent of each other.A recent inspection by Education Scotland found a gap in the literacy and numeracy performance of children coming into P.The new school will follow a single curriculum anda single headteacher will be appointed to oversee its management.The decision to push ahead with the plans came despite a public consultation which found only  per cent of those who took part were in favour of the proposal, with  per cent against it.And

This was brought home to me forcefully by the response to a book I reviewed in , Enlightenment Now by the Hard psychologist, Steven Pinker.Pinker is a long-haired, Jewish, liberal child of the s. Yet for claiming in his books that on almost every index of human progress - health and safety, longevity, ersity, poverty, war, crime ndash things are broadly-speaking getting better, he has been subjected to widespread criticism and even abuse. Pinker has been accused of being a sympathiser with the ldquoalt right by commentators and fellow academics.Yet, most of what he says is undeniably true, even commonplace.

Absolute poverty, meaning le below the World Bankrsquos level of  a day, may now be eliminated entirely by the end of the next decade.We think of this as an age of terrorism, with events like the Westminster kne and lorry attacks and last yearrsquos Manchester bombings. But while there were  terrorism deaths in Western Europe last year, there were nearly twice as many, , as recently as . The reduction is largely down to better policing and intelligence .The vast majority of terrorist deaths occur in the Middle East, though even here the number of fatalities has dropped by nearly  per cent in a year. The number of terrorist deaths globally last year, ,, is less than the number of Americans killed by drug overdoses, according to the University of Marylandrsquos terrorism research centre.UK road accidents have declined by two-thirds since the early s even though there are far more cars on the roads. Workplace and domestic accidents and other ldquoacts of god are down by similar amounts. lsquoElf lsquonrsquo safety may be a standing joke ndash but it has worked.This doesnrsquot, of course mean that people are not starving, being killed in wars or are experiencing health problems. Governments need to reduce road accidents even further, and perhaps self-driving vehicles will do precisely that.

Nor has the threat of nuclear war receded ndash indeed, Americarsquos abandonment of the INF intermediate nuclear weapons treaty in  has made the world a more dangerous place. But recognising that problems exist should not preclude recognition of actual progress. Some problems, like the depletion of the ozone layer or plastic pollution, can and will be resolved. Climate change can be tackled, but notwe wallow in catastrophism.Remarkable things are happening. Last month, Scotland produced  per cent of its electricity from renewables, mainly wind ndash something that would have been inconceivable  years ago. One of the largest energy companies, ScottishPower, has promised to end all fossil fuel generation. CO emissions last year in the UK were lower than in the s, even though population has more than doubled. Market analysts like Blackrock are forecasting big losses in oil and gas stocks as the world moves towards green energy. The worldrsquos biggest polluter, China, is emerging as a leading force in renewable energy.Remember Band Aid  The country that sparked the conscience of the world, Ethiopia, is now one of he fastest growing economies in the world at  per cent annually. There are signs that sub-Saharan Africa could be on the brink of the kind of development revolution that turned China into the second largest economy in the world in only  years.Some may fear that the belated development of Africa will only lead to more pollution and population pressure. But that neednrsquot be the case. We learned in  that the populations of half the countries in the world ndash the richest ones ndash are now declining quite rapidly, easing long-term pressure on the environment.Of course, we shouldnrsquot be complacent, but it is a perverse politics that wilfully ignores what has been achieved. That just leads to passivity and public apathy: nothing ever goes right the poor are always with us the system always wins. Itrsquos important to recognise that things can changewe want them to change further.Despite Brexit we live in tolerant times, vastly more civilised than even in the s, when racial discrimination was widespread and homosexuality was still illegal in Scotland. By winning elections and defending progressive policies like the NHS, the welfare state and public ownership, enlightened governments have immeasurably improved the lives of millions of ordinary people.So things arenrsquot as bad as they seem. Look around. In the UK, the freeze on wages has finally come to an end and pay is increasing more rapidly than at any time in the last  years. That doesnrsquot mean that capitalismrsquos debt problems have been solved. But for thousands of ordinary families, itrsquos a good note on which to end the year"},{"url":null,"title":"a-masterpiece-with-no-future-st-peters-seminary-looks-set-to-remain-a-ruin","story":"Months after ambitious plans to transform St Peters Seminary in Cardross into a cultural centre foundered, it looks likely to remain a forbidding modernist ruin for the foreseeable future.Architects have this week called for the A-listed building in the Kilmahew woodland of Dunbartonshire, an architectural masterpiece by Scottish architects Isi Metzstein and Andy MacMillan, to remain a ruin.For a decade the ground-breaking arts company NVA had appeared to have secured a new future for the lauded  building as an arts venue and, in long term plans, cultural centre.However, this year NVA, led by Angus Farquhar, has its long term funding from Creative Scotland cut in its controversial Regular Funding spending round, and the company closed this summer.St Peters, which appeared to have been saved from limbo, was seemingly cast back into perdition.Now the building, which has been a ruin longer than it was ever a seminary, is back in the hands of the Archdiocese of Glasgow, and this week a statement from the church offered no hope for the buildings long term future.It says: \"Over the decades we have tried everything to find a future for the former seminary.\"For a time it seemed the empty building had a future le: NVA staged the Hinterland project in the ruins in , and made a film with acclaimed artist Rachel Maclean, but its long term poundm project to transform the \"stabilised ruins\" into a cultural centre and performance space is over.Since , NVA spent pound.m on the building, and organised a series of works, including removing hazardous waste and asbestos, the restoration of  vaults, improving paths, clearing away Rhododendron plants as well as other woodland management in the  acre site.It is now unclear what will happen to these works, and whether any more will be done in the future.The building, an impressive and foreboding modernist ruin in the Kilmahew woodland of Dunbartonshire, is A-listed, and the World Monument Fund has it scheduled as one of the worlds most endangered cultural landmarks.Professor Alan Dunlop and Professor Johnny Rodger of the Glasgow School of Art said that its present form, as a ruin, is its most likely future.Professor Rodger, reader in urban literature at the GSA, said that the buildings original purpose as a secluded seminary for priests, had been rendered obsolete quite quickly by the Vatican  reforms in the Catholic Church from -.He added: \"It is a wonderful piece of structural virtuosity....but for the future, I have the idea of it as a ruin, maybe it is best left as a ruin, and a ruin to the hubris of modernism.\"It is not a place of pilgrimage, in reality is is quite inaccessible.\"Professor Rodger added: \"I remember going to Hinterland and speaking to someone there, saying I am not sure about this, its a lot of arts funding to spend in one place, its very isolated, just because of where it is.\"The irony is that it was built to train priests in isolation, and it will fail for that very reason.\"When NVA announced it was to close, Fiona Hyslop, the culture secretary, asked Historic Environment Scotland to study potential uses.The body has this week been tight lipped on its conclusions.However, the statement from the Archdiocese says: \"Over the decades we have tried everything to find a future for the former seminary.\"Its iconic status has, ironically, worked against it, as developers find it almost impossible to get the necessary permissions to bring the building back to le.\"We will continue to work with any group who want to look at providing some kind of future for the building. \"\"We have also spoken to the Scottish Government about our concerns and they have instructed Historic Environment Scotlandto carry out a review of the property with a view to securing the future of this architectural icon.\"A spokesperson for Historic Environment Scotland said: ldquoWe are working with the Scottish Government and the sitersquos owners to explore longer term options for St Peterrsquos seminary, which is a unique site of cultural signicance.Professor Alan Dunlop, a leading architect and academic, and a Fellow of the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland and the Royal Society of Arts, said: \"My own view is that the work of NVA should be consolidated, the site cleared and St. Peters left, as Isi Metzstein proposed, as a beautul ruin.\"Isi Metzstein said that he would enjoy the idea of St Peterrsquos Seminary being stripped of everything except the concrete and left as a ldquopurely romantic conception of the building as a beautul ruinHe added: \"Angus Farquhar of NVA, seemed to have the correct \" little by little\" approach, stating in  at a seminar in Glasgow organised by the Architects Journal that NVA would aim only to bring a small part of the seminary back to restoration: the chapel and the sanctuary adding that most of the rest of the space would simply be consolidated because of lack of funds and that the building was more interesting in its current state.\""},{"url":null,"title":"letters-only-a-second-eu-vote-can-save-our-parliamentary-sovereignty","story":"Parliamentary sovereignty must take precedence over our current Brexit-addled Government and, with the possibility of a General Election being remote, the only recourse democratically feasible is to hold a second referendum on EU membership.Jeremy Corbyns recent statement regarding his party winning a General Election in the new year and then re-negotiating a better Brexit deal than the present Governmentmust be filed under the heading \"deluded fantasy\" and is indicative of just how removed from reality his leadership of the Labour Party continues to be.It appears that doggedly pursuing the brainless and destructive path of Brexit is not simply the preserve of a zombie Prime Minister but also that of a zombie Leader of the Opposition.The Work and Pensions Secretary, Amber Rudd, who is increasingly looking like a future leader of her party, has embraced Realpolitik and admitted that a second referendum is \"plausible\". As Mr Settle points out in his analysis, only a second referendum has the chance of winning a majority in Parliament and is therefore the only path open to breaking the deadlock inflicted on us by Brexit.When Mrs Mays Brexit deal is finally defeated on January , even she will have to admit that, following a delay to the implementation of article , there can be no such thing as a managed no-deal and that a second referendum is the only solution that preserves parliamentary sovereignty.Owen Kelly, Dunvegan Drive, Stirling.IT is disappointing to observe that the arguments by those who are in favour or against Brexit appear to be mostly driven by dogma or for possible political advantage by the MPs involved in the ious factions at Westminster rather than for us all to take a more pragmatic view of what is best for the country as a whole ndash within the general remit set by those who voted Leave in the UK-wide EU referendum.There also appears to a shocking lack of understanding about what is possible to be negotiated with Fortress Europe both in terms of an orderly Withdrawal Agreementand a final negotiated trading arrangement.Labour, for example says it could miraculously renegotiate the WA and would somehow remain in a customs union based on its belief that it would curry favour with the EU by being subservient to the EUs demands whilst on the other hand the SNP says it wants to be in the single market and the customs union. Surely to even a casual observer the above means Brexit in name only and would constitute a bad deal as we would become \"rule takers\" and be severely restricted to make fewindeed any bilateral trade deals with countries outside the EU. But when Labour is driven by wanting the Tories out and the SNP wants independence at any cost we have a problem for a sensible debate especially in a \"hung\" parliament. Then to complicate matters we have the relatively small but influential single-issue European Research Groupwho advocate a hardline Brexit and do not support an orderly withdrawal from the EU or any payment of the pound billion agreed by Mrs. May.Ian Lakin,Pinelands, Murtle Den Road, Miltimber, Aberdeen.BREXIT is such a serious issue that will affect our lives for years ahead that there must be an option in the January Parliament vote to give MPs to go for a complete withdrawal from Brexit and a referendum next year. They must go above party politics and recognise that the people, especially Scottish and Irish people who voted against it in  and certainly are not for it this time, can be given their voice.Everything has changed now. We now know what Brexit really means. This is being completely ignored by the PM, who is essentially blackmailing MPs to go for her deal with all the long-term consequences it will have.Alexander Boyd, Ormonde Avenue, Netherlee, Glasgow.PHILIP Adamsrefers to Iain Macwhirterrsquos reference to what Mr Adams calls the \"spurious mantra\" of Scotland voting overwhelmingly to remain in the EU. Far from being \"spurious\" or a \"mantra\", itrsquos a simple statement of fact which has profound signicance for those of us who wish to continue to benefit from membership of the EU.Unfortunately, however, Scotland is presently a member of a state which, to all intents and purposes, treats it as a sometimes useful but mostly to be ignored junior partner. Is Mr. Adams content to remain in that vulnerable, subservient position or does he not at least concede that Scotland will never have a chance of determining its own future without hindrance as long as the Westminster Parliament remains in overall control The numbers speak for themselves. Those MPs representing Englands constituencies vastly outnumber Scotlands contingent. Understandably, the former have their own constituentsrsquo wishes to consider and cannot be expected to show interest in affairs north of the Border. It has also become obvious in recent decades that Scotlandrsquos voters show support for progressive politics, whereas Englands voters seem to be content with a more conservative path. This widening split has become a chasm.Scotland may have been \"democratically outvoted\" in Mr Adamsrsquos eyes, but that is only because the UKrsquos political system is heavily weighted against it.Dave Stewart, Blairatholl Avenue, Glasgow."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9218355.jpg?type=article-full","title":"advertising-feature-join-the-health-club-thats-not-just-for-january","story":"Thatrsquos where Glasgow Club can help you.

What the year has underlined is you are entitled to have one ndash so long as it agrees with the opinion of the reader.Poor me  Not a bit of it. The columnist, in making the point, is aware of using the lighter fluid of hyperbole to spark up the flames of debate. And sometimes the columnist uses the lighter fluid inadvisedly.That was most likely the case with the column about Zoe Ballrsquos pre-determined take-over of the Chris Evans Show on Radio . I argued that it was undemocratic that not a man in the land was considered for the job. The likes of my chum Elaine C. Smith argued back this didnrsquot matter. ldquoWersquove suffered from hundreds of years of patriarchy, so why shouldnrsquot women get their chance  Women In Journalism described me as a ldquomisogynistic dinosaur and Nicola Sturgeon said I was ldquooutdated and ldquoawful. Do I regret writing this piece  No. I still believe to deny men equal opportunity goes against the grain of democracy. I would still argue for as much training encouragement women need in order for them to compete in whichever work arena they choose to enter. Womenrsquos choices canrsquot ever be constrained. But men shouldnrsquot be excluded from the process.The comment however did make me ask whether I could ever support positive discrimination. The answer is lsquoYes.rsquo If two young people, for example, applied to Oxbridge, and both had the same qualications and one were working class and the other Eton-grown, Irsquod give the entry to the working class person. If the working class person were male and the other a female from Cheltenham Ladiesrsquo College again Irsquod choose on the basis of class.In a conversation last week with Jackie Bird and the issue of BBC positive discrimination strategy the news presenter said she believed in meritocracy. This was warming. This is coming from the daughter of a school janitor from Hamilton.As for the lighter fluid intro on the Zoe Ball column  Yes, Regrets on that one. ldquoTime to give Zoe Ball a little kicking wasnrsquot the best choice of metaphor. It set the tone for war.The column about race discrimination in theatre also caused a little conflict. I had found it hard to accept black actors being placed in historical white roles ndash because of anachronisms. Some actors of colour agreed with the comment. Some pointed out that grant money is often a spur to casting. But it all led to a fascinating discussion with actor Grant OrsquoRourke who argued ends-justied- means and theatre is about endless possibility, a non-prescriptive world in which a table can easily become a sailing ship. ldquoSo why canrsquot a s Hooray Henry be black  We couldnrsquot agree. But the  head will try to see past the colour of those playing our Stanley Kowalskis.The other column which saw social media go into meltdown came about after criticism of Gaelic funding. And the result was a meeting with Professor Wilson McLeod and we discussed Gaelic history, passions, and the social implications of keeping the language alive. Am I now studying Gaelic  Not at all. But I can recognise many of the reasons why the Gaelic voice is so passionate.But I know yoursquore looking for at least one act of contrition. Here it is. In the column Stressed: Stop Feeling Sorry for Yourself, I separated stress from depression. I argued they were dferent things. This was wrong. Wersquove so much more to cope with these days. We see the world so readily we canrsquot deny its confusions and disasters. We face a whole new range of problems, from the likes of technology, gender issues, paying the gas bill. My revised thinking  Depression is the next stop on the line after Stress.There are no regrets however about dissing Burns Suppers, Michelle Mone, Theresa Mayrsquos lack of empathy, Jeremy Corbynrsquos lack of cojones and Nicola Sturgeonrsquos obfuscations. And Madonna. There are no regrets about questioning rapper Kendrick Lamarrsquos being awarded this yearrsquos Pulitzer Prize for Music. I liked Darren McGarveyrsquos response to the column however in which he said in a video message running at : it was ldquoF****** s*** journalism and added ldquoThat you can have that idea that a hip hop artist canrsquot elevate a form to a high art is ludicrous. I didnrsquot say that, Darren. I said I didnrsquot see the merit in Lamarrsquos lyrics. Not the same thing, but more power to your larynx.I canrsquot say the same about my Auntie Ethel. After I wrote about MS losing the way and poorly-stitched underpants she rounded on me and pointed out the many merits of the store chain. As I head there right now to buy dinner I reckon she may have a point.So yoursquore right.

If you walk into any Scottish gt shops, yoursquore as likely to see Eilean Donan castle as tartan or shortbread.But for many years the castle did not look as it does now.  marks  years since the fateful battle which left the castle in ruins after destruction by the British during the Jacobite rising. years later work began on restoring Eilean Donan to its former glory by John MacRae-Gilstrap of Clan MacRae.Sitting between the three sea lochs of Loch Long, Loch Alsh, and Loch Duich, the caste has was used as a stronghold by Spanish invaders during the uprising in a bid to restore James Stuart, son of James IV of Scotland, to the throne.The castle was under heavy bombardment from British naval ships, for several days and eventually, after barrels of gunpowder were set alight, the Eilean Donan was demolished and would not be lived in for over  years.Dr Iain MacInnes is an expert in medieval Scotland from the University of the Highlands and Islands. He spoke about how the castle has had a long history of importance to Scotland:ldquoIt is perhaps its location that makes it ldquospecial, on the road to Skye, and regularly voted as one of Scotlandrsquos most picturesque castles. There is little doubting its ldquoromantic location and its general setting.ldquoThe fact that a castle appears to have existed in some form on this site from the very early middle ages suggests that it was situated at an important strategic location.ldquoIts access to the sea meant that it would likely have acted not just as a castle, but also as a harbour for ships connected to the ruling families in the area, from which they could project their sea power over the region.ldquoThis was an important part of lordship in this region, where travel by water was probably more important than travel by land. Its likely th-century origins also relate to providing defence in depth against Scandinavian raids and incursions in a period when Scoto-Norse relations were not good.Dr MacInnes also says that as with many of Scotlandrsquos Castles, Robert the Bruce may have paid a visit as part of his conquest of Scotland:ldquoClan history suggests that Robert the Bruce stayed at Eilean Donan in - on his flight westwards following his defeat at the battle of Methven, he said.ldquoThere is no corroborative evidence for this, however, and the temptation to be associated with the ldquowarrior king is quite a strong one in many clan histories, so this might well come under the heading of ldquomyth.ldquoAnd, as with many Scottish castles, there is the ghost of a mysterious lady also associated with it. Scottish folklore has a lot to answer for. There is even a suggestion of a Mathesonbeing able to speak to birds. Make of that what you will.ldquoIts lsquolast hurrahrsquo in the Jacobite uprising of  is a pretty spectacular way to go out!Between  and , work began on the rebuilding Eilean Donan by Lt. Col. John MacRae-Gilstrap. As well as a footbridge to connect the island to the mainland, it was built up again to stand just as it had done for hundreds of years before its destruction.Now, visitors from all over Scotland and the world come to visit it, take pictures and even marry there, cementing its status as a Scottish cultural icon for years to come.Clan Mackenzie, along with Clan Macrae have a special affinity with the castle, as it was the stronghold of the Clan for many years. A Committee member of the Clan Mackenzie Society spoke about the long history with the iconic fortress:ldquoIt seems reasonably clear that the Mackenzies then lost control of Eilean Donan at some point by the first half of the century, they said.ldquoThen, following a long exile on the part of the chief, Murdoch Dubh, he finally seems likely to have recovered the familyrsquos power base in Kintail in a purported Royal Charter of  - which was purported to have been further confirmed in  to his son in a grant from the Exchequer.ldquoBecause of the Mackenziersquos power-base in this region it was chosen as the landing place for the Jacobite invasion which was aided by Spanish troops but defeated in the Glen near the Castle by the English General Wightman.ldquoThe Mackenzie, chief, William Dubh , the th Earl and nd Jacobite Marquis off Seaforth, played a heroic role in this Rising before being wounded and carried across the mountainsto exile and safety.ldquoThe MacRaes also played an important role in the history of the Castle, since they are a local clan who were the traditional bodyguards of the Mackenzie chief and their own chiefs had been the hereditary constables of Eilean Donan and were consequently dubbed lsquoMackenziersquos Shirt-of-Mailrsquo."},{"url":null,"title":"the-iconic-the-heroic-and-the-unforgettable-those-we-lost-in-2018","story":"The music industry lost one of its greatest this year: the Queen of Soul Aretha Franklin.

That would be outrageous and, as the Committee has heard, fundamentally undermine efforts to target support where it is most needed.“Orkney has the highest proportion of households in fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty at present.

Incredibly, the pound target was smashed within days, hundreds of complete strangers inspired by his determination amongst the backers.Speaking to the Ross-shire Journal this week, he said: \"Since getting access to the best facilities and coaches, my performance has improved and Im getting personal bests.

That’s it over for another year.The presents are opened. The leftover vegetables are in the soup pot. The internet has been searched to find suggestions of what to do with all the ‘bits’ of roast turkey that are left. The children are less excitable than they were yesterday and have called a brief ceasefire. The shops are open again to get the batteries you forgot to buy. Today there is no pressure to provide a big meal so everyone can relax.Only  days to go ‘til we do it all again!Boxing Day is pretty much a British invention and in my humble opinion, it’s one that it is worth preserving. There are all sorts of theories about what exactly the ‘Boxing’ refers to, but I can say with absolute certainty that it has nothing to do with gloves and two people in a ring!Most people tie it in with gts given to tradesmen at Christmas which then merged into the staff in big houses being given boxes of goodies to take home to their family. Either way, Boxing Day is about looking outwards after a Christmas Day in which most people tend to focus inwards on their own families and loved ones. Boxing Day offers a balance to Christmas.A balance which is much needed not just in December but every day of the year.At a time when people are more aware than perhaps we have ever been, of what is happening down the street, across the town and in cities not only across our own nation, but across the world, we are in danger of knowing more but caring less.Partly that is because news reports tend to major on the bad and the sad things that are happening around the world to such an extent that we can find ourselves almost becoming desensitised to the heart-wrenching stories we hear because of the sheer volume of them.To respond to them all would mean literally, carrying the weight of the world on our shoulders – which is so hardnot impossible to do and maintain any degree of sanity. But to ignore all those dficult situations, plights and issues altogether and concern ourselves only with the things that directly affect us, is to cease to be human. At least, in my book!I suppose what I am saying is that we each need to pick, not our fights, but our causes. Having celebrated the blessings of having people to share Christmas with. Having had food to put on the table and a roof over our head. Having the wherewithal to buy others a present and receiving one or two, means we are very fortunate. You can be sure there are others in the immediate vicinity around us who have not been so lucky. All of us have neighbours who will not have been able to afford to eat a big, slap up Christmas meal: who cannot afford the electricity bill that Christmas lights would bump up. There are, on our streets, people who long for a dry place to sleep. There are children who will be going back to school who cannot say what Santa brought them because for them, there was no Santa. This is in st Century Scotland.In the world beyond, the needs are even greater with warring killing thousands and making so many more homeless and destitute. There are people of all ages, colours and creeds, picked on and used and abused in every corner of the world. There are regimes that are less than kind to the poorest and most vulnerable among their own people. Then there is the way we treat the world itself. I could go on, but I suspect your eye would wander from this column because it is all too much.And it is all too much.But we need to say and do something about at least some of these things since to stand by and do nothing, makes us complicit in the suffering others have to endure.I know it is not easy to care. I know it can be physically and mentally draining to bother about the needs and the issues that make le miserable for so many – but le is about helping each other. It is about carrying each other. It is about recognising that “there but for the grace of God…” Or to put it in a slightly more mercenary way, it’s realising thatthe boot was on the other foot we would want and expect others to come to our rescue.Boxing Day, when all the pressure is off, is a good time to sit down and think about what is important to you and to acknowledge that these same things are probably just as important to every other person on the planet.What is it you are most grateful for in le  Who is it that matters most to you  What is it that you cannot live without Please remember to give thanks for everyone and everything that adds to the richness of le’s experience. Please enjoy the good times and relish the memories you have as well as the people around you.But please too, look outwards and see what you can do to ensure that even just one other might find their le enriched in the way that yours has been.You can’t, I know, put such things in a box and hand it out. To do that though, would be even more precious than any other gt you could give.Be a blessing even as you are blessed.Rt Rev Susan Brown, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4848923.1545902345!/image/image.jpg","title":"holyrood bosses told to stop feeding the pigeons at parliament","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Holyrood chiefs have been told they must stop people feeding pigeons at the Scottish Parliamentthey are to deter the birds from making the building their home.The firm which regularly flies birds of prey from the site to scare the pigeons away claims they are succeeding in keeping numbers down.But they also reported seeing people feeding the pigeons and warned the parliament that such behaviour was undermining their efforts.But one MSP said it would bevirtually impossible to prevent members of the public from giving birds titbits and suggested the parliament learned to live with the pigeons.The Holyrood building has been plagued by pigeons since before it opened in . Its nooks and crannies proved a magnet for the birds, leading to a build-up of mess in certain areas.Deep recesses in the MSP block proved a particular problem. Muck and feathers were blown through vents onto researchers’ desks and some birds even got into MSPs’ offices.Various preventive measures, including netting, tripwires and spikes, were tried before the hawks and falcons were brought in a decade ago.Monthly reports from Trac, which flies the birds of prey, chart the fluctuation in pigeon numbers from visit to visit.For most of the past year they counted more pigeons at the start of their visits than the previous year, but the number always went down after the birds of prey were flown. The September report on the pigeons said: “The continued use of the current programme will ensure the parliament campus is not one of their preferred roosting sites however on September  people were seen feeding the pigeons on site which does not help the programme.”And in October the report noted “extremely low” temperatures compared with previous months. “This has meant that the pigeons are now starting to look for areas to shelter. The use of a iety of hawk and falcons has continued to disrupt and dissuade them from viewing the parliament campus as a preferred site.”But it added: “We must emphasise that all attempts to feed the pigeons in this current spell of cold weather be discouraged as the pigeons will depend on this source of food as the winter months begin.”  Lothian Tory MSP Miles Briggs was not convinced such behaviour could be prevented. He said: “We encourage people to come to the parliament and we know people eat their lunch in the landscaped area outside so it’s no wonder the pigeons do well out of the visitors.“I’m not sure how we could ever stop people feeding them.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.HGIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the # shock value # when it comes to expressing what art is or should be Personally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it # And the winner of the Turner Prize is#. #. lol“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is###. ”.Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is##.David Spence.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"viking seeks update to install larger turbines ","story":"Viking Energy is applying to the Scottish government to increase the size of the turbines it has planned for the major windfarm development.Viking is seeking a iation to the current planning consent for an increase in maximum tip height of up to  metres, from m to m with a corresponding increase in the turbine hub height from  to m.The organisation says the change is intended to ensure the -turbine wind farm keeps up with the latest turbine technology, which, it says, has #advanced considerably# since the project launched more than  years ago.In order to keep up with the latest turbine technology , I propose they hold back for at least another  years, by which time I for one will be past caring#Despite the representation showing such a small increase in the height of the turbines, they will be almost an extra  feet which will give them an overall height of  feet. Given these turbines will be placed on high ground, to suggest they will dominate the landscape is an understatement # just what the tourists come to Shetland to see.As long as they#re not in Bressay or Sandness.Only one and a half times the size of big ben# just little things# pfffffff.Absolutely ridiculous!I’ve seen wind turbines with these extra large blades between Stirling and Edinburgh. They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems.A point of interest regarding Japan andCO free energy . Japan is planning on using nuclear, not wind power, as a major source of electricity production. One may understand that Japan has greater first-hand knowledge of nuclear atomic contamination than any other country on Earth having being subjected two atomic bombs and the Fukushima accident. Using that real information on real nuclear contamination, not the Green lunacy crank disinformation, so prevalent in Scotland. Japan has a knowledge-led, intelligent energy policy. As ofMay , there are  operable reactors in Japan. Of these, nine reactors in  power plants Additionally, five reactors have been approved for a start, and further  have start applications under review. It never ceases to amaze me how ignorance and fear shape energy policy. Japan is fully aware of the risks of nuclear I reference “the Liberal Democratic Party cabinet in April , calls nuclear power #the country#s most important power source#.[Japan is now aiming for #a realistic and balanced energy structure#. The Japanese Government targets for wind power deployment are set at only .% of electricity production by  . That is a total figure, onshore and offshore.What a huge shame The Scottish Government is unwilling to do the same, it would save our countryside from so much uglly devastation. Why #..Well you don`t need a rocket scientist to figure that one out.Ifthis horrendous project does go ahead it`ll be past its sell by the time it is finished and will be made obsolete by newer, more efficient and cleaner technology.When is the plug going to be pulled on this nonsense before any more money is lost to it If Viking want to increase the turbine size, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the other windfarm developers will do the same.The floodgates are being opened and, instead of being a world-class destination for wildle  scenery, Shetland will become a world-class example of crass development without regard to the obvious damage to environment, health and wellbeing, not to mention income from tourism.Renewable energy should be pursued, but in Shetland’s case the cost of the VE project has already been far higher – in every sense – than the imagined benefits.I maybe wrong, but wind farm technology appears to be the cheapest form of producing electricityin regard to other alternative sources of producing electricity.I am pretty sure wave and tidal energy could also be tapped into within Shetland, but economics seem to be based on the cheapest alternative compared to wave or tidal resources being the better, possibly, and signicantly less intrusive than the massive wind turbines scaring the Shetland landscape and more than likely tourists remembering the islands not for its beauty but#.well, it is self explanatory.The potential economic damage caused by the wind turbines I am pretty sure would outweigh any positive contribution the islands may have in regard to tourism or other positive attributes the islands may have.Time, no doubt, will be the final answer#.. watch this space, as they say.David. Just to be a bit more optimistic about wind farms , there is every likelihood that visitors to Shetland will already be familiar with rotating blades .It is a fast growing energy generation procedure so would not come as a shock.The other thing is ,such equipment would almost certainly not be visible from all corners of Shetland.People would get used to them just as they are used to the island hopping planes.It’s a bit unfortunate that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions.I take onboard your points, Haydn, but I think what is putting people off the VEP, is the shear cost of what it could possibly be. I have heard a figure not far short of kicking on the door of £. Billion, and possibly more, and how many decades would this take to bring VEP into the black in terms of revenue One should also look into the potential running and maintenance costs per year for such a project  Would the revenue created be enough to off-set such costs or would VE require more funding from the SCT, to balance its books It seems very evident, the more information people in Shetland know about VEP, the more people are put off the whole idea in terms of economics and what little benefit the islands may reap from it  I have heard a figure of around £ million a year###.poor investmentthe projected costs are to be believed. Aof around. of % does not bode well.I have to take issue with you here Haydn, The proposed VE turbines will now be meres high and constructed on hills. The high point some meters plus above sea level. That would be the line of sight from sea level of about  miles. Precious little of Shetland would not see the VE turbines!! I note you claim #that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions#. I would respectfully point out wind turbines are hardly a new idea! Many consider them at the point of being an obsolete technologyNow for cutting-edge ideas, look to tidal generation and modular nuclear reactors. The latter , I believe you are openly condemning, something about us all glowing in the dark was your comment!!! Now that was Scaremongering nonsense. Rosatom,Russias vehicle for nuclear expansion,has about % of new nuclear plant contracts in the bag,mainly in emerging and third world countries .If Chernobyl is anything to go by and what Russia the culprit did in rectyingthe mess,novichok is going to be a piddle in the ocean in comparison.Read an article this morning.Wish I could remember which paper that said Germany#s  year old wind turbines are coming to the end of their usefulness and no longer qualy for subsidies. No recycling as the blades are made from fibre glass.Their plan is to dump them on third world nations so creating more waste rather than cleaning the mess up themselves. Viking energy should sit up and take not it but will have cloth ears when it comes to profit. Remember, as you sow,so shall ye reap.Germany, by nature of its fragmented political system with government by weak coalitions only resulted in the Green Partyexercising much influence beyond their electoral mandate. Nuclear power was cut back as a political gesture to the Greens, that had nothing to do with the science of the matter. The result was a massive increase in coal-fired electrical generation and also the importation of Natural Gas. Germany is now the worlds largest importer of Natural Gas! and the German motor industries disingenuous diesel emission data is almost legendary!!!.Deaths from atmospheric pollution in Germany are massive and this year the EU is taking Germany to court for breaking all EU guidelines. It is indeed very ironic that the Scotish Government does so much to praise the use of Wind power and exploit all its rural communities to that end while it does all in its ability to expandGas Exportation from the North Sea,. It likewise imports Gasto Grangemouth and at all times try and use North Sea oil revenue to promote Nationalist agendas. The logic escapes me, perhaps you could explain Grahm,!!!Billy , I understand where you are coming from when stating that  year old turbines in Germany are coming to the end of their lives , but is this surprising   Since technological advances in vast areas of activity are so rapid it would be most unlikely for things to suddenly stand still.Try selling a  year old car , TV. washing machine ,vacuum cleaner , racing bike etc etc. Virtually worthless . Fighter ‘planes cost £millions EACH so should we have stuck with the Tiger Moth to save money   Times change continuously.No doubt some would like the world to stop to enable them to get off so that they could abandon their mortgage and live in a cave in a cosy corner of the Moon. All very whimsical but I’m sure you get the drt.Interesting comment Haydn. I am unable to find any substantive advance in Wind Turbines as technology over the last  years. They are larger yes, but no less polluting and even more damaging to the environment. The most recent research would indicate that disturbance in airflow patterns and friction around the rotating blades not only creates more noise pollution but results in substantive heat creation. That heat creation in itself would and does contribute to global warming new research has shown. Reference #Hard University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences# would indicate wind power in theU.S. with wind alone would warm the planet a quarter-degree Celsius! If this research is proved correct, we will be decommissioning and scrapping wind turbines far sooner than the protagonist advocate. There are already far better ways of generating clean electricity than  meter high turbines, sadly too many have staked their reputations on the wind myth and will resist accepting they have been wrongFair enough Ian. I must confess that I was unaware of the likely height of the proposed turbine blades.I’m not so sure about Japan and others having a reducing intention to set up more turbines though. As for the comment I made about nuclear radiation causing people to glow in the dark —— you surely cannot be serious !!!!That was no more than a figure of speech.I hope you are merely poking fun at such a prospect.I know that glow worms emit light as do other creatures in the sea but it’s silly to think that the effects on iniduals who have been subjected to radiation for medical reasons would then walk about looking like Beacons.Give me a break Ian!Ian.—- Your comments on October th at -.Plenty of food for thought in your missive .Thanks.It is a balance between providing energy safely and economically, but our conventional methods of using fossil fuels has brought to the fore due to the impact such energy has had on the environment.However, whilst we are being side-tracked about the impact of fossil fuels, nobody has every mentioned the impact on the planet caused by agriculture. Agriculture, I believe, causes  times more green house gases than all of transportation put together Not only does agriculture produce more green houses gases than transportation, it is the greatest cause of environmental destruction than any other industry. As our population grows, this will become more evident, as we see species upon species being put on the # endangered species list # or # become extinct #. This man-made catastrophe will impact on other species and it will eventually impact the very existence of humans on the planet as nature takes revenge through disease, drought and other natural impacts.Progress in providing alternative energy may be a positive start, but at what price will this be to the planet and le,this progress is purely based on the man-made concept of monetary value and this of profit David Spence, the single most signicant threats to humanity are overpopulation and our leaders, scientic, religious and political leader#s, utter cowardice to dare to mention such an undeniable fact. World population is set to double in  years. Energy needs, food supply, pollution are all driven by human population density. It makes no odds how many windmills we build whatever their size! Atmospheric pollution, global warming or starvation awaits and will kill all our children#s children as long as human overbreeding continues. It is hard to take the Greens cranks, politicians and doom-mongers of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change seriously when their reports fail to state, or take into account the blindingly obvious.David. Your warning shots make me feel that I should grabfew bottles of whisky 🥃 go back to bed and snooze my way through the day even though there’s a hot Indian summer outside.!!Seriously , weare facing a dire situation which will impact on my grandsons far more than on me —— or you. When you say ‘Agriculture’ I’m assuming that you are including livestock.The greenhouse gas emissions from the planet’s animal le must be enormous and that’s whether or not they are raised for their meat .Also, to take your point, such vast amounts of money are tied into food production , it’s hard to seeany measures at all, however well intentioned, , will enable us to eradicate the decline of le in its widest sense.Time to grab that whisky bottle I think 🤔. Cheers.Is there going to be a remake of #Dad#s Army#  Only, a number of contributors seem to be vying for the part of Private Fraser: #Wur do-oO-MM-ED!# LOL 🙂# You stupid Boy, Pike##.sorry, John # lolI take your points Haydn and Ian, but according to predicted human population expansion, it is estimated the global population will be around  billion by the year  Other dynamics affecting population growth, as you know, is requiring more land not only for agriculture but for accommodation and expanded space for for other amenities related.Not doubt, I think, there may come a critical point where demand for the expansion of the population, not including technological advancement, will determine how we live and finding a balance between our own demands to this of the natural world and other le The driving force for this expansion is predominantly based on economics and technological advances, and as long as this is the precedent, this could bring into conflict what we want and what nature will will allow In the food chain, I suspect we will become more use to # processed food # as technological progress will find better ways of growing alternative foods, whether biologically or chemically, as an answer to keep a balance between our demands and this of a coexisting relationship with the natural laws which govern le itself, including humans.You are quite right John, there are people who seem to be dominating these columns and I fear that I am a guilty one —— as well as the others.Perhaps I should take a break and ease off.The trouble is, there are interesting and important problems out there which should be aired rather than be allowed to fester.Maybe a bit more humour would help to make the rough stuff a little more palatable.So, step forward anyone of a Dad’s Army disposition !! How about you John  Sadly my sense of humour is a little lacking here! £ million plus SCT funds gone.  meter high windmills on s of tons of concrete bases all over Shetland. All of this for what  The delusional idea that such a project will save the planet. VE is and always has been a money making project under the guise of the #Green Idyle#. The advocates being the usual shetland suspects, utterly unqualied in scientic justication and reason, highly qualied in political posturing and self-interest. No, there is nothing here of humour. I do believe we are rapidly destroying our planet bitthe findings of# The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change# are valid, windmills on Shetland are an irrelevancy, which will only increase our problems. Their construction will release vast quantities of CO their verywill warm the air around them. It goes a bit beyond Dad,s Army humour, about as funny as Donald Trump#s program of clean coal, Scotland importing fracked gas from the USA and Shetland shipping in wood for burning by deforesting Canada and Eastern Europe!!! It is long past a laughing matter. It is just Green idiocy at its most typical.Ian,I assume you mean “s of tonnes of concrete” per turbine base  Given that a single, typical .MW turbine needs over a thousand tonnes of steel-reinforced concrete , then VE turbines, whose blades will sweep  times the area , at . times the height, must surely need bases several times bigger than that # perhaps, - tonnes, each The accompanying destruction of the land these machines are sited on is also alarming # here is a quote from the link, again, for the small, .MW machine: Given the limited cerebral ability of most politicians this obviously did not prove too dficult LOL!Humour is a coping mechanism.If you can laugh 😆 in the face of adversity you become bullet proof. Only the brave and stoical can achieve that. Dwelling on negatives perpetuates negativity. Goodness knows, there are ample supplies of that in these columns.£ million plus SCT funds have not “gone” Ian. Money does not simply disappear. Whatever the total sum, a decent chunk will of course have found its way into the pay packet pockets of some of those with most to gain from the project. However, so long as the cash gets into the hands of the worthist members of the local community, deserving entrepreneurs intent on bettering their community, who could possibly disagree  Try to be more charitable Ian.If there was anything whfy about all this Tavish Scott would have long since ensured it was properly addressed. Just look how fearlessly he locked horns with the powerful vested interests south who were forever conspiring to keep Shetland in its box. Tavish has already clearly stated he is in favour of democratic reform of SCT, just notit requires him to stand up against anyone local.You`re right there Peter, the money hasn`t just gone it`s been squandered!Squandered or plundered John  Aren’t the controls on the access to Shetland’s charitable funds so weak that any dedicated self serving group with a plausible plan could arrange over time to help themselves  Viking by name#We’ve got to get away from the notion that the funds exist to secure Shetland’s economic future. They exist to ameliorate social disruption resulting from the oil era. Vast infrastructure projects in remote rural communities bring almost random redistributions in wealth and opportunity, drug dependency and a iety of other associated complex social issues and harms. Where is Shetland’s voluntary sector represented on SCT  It ain’t, and it runs scared of complaining.These unguarded funds have weakened and distracted local politics in Shetland. No one group is sufficiently powerful to say enough is enough. Where is the voice of those at the margins  Who speaks up for those in greatest need  The oil industry has washed it’s hands long since. The ongoing tolerance of this is pathetic.I note with entirely no surprise the MOD is now objecting to Viking Energy turbines due to their inherent jamming and degradation of air defence radars and electronic warfare aircraft and missile trackers recently installed at Saxa. Surely the writing must now be on the wall for this turgid project. Is it not well overdue that the SIC and SCT cut their losses and abandon this expensive nonsense  Perhaps the dark cloud of Russian and Putin#s recent belligerence has a silver lining for Shetland  How very ironic..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October.

Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

What we haven’t heard is what exactly it will mean for Shetland.”But clarity remained out of reach over the next two and a half hours with a pivotal vote in the House of Commons scheduled for Tuesday.Presenting a view from Westminster Mr Carmichael said: “Every time you think we’ve got to peak madness in the House of Commons something  happens.”He added that Tuesday will likely to be on “another level” and said that he hesitates to “predict anything beyond the next hour at the moment”.Miss Budge said that farmers were particularly worried about the future of subsidy payments in the aftermath of leaving the EU.“The big concern is where the Scottish government or UK government will find that kind of money to put into farming.”The tourism industry was most concerned about maintaining visa free travel for citizens of the EU, said Mr Mathieson, while Mrs Hambleton said that businesses had to scenario plan in order to offset any potential negative side effects from Britain’s departure. which had highlighted government analysis which warned of potential delays of up to six months for pharmaceuticals.“Project fear is now project reality”, he said.Unsurprisingly, the biggest optimism came from Mr Collins, who viewed Brexit as an opportunity for fishermen. He noted that British fishermen caught less than half of fish in UK waters, compared with Norway catching around  per cent in theirs.He later criticised the EU as undemocratic but said he was a committed European and that he and his partner had four EU passports between them. His ideal scenario would involve dismantling the EU and for the project to be rebuilt with more accountability and less bureaucracy.Indeed the EU came in for criticism throughout the night. Mr Carmichael said that his view was not “massively dferent” from that of Mr Collins. But where the fishermen’s chief was keen to depart Mr Carmichael favoured remaining and reforming.A straw poll at the close of proceedings found an overwhelming support for this view. One person favoured Theresa May’s deal, two opted for leaving with no deal and  said their preference was to stay in the bloc.Isn#t the whole idea of Brexit, to do with the Conservatives wanting a trade deal with the USA, without the interference of the EU This will also, I think, be the beginning of the mass privatization of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to USA companies, where the Conservatives will benefit from such a deal  .The impact on Shetland, I fear, will be very damaging indeed, as economic circumstances will mean a vast reduction of Local Authority spending. This will also force the SIC to do huge cuts in budgets and very much streamline and prioritize what money goes where.This will force many other companies and people owning their own business to either reduce the workforce or shut up shop The general outlook does not look favourable for Shetland in the long term.I sincerely hope my outlook is proven wrong  finally Mr Carmichael should know that the only reform of the eu that they will be doing is ever closer integration. Starting with what his former leader called a DANGEROUS FANTASY dreamed up by brexiteers, an EU ARMY. Well that DANGEROUS FANTASY has been seen to be a DANGEROUS REALITY since the referendum with EU armoured personel carriers on the streets of Paris battling french protestors.Is this DANGEROUS REALITY stuff for real Someone may have been listening to Trump and Farage#s comments on the EU army without turning on their b.s. filter.Why shouldn#t EU nations cooperate in defence matters  Is Ali saying NATO is a bad thing Since  it has become politically correct for democratic European neighbours to cooperate. Why not get over it What is this DANGEROUS REALITY Ali fears  Does he imagine the purpose of a EU army would be to attack domestic protesters across frontiers like the Soviet army did in Hungary in   Does he see the EU as a fascist entity that must be stopped  Before you know it he will be advocating the citizen#s right to bear arms so as to protect itself against the government like they do in the good old US of A. Just how whacky is his DANGEROUS REALTY No one gets to choose their nationality Ali, just how we feel about it. There is nothing natural or God-given in being Scottish, British, German or European. Why not celebrate what we have in common and not obsess about invented dferences resulting from random man made lines on a map  Scary scary stuff. and only a line on a map drawn by a king that separates Scotland and England. A separation you are keen to expand upon. I have to say you do seem confusedSo your British now,not a Shetlander, # accepting the majority wanting to be part of the E.U, So much for Wir Shetlandits Wir Westminster then!Give us a vote and I will vote with my head and my heart for Shetland to be clear of da lot a dem, EU, UK and Scotland all running massive deficits. We wid certainly be much better aff.Fake news strikes again then I guess#Which is this culture that demands you submit without question Ali   Sounds like it owes more to Henry Tudor than Kant and Rousseau. And what culture is it you are being asked to accept that separates us and is abhorrent to you   Eurovision   Persian   Mesophilic Perhaps you can expand on what your gripe actually is Ali,it isn’t pulling sovereignty with folk little dferent from ourselves.FYI should Brexiteers triumph I’d still rather separate Scotland from England and stay European as I don’t much want to be led by English nationalist bigots. No confusion there.As I said only a fool submits without question, and remaining in the eu is submitting without question.Go read the Lisbon treatyyou think it isn#t.I am intrigued as to what other opinions there is on Brexit, and whether or not this has a political agenda to suit the purpose for a particular party to benefit Is Brexit for the greater good of the few, but at the cost to the many Would Shetland be better off under Brexit   There does not appear to be a definite picture being drawn where people can make a concise and definitive choice. Even the politics which has caused this mess, seem to be at odds with each other  How do they expect the people of the countryto choose   The more you look into Brexit, the more I am convinced we would be better off on our own Maybe we should re-establish our links back to Denmark     Propaganda rules okPutting the culture issue Ali ducks aside I don’t get why pulling sovereignty when it is helpful is a problem, be that in the EU or even when accepting WTO rules which, guess what, weren’t written singlehandedly by her majesty’s government. Lisbon moved us to majority rule in a partnership of friendly nations. So what Perhaps the problem to following mutually beneficial accept-some-trade-off rules set by the collective group is where you fear your culture dfers, so again I am wondering what part of European culture Ali fears and   or rejects. Eating snails asideI’ve always felt the UK is an appreciated part of mainstream European culture. There is a joint love of family, films, bevvy and football, eating out a bitpossible, a law abiding appreciation of the need for democracy, free speech, free press etc. Fondness of folktales and music, poetry, song, literature, dance and even opera unite people across national boundaries. Again, what is Ali’s problem Leaving the EU will be bad for jobs, farming and the NHS and we don’t know what the deals will bring to fishing or trade. Vive la dference and long live the similarities. I think your own bigotry is shinning through Peter, You talk about pooling sovereignty on one hand while labeling the English bigots. You say one thing while meaning another will you be standing for office soon A few thoughts, not for the first time have we, in Britain, find ourselves alone with Europe united against us and the will of our people. Not for the first time in our history has our position looked bleak with hard times being promised to come. We are being bullied by a cabal of bureaucratic nonentities answerable to no one who would try and isolate and distance us from our Commonwealth friends. Our Sovereignty and independence being undermined and the will of our people being ignored and denigrated. Contrary to some misinformed views, I and many like me, welcome selective immigration from Europe but not at the expense of our Commonwealth friends, whatever their colour and Creed. I welcome open Borders in Ireland just as they were long before the EU ever existed.We have stood alone before and always overcome adversity however grave. IfJunker and the cabal running the EU will not negotiate and remain intransigent, sneering and neo-bellicose It is time to stand tall and give them the two-finger salute, not just the Churchilian one.Heavens Ian, I wis imagining a violin accompaniment.We cant feed our bairns sovereignty Ian, even the Bank of England agrees that we are going to be worse off.A self-made economic disaster.Let them eat cake.Really Ian, “bullied”   Surely Theresa May said her deal was a “good deal”.There is such a thing as reading too manyeditorials. Last one I read saw Ian’s “bureaucratic nonentities” blasted for removing the right of the honest Brit to buy a lawnmower so loud it could deafen you. How very dare the EU protect UK consumers Does Ian imagine Claude Junker doesn’t speak for the elected leaders of the remaining EU nation states, but that rather they march to his tune  Lamentable.The remain member states are naturally protecting the interests of their citizens, including those of the Republic of Ireland, who are in the worlds largest trading block, which is conveniently on our doorstep.The Commonwealth ties however are lose, with distant nations who urged Britain to Remain. The EU block will secure better trade deals with those nations faster by dint of size and relevance.British diplomacy has never succeeded by cutting off our nose to spite our face.Perhaps we should learn from the Nordic foreign minister who quipped last week that there are two types of countries in Europe: small ones and small ones that don’t realise they are small.Has the question really been answered as to why the Tories, gave us this referendum to leave the EU in the first place,it was not going to be in their favour, despite the fact much of our business is with the EU What hidden agenda do the Tories have that they are not telling us###..until it is too late Have we all become xenophobic and argumentive about the pro#s and con#s of the EU, and the need to # fly the flag # as a weak demonstration of nationalityor Britishness, said very, very loosely   It seems very much we are playing right into the hands of the Tories, and singing their song to their beat.What has brought this on other than a narrow vision and not looking at the bigger picture    Brexit only means one thing, and this one thing is for the Tories to benefit for themselves no matter how you look at it.I would prefer to be as part of the EU, instead of being outside it, looking in.It is as simple as that.Of come off it Ali! I have never once labelled all English people as being bigots, nor would I. English nationalist bigots are bigots by definition of being bigots. It’s a bit like a numpty being a numptythat helps.Great attempt at ersion Ali, but just what, or should it be which, is your “abhorrent” cultural problem exactly  It can’t be this hard to specy the culture s you abhore surely, be they mainland, Scottish, UK mainland, continental or from further afield No man is an island Ali, unless perhaps you moved a little northwards and changed your name to Forvik, but you might need to borrow a little cash from somewhere at that stage to build a hospital lest you ever get poorly. Heaven knows who would staff it though, when you are happy to say some cultures are abhorrent to you but won’t specy which.Last I checked you can’t train as a doctor at Shetland College, the NAFC or in a night class in Hamnavoe or Walls, so I guess we will be needing other folk from other parts and other cultures for some time to come. Maybe try to get over it Mr. Shetland-wid-be-much-better-aff-clear-of-da-lot-of-dem, EU-UK-and-Scotland.I do not know exactly what it is Peter, but your first paragraph reminds me of ##.. Is not worth noticing. lolHo ho ho! Glad you are laughing David 🙂I’m with you on the real agenda behind Brexit not being immediately obvious btw.I think the big picture is that there are some rich and powerful people in the UK wanting to shackle the UK to USA workers rights and health care in order to benefit from lower taxes after Brexit.They don’t need the EU to guarantee their human rights. They have holidays aplenty and investments in so many places that using the NHS is as alien to them as using public transport.They have uncharitably driven their agenda to the fore against the better instincts of one nation Tories and have done so using decades of media manipulation and dispicable xenophobic dog whistle messages on immigration.Thankfully as I write the Shaddow Home Secretary is advocating for an “efficient, fair and non-discriminatory migration policy” that is conducive to the UK’s economic interests. Something to wish for in the New Year.I take your points, Peter. It will be interesting how the Tories will drive their immigration policies and whether or not it bends more towards the USA than to this of the EU, after March next year One of the largest industries which depend on EU workers is in the hospitality industry, even here in Shetland there is a large EU workforce, not only in the hospitality industry, but the fishing processing industry as well.It will be interesting how the Shetland economy will cope after March .As for human rights, I question the validity of as to what will be used and what will be discarded in terms of either British or European Human Rights. I fear workers rights may be diminished and favoured more towards the employer than the employee     We shall see If the UK becomes # the cheap workforce of Europe # this may stir up resentment within the working ethos or political change##.before it is too late    We are in unchartered waters, and there could be stormy sea#s ahead.

However, on turning , she was required to move home and the family worked with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar#s social work department to put in place suitable arrangements.It took two years to find a solution and in May this year, Eilidh moved back to Stornoway, where she was housed in supervised accommodation with a young male who also suffers from autism.Four complaints by the family over that accommodation provision were upheld by the Care Commission and, following an incident, the male was removed from the house to another unit. However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure. She is also on a daily course of benzodiazepine # despite never previously requiring any medication. Catherine Ann MacLeod, Eilidh#s aunt, said there had been a #mishandling# of her situation from the moment she was required to come back to the island.#Eilidh is not psychotic,# said Ms MacLeod. #What she was displaying was traits of autism. The male was removed from the house all of a sudden and Eilidh is not able to process sudden changes without careful handling. That#s why she became more aggressive she#s not able to express herself properly. It would never have happened had a proper care plan been in place.#Whatever happens now, they#ve broken Eilidh # she#ll not be the same now. It#s broken my sister, too. I want the whole thing investigated by the proper authorities so this does not happen to another family.#Miss MacLeod, who said the case was #a clear abuse of Eilidh#s human rights#, was not interested in any apology from the council. The case has been raised with local MSP Alasdair Allan.He said: #I have met with Eilidh and her family. I am very concerned that they need to be reassured that there is accommodation for Eilidh long-term on the island, where she can be near her family.#There is no doubt that the family have had reason to be anxious about this question and I hope that we will now see dferent agencies working together in the islands to find a solution. I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints.

Firstly, in a bid to reduce ‘fast fashion’ a fancy-dress option will be available to participants with the focus on homemade outfits. And in a bid to encourage participation and make the event less competitive, prizes on the day will be only awarded to the best-dressed participants. These include chocolates, Isle of Skye Whisky and sides of salmon donated by the Scottish Salmon Company.A route for participants who have impaired mobility will also be incorporated into this year’s race. This follows on from a link-up between the event organisers and Amanda Bell from the West Highland College, who runs a fitness group for restricted mobility participants. This includes parents with pushchairs, children who cannot manage the whole route and entrants who have mobility limitations.Event organisers have said that the sections that are alternatives to the main route, will not be marshalled, so caution will need to be exercised when crossing roads.All proceeds from the participants taking part in the main route will go towards the Rotary Club of the Isle of Skye, while proceeds from the alternative route entrants will go towards the West Highland College restricted mobility fitness course.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland.

We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8746825.1545316039!/image/image.jpg","title":"duffin replacement selected by sdlp","story":"The SDLP has co-opted Ryan Wilson onto Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council.Mr Wilson will take up the vacant seat in the Dunsilly DEA.It had been vacant since former SDLP representative, Brian Duffin, resigned from the local authority after losing an appeal against a sexual assault conviction.Mr Wilson said: “I am delighted to have been co-opted to serve the people of Randalstown, Toome, Creggan and Parkgate, in what is an increasingly challenging time in politics. “Alongside my colleagues in council, I intend to make rural job creation a focus during my tenure, as well as lobbying for more social housing to be built in South Antrim. “Additionally, I will work to secure adequate funding for many excellent community, charitable and sporting organisations throughout the constituency.”Welcoming Mr Wilson to the role, party leader Colum Eastwood MLA said: “Ryan has proven to be a dedicated activist within the party and his local community.

Evidence of the Males trip produced by the BBC show, included an image from the resort’s internal records which suggested that full board and transfers were provided complimentarily at the request of the Males government and facilitated by the resort owner, Hussain Hilmy, who himself is a former government minister.On whether the trip should have been declared, an expert on Parliamentary rules, Mr Gavin Millar QC, said it should have.He told the Spotlight programme: “If, as Spotlights documentary evidence suggests, the benefit was requested by the government and facilitated by Mr Hilmy,Mr Paisley should not have accepted it.“But having accepted it, he certainly should have registered it undoubtedly.“There are very strict rules about lobbying and creating an interest for yourself that may be perceived as lobbying. “The moment you know these facts, that are disclosed in this document, the perception is that this is a reward for him having advocated for the Males government.”DecorumIan Paisley claimed however that he did seek advice over whether to declare his trip.He said he spoke to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone during her investigation into his previous Sri Lanka holidays, which his failure to declare resulted in his recent suspension from the House of Commons for  sitting days.He told the Spotlight programme that after the conversation he had satisfied himself he did not need to register the holiday.However, when pressed further, the MP claried that he had not spoken to the commissioner as he had claimed, but in fact had spoken to the parliamentary registrar who administers the register of members interests. contacted the Parliamentary Commissioner and the Parliamentary Registrar for a comment, however both refused to comment on private discussions with an inidual MP. They instead directed the ’s attention to the rules on the registration of Members’ financial interests.These rules clearly state under the heading of ‘Selflessness’ that: “Holders of public office should take decisions solely in terms of the public interest. “They should not do so in order to gain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their family, or their friends.”Under the heading of ‘Integrity’ it states: “Holders of public office should not place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside iniduals or organisations that might influence them in the performance of their official duties.”DenialMr.. Paisley last week denied that the trip was connected with the government of the Males, but rather that the cost was covered partly by himself and partly by a friend, who he has not named.He also told Spotlight he had evidence which, he said, categorically disproves that the trip was connected to the government. He said the holiday had not been arranged by the Embassy or paid for by the government of the Males.Deacutejagrave vuMr. Paisley has just recently finished his  day suspension, the longest given to an MP, for failing to declare complimentary family holidays to Sri Lanka.  He told the House of Commons in July that he felt: “A deep personal embarrassment” over failing to declare his Sri Lankan trips and made the “profoundest of apologies. A jubilant Ian Paisley told thein the immediate aftermath of the shortfall in the ‘petition of recall’ that ‘a smaller man than me would have crumbled’ under the pressure he had faced. And he told the BBC that after avoiding a by-election by  votes, it was the public’s way of saying: “We are keeping you big fella, we like you” and that it was “a miracle.”He was also adamant that there were no other potentially embarassing issues which could impinge his role. He said: “No. Nothing at all. I mean that was a genuine mistake on my part, I made a mistake and I apologised for it and I was punished for it.The matter will now be referred back to the Parliamentary Standards Commission, where the allegations will be further scrutinised.

Last winter’s figures for NI will be released on Wednesday.The comments from Age NI come three weeks after the Department of Healthannounced a ‘review of urgent and emergency care’ with a particular focus on the elderly in light of emergency departments experiencing “intensying pressures over recent years”. DoH acknowledged growing waiting times for hospital admissions and that “another dficult winter period” is anticipated.Age NI welcomed the review – but expressed concern about the timing. “It is good news but it seems late in the day to start this processwe want to see any benefits this winter,” a spokeswoman said. ldquoit seems late in the day ,,, this process should have started months agoAge NI“We all know that our healthcare system, particularly our hospitals, come under extreme pressure during these winter months and this process should have started months ago.” She noted the “added impact” a long wait in AE can have on the elderly and pressed for “safe and effective” alternatives that will be “just as beneficial or more so than an admission to hospital”.Rita Devlin, deputy director of the RCN in NI, said nurses are worried. “Our members are fearful that there will be a repeat of the problems experienced last year in emergency departments over the holiday period,” she said. “Staff would hope that trusts will have contingency plans in place to ensure that services will be maintained at normal levels.”Dr Grainne Doran, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners NI, said GPs have “serious concerns about the increase in workload that will come this winter”. She added: “With services already struggling, doctors have voiced their concern about being able to manage with the additional workload during the winter season. “A review of emergency and urgent care, and the implementation of necessary changes, cannot come quickly enough.” of Donaghys, Banbridge presents a cheque for the money raised at the recent Ladies Night held in aid of Ellens Journey.

While each trust will have a winter contingency plan, he said, staff face “additional workload and work-related stress” during the winter period which may see “the whole system begin to wobble”.Properly funded home care packages for discharged patients are needed, he said, along with “meaningful long-term workforce planning” to have enough doctors in place to meet the needs.Last winter saw Antrim Area Hospital call in St John Ambulance volunteers for basic ward cover on New Year’s Eve, while SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly said  people waited at Craigavon Area Hospital over two nights for assessment on January  and .In the first week of January, staff reported that Belfast’s Royal Victoria Hospital was “at breaking point” and a ‘major incident’ was declared because of the excessive backlog of patients.Londonderry’s Altnagelvin Hospital had to implement an emergency plan for its emergency department, and on Boxing Day the Southern Health Trust said patients were having to wait for up to  hours to speak to an out-of-hours GP.From December  to January  last year, some  NI patients waited more than  hours for admission, transfer or discharge, the BBC reported.However, the Department of Health said that its newly launched review of emergency care is not intended to address problems this winter.A spokeswoman said: “The review of urgent and emergency care is a long-term project and should not be conflated with initiatives to counter winter pressures in hospitals this year.”The review will aim to establish a new regional care model for the Province, with particular focus on the elderly, she said. “A range of measures have been put in place by trusts for this winter in expectation of another challenging period for health services across these islands.”The department has funded these initiatives, recognising the need for immediate mitigations and longer term review, she added.Age NI advises that by taking some simple steps, older people can stay warm, well and safe in the winter months-. By setting your heating to the right temperature , you can keep your home warm and your bills as low as possible.. Food is a vital source of energy, which helps to keep your body warm. Keep basic food items in the cupboard or freezer, and try to have hot meals and drinks throughout the day.. Try to avoid going outside on extremely cold days. If you do need to, wrap up warm and remember that several thin layers will keep you warmer than one thick layer.. Keeping active generates heat and helps to keep you warm, so when you’re indoors, try not to sit still for more than an hour. Get up and walk around, make yourself a warm drink, and spread any chores throughout the day.. If you’re over , be sure to have a seasonal flu jab. Seasonal flu viruses are always changing, so you need to have a jab every year, using the latest vaccine.. It’s not unusual to feel a bit down in winter. Try to keep to your usual routines and,you can’t visit friends, make sure you phone them regularly for a chat.. Call Age NI’s Advice Service on    for a free benefits check.

In a move that’s sure to be viewed with envy by congregations all over the city, Clonard has upholstered its wooden seats just in time for the festive season. On Friday night the church welcomed guests to its sold-out Candlelight Christmas at Clonard event, which featured the St Dominic’s Grammar School for Girls’ Choir, baritone Karl McGuckin and West End star Niamh Perry. Clonard church manager Tom Brady said even at this early stage it’s clear the cushioned seats are a welcome addition at the church. “This is a way of providing comfort for the congregation, it’s a way of giving back to them and as a way of thanking them for all their support and generosity shown to the church,” he said. “Both our concert and carol service over the weekend were packed to capacity and with our annual Féile concerts people can rest assured that the seats will be cushioned for years to come. Clonard attracts people from all over and we are really looking forward to welcoming everyone who comes for their Christmas Masses. We have three vigils on Christmas Eve, one at pm, pm and .pm. “We would also like to thank all those who donated so generously to our Christmas crib during the carol service and hampers are now being prepared and distributed by the St Vincent de Paul Society.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"local schoolboy pulls toddler from pond","story":"A YOUNG boy from the Cltonville area has been hailed a “hero” after pulling a toddler from the Waterworks lower pond.-year-old Neil Francis Montgomery from Brookhill Avenue was walking through the park with his friends on Sunday when a toddler slipped into the duck pond.While other passers by looked on in shock, the Edmund Rice College boy leapt into action, jumping into the freezing water to pull the child out. Speaking to the North Belfast News, Neil Francis said: “Me and my friends were walking out of the playground and this baby walked down towards the pond. We saw a woman pointing towards the baby and he slipped into the water face first. “All the other people started panicking and they all ran over and people were screaming. I got on my stomach and tried to reach in to get him, but I couldn’t reach so I just jumped in lted him under the armpits and lted him out.“A woman took the baby and cleaned him and dried him. I was scared, but nobody  seemed to be doing anything so I just jumped in. I was worried that it might be a bit deep, but I was more worried about the baby. I’m just really happy that the baby wasn’t hurt.”Neil Francis has been recognised as hero at his school assembly, and was gted a superman t-shirt by his religion teacher Mr Wylie. Paul Berne, acting Principal at Edmund Rice College, said: “We’re delighted that these kids are able to do what they’re doing. It’s the second time our pupils have saved someone’s le in a month. We’re very, very proud of them. They are top class role models for the school. About a month ago a sixth year helped someone in a hit-and-run and now we have this.It’s great that young people that age are able to do that – it’s incredible. Some people would freeze in these situations. These kids are top class. It’s a very tough thing and a very brave and courageous thing for any child to do.”Neil Francis’ mum, Natalie, added: “We’re so proud of him. We were scared that he did it, but we’re very happy that he did.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"pressure mounts for new school building for st josephs college","story":"EDUCATIONALISTS and local community leaders have called for a new school building for St Joseph’s College.Housed in the former St Monica’s Secondary School on the Ravenhill Road, local representatives believe stellar progress at the school is being hampered by its crumbling premises.The school, which opened in , is proud of its all-ability, Catholic ethos and its erse student body, but many believe it is time the school got the st century facilities it deserves to keep up with its growing pupil numbers.Speaking after addressing the school’s annual prize-givin, Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey called on education chiefs to fast-track a long-promised rebuild for St Joseph’s.“St Joseph#s’ exemplary inclusive approach is a source of pride for all in Belfast who value excellence in education,” she said. #Under the leadership of principal Michele McCormick, the school is going from strength to strength but the commitment of governors, staff and indeed pupils is not matched by the resources it commands.#Physical education amenities at the school have come in for fierce criticism from parents who say the tarmacadam car park in front of the school which doubles as a play area is an indictment of the existing facilities. And the contrast with the spanking new facilities of its Catholic grammar school neighbour, Aquinas College, has raised questions about the priorities of education chiefs.Principal Michele McCormick says the school’s results, particularly in Maths and English, are the best in Belfast in the non-selective sector. In , the school also won the Aisling Award for ‘Oustanding Achievement in Education’. “St Joseph’s has a warm, welcoming ethos and they pride themselves on the care and compassion the staff have for pupils and their determination and passion to achieve the best possible success for every child,” added the Lord Mayor.#St Joseph’s College is delivering a first-class, st century education to our young people. It’s time, therefore, that it was given the st century resources it needs to fully realise its mission.”A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “The Department does not maintain a prioritised list of schools in need of a new school build. When a major capital announcement is being planned, the education managing authorities are asked to providea list of schools that they consider most in need of a new build at that time. “Due to the many demands on the Department’s capital budget, when a call for proposals is made, all projects submitted by the Managing Authority are assessed under the Department’s protocol “Any school not announced must be selected through the formal ‘call for projects’ processit is to become eligible for a new build. Given the medium term budget uncertainty and the absence of a Minister, there are currently no plans for a further major capital investment announcement.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37660616.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/cattle_prod_seized.jpg","title":"cow prod used on pedestrians in northern ireland town from passing vehicle","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

No easy feat for young prospective first-time buyers.“A few years ago in England I was looking at housing options - and obviously there are housing issues there and here,” he said.“My original motivation was the show likeAmazing Spaces, and lots of YouTube videos about alternative living spaces.”After doing some research, the former Abbey Grammar school student quickly ruled out ious options such as shipping containers and quickly settled on what he felt was a more practical choice.“A bus can move, it can be sited anywhere,” stressed Jack, who works for pharmaceutical company Norbrook Technologies.Choice made, he located his double decker outside Liverpool and impressed by the -year-old Leyland model, he stumped up £, to purchase the bus in May .“The bus was still in full operation in  in Kent.“Although its basically a -year-old vehicle - Leyland was bought over by Volvo and the engines are like tank engines,” he explained.Jack McGrath and his glamping project of a Leyland double decker bus.Picture by Freddie ParkinsonShipping it over to Warrenpoint via Heysham port in Lancashire, its now temporarily sited in the Mayobridge area where Jack has since spent his spare time on the laborious process of stripping back the interior - which is around .m wide - to its shell - not the easiest of tasks.“They made these buses hard to rip apart. Probably the hardest process stripping the inside,”  reveals Jack. “I took out seats, the ling. Then I started putting in wood frames, .“I got an electrician in, wires were put through the bus and then sockets. Most of the wood work done by myself.”It now boasts accommodation such as a double bed, a single bed on the upper ‘deck’, while the downstairs there is a dining area, which also can be converted into a second double bed.Heat is provided by a wood burner and a kitchen space comes complete with an oven and fridge.Bathroom facilities include a toilet and sink. A shower is external to the bus, but is self-contained ensuring privacy.Jack McGrath and his glamping project of a Leyland double decker bus.Mandatory Credit - Picture by Freddie Parkinson ©When the conversion is fully completed, Jack estimates that he will have spent £k - money he saved up for since his uni days. From looking at similar converted buses that have sold on the property market, Jack believes it’s worth £k - virtually double his initial investment.To get the project to its final destination, however, he needs to find a permanent base for the bus for a business venture.Originally he thought that once completed, the bus would be his first home, but now he believes it could be the start of a great business venture by renting it out to holiday-makers looking for a luxury caravaning experience.“I’m looking for to site it on another person’s land and rent it out to glampers,” explains Jack, who added thathe found a land owner who agreed to house the bus, they would be financially compensated.Although pleased with his progress, Jack - who lives with his parents Jim and Liz - insists that it will be only when he can fully install all the necessary plumbing and electrics that he can consider the project finished.“I am proud of it, but I won’t be until its finished. And one day I’ll maybe think about making it my home,” he added."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37660589.ece/7cbe5/AUTOCROP/w620h342/Police_drink_driving_.jpg","title":"pictured drink driving blamed after car ends on roof on derry roundabout","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Impossible First ✅.  hours and  minutes after leaving my last camp early Christmas morning, I covered the remaining ~ miles in one continuous “Antarctica Ultramarathon” push to the finish line. The wooden post in the background of this picture marks the edge of the Ross Ice Shelf, where Antarctica’s land mass ends and the sea ice begins. As I pulled my sled over this invisible line, I accomplished my goal: to become the first person in history to traverse the continent of Antarctica coast to coast solo, unsupported and unaided. While the last  hours were some of the most challenging hours of my le, they have quite honestly been some of the best moments I have ever experienced. I was locked in a deep flow state the entire time, equally focused on the end goal, while allowing my mind to recount the profound lessons of this journey. I’m delirious writing this as I haven’t slept yet. There is so much to process and integrate and there will be many more posts to acknowledge the incredible group of people who supported this project. But for now, I want to simply recognize my # who I, of course, called immediately upon finishing. I burst into tears making this call. I was never alone out there. @jennabesaw you walked every step with me and guided me with your courage and strength. WE DID IT!!

I woke up this morning about  miles away from the finish line. As I was boiling water for my morning oatmeal, a seemingly impossible question popped into my head. I wonder, would be possible to do one straight continuous push all the way to the end  By the time I was lacing up my boots the impossible plan had become a solidied goal. I’m going to go for it. I can feel it in my body that I am in the zone and want to harness that. It’s a rare and precious feeling to find the flow. I’m going to push on and try to finish all  miles to the end in one go. Currently, I am  hours and  miles into the push. I’m taking a pit stop now to melt more water before I continue on. I’m listening to my body and taking care of the details to keep myself safe. I called home and talked to my mom, sister and we - I promised them I will stop when I need to. Only  more miles to make The Impossible First POSSIBLE. A very merry Christmas to all. Stay tuned... #TheImpossibleFirst #BePossible A post shared by  Colin OBradyon Dec ,  at :pm PSTMr Worsley’s friend and fellow English adventurer Louis Rudd is currently attempting an unaided solo in Worsley’s honour and was competing against Mr O’Brady to be the first to do it.Ms Besaw said Mr O’Brady planned to stay on Antarctica until Mr Rudd finishes his trek, hopefully in the next few days.“It’s a small club,” she joked. “His intention is to wait for Louis and have kind of a celebratory moment with the only other person on the planet to have accomplished this same thing.”Mr O’Brady described in detail the ups and downs along the way since he began the trek on November . He had to haul  kilograms of gear largely uphill and over sastrugi – wave-like ridges created by wind.“Not only am I pulling my … sled all day, but I’m pulling it up and over thousands of these sastrugi speed bumps created by the violent wind,” he wrote in an Instagram post on November .“It’s a frustrating process at times to say the least.”On November , he wrote that he awoke to find his sled completely buried from an all-night blasting of wind and snow. That day he battled a mph headwind for eight hours as he trudged along.“There were several times I considered stopping, putting my tent back up and calling it a day,” he wrote., px px  rgba margin: px max-width:px min-width:px padding: width:.% width:-webkit-calc width:calc\"      \" fill\"#\"  View this post on Instagram translateY\"translateX translateY width: .px flex-grow:  margin-right: px margin-left: px\"translateY\" translateY rotate\" \" \"translateX\"  Day : STRUNG OUT BUT STILL MOVING. I can’t believe I been out here all alone for  days. Even having lived it, I can’t quite wrap my mind around it. This wind storm still has not subsided so I spent another day getting beat down. Fingers crossed I catch a break on the weather soon. I’ve been writing a lot about the mental game as it’s clearly the most crucial part of this challenge . However today I want to honor my body and health. I wholeheartedly believe that nothing in le is more important that being healthy. Without that it’s hard to do or do fully. I’m so fortunate to have parents that instilled that in me from a young age, teaching me the importance of healthy eating and exercise. My dad is an organic farmer so I guess you could say it’s in my blood.

I’ve laughed and danced, cried tears of joy and been awestruck with love and inspiration.”Though Mr O’Brady had initially thought he would want a cheeseburger at the end of his nearly impossible journey, his we said he had been fantasising about fresh fish and salad because he had mostly been eating freeze-dried foods.As for what is next for Mr O’Brady, who also has climbed Mount Everest, Ms Besaw said she was not entirely sure.“We are just so in the moment celebrating this right now,” she said. “Then we’ll see what’s next on the horizon.”"},{"url":null,"title":"wall street stocks surge with dow jones setting oneday record","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

little Derry twins have delivered an early Christmas present for the nurses who helped to save their lives.Saorlaith and Saoirse McLaughlin spent the first few weeks of their lives at Altnagelvin Hospital’s Neo Natal Intensive Care Unit .The girls were born six weeks prematurely and suffering from a potentially fatal complication called \"Twin to Twin Transfusion Syndrome,\" where one baby gets the majority of the blood flow and nutrients from the placenta.Their parents, Bob and Michelle, have since raised a staggering £, for the unit, with the help of their friends and work colleagues.This year alone, they raised over £, through a tattoo fun day and a sponsored walk.But the McLaughlin’s decided that as well as vital equipment for the ward they wanted some of the money to be spent on the nurses, who work so tirelessly for the tiny babies in their care.“This year we wanted to put a bit of focus on the nurses and let them know we appreciate everything they do for sick new borns in Derry and beyond and especially our own twin girls,” explained Bob.“We asked the nurses to give us a list of stuff they needed for their tea room and of course we added a few extras and we are also going to buy them a new three seater sofa.“We felt it was very important that the nurses should have everything they need to make decent food.“It’s not a lot but it will make a dference to them.”“We want them to know that people are thinking of them and appreciate what they do.“The NHS canteen is closed when they are on night sht and at the minute I think all they have is a kettle and a

when the parents go home at night we are leaving our babies in their care.”The couple gave the nurses a voucher for a fridge freezer, cups, plates, cutlery, glasses a George Foreman grill, a set of knives, a radio and a £ MS voucher.And next month, they will present a cheque for the remaining £, to be spent on frontline services at the unit.“It was fantastic to catch up with some of the lovely nurses who did so much for our girls Cathy McClafferty Bridgeen Devine and Ciara Doherty and they passed on their thanks for the generosity of the public“We’d like to give a big thank you to everyone who made this possible including Michael Kelly who held a fundraiser at the Tattoo Lounge in Rathmor Business Park in the twins’ honour.”The tattoo fun day and last weekend’s sponsored walk have raised over £,, which will be donated to the unit next month.Mr McLaughlin says his employers and colleagues at First Source have played a huge part in helping them raise the £, over the past three years.“The management have been so supportive,” he continued.“They pick their own charity every year, but they also help a lot of smaller charities and a lot of it goes under the radar because they don’t advertise it.“When I brought my sponsorship form for the walk into work I raised £, in just five hours.“That’s how generous people in First Source are, there were people donating £ and

The bumper pre-match lunch crowd were less than keen to brave the elements, but a few hardy souls cheered the team on.Johnny McPhillips was released by Ulster late on Friday night and he started the match with Ryan Wilson ping to the bench. Ulster flyer Iwan Hughes also made his debut on the wing and Peter Nelson continued at full back.Kyle McCall ed at loose head, but his brother Zac was ruled out with Clayton Milligan taking his place at hooker. Malone looked strong with Ross Kane, Joe Dunleavey, Peter Cooper, Adam McBurney and Matthew Dalton all released by Ulster to bolster their forward pack.The wind was blowing across the pitch and this did not really favour either side. However, it did make things even more dficult as the rain was relentless and conditions underfoot were fairly treacherous.No one expected a classic and Ballynahinch had a little more composure in the key moments to secure a vital win. Local knowledge certainly helped with Nelson providing a masterclass in tactical kicking throughout, using his big left boot to keep his forwards on the front foot and dig his team out of trouble.Two McPhillips penalties and a typical Ross Adair finish following a Kyle McCall break had Ballynahinch - up at the break and they were well worth their lead.Malone turned the screw in the second half and when they scored a penalty try following a collapsed scrum under the lsquoHinch posts to close the gap to - with around  minutes the game could have slipped away from the home side, especially as McCall was sin-binned at the same time.However, the  man defence held out, and with the outstanding John Donnan laying waste to the Malone line out, the locals held out in relative comfort for another tight derby win.The next AIL fixture is away at Malone for the next instalment of the double-header on January .Ballynahinch will hope to have some players back from injury as the season reaches a crucial stage.The Ulster derbies look likely to decide the shape of the table and lsquoHinch will be away from home for three out of four in the second half of the season.Brian McLaughlin and his coaching staff will be plotting over the break to gain any advantage in the race for promotion.Ballynahinch Malone AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£250k Lottery Funding boost to restore Castlewellan park  ","story":"MAJOR plans to restore Castlewellan Forest Park to its former glory as part of a signicant investment programme have received a major pre-Christmas boost.The Heritage Lottery Fund confirmed yesterday that it is to provide almost pound, to help with ambitious redevelopment proposals which are being spearheaded by Newry, Mourne and Down Council in conjunction with the Forest Service.Fund officials had made it clear that the application process was very competitive, with council officials delighted they had made a persuasive argument to secure the cash they require.The local authority is also in the process of making a separate pound, bid to the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to assist with the work at the forest park. The closing date for applications is the end of next month.Since the s, the forest park was the demesne of the Annesley family, a long line of passionate gardeners who created a beautul landscape and a nationally and internationally important  hectare arboretum.The pound, Heritage Lottery Fundgrant will be used to help fund the development phase of the project, which will work to achieve a vision for Castlewellan Historic Demesne to create a heritage-led destination to connect people with their built and natural heritage.The development phase includes surveys of the woody plants in the arboretum and bioersity of the park, alongside design work to repair and develop the buildings in The Grange and walled garden. Work is also required to carry out further consultations and submit planning applications.Council chairman Mark Murnin, thanked the HLF for its financial support for the exciting project.ldquoThe park is such a vital part of the local community, he said. I am delighted that this funding gives us the potential for its restoration and that future generations will also be able to enjoy the facility and engage with its heritage, he added.The local authority is keen to see the picturesque forest parkrsquos Arboretum, Annesley Garden and Grange Buildings redeveloped to help increase the number of visitors and provide the area with an economic boost.A recent economic appraisal recommended the development of what is being described as a welcome centre in the Walled Garden area designed to provide access via lt to its upper floor, with the local council keen to play a leading role, alongside the Forest Service, to help transform the parkrsquos fortunes and make it even more popular.Politicians were told last week that architects have been awarded the tender for works in the Walled Garden and Bothy Yard and Rhododendron Wood areas, with work underway on planning and statutory approvals for works in the Walled Garden and Bothy Yard.It has also been confirmed that a topographical survey mdash which could cost as much as pound, mdashwill be required to assist with the planning process.Council officials say that while they recognise the parkrsquos undoubted heritage signicance, parts of it require investment to preserve and help promote an area which has ldquoexceptional tourism and recreational potential.It is envisaged that initial restoration work will focus on the -acre walled garden which is at the centre of the critically acclaimed arboretum, Bothy Yard and pathways which wind their way through the Rhododendron Wood.A critical look has also been taken of the parkrsquos traffic management and parking facilities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£700k environment scheme set to begin  ","story":"WORK on a near pound, environmental improvement scheme at Irish Street in Downpatrick starts on January .The Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council are jointly funding the initiative which will result in one traffic lane being closed during the scheme to facilitate the contractor.The government department is making a pound, contribution to the public realm project, with the local authority providing the remainder of the cash for the eagerly-awaited revamp.Design proposals have revealed the work mdash which includes new granite footpaths, lighting and street furniture mdash is due to be completed before the end of the financial year.The government department said funding for the streetscape scheme will build on the ldquosignicant public realm investment already made by the government department in Downpatrick over recent years.Local council officials are delighted to be working in partnership with the Department for Communities to deliver the project and are looking forward to the benefits that it will bring to Irish Street in terms of regenerating a central part of the town which has missed out on major public sector investment for several decades.Damian Mulholland mdash director of regional development with the Department for Communities mdash said recently that funding for the streetscape scheme will build on the ldquosignicant public realm investment already made by the government department in Downpatrick over recent years.He said the latest investment for Irish Street will enhance the natural heritage of the area at this historic part of the town and help improve visitors and resident experience.Councillor Dermot Curran says he is pleased work will start early in the New Year and has appealed to motorists to be patient during the lane closure.ldquoI realise this will inevitably have an impact on traffic, but hope roads officials will alter the sequencing of town centre traffic lights in a bid to minimise this, he continued. ldquoI hope the lane closure will be in place for the shortest time possible and will be liaising with contractors throughout the duration of the scheme.Cllr Curran said the scheme will help regenerate Irish Street, providing a boost for traders and residents and help arrest decline in an area where the presence of the townrsquos former police base was a major impediment to investment.He continued: ldquoBusiness owners in particular will be delighted that work is due to start soon. As I have said previously, Irish Street is ripe for redevelopment opportunities and this major investment is long overdue.Cllr Curran is also hopeful that Newry, Mourne and Down Council will make a fresh bid for Heritage Lottery Funding to help restore historic buildings within Downpatrickrsquos conservation area, which includes Irish Street.Several weeks ago it was confirmed that the local authorityrsquos initial bid for a so-called townscape initiative had been rejected, despite a signicant amount of time, effort and money being invested in the application process.Officials in charge of the heritage fund claimed the local authorityrsquos bid was influenced by planned regeneration opportunities within the wider conservation area ldquorather than heritage need.In addition, they argued there was limited scope within Downpatrickrsquos townscape initiative area to deliver a ldquocomprehensive scheme and believed that given development proposals for Irish Street and the townrsquos former police base, the local authorityrsquos proposed scheme was ldquoinfluenced by regeneration opportunities within the wider conservation area.Cllr Curran says he hopes a fresh application will meet with success to assist further the social and economic regeneration of not only Irish Street, but the wider town centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch fete Schmidt  ","story":"IRELAND coach Joe Schmidt was the guest of honour at Ballymacarn Park on Friday when  members and guests enjoyed an excellent lunch followed by a question and answer session, conducted by club chairman Philip Gregg.He was his usual humble self as he described his coaching philosophy and the journey he has been on over the past  years and it was a wonderful afternoon for all in attendance.Despite his tight time schedule, Joe took the time to mingle with those present and was a complete gentleman throughout.

Council enforcement officers will also investigate each incident and assessthe culprits can be identied and prosecuted.On Monday night, councillors were told that over the past eight months there have been almost  reported fly tipping incidents across the district.Council staff responded to  incidents, with contractors removing waste on  occasions. Environment Agency staff removed waste on  occasions.While the cost of removing waste over the past eight months is estimated at almost pound,, council officials have suggested the yearly total could top the pound, mark.The cost of flytipping on hard pressed ratepayers comes just a few weeks after council officials were asked to look at innovative ways of combating the problem.Councillors are concerned about the scale of the issue and the restrictions being placed on what material ratepayers can dump at household recycling centres.Some elected representatives have suggested council officials should reintroduce a service used by the former Down Council which arranged for a local authority bin lorry to visit some towns and villages on a Saturday morning to allow people to get rid of their household waste.The scheme proved extremely popular and while it was in service there were few reported flytipping incidents in the area.In addition, community groups helped keep their respective towns and villages clean by taking part in litter picks, with their efforts recognised by the local authority via an awards scheme.Councillors also believe the fact that some of the districtrsquos household recycling centres do not accept certain types of waste is contributing to the scale of the flytipping issue which, they say, must be addressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C December 19%2C 1978  ","story":"NEWCASTLE mdash Fears that Newcastlersquos status as a leboat base could be thrown on the rocks were sunk yesterday by the Royal National Leboat Institutionrsquos chief spokesman in Ireland, Lt-Col Brian Clark.In a clear-cut statement he dashed the hopes of  Kilkeel fishermen who have called for a full-scale rescue centre to be set up in their port instead of Newcastle.Lt-Col Clark, who is the RNLIrsquos organising secretary for all of Ireland, has also hit out strongly at claims that the prospect of a tug-orsquo-war situation is looming between Newcastle and Kilkeel.He said: ldquoKilkeel has indeed been considered carefully as a possible location for a leboat, but the major requirement is that a boat must be able to get away from its base promptly in all kinds of weather.ldquoThe RNLI management committee feels that this capability is at present lacking in the case of Kilkeel where strong winds create unfavourable conditions at the entrance to the new harbour. These conditions could prevent a leboat from ing to its moorings and may prevent it from getting out of the harbour on service.Lord Roden, the honorary secretary of the Newcastle leboat station, has also rejected the latest call to switch the leboat base from his town to Kilkeel.ldquoI can give an assurance that Newcastle is taking no part in such an argument, he said. ldquoThe stationing of boats on the coast is solely a matter for the RNLI management committee.ldquoThe Newcastle leboatmen are proud of their boat.

Teddy wouldnrsquot worry sheep. He was far more interested in carrying my sonrsquos bag home from school and things like that.

In  he sailed from Bangor to travel across Europe for  years, founding communities and monasteries.The cities and regions across Europe where his memory live on are joining forces to create a cultural walking route of which Newry, Mourne and Down Council wants to be a part of.The St Patrickrsquos Way route mdash which links key sites associated with the saint across the district mdash could form part of the proposed new cultural route linked to Columbanus.The proposed feasibility study will examine the merits of getting involved in the ambitious project, with support from the other three local authorities.Members of the local councilrsquos Economic, Regeneration and Tourism Committee were told on Monday night that the feasibility study will also look at the marketing opportunities the new cultural walking route presents and, signicantly, the level of investment required to ensure the walking route can attract international visitors to Down and other parts of the province.Councillors were told the study will examine the amount of money required to finance what has been described as a ldquohigh quality visitor experience and what services and facilities walkers would require which are not currently available.News of the feasibility study comes just a week after Newry, Mourne and Down Council gave its support for a new campaign aimed at restoring the former Ulster Way walking route to link Killyleagh with Strangford via Downpatrick.Local politicians say they recognise the importance of this particular project and its potential for increasing the number of tourists to the area, with the proposal described as a ldquosimple, affordable and detailed plan to restore linkages lost in the s and s.Politicians agreed that council officials start work on the project to help restore the Ulster Way which would reconnect Killyleagh, Delamont Country Park, Downpatrick, Castle Ward and Strangford.They say a huge investment will not be required to restore a series of off-road paths, with the route requiring the provision of several sections of boardwalk to reconnect existing paths over boggy ground.Cllr Cadogan Enright said restoring local sections of the former Ulster Way could reconnect what he described as the ldquojewels in the crown of East Down.Moving forward, he said Newry, Mourne and Down Council needed to prioritise the required work as part of a cross departmental plan ldquoto have any hope of success within a reasonable timescale..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Yuletide festivities  ","story":"ITrsquoS going to be a busy festive season for Ballynahinch sports fans.Not only are Ballynahinch Olympic involved in two major football finals inside  hours, but the townrsquos hockey club are also through to a Yuletide showpiece decider.The Olympic seconds team face Celtic Bhoys in the Bobby Dalzell Cup final at Drumaness on Boxing Day.Twenty four hours later the Olympic firsts take on Crumlin Star in the Border Cup final at Seaview.The Ballynahinch club will be hoping to emulate Drumaness Mills who won both finals in .Athletics is catered for with the Castlewellan Parkrun taking place this Saturday before Newcastle ACrsquos highly popular Christmas Cracker race in Castlewellan on Saturday, December .Just for good measure, Downrsquos senior Gaelic footballers open their McKenna Cup campaign away to Cavan on Sunday, December , and Tollymore Unitedrsquos youth teams are involved in two Lisburn Youth League cup finals.Both games will be played at the Lisburn Leisure Centre pitches and it is sure to be a great day of football for everyone involved with the club.

It was speculated that the company could occupy a smaller site and the balance could be sold or redeveloped for other uses. “The HW site, most of which sits on land leased from Belfast Harbour, is the largest industrial piece of ground in the greater Belfast area. Whether or not a future owner of HW requires so much land or not, it is important that this land bank is maintained for industrial use so that future generations can have the opportunity to work for companies based in this area.“What I have always feared is thatHW was either sold or closed, there would be a ‘plunder’ of the ground by property developers for more apartments or other such quick turnaround uses, leaving no legacy for the city in the future and preventing any meaningful industrial uses and the jobs that could go with it.”Lord Empey said housing and heavy industry “don’t mix,” and added: “This is an example of another matter that should be receiving attention from a restored Executive and Assembly, and we must not allow the prospect of a short-term, one-off profit to blind us to the long-term consequences of re-designating this land for non-industrial uses.”Get on board ... for a holiday on a double decker bus Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingEx-UDA bomber tells teens: Donrsquot do as I didRangers: Steven Gerrard frustration at draw before Celtic testChristmas Eve fire death man lsquothe soul of our streetrsquoGet on board ... for a holiday on a double decker busRevealed: Top  fastest speeding drivers in Northern Ireland          ..

I was frustrated by housing prices. “The idea of living in a converted double decker bus was essentially a housing solution.The inside of the bus before the start of the conversion“I got it off a businessman from just outside Liverpool who was selling them. He brought the bus to Heysham and got it ferried over to Warrenpoint. “From there it was driven to where it is now.”Jack’s plans to live in the bus changed shortly after he began work on the vehicle.He said: “I’ll be close to the limit of my budget by the end of this first phase so at the moment it seems more feasible to rent it out.”The inside of the bus after the conversionJack said the target market would be glampers – a term coined for people who like camping-style trips in more luxurious surrounds than a tent.He commented: “You would make more from renting it out to holiday makers rather than renting it as an actual dwelling. “The requirements for accommodation that is lived in  days of the year are very dferent to somewhere that is rented out for short periods to lots of dferent people.Discounted rail and bus fares continue to aid ‘recovery’ after Primark fire Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“By renting it out to glampers – for example via airbnb – I’d be able to recoup some money and explore other possibilities.“I’ve looked at other people who have converted buses over in England and they seem to be doing very well with renting them out.“I might as well give it a go. As far as I’m aware it will be the first converted double decker bus in Ireland so that’s definitely a selling point.”Jack – a university student who spent a couple of years working in a power station – said he’d had the bus for around  months. He hopes to have made the vehicle habitable by early next year.Jack said: “The issue is finding somewhere to put it before finishing it off. “It’s the land that is the expensive part. That’s more of an issue than the bus conversion itself.“I’m renting out the yard that it’s in now month by month.“I don’t have anywhere permanent to put it the moment.“I’m looking for a site or trying to find someone who wanted to go into partnership and would be interested in putting it on their site.“Ideally I’d like to have it in a permanent location before starting to rent it out.”Of the work that has been done on the bus and still needs to be carried out he said: “On the outside I have to take off the advertising sign and repaint it. “I’m going to keep it the same colour of green. “Inside I’m keeping some original features like the driver’s seat, steering wheel and dashboard. “I’ve kept some of the rails people would hold onto when the bus is moving.“I’ve taken all the seats out and the poles. I’m thinking of maybe using one of the ‘stop’ bells from the poles as a front door bell. I’ve also kept all the seats in storage with a view to do something with them at a later date.” In terms of new additions he said: “I’ve got the kitchen put in and the beds in. I need to do soft furnishings, carpets, blinds, sofas, etc .“I need to put in a toilet and a wood burner but I can’t put those in until it’s sited. You couldn’t move it with those fitted. The wood burner would probably be too heavy and the ceramics could break in transport.”Jack, who lives with his parents Jim and Liz and his sister Alison, is trying to keep the project environmentally friendly.He said: “I did Environmental Science at university over in Nottingham. “After that I worked in a power station for two years doing environmental management.“I saved up money from that job to be able to do this. I try to be as environmentally conscious as possible. I’ve tried to keep the bus project as carbon low as possible.” He added: “I saved £, and gave myself a budget of £,.“The bus cost £,, at the moment I’m into about £, conversion costs, so I’m hoping to be within the £, costs by the end of it.“I’ve had the bus for about a good year and a half, but most of the work has been done inside  months. “I should have it fully operational by early next year.“I’d say it would take two months once it’s sited for plumbing, electricity, etc.”Jack said planning permission to live in a vehicle was a “grey area”.“If you have a motorhome you can have it on your property for up to  days without planning permission, butit’s going to have plumbing and electricity then it will need the necessary permissions,” he said.“A double decker bus is still classed as a vehicle so you can park it at your houseyou have the room.“The ultimate goal would be for my bus to be self-contained – with solar , a wood burner to heat it, its own water supply and an above ground waste container. Planning permission would be needed for that.”You can follow Jack McGrath’s bus conversion on social media at: • www bus_tale• www.facebook Jacks-Bus-Tale-• www.instagram jacks.bus.taletry catch  TrendingPictures: Royals attend Christmas Day church service at Sandringham, minus Prince PhilipSinn Fein poll slump is new setback for Mary Lou McDonaldSteel and Sons Cup Final:East Belfast lt trophy after win over Sirocco WorksYear in Review: Michael Dunloprsquos Isle of Man TT trebleThieves stealing directly from shoppersrsquo trollies, DUP MP tells police          ..

It was indeed a thanksgiving service for a le well lived and the family have been encouraged by the hundreds of messages of support from all over the country.One message in particular spoke volumes for the regard in which Niall was held. It came from a long-serving worker and it spoke of the love for him, mentioning in particular the Christmas morning phone calls he made every year to the workers. “That was typical of him,” said the letter. “He was much more than a boss to the workers. He cared for them and was always interested in their welfare. He often phoned many of them on Christmas morning to wish them well.” During his childhood, the Irwin family lived at Woodhouse Street, beside the family bakery business.Niall attended Portadown College and from an early age it was evident that he was keen to join the family bakery business.In , when he was , he moved to Leeds to attend Thomas Danby College to study City and Guilds Bakery Diploma. During his time there, he learnt extensive baking knowledge as he got access to a range of bakeries on the mainland, including small craft business and chocolatiers to larger plant bakeries and this knowledge would stand him in good stead for the future.He ed home from Leeds in  to begin his career as production manager in the family business. These were dficult times in Northern Ireland but there was a strict ‘no politics’ policy in the bakery and Niall and his father, Kenneth Irwin, ensured there was a workforce from all the community and the bakery still carries that ethos today.Niall introduced new techniques and equipment and was always seeking methods to improve the bakery. He and his brother Brian, who joined the firm in , established the Irwin brand as one of the most successful in the country.He also contributed much to the bakery industry body, the Northern Ireland Bakery Council. With Manufacturing NI he played a signicant role in retaining the Industrial De-rating policy for local manufacturers.Manufacturing Northern Ireland’s chief executive Stephen Kelly said, “Niall was enormously generous to many groups and causes, particularly in sharing his experience, time and considerable wisdom. And that was very evident in the campaign to retain the industrial derating.Cold Feet will go to a ‘painfully embarrassing’ place in new series, says James Nesbitt Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“He enjoyed holding people to account and was a fierce advocate for the sector, ensuring that the conditions were right to allow firms to grow and to compete in markets at home and abroad and provide jobs. He contributed much in making great bread and bakery products and a better Northern Ireland.“He will be hugely missed by all those who worked with him.”Niall contributed his time generously to the Irish bakery trade. He was an energetic President of the Irish Association of Master Bakers in  and he was held in such esteem in the bakery business throughout these islands that he was awarded Honorary Le Membership of the Scottish Bakers Association. Last year he and brother Brian attended the Bakers Hall in London where they were both clothed in the Livery of the Worshipful Company of Bakers, giving them the honour of becoming Freemen of the City of London.One of Niall’s biggest challenges was helping oversee Irwins bakery move from Woodhouse Street to new premises in Carn in  and it says much of his and the other directors expertise that the move was made seamlessly with no loss of production.Mr Michael Murphy, chief executive officer at Irwins, joined in the tributes and he said, “Niall was passionate about work and extending his family values to the people who worked in the bakery. We are very much a family business and Niall was at the heart of this.“He was interested in everyone, no matter who you were, what you did or where you came from and he was always interested in seeing the young people progress. He would walk all the lines and by lunch-time he knew everything that was going on right across the business, both inside and out.“He was enormously generous to many people, groups and causes, sharing his experience, time and considerable wisdom. He was the heart of the bakery and he will be greatly missed.”As well as the bakery business, Niall took much pride at the progress of Irwin’s sand and aggregate business.But his le wasn’t all about work and outside the bakery business he was generous with his time and money to many causes. He travelled to Uganda in  with Fields of Le and became involved with the Water Of Le projects raising money for water well drilling rigs. He also fundraised tirelessly for the Irish Bakers Benevolent Society.On the sporting front he was President of Portadown Boat Club, where he was a driving force in the development of the club.The service was conducted by the minister of Edenderry Methodist Church, the Rev Alan Wardlow and there was a reading by family friend, Peter Thompson. Wilson Graham was the soloist.Niall is survived by his we, Kay, sons Ross and Stewart, sister Lyn and brother Brian. He was predeceased by his parents, Kenneth and Patsy.Ross said, “We have been greatly touched by all the tributes to Niall and we want everyone to know that we are very grateful for all the messages of sympathy.”He is interred at Kernan Cemetery.Donations in lieu of flowers are to Cancer Focus NI, c o Milne Funeral Services, , Seagoe Road, Portadown, BT HS.try catch  TrendingEx-UDA bomber tells teens: Donrsquot do as I didRangers: Steven Gerrard frustration at draw before Celtic testChristmas Eve fire death man lsquothe soul of our streetrsquoGet on board ... for a holiday on a double decker busRevealed: Top  fastest speeding drivers in Northern Ireland          ..

So my mind was a bit screwed up, I became a dferent character.”He later moved to Mourneview in Lurgan as the Troubles erupted.“People got very worried and I got misled into things. But I started to think – ‘this is ok because I am getting attention because of what I was doing’, but I was very misled.”Youngsters on both sides were fighting and the IRA left a bomb in his estate, he said.“I felt very sad and very aggressive towards everything, not just because of the Troubles but because of what was going on with me, being abused and so on. “I got terribly involved and of course the older ones mislead the youngsters, and me being a youngster with no sense and both my parents being deaf and dumb, I just thought it was the right thing to be getting on with.”Although only , as a UDA member he drove the lb bomb by car to Edwards Street in Lurgan, where he was told four IRA men were meeting.“I lit the fuse and it went out, but God intervened and he said to me ‘thou shalt not kill’ and the fear of God came upon me.”He did not try to relight it.Lisburn man tackles Everest to help get over loss of soul mateFaith in Christianity is beyond reason but is not contrary to it Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“Nobody got killed and nobody got hurt but it would have caused an awful lot of upset.“They were taking advantage of me. Of course they were. A young fella going to blow up a street, thinking it is going to be all right. Imaginethat bomb had gone off. I would probably still be in prison or it could have killed me.”He fled to England, where he now lives, but later served two years in jail and borstal.“I was a Marxist, I was a communist, I got involved in the drugs scene a bit. My le was a total mess. I had no idea how to live le because of what happened to me. But then I became a Christian, aged , and my le changed.”He now has a message for teenagers in NI going down the path he did.“Stop. Think. Read my book. See what can happen and where you can end up. And remember it is never the guys who are telling you what to do that get in trouble it is you that gets in trouble.“Prison was unbelievable. I was locked up for  hours a day. I was beaten up and all sorts of stuff in prison.“The criminal record never goes from you. So when you go for a job you have to declare itthey ask you your past. You are not covered by the rehabilitation act for this act.“So I would say to the youngsters of NI, ‘you are known all over the world as the most hospitable people there ever was, so look at each other in the same light as the world looks at you.“And get on together guys and leave the Troubles to the past.

It includes younger and older swimmers, male and female, with a range of abilities who swim every day come rain, hail or snow.Martin Strain said the group has been going informally for eight years but has grown notably in the last three. He said cold water plungeshelp members who have mental health issues.In Bangor, the Brompton Belles and Beaux have a core who swim every day at am. Marie-Therese Davis-Hanson started the group in  and said numbers have rocketed.One of the newest groups is Team Dash and Splash, whose members run along the coast before a plunge at Pickie Beach, Bangor on Sunday morning. Member and former Olympic swimmer Andrew Bree said it has been a big change from the warm indoor pools of his competitive career.“The water temperature gets down to around four five degrees in February and March here,” he said.“I got injured in  and left the sport not the way I wanted to and I think that affected me, but now I have found that love for the water again.“It strips the ego, when you get into the cold, there is no room for the past, there is no room for thoughts, you are focused on the present moment.Family’s thanks for Parker’s gt of le Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“My benefit was definitely mental, but there has also been a cardiovascular benefit, I have taken up more running and things I didn’t use to do. I come from a swimming background but I never liked running.“I think it’s from the cold, you are pumping that blood through the body, I just feel overall really good from it.”Dash and Splash founder Scott Riley said it started with a Facebook post in October .“I was going for a run and sea swim anyway, I got really interested in the health benefits of cold water and I was training to become a Wim Hof method instructor at that time which is a breathing and cold training technique for strengthening the nervous system,” he said.“The first week,  people turned up.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This will enable those who canrsquot make the Valersquos Daytime meeting to be informed and wersquoll offer help and explanationsneeded.ldquoItrsquos vitally important everyone makes their comments loud and clear in writing to the Vale Council at this time.ldquoWe need to drive home that a by-pass option is accepted through to the next stage of the process. It will be no use people moaning later.ldquoOf course multi-modal proposals can have their place but it is unrealistic to suggest they would ever solve the traffic congestion problem through Dinas Powys without a by-pass and without better park and ride facilities.ldquoBuses are currently used by just two per cent of commuters. Itrsquos no use putting more on the roads without removing some of the current commuting traffic, he said.ldquoDespite all the talk of rail and tram improvements there isnrsquot any scope to increase the minimal park-and-ride facilities at Eastbrook and none at all at Dinas Powys.After the Public Consultation, the WelTAG Draft Stage  Report will go to the Vale Cabinet.Members will probably ask their Scrutiny Committee for Environment and Regeneration to give their opinion.The Steering Group is also seeking to engage Ken Skates AM, Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Transport in talks that could involve private sector developments to help fund a by-pass.But theyrsquove been put on hold awaiting the Stage  report. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all. I would like to thank her for writing the book - especially with the personal things.The book is pound at www.jamessommerinrestaurant. co.uk  article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When I woke up whenever and potted and mooched and just saw what the day would bring.Like most people, the demands of work, family, friends, errands and the general stuff of le, mean that at any given moment we can be doing one thing, planning something  and thinking about many more.I get in to grasshopper phases where it feels like there is so much on my lsquoto dorsquo list that I flit and fly between myriad things and sometimes few of them get completed how Irsquod like or indeed completed at all and for those that that do get sorted and sewn up with aplomb, there is no time to take any satisfaction or pride because it is time to crack on with the next thing folks.I read a while ago about a concept that affects your brain around scarcity.The idea that when we feel that something is scarce, be that time, money or something  that we feel is in short supply, it can make us act with less focus and rationality thanwe had an abundance of such.So, in my case, when I feel time is pressured, I am more likely to try to do more with the result that I feel I have less time and my scarcity suffering brain is more likely to forget, to misplace to mess up.And so, knowing this, I am going to set aside the lsquoto dosrsquo and the lsquoshouldsrsquo and curl up on the settee with my utterly wonderful friend and eat and chill and know that with every mouthful of delicious cake, I am doing myself some good. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Beth was one of those rare people who always seemed kind and sincere.People remarked that she was always patient and helpful, always listened to your answer when she asked you how you were.\"She was no push-over either, though. She had steel, and was utterly intolerant of injustice. She was always instantly and unquestionably on the side of anyone suffering under any form of oppression, always ready to defend them, and willing to put her own shoulder to wheel to move things.She had a penetrating mind too. Shersquod always challenge an idea or an argumentshe wasnrsquot convinced by it. She volunteered for some time with the Welsh Refugee Council and it is completely in character with her, that utterly without thrusting herself egotistically forward, she became so central to the work of that organisation that they took her on paid ndash one of three jobs she worked.\"She helped set up a campaign in Penarth to save the local fire station from being gutted of - of its firefighters. We won that campaign, thanks in no small part to the campaign stalls she helped run, the support gig she helped organised and the other activity she engaged in. She was ever and an activist: fighting back against injustice was part of her DNA.       ,params: .push\"She was active in Cardf Unite Energy and Services branch and was a delegate to Cardf Trades Council. Both organisations will keenly feel her loss.\"Beth lived her le fighting for a fairer, socialist world and fighting to build the revolutionary party, the political vehicle we need to create that world. In her memory we rededicate ourselves to that struggle.\"Miss Roperdied from serious head injuries suffered on a train was a charity worker ing from a Christmas shopping trip with friends.Police believe the -year-olds injuries were caused when she leaned out of a train window.The charity worker and chair of a young socialist group was ing to her home in South Wales after spending the day at Baths Christmas Market with friends when she suffered the fatal blow to her head.British Transport Police said its initial inquiries suggested Miss Roper may have been leaning out of a carriage window at the time.The spokesman said the incident was reported to the Rail Accident Investigation Branch, and that the death was not being treated as suspicious.An inquest into her death is yet to open at Avon Coroners Court in Bristol.Miss Roper was working for the Welsh Refugee Council at the time of her death, having graduated from Cardf politan University in .The charity, a sister organisation to the UK-wide Refugee Council, works to help asylum seekers and refugees in Wales.She was also a campaigner and chairman of Young Socialists Cardf, and gave a speech in Cardf earlier this year arguing asylum seekers right to work and receive education were being ignored by the UK government. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was indeed a thanksgiving service for a le well lived and the family have been encouraged by the hundreds of messages of support from all over the country.One message in particular spoke volumes for the regard in which Niall was held. It came from a long-serving worker and it spoke of the love for him, mentioning in particular the Christmas morning phone calls he made every year to the workers. “That was typical of him,” said the letter. “He was much more than a boss to the workers. He cared for them and was always interested in their welfare. He often phoned many of them on Christmas morning to wish them well.” During his childhood, the Irwin family lived at Woodhouse Street, beside the family bakery business.Niall attended Portadown College and from an early age it was evident that he was keen to join the family bakery business.In , when he was , he moved to Leeds to attend Thomas Danby College to study City and Guilds Bakery Diploma. During his time there, he learnt extensive baking knowledge as he got access to a range of bakeries on the mainland, including small craft business and chocolatiers to larger plant bakeries and this knowledge would stand him in good stead for the future.He ed home from Leeds in  to begin his career as production manager in the family business. These were dficult times in Northern Ireland but there was a strict ‘no politics’ policy in the bakery and Niall and his father, Kenneth Irwin, ensured there was a workforce from all the community and the bakery still carries that ethos today.Niall introduced new techniques and equipment and was always seeking methods to improve the bakery. He and his brother Brian, who joined the firm in , established the Irwin brand as one of the most successful in the country.He also contributed much to the bakery industry body, the Northern Ireland Bakery Council. With Manufacturing NI he played a signicant role in retaining the Industrial De-rating policy for local manufacturers.Manufacturing Northern Ireland’s chief executive Stephen Kelly said, “Niall was enormously generous to many groups and causes, particularly in sharing his experience, time and considerable wisdom. And that was very evident in the campaign to retain the industrial derating.Cocaine seized at Belfast City Airport ‘could be worth £.m’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“He enjoyed holding people to account and was a fierce advocate for the sector, ensuring that the conditions were right to allow firms to grow and to compete in markets at home and abroad and provide jobs. He contributed much in making great bread and bakery products and a better Northern Ireland.“He will be hugely missed by all those who worked with him.”Niall contributed his time generously to the Irish bakery trade. He was an energetic President of the Irish Association of Master Bakers in  and he was held in such esteem in the bakery business throughout these islands that he was awarded Honorary Le Membership of the Scottish Bakers Association. Last year he and brother Brian attended the Bakers Hall in London where they were both clothed in the Livery of the Worshipful Company of Bakers, giving them the honour of becoming Freemen of the City of London.One of Niall’s biggest challenges was helping oversee Irwins bakery move from Woodhouse Street to new premises in Carn in  and it says much of his and the other directors expertise that the move was made seamlessly with no loss of production.Mr Michael Murphy, chief executive officer at Irwins, joined in the tributes and he said, “Niall was passionate about work and extending his family values to the people who worked in the bakery. We are very much a family business and Niall was at the heart of this.“He was interested in everyone, no matter who you were, what you did or where you came from and he was always interested in seeing the young people progress. He would walk all the lines and by lunch-time he knew everything that was going on right across the business, both inside and out.“He was enormously generous to many people, groups and causes, sharing his experience, time and considerable wisdom. He was the heart of the bakery and he will be greatly missed.”As well as the bakery business, Niall took much pride at the progress of Irwin’s sand and aggregate business.But his le wasn’t all about work and outside the bakery business he was generous with his time and money to many causes. He travelled to Uganda in  with Fields of Le and became involved with the Water Of Le projects raising money for water well drilling rigs. He also fundraised tirelessly for the Irish Bakers Benevolent Society.On the sporting front he was President of Portadown Boat Club, where he was a driving force in the development of the club.The service was conducted by the minister of Edenderry Methodist Church, the Rev Alan Wardlow and there was a reading by family friend, Peter Thompson.

So my mind was a bit screwed up, I became a dferent character.”He later moved to Mourneview in Lurgan as the Troubles erupted.“People got very worried and I got misled into things. But I started to think – ‘this is ok because I am getting attention because of what I was doing’, but I was very misled.”Youngsters on both sides were fighting and the IRA left a bomb in his estate, he said.“I felt very sad and very aggressive towards everything, not just because of the Troubles but because of what was going on with me, being abused and so on. “I got terribly involved and of course the older ones mislead the youngsters, and me being a youngster with no sense and both my parents being deaf and dumb, I just thought it was the right thing to be getting on with.”Although only , as a UDA member he drove the lb bomb by car to Edwards Street in Lurgan, where he was told four IRA men were meeting.“I lit the fuse and it went out, but God intervened and he said to me ‘thou shalt not kill’ and the fear of God came upon me.”He did not try to relight it.Cocaine seized at Belfast City Airport ‘could be worth £.m’Stephen cooks up  dinners for the needy Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"LURG | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"LURG | Article Teaser\"“Nobody got killed and nobody got hurt but it would have caused an awful lot of upset.“They were taking advantage of me.

And remember it is never the guys who are telling you what to do that get in trouble it is you that gets in trouble.“Prison was unbelievable. I was locked up for  hours a day. I was beaten up and all sorts of stuff in prison.“The criminal record never goes from you. So when you go for a job you have to declare itthey ask you your past.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/flat1.jpg","title":"belfasts flatiron building takes on first tenants","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew A design agency has become the first tenant of a newly renovated Victorian listed building with another business expected to become the second soon, Ulster Business can reveal.

The Belfast Region City Deal will see a series of projects and schemes taking place across, Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Mid and East Antrim, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Newry, Mourne and Down. And with that, a series of major IT initiatives are being outlined, many in collaboration with Ulster University and Queen’s University, in a bid to grow and expand Northern Ireland’s credentials on a global scale. “Queen’s University Belfast and Ulster University have collaborated extensively to develop proposals for global centres of innovation excellence in key growth sectors in which world-leading expertise in our universities can be leveraged by businesses to create breakthrough technologies, products and services,” the City Deal proposal says. And it adds that a deal “requires a catalyst that will drive forward investment in research and development and help embed a culture of innovation to act as a driver for increased productivity”. The councils took their case to Westminster at the end of October, and following that, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced the Treasury’s commitment. The rest of the proposed funding will come from matched finance from Stormont, with the remaining from the councils. Andthey pull it off, they are predicting as many as , new jobs could be created. DIGITAL HEALTHCARE In a bid to further grow and develop Northern Ireland’s position on the international healthcare market, the City Deal proposes creating a branded cluster of medical device and technology companies that “through a supportive and collaborative eco system of co-location and working will build the size and value of the sector”. The centre aims to attract and develop businesses across a range of areas, especially in the areas of cardiology, diabetes, respiratory and stroke. It says that a key aspect of the proposed cluster is the partnership working with scientists and companies with the existing pilot clinical lab at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Also in the pipeline is the ‘i-Reach’ project. Led by Queen’s University, Ulster University and partners from the le and health sciences sector, those behind the City Deal say it sits within the umbrella of an “emerging health innovation NI concept which seeks to bring a unied ‘front door’ for external investment into the health and le sciences sector”. DIGITAL PARTNERSHIP It is proposing a “physical and digital environment” to allow the academic research community, tech entrepreneurs and industrial partners will come together to address key challenges in business and society through the application of the IoTand data science. Those behind it say it will support a common approach to big data sourcing and management, including early adoption of prevailing industry standards and codes of practice for secure and ethical use of data. There are also plans for a ‘global innovation institute’. The plans say it will draw together the skills of several areas of Queen’s University – which includes electronics, communications and information technology, health sciences and food security – to “anchor and support the creation of a Global Innovation Quarter in Belfast”. MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY According to those behind the City Deal, the will operate at the interface between academia and industry “accelerating new technology developments through the innovation phase and ensuring that real industrial challenges based on market need are solved through collaboration with the best university research”. Queen’s and Ulster University have developed an ‘advanced manufacturing innovation centre’ concept, that will “become the springboard for manufacturing innovation within the region”. CREATIVE INDUSTRIES Northern Ireland has already proven itself on the big and small screen, but there has been a strong move towards growing that further still. Aside from NI providing the facilities and backdrop for most of Game of Thrones, there’s also been the development of the Belfast Harbour Film Studios. Part of the City Deal plan involves boosting that position, with a ‘screen and media innovation lab’ bringing together “transformative production, studio and RD facilities”. SCIENCE PARK Elsewhere, in Mid and East Antrim, plans are under way for the transformation of the former St Patrick’s Barracks site in Ballymena into a new science park – Integrated Industrial Inspiration and Innovation Campus called iC. It’s being proposed that each council area will have some form of innovation hub, which will be directed towards business development. CONNECTIVITY Aside from specic schemes, infrastructure and connectivity improvements are part of the plans. That includes improvements in fibre-optic and mobiles broadband connectivity. It comes as mobile network EE, part of the BT Group, announced that Belfast is among six cities across the UK which have been chosen for the first phase of its G launch. “Our G trials are going well, giving us valuable insight into both the performance of the new technology and the challenges of upgrading sites with this new equipment,” Marc Allera, chief executive of BT’s consumer ision said. “We’re confident that we can bring G to the busiest parts of Belfast and the UK in .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"ni hospice the best of business and sport championing a force for good","story":"Posted on Tuesday  December  by Ulster Business The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice wants to partner with business leaders from right across the province.

With annual costs of £.m, the children’s hospice depends heavily on donations from the public to keep vital services going.But in addition to that, the children’s hospice is focused on boosting and growing philanthropic relationships with Northern Ireland business leaders who want to establish long-term links and a partnership with a charity who make a positive and meaningful impact across Northern Ireland.And as a result of that, it’s Time to Care programme was created – looking at new and innovative ways to reach out for key support.Heather Weir is chief executive of the NI Hospice. “The NI Hospice costs £m to run each year, and we have to raise £.m for direct care costs every year through our fundraising efforts,” she says.“As well as relying on the local community, we rely on business support too. With the vast amount of charities out there, we have been looking at how we can align the charity with business leaders and their companies, in terms of a fresh partnership approach.“We looked at how we could make supporting a charity feel really meaningful for businesses.“As a charity we need business insights, and not just in fundraising support. Having a network of business leaders is a practical way of supporting the hospice.”Heather says, aside from helping young people with le-limiting conditions, it’s also a chance for them to help improve their companies corporate social responsibility agenda.For Co Antrim man Brendan Rodgers – who paid a visit to the organisation’s Newtownabbey base alongside Wayne Sullivan and Ken Montgomery – the connection started with a letter from the NI Hospice, back when he was manager of Liverpool.“When I met Heather and came over, it was something from a personal perspective. We are all brought up as carers in Northern Ireland, and we want to give back. But I also felt that my role and responsibility as a manager – sport touches a lot of people and I could use it in a way that would hopefully open up doors for the NI Hospice in a dferent way.“In the last number of years, it’s been a great opportunity for me to meet people like Wayne, who I have met before – like-minded people who are very driven in their professional le, but alongside that, they have a real duty of care for organisation they support.”“What you have when you support the NI Hospice is something tangible.”Wayne Sullivan, founder of Vanrath, said: “What we have come up with is a project where all donations and funding goes into a specic account that is designated solely for the use of spending on nurse salaries.“You know where the money is going and that really ticks a box from our perspective. The nurses also come out to provide presentations of what they have been doing.“But asfor this, we get to use the brand and we co-partner. This is a marketing partnership.”The Time to Care relationship with companies also includes a Business Ambassadors network, which brings leaders together across a range of events.Ken Montgomery, chairman of Pinnacle, said: “For us at Pinnacle, my interest was the corporate social aspect of it and giving back to the community. Running a successful business in the community, I think there is a big role for corporates to play.”“It was also selling it to our own employees – the people working in the company. One of the things that appealed to me was having the direct contact with a particular nurse, and you felt the direct impact of what you are doing.”The key focus is enabling businesses to fund the cost of a qualied children’s nurse for a year. That relationship then offers a company access to co-branding opportunities and its own business network.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice has opened two new cots this year, at a cost of £, each. And for each cot, the children’s hospice needs five paediatric nurses.And the target for the NI Hospice in the next three years is focused on achieving maximum capacity, bringing it to  cots and beds, serving over , infants and children living with a le limiting and le threatening illness. That’s an additional £.m over the next three years that’s needed.   So, what’s the key message to get Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes involved “For most top businesses, their brand will have a set of values which is important to them.” Brendan says.“The key word is alignment... you want to align yourself with those values that will drive your business, your people and your customers or beneficiaries.”This year, it has also launched its Jingle All the Way campaign. It encourages businesses, organisations, schools, clubs, churches and iniduals across Northern Ireland to get involved and fundraise through a iety of areas, including a k run, a Jingle bake-off and a Jingle Jumper Day.Time to Care is a unique offer for business leaders to support the children’s hospice and the specialist nurses who  provide vital care to infants and children with a le limiting illness across Northern Ireland.

Here Emma Deighan looks at the who, what and why of STEM initiatives in the business sector According to the most recent Skills Barometer report the biggest shortage of skills in Northern Ireland falls within the science, technology, engineering and mathssectors.The research, compiled by Ulster University for the Department for the Economyin , shows an urgency to train future generations in what are the fastest-growing areas of our economy.In its analysis the report concluded: “The subjects forecast to be predominantly under-supplied are engineering and technology, maths and computer sciences and physical and environmental sciences. It is estimated that the economy will require an additional  engineering and technology graduates and a similar number of additional maths and computer science graduates each year. Strong demand for the STEM related subjects is forecast.”It’s a concern given the growth within those business isions here. An influx of international STEM related employers have set up shop here, investing in a skillset that still needs much attention. Meanwhile our homegrown hub of STEM related employers are expanding at a phenomenal rate.Some of these investments include Lisburn-based firm Camlin’s announcement that it will create  new roles in the engineering field thanks to a £m expansion. And in earlier in the year, financial services firm, FinTrU revealed it would add a further  employees to its team across Belfast and in the North West.Then there’s the hugely successful sports device firm, STATSports, that is seeking another  staff members. And two years ago Belfast-based global aerospace and defence system manufacturer Thales’ opened up a whole new field here when in it launched a £m space propulsion facility signalling a whole new area of expertise that would open up to graduates here. With the future looking bright in terms of employment in these sectors, sirens sound when the Skills Barometer says STEM related subjects have been regularly under-supplied. It described it as a “consistent finding” across several years of research but fortunately activity to level out the supply-demand flow within the STEM world here is by no means passive. Governmental, third sector organisations and indeed those businesses reliant on that talent pool have been engaging in initiatives to support a deficit in talent. Clinical diagnostics firm Randox is one such employer. Software development, IT support, engineering, science research and mathematics make up the bulk of its operations and as such it promotes roles within the latter fields through STEM programmes.Linda Magee, head of human resources at Randox, said: “At Randox there are plenty of opportunities to work across a wide iety of STEM disciplines. Our APEX programme, which offers first year university students a complete career package, includes work experience between first and second year, a paid placement in third year and, finally, a graduate position post-degree.“Students accepted on to the Randox APEX programme work with, and learn from, the most experienced professionals in the industry, across a range of departments within their discipline.“They might be assisting our ground-breaking research into tests for cancer, kidney disease and Alzheimer’s, working in our engineering department developing diagnostic technologies, contributing to the output of a busy forensics laboratory, or joining our business development teams as they expand the Randox portfolio across the globe.”Linda said the firm also encourages “established talent” to come back and join the company through a ‘ers’ programme, a six-week scheme aimed at those who have had a break from the workplace. It includes induction, training and mentoring.“There are endless opportunities for career progression at Randox – the sky really is the limit,” she said.Another firm with training high up its agenda is FinTrU, the investment bank services firm, at the Gasworks in Belfast.In terms of recruitment, FinTrU developed its two-year Graduate Programme with a long-term commitment to providing analysts with support, training and industry qualications such as Investment Operations Certicates .It also offers financial services academies which have resulted in almost  jobs for graduates in Belfast. Named Academy X,  this year’s intake welcomed a range of graduates from non-financial backgrounds to allow them to forge a career in the sector. Founder of the company, Darragh McCarthy, believes such programmes create an “ecosystem” that gives back to the talent pool and economy here. “I see FinTrU as having a social purpose to create high-quality professional employment in Northern Ireland,” he said.One of the most active firms in nurturing a talent pool in IT is Kainos. Each year the NI digital services giant donates over £, and , man hours to safeguarding the IT sector’s future. Kainos’ technology outreach manager Gemma Crothers said: “You can go into schools and they have this tumbleweed idea thatyou’re going to work in IT you literally get a PC and type stuff. And we want to change that perception.“There are so many dferent areas to IT. And it’s lucrative and that’s the message we’re trying to put across. We are trying to change the way the schools are managed and bring computer science in at a nationwide level and we are lobbying the government for that.“One of the big areas for us is trying to train teachers on all levels so they have the confidence in the classroom to weave the skills in and give the students the exposure they need so they can chose to follow through.”Kainos recently announced that it was seeking applications for its ‘Earn as you Learn’ scheme. It’s a funded computing systems degree that also allows students to earn a salary while they study. Brendan Mooney, Kainos’ chief executive said of the scheme offers students the best of both worlds. He said: “The pace of technological change is faster than ever. So, anyone who can obtain both industry experience and an education at the same time, will have the advantage. They get to apply what they have learned in university and also get a head start in their career.“At Kainos we pride ourselves on our determination to nurture and invest in the talent of the future and are committed to broadening access and offering dferent routes to school leavers from dferent backgrounds.”In the science field, Craigavon-based global pharmaceutical company Almac Group also works closely with schools and universities to encourage interest in STEM subjects and careers.Frances Weldon, STEM outreach manager at the firm said Almac believes it has a responsibility to drive interest in the field to “grow a dynamic and innovative economy that benefits all”.“At Almac we are hugely focused on engaging with the next generation and helping them gain skills that they will need for their future careers. We rely on the talent, skills and expertise of our dedicated employees to drive continued growth and realise our vision to advance human health. We know that to ensure our success in the future we need even more skilled and knowledgeable recruits.”Among its initiatives are the Sloane McClay and Almac McKervey awards, work shadow placements, apprenticeships and industrial placements for third level students, some of which do not require a science background. “In the new year, through a partnership with W, we will launch a £m project aimed at enhancing STEM knowledge, skills and understanding among school pupils. An interactive exhibition will explore the human body and the diagnosis and treatment of illness as well as telling Almac’s story,” Frances said.The objective she says is to “inspire a new generation of students to gain skills to help them secure exciting and innovative roles such as those we offer at Almac”.The latter investments represent just a fraction of STEM activity ongoing here. The wider picture of such initiatives is not just beneficial to STEM businesses but the economy as a whole here.

Seamus Leheny is just one voice in the increasingly tumultuous debate around the main concerns and issues that still exist around the border, following the UK’s exit from the EU. We currently sit on the precipice, a Schrodinger’s cat scenario, where we on one hand have some form of early agreement on ensuring noto a hard border, and at the same time, don’t, while waiting to see whether the Prime Minister can sell it. We then establish what will be done to avoid any severe impact to cross-border trade here. The BBC’s Chris Mason garnered attention with an honest abstract on Brexit progress a couple of weeks ago - ‘I haven’t for the foggiest idea’ he told his colleagues back in the studio. “When we turn our attention to commercial goods vehicles crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, it’s a very dferent story,” Seamus Leheny says. More than . million goods vehicles crossed the border in , according to official stats. And of those . million movements, the majority was recorded on the A Belfast to Dublin road. “When we break down the figures on cross border traffic, this equates to an average of , goods vehicles crossing the border daily, which is  per hour – or to illustrate it in comparison to cross channel movements, it’s a large freight ferry fully laden every  minutes,  ,  days a year,” Seamus says. For Dale Farm for example, and other food processors, its concern is over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says. “For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t. “It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate. “I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now. “Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.” Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy, as an example, is sold where. A study by InterTrade Ireland said a signicant share of cross-border trade is accounted for by firms that trade “simultaneously in both directions”. “These two-way traders make up around % of ﬁrms, but accounted for over % of exports and over % of imports,” according to Seamus. With transport, Translink boss Chris Conway says it remains unclearthe company will be able to run cross-border bus services,no deal on Brexit is secured. During an evidence session in Westminster, he said that the organisation runs around  cross-border services – some which, he said, “meander” between Northern Ireland and the Republic during a journey. There’s also the issue of whether drivers will be able to operate between jurisdictions following the UK’s exit. That’s due to a question mark floating over the head of licences for drivers in the EU. Elsewhere, the Road Haulage Association has said with around three months left to go it is not prepared for what’s around the corner. It’s a two-way street, of course, for both firms from Northern Ireland selling south, and those from the Republic selling north. Figures from the ONS show Northern Irish business with the Republic of Ireland accounted for around % of exports and % of imports. “The share of intermediate products in imports from Northern Ireland to Ireland is higher in almost all sectors than trade in the same sectors from the rest of the UK,” Seamus said in a piece examining the impact of a ‘no deal’ scenario. “So for example, a company could transport ingredients or components across the border several times before the finished product is completed in Northern Ireland, and is then ready for export to consumers in Great Britain. “Naturally the intermediate products will be of lesser value compared to the completed product, hence the disparity in value of goods crossing the Irish Sea compared to the land border. “In recent Brexit discussions the signicance of the value of trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain has been highlighted. “This is quite right and we must ensure this hugely important market for us is not jeopardised or impeded in any way as a result of Brexit. “What has often been overlooked is our reliance on being able to move goods quickly, cheaply and without tarfs across the Irish border, in order to assemble those valuable goods we end up shipping to Great Britain. “If the all-island supply chains are impeded with subsequent increased costs and subject to tarfs, then those exports we champion and put on those ferries to Great Britain will suddenly become less competitive in price – or, in the worst case scenario, won’t exist anymore.” Seamus says a “holistic approach is required when trade from Northern Ireland is discussed and used as a bargaining chip due to the fact it’s a unique economic region that is finely interwoven with that of another EU member state”. “To pursue, or indeed to sleep walk into, a no deal Brexit would unravel the carefully tailored economy of Northern Ireland and potentially leave it in tatters.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/house1.jpg","title":"ulster rugby player developing luxury homes","story":"Posted on Friday  December  by John Mulgrew A series of new luxury homes are being developed by an Ulster Rugby player in east Belfast, Ulster Business can reveal.Craig Gilroy, alongside developer Austin Baird, is currently building two large detached properties on a site at his home close to the Belmont Road.Work is under way on the properties, which will include a five-bedroom and six-bedroom development.“One of the properties is around , sq ft and the other , sq ft – we are still working on a price,” Mr Gilroy said.“The market seems to be pretty good, looking at the other properties in the area.”He said the properties will come to market in the next few weeks.
