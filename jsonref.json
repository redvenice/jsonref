But the wife of sweary television chef Gordon Ramsay, now head of a £43 million restaurant empire, is not immune to shedding a few tears every now and again – indeed, she says, it’s a necessity.Running around Wimbledon Common in South-West London, as Tana does several times a week with the family’s two dogs, she allows herself to cry and occasionally, even, to scream. For the last couple of years have wreaked a heavy emotional toll.There was the devastating loss of their son, the couple’s fifth child, when Tana had a miscarriage at 21 weeks. Then, last year, a bust-up between Gordon and Tana’s father, Chris Hutcheson – who used to run Gordon Ramsay Holdings – ended at the Old Bailey, with the latter jailed for six months for hacking into Gordon’s emails.Earlier it was revealed that Chris had a secret second family, with grown-up children. ‘It’s easy to put a smile on and say, “Everything is absolutely fine!” ’ says Tana.‘But when you’re running, with your music on, you can cry. You can scream. That’s important. You can’t keep it in because it comes back to haunt you if you haven’t processed it. That’s what causes long-term problems.’DR MICHAEL MOSLEY: Keep your blood sugar in check... even if...The many reasons for buying a Georgian house... they\u0027ve got...Share this articleThere is no sign of this emotional turmoil today. Tana, 43, is glowing with good health. She reveals that her father, now 70, is out of jail and competed in his 90th marathon in April this year – alongside his grandchildren.So they’re all back in touch? ‘Oh yes, absolutely,’ Tana says. She won’t say more, but it’s evident that Chris is now very much part of the family again. Whether he and Gordon have patched up their differences is less clear.And Tana, like her father, is arguably in the best shape of her life. She runs marathons, has completed a half-ironman, and is currently training for the London Triathlon to raise money for the couple’s charity, the Gordon and Tana Ramsay Foundation, which has donated £850,000 to London’s Great Ormond Street Hospital since 2015.          Tana, pictured centre with husband Gordon, right, and from left son Jack, family friend Alexander Dundas, and daughters Holly and MatildaIt is exercise, more than anything, which has helped the family cope with the tribulations of the past two years.‘What it does is allow you to process things,’ she says.‘Whether it is cycling and chatting together, or running and having a cry on your own, you have to have that release. You also have to have those moments where you allow yourself to feel really sad, when you’re thinking, “Why me?” We’re all going to think like that occasionally. It means we can handle it. It has drawn us together as a family.‘It’s also important to talk with the children and not just think everything is fine. Gordon’s a really big one for talking. Sometimes I just say to him “Seriously?”, and he’s like: “No, we have to talk about it.” Sometimes that’s irritating.’          The Ramsay\u0027s pictured here with Victoria Beckham, centre, are an incredibly sporty familySport runs through almost everything the Ramsay family does. The couple’s four children – Megan, 20, twins Jack and Holly, 18, and Tilly, 16 – compete variously in swimming, netball, rugby, ju-jitsu, hockey and water polo. Their schedule is frenetic: Tana shrugs at the idea that she’s a supermum, but it is impressively well-orchestrated.Jack can be dropped off at school in Dulwich, South-East London, by 6.30am, and Tilly and Holly to their school in Richmond by 7.30am, which leaves Tana time to have a run on Wimbledon Common with the dogs by 7.50am. She’s home by nine, showered and at work at her beauty salon in Battersea by 9.30am.There’s also a home gym – which the whole family uses – and gruelling three-hour cycle rides at the weekends. It’s precisely because the kids are so busy that you won’t see them falling out of nightclubs like other celebrity offspring.‘I don’t worry about the kids going off the rails because they have sport,’ she explains. ‘Yes, they’re teenagers and they’re all on Instagram doing those weird pouts. How could they not be?‘All I can do is make sure they have a healthy relationship between their body and food. Exercise is good not only to keep in shape but mentally it’s fantastic, and a great discipline for kids. Showing them we do it, and instilling that attitude in them, is so important. They’ve been studying for A-level and GCSE exams and I’ve said, “Do a couple of hours of exercise and your brains will work better.”‘I do think it’s helped them to deal with the stress.’Tana admits to following her children on the Find My Friends app, which allows users to see the location of others using GPS. It hasn’t always been reassuring.‘Jack went out after his exams,’ she says. ‘I woke up and it was 5am and he wasn’t home. I’d promised I wouldn’t call because he’s 18, so I went on the app and then saw he was at St Thomas’ Hospital so I freaked and rang him, but tried to sound relaxed. In fact, he was just getting in an Uber.’Tana has run nine marathons and Gordon has competed over a dozen. When Megan turned 18 – the minimum age to take part – she begged to be allowed to do it too. Jack and Holly competed for the first time this year, while Tilly, who has her own CBBC show, Matilda And The Ramsay Bunch, is ‘chomping at the bit’ to have her chance.GORDON, 51, naturally, has the best time (3.30) – ‘have you seen his thighs?’ – followed by Tana, a respectable 25 minutes behind. All of them except Tilly, who will be on a water polo tour, are taking part in the London Triathlon on August 4 to 5. Surely there must be competition? Tana laughs. ‘Between Jack and Gordon it can get pretty intense,’ she admits. ‘But Jack hasn’t beaten me at the marathon yet. They all make me incredibly proud, and I get very emotional.‘There’s so much pressure on them already with social media, so the more normal we keep it the easier it is as a family to just be us, and for them to have the confidence to be themselves.’Tana is clearly comfortable in her own skin, and felt no pressure to stay in shape as Gordon’s celebrity rose. They married in 1996 when he was head chef at Aubergine in Chelsea – now he has 35 restaurants across the globe and seven Michelin stars, along with TV projects in the UK and US.The couple count the Beckhams among their closest friends, so does Tana train with Victoria? ‘No, although when we’re in America we do go to Soul Cycle classes together. I’d love to get Victoria in an ironman competition.’ Tana looks mischievous. Would she do it? ‘No, I doubt it. She’d look at me like I was some kind of maniac, I imagine.’Tana obviously sees things differently – for Gordon and her, exercise is a release. The couple take long cycle rides together on Sundays, completing up to 60 miles a time over the Surrey hills as part of their triathlon training.‘We’ve always been good at spending time away from the kids, just the two of us. Finding something which helps you remember what you like in that person, after so many years of marriage, is great. Gordon might have been away all week in the US, but we’ll go out early in the morning and spend several hours on our bikes and catch up.‘For me, a mum in my 40s, it’s also about doing something just to feel good about myself. I’ve given the kids all of my attention for all of these years, so it’s time for me. I really enjoy it – it’s so social.’Food, perhaps unsurprisingly, is important in the Ramsay household but Tana insists they have ‘a good balance’. ‘I never obsessed over having perfect food for the kids at all times,’ she says. ‘I never watched over them at parties, never said, “Don’t eat this.” I didn’t want to be a helicopter mum, forever hovering over them.‘We’ll have chocolate in the fridge, but our meals are usually healthy. That’s how it should be.’They try to eat together as a family as much as possible but their conflicting schedules mean it happens ‘maybe once or twice a week’.Breakfast is ‘a slice of toast while running down the stairs’, she says. When asked if the children are talented cooks, she pauses before sniggering: ‘They do cook.’Refreshingly, too, there’s no special ‘training diet’ as she prepares for the triathlon. Tana has always run and once finished a 5km in a very good time of 19 minutes. The London Triathlon involves a 750m swim (‘longer than it sounds’, she jokes, grimly), then a 20km cycle ride followed by a 5km run.It’s for a great cause. The Gordon and Tana Ramsay Foundation, set up in 2014, has 235 competitors signed up to Team Ramsay, and money raised for Great Ormond Street has, in previous years, funded research projects and intensive-care equipment.Does she see herself doing it at 80? ‘My father has just had a hip replacement and has been on this health regime. He’s lost a stone in three weeks and ran his 90th marathon in April with three of his grandchildren and one of his sons. I’d like to aspire to that.‘At 80, I want to have energy, I want to be saying to Gordon, “Let’s go on holiday with our bikes and panniers, somewhere like Hawaii.”‘Enjoying our time after working so hard, just ambling around. That’s how I see us.’    Start in a low lunge, with one knee down and the other leg forwards. Then, engaging your core muscles, switch legs.

Ear-bleedingly loud dance music pumps through the speakers as Heidi and Chris Powell – the stars of US hit reality show Extreme Weight Loss – take the stage to lead an exercise class that will help us reach our ‘pain threshold’ and ‘burn optimum body fat’.Someone in the crowd screams. Another cries. It’s not yet 7.30am. Welcome to the first day of the world’s biggest fitness convention: Idea World, in San Diego, southern California.Dubbed the ‘superbowl of the fitness industry’, the annual event brings together more than 200 fitness industry professionals, trainers and celebrity weight-loss gurus, alongside 14,000 exercise fanatics from all around the globe.They flock to the four-day festival to find the latest innovations and trends in workouts, equipment and technology on offer.

So, as the only British journalist invited to attend this year, would I discover one I could actually bear?COULD I GET MADONNA’S BOTTOM?The exhaustive list of almost 400 classes, workouts and evening activities at Idea World is overwhelming I commit to 25 classes over a period of 48 hours.Only the most sweat-inducing make my cut.After the Powells’ Extreme Transformation Workout, an endless series of muscle-toning exercises performed for three minutes at a time, I move on to a BOSU class: exercises practised aboard a squishy rubber dome.Instructor Alison demonstrates how to ‘paddle’ with my steel bar in hand, engaging the core and glutes for ‘bums and tums’ tightening.          Over the course of 48 hours, Eve tried out 20 different work outs at the Idea World fitness convention in San Diego, CaliforniaFinding my balance on the rubber sphere is tough enough let alone extending opposite arm and legs simultaneously. Remarkably, by focusing on a spot on the wall in front of me, I’m able to complete the rest of the routine with minimal wobbling.After Tae Bo, a mixture of martial arts and aerobics, comes Booty Barre – a class especially designed to build a beautiful bottom.The workout – whose fans include Madonna – draws on the principles of Pilates and ballet.As a regular Pilates goer, I was fairly confident I’d get through the hour with ease, but after five minutes of thrusting with a medicine ball between my legs – on tiptoes – I realise this isn’t the case.By the end of the class, my thighs are like jelly and I’m starving hungry. It’s 10am.BOOT CAMP, BOXING... AND BATTLE ROPESI decide to get the worst out the way before lunchtime: army boot camp.Developed by a former US sergeant, this is a 90-minute sweatathon involving jumping squats, lunges and sprints interspersed with military-style marches. Angry orders from Sergeant Ken Weichart (aka Sgt Ken) to ‘Embrace The Pain!’ keep me moving despite the agony but after 50 rapid squats and the sergeant’s demands to ‘get lower’, I succumb to the pain and embarrassingly stumble mid-rep. ‘No quitters here!’ Ken loudly reminds me.I manage a 30-minute lunch break before leaping straight into the on-site boxing ring for a couple of rounds with a bullish, bald-headed former champ.          This odd-looking device is supposed to provide a work out for bums and tumsTo my surprise, I can throw a mean punch and even manage a spin, kick and smack move.Then I move across to Battle Ropes. After 15 minutes of tutorial, we experiment with all 30 ways a 55 lb, 50ft rope can be moved about for a vigorous full-body workout.It’s not all about waving it with the hands – try jumping between two ropes for a quick warm-up, or lifting the ropes in between press-ups to work the core and arms. At the end of the class, I unashamedly collapse on the floor into a pool of my own sweat and admit defeat. Tomorrow is another day…TORTURE... FOR KILLER ABSOn day two, I explore the 500,000 square foot exhibition hall showcasing almost 400 cutting-edge fitness gadgets and machinery.I start with a demonstration of the latest vibrating Power Plate to hit US gyms. The machine stimulates muscles with vibration, increasing muscle tone when exercising. I expect to watch my love handles wiggle off my body without moving but unfortunately, some work is required. I try step-ups and single leg balances, before moving on to planks, bridges and seated crunches – all aboard the vibrating platform. Each exercise feels ten times more intense than I’d ever experienced before, with ripples of pain shooting through my entire body.Converts claim that those ten minutes of excruciating torture are the fastest route to killer abs.Other highlights of the exhibition include a 6ft stair-climbing machine which, on maximum resistance, feels five times harder than normal stairs a virtual-reality treadmill that sends me running through the French countryside and a cycling machine called Real Ryder which tilts 22 degrees and emits stimulating vibrations. I disembark the bike, feeling two stone lighter, and seek out an upper-body exercise to give my legs some well-earned rest.

Four other boys were excluded for a fixed period.An online petition calling for \u0027something to be done\u0027 has gathered more than 2,000 signatures since it was launched in March.

A source told the paper that a French boarding pupil had been called a \u0027dirty croissant\u0027 by a teacher, an incident thought to be under investigation by civil servants.The move, threatening possible closure of Beechen Cliff follows a damning inspectors\u0027 report written after a snap inspection in May, which found safeguarding was \u0027not effective\u0027.In 2014, Ofsted rated the school outstanding, however the governing body has now said the school is inadequate in two out of five measures of education standards and required improvement in the other three.Ofsted said the language used by leaders and governors during the inspection to describe the alleged racist incident in January gave \u0027serious cause for concern\u0027.          The school has been given a \u0027termination warning notice\u0027 by the government, threatening to withdraw its funding\u0027They still do not appreciate its true gravity, and little appears to have been learnt from the way that this issue was handled,\u0027 says the report. \u0027The school\u0027s current plans to improve safeguarding are weak.\u0027Inspectors also said the school was illegally excluding pupils by sending them on extended study leave.This comes as some parents came out in support of Beechen Cliff after the report was published, signing an open letter that said their boys were \u0027happy\u0027 and felt safe at the school.In a letter to the local paper, a former headmaster, Roy Ludlow, said the inspection report painted an \u0027unrecognisable\u0027 picture of the school and had exaggerated its \u0027few faults\u0027.

This is an astonishingly dishonest claim.\u0027He said that under the controversial Chequers plan the UK would say tied to many of the EU\u0027s rules - without having a voice in what they should be.    PM (pictured with Donald Trump at Chequers on Friday) in stern Brexit warning her MPsTheresa May has warned there may be ‘no Brexit at all’ because of attempts to wreck her controversial blueprint for Britain’s departure from the European Union.She claims that rival Commons revolts by warring pro- and anti-Europe Tory MPs threaten to sabotage hopes of winning a post-Brexit deal for Britain. And in a hard-hitting message to Brussels, the Prime Minister says she will not budge an inch on the proposed Brexit deal she agreed with Cabinet Ministers at her Chequers summit.Writing in today’s Mail on Sunday, Mrs May dramatically raises the stakes in her bid to win support for her proposal to make a success of leaving the EU.Her fighting talk comes after US President Donald Trump enraged Downing Street last week by claiming that Mrs May should be more ‘brutal’ towards Brussels, and also follows reports that Conservative MPs are threatening to force her to quit.In a bold attempt to kill off plots by both Brexit and Remainer MPs to make her tear up her new Brexit policy, the Prime Minister says: ‘My message to the country this weekend is simple: we need to keep our eyes on the prize.‘If we don’t, we risk ending up with no Brexit at all.’                          The Prime Minister launched her fightback today by writing in the Mail on Sunday warning Eurosceptics that they can either back her plans or risk no Brexit at all.But leading Brexiteers turned the heat up on No10 by making a series of fiery interventions in the Sunday newspapers.  Steve Baker - who dramatically quit as Brexit minister last week -accused the PM of leading a year long \u0027cloak a dagger\u0027 plot to scupper a clean Brexit.He said the plan amounted to a \u0027Potemkin structure\u0027 - a fake illusion intended to deceive -  to distract from what the Cabinet Office Europe unit was doing for the Prime Minister.Talking to The Sunday Telegraph, Mr Baker said: \u0027It does appear to me that there has been a year\u0027s worth of cloak and dagger to land us into the Chequers position. \u0027An establishment elite who never accepted the fundamental right of the public to choose democratically their institutions are working towards overturning them.\u0027We\u0027re back to what civil servants wanted a year ago, the advice they were giving then, of something like the EEA (European Economic Area membership) plus something like the customs union.\u0027In terms of who ultimately holds the pen on the papers that go to Cabinet for collective decision, it has been the Cabinet Office\u0027s Europe Unit, and they have clearly been operating to a different ultimate goal to the one what we were operating to.\u0027 And Jacob Rees-Mogg - the de facto leader of the Brexiteers - launched an astonishing attack on Mrs May.He said the Prime Minister had acted in an \u0027untrusting way\u0027 by flouting her previous red lines on leaving the EU.  He accused Mrs May of being so \u0027oddly secretive\u0027 in her \u0027headlong retreat that even key Secretaries of State didn\u0027t know\u0027.He told The Sunday Express:  \u0027She always wanted a soft Brexit. The Chequers U-turn, the failure of the Mansion House test and abandonment of \u0027Brexit means Brexit\u0027 has broken trust. \u0027It would have been more straightforward to admit that no real Brexit was the intention all along rather than trying to gull Brexiteers. Perhaps we ought to have realised earlier on that a Remainer would stick with Remain.\u0027 Mr Rees-Mogg said the PM had wasted time and taxpayers\u0027 money in stringing them along before abandoning her Brexit red lines. He added: \u0027This is at best an untrusting way to behave and a more severe commentator would call it untrustworthy.\u0027              Appearing on the BBC \u0027s Andrew Marr show today, insisted that she will deliver on the hopes of the passionate Brexit voters "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/15/13/4E44506200000578-0-image-a-2_1531658874617.jpg","title":"Travellers pitch 30 caravans beauty spot JRR Tolkien used inspiration middle earth","story":"    Dozens of traveller families have angered locals after pitching up at a world famous beauty spot, that was the inspiration for Lord of the Rings          The 18th Century mill is a well known tourist destination run by Birmingham City Council and has a number of famous literary connections, most notably to JRR Tolkien          Tolkien lived just yards away and in later life said how the mill and rural surroundings inspired his writing of middle earth          Locals in Birmingham are fuming after travellers pitched up at a world famous beauty spot - which inspired JRR Tolkien\u0027s Lord Of The Rings.The grounds nearby host the annual Tolkien Weekend event that celebrates the life and works of Tolkien.But now cars, vans and caravans, many with Irish number plates, are sprawled over about three acres of the site, blotting out the silhouette of the 18th century mill.A local 38-year-old woman, who did not want to be named said: \u0027It\u0027s not only the fact they camp on this beautiful parkland, it\u0027s the fact they leave such a mess when they leave.Welcome home!

In 2016, Barclays scrapped £8 billion of Lobo loans by converting them to fixed-rate loans, at a cost of £182 million to the bank.Barclays board row over possible £61bn merger with rival...Barclays fraud case kicked out: Blow for the Serious Fraud...Share this articleThe councils’ claim form accuses the bank of ‘deceit andor fraudulent misrepresentation’ as its bankers were secretly rigging Libor, which was ‘integral’ to the rate at which Lobo loans had to be paid back.Many local authorities took out the loans as they appeared to promise lower interest rates than those offered by central government. But the loans remain highly contentious as they gave banks the power to impose new rates at certain points. Borrowers could reject the new terms, but would then be forced to repay the entire loan straight away.Barclays and the local authorities declined to comment. But Lianne Craig, a partner at law firm Hausfeld, which is representing the councils, confirmed it had issued a ‘protective claim’ in the High Court.A full claim is due to be filed in the coming months. In 2015, a parliamentary committee launched an investigation into Lobo loans.          Manchester is among the local authorities launching the action against BarclaysRob Carver, a former derivatives trader at Barclays, described the loans as ‘horrible stuff’, telling MPs: ‘I do not think anyone who fully understood it would do it.’Crippling repayment rates of 7 to 9 per cent were attached to some of the loans and are thought to have cost taxpayers tens of millions of pounds in interest a year.The 14 local authorities – Bristol, Bradford, Greater Manchester, Kirklees, Leeds, Liverpool, Newcastle, North East Lincolnshire, Nottingham, Oldham, Sheffield, South Gloucestershire, Walsall and West Yorkshire – launched the action. They are preparing to put a number to the total value of the claim if Barclays seeks to defend the action, rather than settle.The councils say the loans – entered into between 2004 and 2010 – should be rescinded with fees returned. They also want compensation for damages.On June 27, 2012, the Financial Services Authority, the precursor to the Financial Conduct Authority, fined Barclays £59.5 million over manipulation of Libor – the London interbank offered rate. Some Lobo loans were directly linked to Libor rates, and many others were influenced by it. In some cases, repayment rates rose if Libor rates fell out of a certain range.Joel Benjamin, of Debt Resistance UK, said: ‘It’s high time banks were made to pay to clean up their own mess.’"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/14/16/4E3D2B2900000578-0-image-m-5_1531583925313.jpg","title":"TANA RAMSAY explains exercise helps deal family trauma","story":"    Tana Ramsay, pictured, uses her daily run as an excuse to cry and screamThere is much for Tana Ramsay to be grateful for today.

For the last couple of years have wreaked a heavy emotional toll.There was the devastating loss of their son, the couple’s fifth child, when Tana had a miscarriage at 21 weeks. Then, last year, a bust-up between Gordon and Tana’s father, Chris Hutcheson – who used to run Gordon Ramsay Holdings – ended at the Old Bailey, with the latter jailed for six months for hacking into Gordon’s emails.Earlier it was revealed that Chris had a secret second family, with grown-up children. ‘It’s easy to put a smile on and say, “Everything is absolutely fine!” ’ says Tana.‘But when you’re running, with your music on, you can cry.

She won’t say more, but it’s evident that Chris is now very much part of the family again. Whether he and Gordon have patched up their differences is less clear.And Tana, like her father, is arguably in the best shape of her life. She runs marathons, has completed a half-ironman, and is currently training for the London Triathlon to raise money for the couple’s charity, the Gordon and Tana Ramsay Foundation, which has donated £850,000 to London’s Great Ormond Street Hospital since 2015.

You also have to have those moments where you allow yourself to feel really sad, when you’re thinking, “Why me?” We’re all going to think like that occasionally. It means we can handle it. It has drawn us together as a family.‘It’s also important to talk with the children and not just think everything is fine. Gordon’s a really big one for talking. Sometimes I just say to him “Seriously?”, and he’s like: “No, we have to talk about it.” Sometimes that’s irritating.’          The Ramsay\u0027s pictured here with Victoria Beckham, centre, are an incredibly sporty familySport runs through almost everything the Ramsay family does. The couple’s four children – Megan, 20, twins Jack and Holly, 18, and Tilly, 16 – compete variously in swimming, netball, rugby, ju-jitsu, hockey and water polo. Their schedule is frenetic: Tana shrugs at the idea that she’s a supermum, but it is impressively well-orchestrated.Jack can be dropped off at school in Dulwich, South-East London, by 6.30am, and Tilly and Holly to their school in Richmond by 7.30am, which leaves Tana time to have a run on Wimbledon Common with the dogs by 7.50am. She’s home by nine, showered and at work at her beauty salon in Battersea by 9.30am.There’s also a home gym – which the whole family uses – and gruelling three-hour cycle rides at the weekends. It’s precisely because the kids are so busy that you won’t see them falling out of nightclubs like other celebrity offspring.‘I don’t worry about the kids going off the rails because they have sport,’ she explains. ‘Yes, they’re teenagers and they’re all on Instagram doing those weird pouts. How could they not be?‘All I can do is make sure they have a healthy relationship between their body and food. Exercise is good not only to keep in shape but mentally it’s fantastic, and a great discipline for kids. Showing them we do it, and instilling that attitude in them, is so important. They’ve been studying for A-level and GCSE exams and I’ve said, “Do a couple of hours of exercise and your brains will work better.”‘I do think it’s helped them to deal with the stress.’Tana admits to following her children on the Find My Friends app, which allows users to see the location of others using GPS. It hasn’t always been reassuring.‘Jack went out after his exams,’ she says. ‘I woke up and it was 5am and he wasn’t home. I’d promised I wouldn’t call because he’s 18, so I went on the app and then saw he was at St Thomas’ Hospital so I freaked and rang him, but tried to sound relaxed. In fact, he was just getting in an Uber.’Tana has run nine marathons and Gordon has competed over a dozen. When Megan turned 18 – the minimum age to take part – she begged to be allowed to do it too. Jack and Holly competed for the first time this year, while Tilly, who has her own CBBC show, Matilda And The Ramsay Bunch, is ‘chomping at the bit’ to have her chance.GORDON, 51, naturally, has the best time (3.30) – ‘have you seen his thighs?’ – followed by Tana, a respectable 25 minutes behind. All of them except Tilly, who will be on a water polo tour, are taking part in the London Triathlon on August 4 to 5. Surely there must be competition? Tana laughs. ‘Between Jack and Gordon it can get pretty intense,’ she admits. ‘But Jack hasn’t beaten me at the marathon yet. They all make me incredibly proud, and I get very emotional.‘There’s so much pressure on them already with social media, so the more normal we keep it the easier it is as a family to just be us, and for them to have the confidence to be themselves.’Tana is clearly comfortable in her own skin, and felt no pressure to stay in shape as Gordon’s celebrity rose. They married in 1996 when he was head chef at Aubergine in Chelsea – now he has 35 restaurants across the globe and seven Michelin stars, along with TV projects in the UK and US.The couple count the Beckhams among their closest friends, so does Tana train with Victoria? ‘No, although when we’re in America we do go to Soul Cycle classes together. I’d love to get Victoria in an ironman competition.’ Tana looks mischievous. Would she do it? ‘No, I doubt it. She’d look at me like I was some kind of maniac, I imagine.’Tana obviously sees things differently – for Gordon and her, exercise is a release. The couple take long cycle rides together on Sundays, completing up to 60 miles a time over the Surrey hills as part of their triathlon training.‘We’ve always been good at spending time away from the kids, just the two of us. Finding something which helps you remember what you like in that person, after so many years of marriage, is great. Gordon might have been away all week in the US, but we’ll go out early in the morning and spend several hours on our bikes and catch up.‘For me, a mum in my 40s, it’s also about doing something just to feel good about myself. I’ve given the kids all of my attention for all of these years, so it’s time for me. I really enjoy it – it’s so social.’Food, perhaps unsurprisingly, is important in the Ramsay household but Tana insists they have ‘a good balance’. ‘I never obsessed over having perfect food for the kids at all times,’ she says. ‘I never watched over them at parties, never said, “Don’t eat this.” I didn’t want to be a helicopter mum, forever hovering over them.‘We’ll have chocolate in the fridge, but our meals are usually healthy. That’s how it should be.’They try to eat together as a family as much as possible but their conflicting schedules mean it happens ‘maybe once or twice a week’.Breakfast is ‘a slice of toast while running down the stairs’, she says. When asked if the children are talented cooks, she pauses before sniggering: ‘They do cook.’Refreshingly, too, there’s no special ‘training diet’ as she prepares for the triathlon. Tana has always run and once finished a 5km in a very good time of 19 minutes. The London Triathlon involves a 750m swim (‘longer than it sounds’, she jokes, grimly), then a 20km cycle ride followed by a 5km run.It’s for a great cause. The Gordon and Tana Ramsay Foundation, set up in 2014, has 235 competitors signed up to Team Ramsay, and money raised for Great Ormond Street has, in previous years, funded research projects and intensive-care equipment.Does she see herself doing it at 80? ‘My father has just had a hip replacement and has been on this health regime. He’s lost a stone in three weeks and ran his 90th marathon in April with three of his grandchildren and one of his sons. I’d like to aspire to that.‘At 80, I want to have energy, I want to be saying to Gordon, “Let’s go on holiday with our bikes and panniers, somewhere like Hawaii.”‘Enjoying our time after working so hard, just ambling around. That’s how I see us.’    Start in a low lunge, with one knee down and the other leg forwards. Then, engaging your core muscles, switch legs.

Around me an army of eager, Lycra-clad men and women stand in neat rows, shoulder width apart, eyes widened. Ear-bleedingly loud dance music pumps through the speakers as Heidi and Chris Powell – the stars of US hit reality show Extreme Weight Loss – take the stage to lead an exercise class that will help us reach our ‘pain threshold’ and ‘burn optimum body fat’.Someone in the crowd screams. Another cries. It’s not yet 7.30am. Welcome to the first day of the world’s biggest fitness convention: Idea World, in San Diego, southern California.Dubbed the ‘superbowl of the fitness industry’, the annual event brings together more than 200 fitness industry professionals, trainers and celebrity weight-loss gurus, alongside 14,000 exercise fanatics from all around the globe.They flock to the four-day festival to find the latest innovations and trends in workouts, equipment and technology on offer. And what debuts here quickly makes its way into gyms across the Atlantic.Justin Webb: Why I\u0027ll stick with walking my labradoodle...I can cry and scream when I\u0027m running: TANA RAMSAY explains...Share this articleThe expo has launched countless products, machines and exercises during its 36-year run, from vibrating power plates to Zumba.As a long-time exercise-avoider with minimal muscle mass, I’ve always struggled to find an exercise class I enjoy. So, as the only British journalist invited to attend this year, would I discover one I could actually bear?COULD I GET MADONNA’S BOTTOM?The exhaustive list of almost 400 classes, workouts and evening activities at Idea World is overwhelming I commit to 25 classes over a period of 48 hours.Only the most sweat-inducing make my cut.After the Powells’ Extreme Transformation Workout, an endless series of muscle-toning exercises performed for three minutes at a time, I move on to a BOSU class: exercises practised aboard a squishy rubber dome.Instructor Alison demonstrates how to ‘paddle’ with my steel bar in hand, engaging the core and glutes for ‘bums and tums’ tightening.          Over the course of 48 hours, Eve tried out 20 different work outs at the Idea World fitness convention in San Diego, CaliforniaFinding my balance on the rubber sphere is tough enough let alone extending opposite arm and legs simultaneously. Remarkably, by focusing on a spot on the wall in front of me, I’m able to complete the rest of the routine with minimal wobbling.After Tae Bo, a mixture of martial arts and aerobics, comes Booty Barre – a class especially designed to build a beautiful bottom.The workout – whose fans include Madonna – draws on the principles of Pilates and ballet.As a regular Pilates goer, I was fairly confident I’d get through the hour with ease, but after five minutes of thrusting with a medicine ball between my legs – on tiptoes – I realise this isn’t the case.By the end of the class, my thighs are like jelly and I’m starving hungry. It’s 10am.BOOT CAMP, BOXING... AND BATTLE ROPESI decide to get the worst out the way before lunchtime: army boot camp.Developed by a former US sergeant, this is a 90-minute sweatathon involving jumping squats, lunges and sprints interspersed with military-style marches. Angry orders from Sergeant Ken Weichart (aka Sgt Ken) to ‘Embrace The Pain!’ keep me moving despite the agony but after 50 rapid squats and the sergeant’s demands to ‘get lower’, I succumb to the pain and embarrassingly stumble mid-rep. ‘No quitters here!’ Ken loudly reminds me.I manage a 30-minute lunch break before leaping straight into the on-site boxing ring for a couple of rounds with a bullish, bald-headed former champ.          This odd-looking device is supposed to provide a work out for bums and tumsTo my surprise, I can throw a mean punch and even manage a spin, kick and smack move.Then I move across to Battle Ropes. After 15 minutes of tutorial, we experiment with all 30 ways a 55 lb, 50ft rope can be moved about for a vigorous full-body workout.It’s not all about waving it with the hands – try jumping between two ropes for a quick warm-up, or lifting the ropes in between press-ups to work the core and arms. At the end of the class, I unashamedly collapse on the floor into a pool of my own sweat and admit defeat. Tomorrow is another day…TORTURE... FOR KILLER ABSOn day two, I explore the 500,000 square foot exhibition hall showcasing almost 400 cutting-edge fitness gadgets and machinery.I start with a demonstration of the latest vibrating Power Plate to hit US gyms. The machine stimulates muscles with vibration, increasing muscle tone when exercising. I expect to watch my love handles wiggle off my body without moving but unfortunately, some work is required. I try step-ups and single leg balances, before moving on to planks, bridges and seated crunches – all aboard the vibrating platform. Each exercise feels ten times more intense than I’d ever experienced before, with ripples of pain shooting through my entire body.Converts claim that those ten minutes of excruciating torture are the fastest route to killer abs.Other highlights of the exhibition include a 6ft stair-climbing machine which, on maximum resistance, feels five times harder than normal stairs a virtual-reality treadmill that sends me running through the French countryside and a cycling machine called Real Ryder which tilts 22 degrees and emits stimulating vibrations. I disembark the bike, feeling two stone lighter, and seek out an upper-body exercise to give my legs some well-earned rest.

Lawyers for the claimants will on Monday argue in a preliminary hearing that they suffered age and sex discrimination, should have been fully consulted and are entitled to retrospective holiday pay. The educators welcome school tours and members of the public, giving talks, workshops and information about the history of the institution and the works of art on display.James Heard, the longest-serving claimant who worked there for 45 years, said: “We are standing up for fair treatment for staff in the arts, and to protect the teaching expertise at the heart of our museums. Our national galleries are something the UK is extremely proud of and it is vital that the educators who hold the collective knowledge of these places are properly protected.”Most recent test cases on employment status have related to private sector firms such as Uber, Deliveroo and Pimlico Plumbers. The National Gallery, the educators say, demonstrates that exploitation also exists in the state sector.The National Gallery said: “It is our understanding that the claims have arisen out of the Gallery’s wish to change from offering ad hoc work to offering more secure employment, with additional pension and worker benefits. This change reflects the Gallery’s strategy to develop our programmes to increasingly reach new audiences and make the most of digital technology to widen our engagement.”While insisting they were freelancers, the gallery paid them through a taxed PAYE system, gave them official’s badges, trained them, subjected them to regular appraisals, provided offices and access to the staff canteen, according to the claimants. In effect, it is alleged, they were employees.Of the 27, most have been dismissed. Seven are now working, under protest, on less well-paid staff or casual contracts. Their treatment is said to be typical of many in the underfunded museum and galleries sector.The claimants have set up a page on the crowdfunding website CrowdJustice to raise funds for their legal claim. Jo Lewis, who has worked for the National Gallery for 16 years, said: “We are asking for our longstanding contribution to the National Gallery to be recognised and valued. We are asserting our rights as employees, and at a minimum as ‘workers’.” Marie-Thérèse Ross, a claimant who worked for the National Gallery for 22 years, said: “We love the gallery and recognise its importance in artistic and cultural education. However, despite our attempts to raise our concerns with the gallery, we as a group have not been given the rights to which we believe we are entitled.” Marie van der Zyl, a solicitor at the law firm Gordon Dadds LLP which is representing them, said: “Iniduals working in the arts are in need of certainty surrounding their employment rights and it’s essential to ensure they are categorised correctly.” The National Gallery also stated: “The entire group were consulted for their views together and inidually over the change for a period of three months between October 2017 and January 2018. These jobs were offered to all of our existing freelance service providers last year. We still have vacancies which are available, although unfortunately not all of the group have expressed an interest in these.“The Gallery is not yet in receipt of the details of each complaint, but believes that we have acted both lawfully and fairly in changing our service provision to one of secure employment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15baceb4a59c93747190d05f01c0e56021d2a9d9/0_0_4632_2780/master/4632.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=934bd881c812856f85225370e075ff35","title":"brexit eu uk institutions britain","story":"Before British voters went to the polls in June 2016, the institutions of the European Union were dismissed as “sclerotic, over-centralised and undemocratic”. Those same EU institutions are now portrayed as running rings around British negotiators. Here we find another – among many – of Brexit’s paradoxes.This state of affairs stems from popular misunderstanding in the UK, as well as elsewhere, of how EU institutions actually work. It also reflects the fact that Brexit is a challenge to which EU institutions are better suited than their British counterparts. The loss of two senior ministers just days after the cabinet agreed on a new negotiating position makes British political institutions’ deficiencies all too clear.Theresa May’s decision to put David Davis in charge of a new Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) in July 2016 helped to contain cabinet tensions in the immediate aftermath of the referendum. But it also weakened the UK’s negotiating position. Creating new government departments is not something that Whitehall tends to do well and DExEU has struggled to recruit and retain suitably qualified staff. It has had two permanent secretaries in two years.Davis styled himself as a happy warrior in leading the British negotiating team. But his working relationship with the prime minister and EU counterparts was strained. He visited Dublin just once in his role as Brexit secretary. Remarkably, Davis spent just four hours in talks with the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, in the first half of 2018. At home, rumours that Davis might resign surfaced regularly, until he finally quit. His departure, and that of foreign secretary Boris Johnson a day later, could yet generate sufficient momentum to topple the prime minister.Johnson knows better than most British politicians how EU institutions work. His father was once an official at the European commission and even wrote a novel (which became a film) about a fictionalised commissioner. Johnson Jr’s understanding of the UK’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) turned out to be less assured. His tenure as foreign secretary was marked by multiple gaffes on the international stage and a bit part on the European one. In spite of its vast experience in EU matters, the FCO has been sidelined in Brexit negotiations by DExEU and Downing Street. So much so, in fact, that Davis publicly questioned why Johnson had resigned over the cabinet’s new negotiating position when Brexit wasn’t “central” to the foreign secretary’s job.EU institutions are far from perfect. They can appear remote and rigid. They have an infuriating habit of delaying crucial decisions until confronted with a sense of impending doom. And yet, by the standards of international diplomacy, the EU is both efficient and democratic. No other international organisation has a democratically elected parliament nor one that carries more weight than many national legislatures. None wields the same influence that the EU does at home or abroad with such clear rules for doing so and across such a wide range of policies.Considered by some to be a controversial choice, Barnier proved to be a smart one. Having gained a good understanding of the Northern Ireland peace process during his tenure as European commissioner for regional policy, the EU’s chief negotiator was quick to grasp the economic and political repercussions of establishing a hard border on the island of Ireland. He has worked closely with the Irish government to address its concerns. Barnier has always made clear that there can be no backsliding on a backstop to prevent border checks between Ireland and Northern Ireland after Brexit.The British government has also found it difficult to gain traction in the EU’s most powerful institution: the European council. This difficulty is not simply a matter of chemistry (or lack thereof) between May and other EU leaders. It reflects the fact that the UK, as soon as it voted to leave the EU, was excluded from the European council’s deliberative working methods. Meeting informally among themselves since 2016, the heads of state or government of the EU27 (that is: all EU member states except the UK) have spoken with one voice on Brexit. The European council, meanwhile, has severely restricted the time devoted to Brexit, making it difficult for May to bypass formal talks between her government and the European commission.EU institutions’ “transformation” from bloated bureaucracy to a lean, mean negotiation machine may be an irony, but it is a bitter one – for three reasons.First, it provides further evidence of how the UK’s vote to leave the EU was premised, in part, on a popular misunderstanding of how the EU works.Second, the UK’s struggles to engage with withdrawal negotiations may strengthen the EU’s negotiating hand. But they will leave both sides worse off if a hard Brexit ensues.Third, the unity of purpose that EU institutions have shown over Brexit is lacking on other pressing policy challenges, most notably over migration, eurozone reform and democratic backsliding in Poland and Hungary. EU institutions may be having a good Brexit, but this gives Europe no grounds for complacency.A version of this piece was originally published on LSE Brexit• Dermot Hodson is reader in political economy at Birkbeck College.

Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn agree on Brexit. They are both realists. They know Britain needs a customs union with the EU. Perhaps they should go off to a Welsh mountain together, and do a TrumpPutin? Either way, it is time for parliament to offer united support to Britain’s negotiators in Brussels, as it did to the leave decision on article 50.On Sunday, May’s former education secretary, Justine Greening, added to her misery by calling her Chequers negotiating compromise a fudge. All compromises are that. In truth Chequers was a tactical way-station to the inevitable: a customs union. It was not ideal, but it was progress, and anything else is fantasy. Greening complains May’s union would leave Britain with “no say on shaping” EU trade rules. But that is what leave meant. In reality, Norway, the US, even China, have plenty of say on trade rules with the EU where it affects them. Trade on goods with the EU is a trivial aspect of Brexit.Greening, a desperate remainer, joined calls for a second referendum on Brexit, though on the BBC’s Today programme she confused a referendum on “the Chequers deal”, which she calls unworkable, with a referendum on “the final negotiated deal”, which is as yet unknown. The idea of asking the electorate its opinion during a negotiation is absurd. The constitutional position is clear. The vote was “to leave the EU”. It is for parliament and those negotiating on its behalf to decide how.According to Greening, parliament is in stalemate over Brexit, yet there is wide parliamentary support for customs union. The jam is party political. This week promises more chaos over amendments to the Brexit bill, but out of it must come a “coalition of sanity” in favour of customs union. Britain’s negotiators in Brussels cannot go on talking when the other side knows they have a ided political community behind them.The reality is that the argument over a customs union is a distraction, largely because it has allowed the hard Brexiters to talk about “making our own trade deals”, when this is pie in the sky. Every poll of leave voters shows them uninterested in trade barriers with Europe. What they wanted, and still want, is a degree of immigration control. This wholly separate issue is hotly debated across Europe at present, and can at least be put on hold. When this process is over and Britain has embarked on a transitional period of leaving the EU, it might indeed be sensible, as in 1975, to heal the bruised body politic with a second referendum. The mind boggles at the consequence of it being lost. More plausible would be for parliament to agree to seek a fresh electoral mandate for the leadership of post-Brexit Britain. Then I suspect we shall wonder what all the fuss was about."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e3f602dffee4cec2fc33f8c49842bbe0787f81b/0_167_5023_3014/master/5023.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14077ef3cab8d87897978aac090e6788","title":"pedallers pilgrimage britains best cycling routes","story":"Wild Cycling author Chris Sidwells shares nine of his favourite rides – from the rugged west Highlands of Scotland to the green and pleasant loops of the home counties  These rides are my choices based on a wide variety of cycling experiences. Don’t consider the routes prescriptive – they are merely an introduction to the possibilities for cycling in different parts of the UK. Use them as a basis for your own exploration of nine parts of the country, each offering a unique day’s cycling.Full English: the Chiltern Hills, BuckinghamshireDistance: 37 milesDifficulty: 610Start and finish: Princes RisboroughNearest station: Princes Risborough“England’s green and pleasant land” perfectly describes the Chilterns. Broad-leaf woods overhang deep seductive lanes that wriggle around and over these chalky hills. Red kites rule the sky, and cricket is played on village greens. The Chilterns are commuter country now, but still charming, and still very English.Head for Chinnor on the north-west edge of the hills, then ride towards them to pick up a cycle-way going south-west to Watlingon, where you leave the trail. Climb Watlington Hill, then go through Christmas Common and Turville Heath take a pitstop at the Barn cafe at Turville Heath Farm, which is excellent. Continue to Marlow, then head north-west along the B482, leaving at Stokenchurch, and go north through the lanes to Princes Risborough.The most unexpected: Dengie Peninsula, EssexDistance: 24 milesDifficulty: 410 (810 if it’s windy)Start and finish: Burnham-on-CrouchNearest station: Burnham-on-CrouchSqueezed between two rivers, just 24 crow-flying miles from the centre of London, there’s a time capsule called the Dengie Peninsula. For a basic loop, follow the B1021 north towards Bradwell, go left after Tillingham through Maylandsea and Latchington, then follow the B1010 back to Burnham-on-Crouch. You ride through rosy brick and painted clapboard villages, past a patchwork quilt of fields. There are little loops you could add, such as visiting Dengie Marshes where you might glimpse a rare hen harrier. It’s so quiet, so peaceful, it’s like riding through the 1950s. Distance: 45 milesDifficulty: 810Start and Finish: BodminNearest station: Bodmin Parkway A ride of stunning sea views with a taste of wild moorland. Follow the Camel Trail from Bodmin to Wadebridge, leaving at the old bridge for Port Isaac, a beautiful Cornish fishing village and location for TV’s Doc Martin.  Continue north on the clifftop road, then join the B-road to Delabole, where you turn left and descend to Trebarwith Strand and its gorgeous beach. Continue north through Tintagel, for an unmissable mid-ride snack at Pengenna Pasties. Then it’s on to Boscastle, where you head inland through Camelford to St Tudy. Go left just outside St Tudy, to experience Bodmin Moor and its villages, before picking up the Camel Trail back to Bodmin. Best urban ride: the Taff Trail, CardiffDistance: 32 milesDifficulty: 510Start and finish: Cardiff BayNearest station: Cardiff Central “We’ve had it done up,” the Welsh comedian Rhod Gilbert says when describing Cardiff. And it has been done up, especially the waterfront of Cardiff Bay, where this ride starts. It’s a glorious place to pootle around on a bike. There are plenty of cafes to choose from – but save them for later, when you get back.  The Taff Trail mixes cycle-ways with quiet roads and is well signposted. This ride is 32 miles there and back to Pontypridd, but you can go on to Abercynon in the Rhondda or even do the whole 55-mile-long Taff Trail and reach the Brecon Beacons. The cycle-way sections are ideal for family rides.Best rite of passage ride: the Strines, SheffieldDistance: 22 milesDifficulty: 810Start and finish: LangsettNearest station: Penistone The Strines is 11 miles of unclassified road on the eastern edge of the Peak District, running from Langsett on the A616 to Moscar Fields on the A57. It’s brutal the road plunges into and out of three steep-sided valleys, with plenty of undulations and exposed moorland in between. Head south from Langsett, keeping right at all junctions, to the A57. Turn around and ride back. The Strines both ways is a local rite of passage, and the hills form part of many local training rides. There are six big climbs if you go both ways, ranging between a third and a half a mile long. Oh, and there’s the Bank View cafe in Langsett. It’s very special. Best cafe ride: Selby, West YorkshireDistance: 24 milesDifficulty: 510Start and finish: SelbyNearest station: Selby A pleasant ride through quiet lanes with a cafe stop about halfway. Start at Selby Abbey (fact: the Rt Rev Dr John Thompson is actually known as the Biking Bishop of Selby), find the B1223 and go north then west to Sherburn in Elmet. Elmet was an ancient British kingdom covering much of what is now West Yorkshire. From Sherburn go south to Hillam then Birkin for the cafe, the Birkin Fisheries Tea Room, which stands in its own grounds – there’s a lake, the food is delicious and the service always smiling. Once re-fuelled, head east to West Haddlesey, then north to Gateforth and on, north-east, to Selby.  Distance: 35 milesDifficulty: 910Start and finish: UlphaNearest station: Broughton in Furness Two of the steepest road climbs in the UK – plus others, long and short – give this ride a total altitude gain of 1,800 metres. The first seven and a half miles from Ulpha to Cockley Beck has only one climb, then you are at the foot of Wrynose heading east with the pass before you. Engage your lowest gear and haul yourself over – there’s no way of finessing it.  Descend to Little Langdale, climb over to Great Langdale. Go right in Elterwater, right at the next junction for Wrynose, then clamber over Hardknott Pass. Continue to Eskdale Green and turn left for the long slog over Birker Fell and back to Ulpha. This ride hurts – but the satisfaction of doing it lasts a lot longer than the pain it causes.The quietest: the Cheviot Hills, NorthumberlandDistance: 47 milesDifficulty: 710Start and finish: RothburyNearest station: Alnmouth (for a regular service) Rothbury is a country town like country towns used to be – gentle and homely, where people enquire about a person’s health and actually want to know the answer. The ride is out and back, mostly uphill out and downhill coming back, tracing the River Coquet almost to its source.  Follow the B6341 west from Rothbury. Take the first right after Hepple then keep left all the way to the end of the road, where if you stop for a moment you will probably hear no other evidence of human life but the sound of your own breath. Refuelling at the Barrowburn Tea Room near the turnaround point is highly recommended.The wildest: Ardgour and Moidart, west HighlandsDistance: 81 milesDifficulty: 810Start and finish: Fort WilliamNearest station: Fort William I saved the best till last. Any ride with a ferry crossing starts ticking wild boxes for me, but this gets a lot wilder. It’s mostly on main roads, but they will be the quietest main roads you’ll ever ride. The busiest, the A82, is first, going south-west from Fort William to the Corran Ferry Terminal. Marvel at the mountains as you cross Loch Linnhe. Then it’s on the A861 west through glens, alongside salty sea lochs, over the tip toes of mountains, around the Sound of Arisaig, where the Isles of Rum, Eigg and Muck are grey-green jewels in a sea setting. Finally you’ll head back to Fort William, and in fine weather the whole of Ben Nevis can be seen. Ready to hit the road? Why not make it count?

But if you had to guess any of them, including the forthcoming Mission: Impossible – Fallout, you could safely say either: “Tom Cruise goes rogue”, “Tom Cruise goes after someone who’s gone rogue”, or possibly “Who cares? Remember those awesome stunts!”And, basically, you’d be right. The previous instalment featured all three: it had a secret spy project that had gone rogue. To infiltrate it, Cruise’s Ethan Hunt had to go even roguer (and hang on to the outside of a plane). In case you’d forgotten, it was called Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, although that could be the title for any of them, and many other movies besides.Jason Bourne was never knowingly un-rogue. Daniel Craig’s James Bond has gone varying degrees of rogue in pretty much every movie (Quantum of Solace in particular), as have many Bonds before him. Jennifer Lawrence’s Red Sparrow was a Russian spy who went off-message. Felicity Jones defied orders and saved the rebellion in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story Captain America had similar ideas and took half of the Avengers with him. Vigilantes such as Batman have permanent rogue status. Even Vin Diesel turned on his Fast and Furious buddies. Why can’t anyone just stick to the programme?You could read Tom Cruise’s persistent rogueism as a coded bid to break free from his Scientological shackles but, in the wider sense, it’s now accepted in the movies that rules and orders are the preserve of villains and wusses. The real heroes are those who go against the herd.In the real world, however, it doesn’t usually work out like that. When government operatives go rogue in real life, they are more likely to be persecuted (eg Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning). Then again, look at Donald Trump. Going rogue – defying the establishment, the elites, the Deep State, the mainstream media – is what populist politics purports to be all about. Trump trailblazer Sarah Palin even called her memoir: Going Rogue: An American Story. It might be a stretch to blame Cruise for Trump, but Cruise has at least highlighted how meaningless a term “going rogue” has become. It can denote courageous sacrifice or dangerous recklessness. Looking at the state of the planet, perhaps we could do with a bit less going rogue and a bit more, you know, agreeing on some rules and sticking to them. Trouble is, that sounds like the most boring movie ever. If only there was a franchise-friendly action hero who could make “not going rogue” into a really exciting movie. That just might be Mission: Impossible.

On a stormy, slightly wild afternoon in Moscow France became world champions for the second time, providing a bookend to one victorious era and offering a seductive hint of another to come.It seemed fitting that victory here was never really in doubt. This despite the attentions of a manically committed Croatia who seemed to be charging after something that just kept moving away, engine purring, geared to a higher rate of frequency.It seemed fitting, too, that the trophy should be handed over in fierce, warm Moscow rain at the end of a startlingly good World Cup, with every player, volunteer and head of state present soaked to the skin – all except for the great Vlad, who showed his eye for the fine details by deploying his personal golf umbrella holder.Above all it was fitting that the most talented team in Russia should take the trophy at a gallop and in a manner that poses some obvious questions.Mainly, how have they done this? And how much better can they get?There was a suggestion of an answer to both of these at the final whistle at the Luzhniki Stadium. As the referee, Néstor Pitana, blew to signify the dawning of the age of Didier an entire team of men who could probably also have won this tournament came sprinting on in formation, howling with joy and hurling themselves into the arms of their fraternal peers.The ages of the reserves running on were salutary: 21, 21, 22, 23, 25, 23.This France squad was the second youngest at the World Cup. And here is the other thing: thanks to the efforts of these academy graduates France can now claim to be the most powerful nation in world football in the past 20 years.Spain’s brilliance was more concentrated and indeed more transformative. But France have appeared in five of the last 11 World Cup and Euro finals, winning three of them. Spain have played three, won three. Germany have played three, won one.For the English it is a roll call of world champs that reads back like a gentle rebuke to any lingering dreams of major nation status: France, Germany, Spain, Italy. The World Cup has now spent the past 12 years and counting in the Schengen Zone, with one nation right at the heart of the project. From Thierry to Kylian: welcome to the age of L’Hexagone.Given their resources there will be some wistful thoughts about France’s style. At the end here there was the tremendously funny sight of Didier Deschamps being given the bumps by his players, still stern and stiff and frowning as he flew high into the air, as though considering bringing on a third defensive midfielder even at the moment of his ultimate personal ascent.Some will suggest that, even when they were scoring four here and in Kazan, this France team never really found its deepest attacking gears. What drove them on was Deschamps’s will, his obsession with shape and team combinations.In Antoine Griezmann’s set‑piece expertise, Paul Pogba’s easy craft and Kylian Mbappé’s extreme qualities of simply being like Kylian Mbappé France had enough controlled fantasy whenever their opponents showed signs of resistance. A brief word here about Mbappé. Blimey. Whoah. Cripes. Actually that is three. But you get the idea.What are we going to do with this kid? He is simply irresistible, not just a pure, brilliantly fearless talent, with a genuine sprinter’s technique that allows him to glide away in the smallest of spaces. He is also a joy to watch, a footballer of real charm and warmth, who still seems to be having the most wonderful time, playing with friends in the middle of all that epic-scale tension.Early on Mbappé played as an auxiliary right‑back. Later he shifted up a gear and became a traumatic prospect for Croatia’s left side, covering the ground like a pond-skater, barely breaking the surface tension. Finally he scored the fourth in France’s 4-2 win, lashing a right‑footed shot low into the corner with casually perfect technique. In between France were never really on top but were still somehow always on top.Croatia had more possession and more shots. France led 2-1 at half-time through an own goal and a debatable VAR penalty.At which point this team pulled itself up to its full height and simply eased away, And so for the second time in a row we have a world champion team from a prosperous western European nation whose progress through the tournament has been a matter of systems-efficiency combined with controlled attacking flair.Deschamps always had a golden ticket here, the greatest harvest of playing talent anywhere, tribute to the depth of the methods and structures of Clairefontaine and its 11 satellite academies.There are other things, too. This is a nation that has always had a wider respect for the academic and the scholarly, and where even football coaches are promoted on the basis of intellect and methods, with little trace of the “practical man” template the idea that only playing the game can confer authority.The world has moved towards the French here. Elite football is increasingly a matter of prep and method and planning, the ability of players to learn and adapt and make their own decisions.France showed these qualities right through this tournament, keeping to their structures, always seeming to have an extra gear. Even the most grating cliches often turn out to have a perverse kind of truth. And perhaps football really did come home at a World Cup won by the cradle of current European talent and by a nation that gave us this fun, thrilling, enduringly fine global beano in the first place."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab30603760437640de518fe486d69788077db869/0_112_3143_1887/master/3143.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf3839f15a70b8c8762954aa2a39470f","title":"harry kane world cup golden boot john stones","story":"• Kane: ‘There is still stuff I can improve on’• John Stones: ‘We set a lot of markers and should be proud’Harry Kane says he has now proved he can perform on every major stage in football after winning the World Cup Golden Boot. The 24-year-old scored six goals at Russia 2018, holding off competition from Belgium’s Romelu Lukaku and France’s Kylian Mbappé among others to win the trophy.Kane scored five of his six goals in the group stages, including a hat-trick in England’s 6-1 rout of Panama. He said that after the disappointment of Euro 2016, when he failed to score and the team crashed out against Iceland, it was a welcome tonic.“I said before coming into this tournament that I wanted to prove I could do it on these stages,” Kane said. “The Euros were disappointing. If anything I wanted to prove to myself I could score at this level. I’ve scored at every other level and it was important I did that.“I’m extremely proud and I’m sure I’ll look back in a few weeks’ time and take all these experiences in. It’s hard to do that now because we are still disappointed.”The award puts Kane in exalted company, with Eusébio, Garrincha and the Brazilian Ronaldo among the previous winners of the Golden Boot. He demonstrated a lethal instinct in front of goal in England’s opening game against Tunisia with two goals including a stoppage-time header which played a vital part in the team advancing from the group.Two of his goals against Panama came from penalties as the Central American side were punished for ill discipline and a third deflected in off his heel following a Ruben Loftus‑Cheek strike.Kane expressed disappointment he was not able to score in England’s final three games but was celebrating the achievement. “It’s been a fantastic campaign for me personally and the team as well,” the England captain said. “But there’s still stuff I can improve on. Obviously I can get better.“I feel like there have been games in this tournament when I could have done better but that’s all part of the learning curve.”Kane has flown home but expects Fifa to send the trophy to him. He will store it at his home in London alongside his two Premier League golden boot accolades from the 2015-16 and 2016-17 seasons. “It will go with the other two, the Premier League ones,” he said. “It’s a big achievement. Not many people get to say they’ve won a Golden Boot at a World Cup. I’m sure they’ll send it to me in a nice secure package.”Meanwhile John Stones says he will watch England’s seven games in Russia back in full. The Manchester City defender was one of England’s standout performers and was singled out for praise by Gareth Southgate after his performance against Belgium in the third-place play-off. But he was in a self-analytical mood afterwards, reflecting on his header which was saved in extra time in the semi-final against Croatia as well as allowing Mario Mandzukic to sneak in behind him for the winner.“I could have done better in a lot of things,” he said. “If that header against Croatia had been two feet closer – things like that. In any situation, making a misplaced pass, it’s difficult because if you make a misplaced pass teams are so good now they invariably punish you, so you study everything little thing.“Look at Belgium,” he said. “Their counterattacking was frightening at times. I wouldn’t like to come up against that every week. I am self-critical but I don’t want to be too negative about the whole tournament. There are ifs and buts in any field of life. We should be so positive after this experience. How we have been is the way forward for England. We will take all the good things out of it. Everyone has enjoyed it, coming up against teams who are not easy to play against.“We never underestimated anyone and knew that every team had their own qualities,” he added. “Some were defensively solid, others had a great set piece in the main we dealt with those moments. We set a lot of markers and should be really proud of that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8194765d9e92e573ae54cabaef42811ee11b681d/1_470_4303_2582/master/4303.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90bfea3a5486161bef73f73288f31fe9","title":"croatia world cup final run game neglect back home","story":"Pride at their final efforts could lead to a new national stadium but lack of grassroots investment is a more pressing concernThe defeat was hard to accept, as was missing a chance that is not likely to come again in the lifetime of these players or fans. Everyone thought Croatia deserved more but the nation still celebrated, rather than mourning. Crowds that flooded the streets of Zagreb and other cities to watch the final – among them, many foreign tourists and football fans who came just to be a part of it – stayed long into the night. The party, of course, was muted but it was still a party, not a wake.“You made us proud,” Jutarnji list proclaimed on the front cover “Thank you, heroes! You gave us everything,” said Sportske novosti. But it wasn’t just that – there was a genuine feeling of pride and gratitude among people.For days Croatia existed in a parallel dimension facilitated by football, one where history lost significance because it was clearly being remade and everything, for once, seemed possible no one was ready to give up that feeling and wake up to reality with its many constraints and low horizons. If only for a while, football left most of Croatia happy and daydreaming, a feeling almost forgotten or never fully experienced by many. It did something that the nation’s political leaders have never managed to do and never will.What they will try is to seize the opportunity to wrap themselves up in checkers and use the success for their populist agenda. A plan to build a grand national stadium has already been pulled out of someone’s bottom drawer and put on top of the pile containing promises. Croatian politicians are good at making those and the people are forgetful when it comes to fulfilling them. This time, though, they might well go ahead and do it – because they have to do something and building one structure with taxpayers’ money is easy.It is much harder to rebuild burnt bridges in domestic football and restore the people’s faith in something that has for years been dominated by criminal elements with close ties to powerful politicians. It is much harder to build order from chaos, a lesson they could try to learn from the national team – but it’s the kind of lesson that gets you to a World Cup final, so not everyone is capable of following that masterclass.When Croatia came third in the 1998 World Cup, it was still a new nation brimming with patriotic pride, forged in the bloody war for independence. The general outlook was optimistic, there was hope for the future and football played a significant part of it. In retrospect, it is clear that the nation failed to learn anything from that. It failed as a society, now sharply ided along many ideological lines. It failed as an economy, ending up as the least developed member of the European Union and with alarming emigration rates. Much has been said and written about the fact that Croatia is the second-least populous country – after Uruguay back in the day – to have reached a World Cup final, but the fact is that it has 300,000 fewer inhabitants than in 1998, according to official figures. At this rate, it could soon find itself at the bottom of that list.But it failed in terms of football as well. Much more than a flashy five-star stadium where its leaders, football and otherwise, will come to flaunt their fandom and shake hands with their colleagues from other countries, it needs investment in infrastructure, education and grassroots. It needs pitches and coaches across the country and a plan on how to harness its evidently extraordinary deep pool of talent. It needs to ensure that the Modrics and Lovrens of tomorrow can come through without first having to sell their soul to the likes of Zdravko Mamic. It needs to create an atmosphere in which players, coaches, journalists or anyone else won’t be afraid they’ll jeopardise their status – or more – if they speak up about all the things that are wrong in the domestic game.Every single player in this squad has a difficult background story to tell. They’ve been refugees of war, victims of agents and various other people trying to take advantage of them some had been intentionally marginalised by their clubs or forced to leave before they were ready in order to save their careers. Some have been compromised through their cooperation with villains and crooks and will have to bear consequences for that despite their success some have been judged for not stepping up and breaking their silence, and rightly so.But still they came out on top and made the World Cup final solely on their own merits. They succeeded despite, and not because of, everything that has been going on around them since the start of their careers.On the global stage, where there are no shortcuts, they taught Croatia the value of hard work, dedication and togetherness. By coming second in the world, they gave themselves – and Croatia – a second chance, not just in football. They allowed the people to shoot for the moon once again for that, we should all be grateful."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6cadadb95f4ada298269fb4109dac11ac7d3774/0_0_2736_1642/master/2736.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7276fa8e13e5346a7d0cc7f27102f389","title":"gareth bale real madrid cristiano ronaldo julen lopetegui manchester united","story":"Gareth Bale is set to be handed the challenge of replacing Cristiano Ronaldo as Real Madrid’s driving force when he meets his new coach, Julen Lopetegui, for talks in the next two weeks.The move will disappoint José Mourinho as Bale is a long-term target of the Manchester United manager. Mourinho is leading the club’s pre-season tour of the US, the squad having flown to Los Angeles on Sunday.Bale is yet to discuss his future with Lopetegui, having been on holiday before Real’s pre-season training started on Monday. The 29-year-old will seek assurances that he will become a starter again, having spent much of last season on the bench under Zinedine Zidane.This led to the Welshman suggesting he might leave the club following a match-winning substitute appearance in the Champions League final win against Liverpool in May. It is understood, though, that Bale believes he will be told Lopetegui views him as the successor to Ronaldo, who was sold to Juventus for €100m (£88.3m) this month. If so, Bale will remain at a club he joined in summer 2013 for a then world record fee of £85.3m.Bale entered the Champions League final on 61 minutes with the score at 1-1. Within three minutes he scored the first of two decisive goals, a spectacular overhead kick. Yet after the match he voiced frustration at not starting, alerting United and other suitors to his potential availability.Alexis Sánchez was not in the United squad that flew to LA, with confusion surrounding his absence. The forward was pictured in training on Wednesday at United’s Carrington base in an Instagram post by Ander Herrera and as Chile did not participate in the World Cup Sánchez was expected to be in Mourinho’s party.Daley Blind also did not fly with United, though this is because of his expected move to Ajax.

There were loads of brilliant photos from the game yesterday, but this one, by our own Tom Jenkins, might be my favourite. Abhinav Dutta has a suggestion for moment of the tournament: “In keeping with my tendency to pick out moments of no actual significance, I would choose a brief sequence of high grade Modric. Boxed deep into the right flank of England’s half, swarmed by English players of all stripes, he flitted about with the nonchalance that accompanies his subtle genius. Pass-move-pass, shifting at all times the space to be worked in before the wide acres of the rest of the field opened up. I would like to believe that Perisic’s fizzing low shot against the post came from this sequence of passes but that is perhaps me trying to add value to what was otherwise a mundane instance of Modric’s calibre.”“Easily the best tournament of my lifetime (born 1991),” writes Gabriel Szatan, in London. “There was no single stunning watercooler moment, à la Zidane’s headbutt, Beckham’s red mist or Suarez’s gnashers and no one team the world fell in love with, à la Brazil 2002. But instead, we were treated to an unceasing barrage of giant killings, dizzying last-ditch twists \u0026amp turns, dozens of worldies from outside the box, and a blessed lack of bitterness and jingoism back home (whatever Modric might have inferred).“Plus, how nice to have a whole month where day to day international relations in the news brings out feelings of joy, not despondence.”And the final World Cup Football Daily: Barry, Max, Paolo, Phillipe, Barney and all your other podcast pals discuss the tournament’s denouement...A fitting end to the World Cup for France, by Martha Kelner and Shaun Walker...The player ratings: feel free to loudly tell Marcus Christenson how incorrect and biased he is...David Hytner on a remarkable effort from Croatia, who just couldn’t quite manage to beat France...Here’s Daniel Taylor’s match report from the Luzhniki...Let’s have a quick reminder of our pieces from the final.

And they were brilliant. They didn’t put me under pressure to try to achieve a certain performance, or a certain outcome, but they were keen that we showed signs of progress and improvement.“So the defeats have been hugely important for our development as well. We finished in the top four, deservedly in this tournament, helped by the draw. But we’re not a top-four team yet, and we know that.”Inquest time! Did your team exceed expectations or were they on an unexpected early flight home? What is the reason for your team’s success this summer? And where do you think it went wrong for them? Share your thoughts on the last four weeks with us. This is an interesting read, from the ’s readers editor, Paul Chadwick. (Warning: contains a degree of trumpet blowing.)“It was striking how the editorial and technical teams deployed the technologies that today allow genuinely international events like World Cup finals to be experienced by huge, disparate yet interacting audiences. All 64 games were live blogged. The live coverage of the England win over Colombia was viewed – mostly on phones – more than 3.1m times, and England’s semi-final loss to Croatia more than 3.7m. The guide to all 736 players had more than 2m views. Sixteen other World Cup items were viewed more than 1 million times each.”Macron’s celebration makes it onto the front page of the Times today.Meanwhile, France’s latest poster boy graces other papers, including the ’s back page.World Cup time isn’t just about digging out old DVDs of every single World Cup goal ever scored despite the often treacherous path trodden by football filmmakers there is plenty out there to enjoy.

It’s a tough one to make a case against.Mbappé got an 8 in the ’s player ratings with an “outstanding” note to boot. But he wasn’t France’s best player on the night. We’re not supposed to do clickbait, but you’ll never guess who got a 9 (you will). Find out here!No surprises that Mbappé was named the young player of the tournament. “In Antoine Griezmann’s set‑piece expertise, Paul Pogba’s easy craft and Kylian Mbappé’s extreme qualities of simply being like Kylian Mbappé France had enough controlled fantasy whenever their opponents showed signs of resistance.

The 32-year-old Marseille defender did not play a single minute of the campaign in Russia, but can still call himself a world champion. Not a bad way to go out. Here’s Martha Kelner and Shaun Walker with their take on last night, including the revelation that the World Cup trophy arrived at the stadium in its new Louis Vuitton travel case.“The sky above was dark grey with flashes of thunder as the rain-, sweat- and euphoria-soaked French team lifted the trophy during a chaotic presentation ceremony. The winners’ medals were presented by Putin shielded by a black umbrella as an almighty downpour pierced a sticky, humid afternoon in the Russian capital. Macron remained uncovered and was wringing out his navy blue suit jacket on the pitch afterwards.”The big news, though, is that with Antoine Griezmann, Kylian Mbappé and Mario Mandzukic all managing to score just one each (in the right net) on the night, the Golden Boot belongs to Harry Kane. He had already landed in Birmingham by the time the final whistle tooted in Moscow though, so he’s going to have to rely on Почта России (the Russian postal system) to get his gong to him in London.France’s victory has prompted comparisons to 1998, when Aimeé Jacquet guided his side, which contained Didier Deschamps, to the summit of the world. Those comparisons might have been in the mind of L’Equipe’s editor too, judging by the headline in this morning’s paper.World Cup finals, like all games really, can be won by fine margins. The smallest of details. How fine were those margins in the final? I’d contest pretty fine, given the VAR decision that awarded Antoine Griezmann the chance to score from the spot came with the game delicately poised at 1-1. Who knows which direction the game would have gone if the referee, Néstor Pitana, had opted not to penalise Ivan Perisic for his dangling arm. As David Hytner writes from the Luzhniki Stadium:“The slow-motion replays looked bad for Perisic and it became clear what kind of a conclusion Pitana would reach. Griezmann scored the penalty and Croatia could smoulder with injustice. It was a borderline decision and, this time, there would be no way back for Zlatko Dalic and his band of fighters.”From the ecstasy of the French, to the agony of the Croatians. How are they bearing up after having been so close to glory, yet in the end so far? Well, according to Una Hajdari in Zagreb, not too bad. “I feel great. We still made history, even thought we did not become champions,” said one fan, while another said: “We are sad, but second place is still a big deal for Croatia. We’ll all forget about it all once they come home tomorrow.”Meanwhile, in Birmingham....And the Croatian president, Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic, has received no small amount of praise for her role in Russia during the tournament. This tweet rather sums it up nicely. They say politics and football shouldn’t mix, but like it or not, the two are inextricably linked. Putting aside any cynicism for a moment, at least Emmanuel Macron appears to be a genuine fan of Les Blues. So, it’s becoming apparent who last night’s pitch invaders were: Pussy Riot. Three women and one man were dragged away (with help from Dejan Lovren), while Kylian Mbappé opted to high-five one of the women rather than manhandle her off the pitch. “The citizens in question were taken to the local police station,” the Moscow branch of the Russian Interior Ministry said. Other than that statement, there is no further word from the police as yet. That wasn’t the only unruly French behaviour of the night, though, not by any stretch. The French players allowed themselves a moment of public inhibition when they gatecrashed Didier Deschamps’ post-match press conference to mount a desk – with the elan of a England fan clambering up a double decker bus – and spray champagne all about the place, no doubt to the delight of the congregated journalists with their cheap, waterproof equipment. Great scenes on the last night as one million fans filled Champs-Élysées to celebrate their team’s victory. This, from Angelique Chrisafis in Paris, has the full story, although it’s not clear whether the “tears” in fans’ eyes was due to the emotion of the night, or indeed the tear gas fired off by French police in response to having projectiles hurled at them.As we ease ourselves in, allow Max Rushden and guests to fill your ears with their thoughts on the final, another penalty, another controversial VAR incident, the tournament’s highs and lows and “players taking shots to the conkers”.So there we have it. Vive la France! France are world champions once more, and who can say they don’t deserve to be so? Well, about four million Croatians for a start – you can understand that – but Didier Deschamps’ side has played some terrific football over the past four weeks, boasted one of the tournament’s most exciting breakout stars and, crucially, not lost a single game while posting six wins, including victories over heavyweight nations such as Uruguay, Belgium,Naturally, France is a country losing its collective merde over the result at the Luzhniki Stadium, a theme we’ll focus on first up today, with reports of mad celebrations from Paris to Perpignan and beyond, some of which involve the police, sadly.But it’s not just French who are celebrating today – it is also a day on which jaded  livebloggers can finally rejoice the end of the tournament, as this is indeed the last daily World Cup blog for four years. Get your fill while you can. It also means that it’s a pretty good opportunity to reflect of what a wonderful tournament this has been, so please do feel free to get in touch on email (mike.hytner@the) or Twitter (@mike_hytner) or below the line throughout the course of the dayeveningwhatever it is where you are."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94ad2eeef6e5c822ddcfc6c35959ca073645c4fb/0_3139_4777_2864/master/4777.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89a91b405d66fefb78ad3e0162d8ad57","title":"nigel slater summer fruit and dairy recipes","story":"Gooseberry cheesecake, ricotta cream and cherry compote, peach and honey cake – Nigel Slater’s sun-filled fruit and dairy puddingsThere comes a point in deepest summer when every meal seems to end with the marriage of fruit and some sort of dairy produce. Ripe cherries with ricotta, gooseberries with cream cheese, or perhaps a peach cake with a dish of lightly whipped cream. I also like to start the day with yogurt, muesli and strawberries that have been marinated with orange and a drop of sweet-sour balsamic vinegar. This year has been particularly fine for soft fruit, so here are some of my favourites from this long summer.Gooseberries have a natural affinity with dairy produce, which is why they produce what is probably the ultimate fruit fool. Their characteristic sharpness marries neatly with cream cheese, too, hence their addition to this summer cheesecake. The juice that collects from the cooked fruit should be thoroughly chilled and served over the finished cake.Serves 8For the gooseberriesgooseberries 600gcaster sugar 2 tbspwater 3tbspFor the crustsweet oat biscuits 300gbutter 90gFor the cheesecake cream cheese 300gcaster sugar 150gegg 1 egg yolks 2mascarpone 125gvanilla extractYou will need a 24cm square cake tin, lined with baking parchment.Top and tail the gooseberries, place in a non-reactive saucepan with the sugar and water, then bring them to the boil. As the berries begin to burst, remove from the heat. Place a sieve over a deep jug, pour in the cooked fruit and let it drain, the juice collecting in the jug underneath.Crush the biscuits to fine crumbs in a food processor or with a rolling pin. Melt the butter, add the crumbs then mix thoroughly. Press them down into the lined cake tin, then refrigerate for 30 minutes.Spoon the drained gooseberries over the biscuit crust. Put the juice in the fridge to chill. Set the oven at 175Cgas mark 3. In a food mixer fitted with a paddle beater, mix together the cream cheese, caster sugar, egg and yolks, and mascarpone, then add a teaspoon or so of vanilla extract. When all is thoroughly mixed, spoon into the lined tin, smooth the surface level, then bake for 35-40 minutes, until the cake is almost set in the middle. The centre should wobble slightly when lightly shaken.Remove the cake from the oven and leave to cool, then place in the refrigerator and chill for a good four or five hours. It needs this time in which to set properly. Remove from the tin and slice into 8 equal bars. Serve with the gooseberry syrup. Decorate as you wish.In deepest summer I like to make a rose-scented sugar for pancakes, scattering the pale pink sugar over them with a squeeze of lemon. Equally delicious is a homemade raspberry preserve, served warm from the stove.

Stir in the sugar.Make a well in the centre then pour in the egg and egg yolk, lightly beaten, and the milk. Bring the flour slowly in to the middle, beating lightly to get a smooth batter. Set aside for half an hour.Put the raspberries in a deep saucepan and add the sugar. Finely grate the zest from the lemon, squeeze its juice and add both to the pan. Bring to the boil and continue boiling for five minutes. Remove from the heat, removing any froth from the surface, then set aside.Brush a 20-22cm non-stick frying pan or crepe pan with a little melted butter. When the butter starts to sizzle, give the batter a quick stir, then pour or ladle in enough to give a wafer-thin layer. Tip the pan around so the batter covers the bottom. Let it cook for a minute, then run a palette knife around the edge to loosen it. Slide the palette knife underneath, then flip the pancake over quickly and smoothly. Leave to cook for a minute or two then slide out on to a plate.Continue with the rest of the mixture. You should make about 6-8 pancakes. Serve the pancakes with thick cream and the raspberry preserve.You can make a scented sugar to scatter over the pancakes if you prefer. Process a large red garden rose (not one from a shop) with 3 tablespoons of sugar in a food processor. When the sugar is pink, scatter over the pancakes with a squeeze of lemon.I like to make cherry compote just before serving, so the steaming fruit contrasts with the cool, milky ricotta cream.Serves 4ricotta 250gmascarpone 250gorange 1 medium-sized vanilla extract ½-1 tsporange blossom water 1 tspicing sugar to tasteFor the compoteblackcurrants 75gcherries 250gcaster sugar 1 tbspwater 6 tbspPut the ricotta and mascarpone into a mixing bowl. Finely grate the zest from the orange and stir it in, together with the vanilla extract and orange blossom water to taste.Line a small sieve or colander with a piece of clean muslin (a J-cloth will do) and spoon the ricotta cream into it. Suspend the sieve over a bowl so there is room for any whey to run off, then cover the surface with a piece of clingfilm, a small, heavy plate and a weight, and refrigerate for at least four hours.Make the compote. Top and tail the blackcurrants and put them in a non-reactive saucepan. Stone the cherries, add them to the pan with the sugar and water, and bring to the boil. Lower the heat and let the compote bubble gentle for a few minutes until the berries have burst and the syrup is deep purple. Remove and set aside.To serve, remove the plate and clingfilm from the ricotta cream. Turn the sieve upside down on a serving plate, shaking it gently to dislodge the cream from its container. Dust, if you wish, with a little icing sugar. Serve with the cherry compote.A cake, studded with fresh fruit, works as both dessert and teatime treat. If this cake, with its layer of soft peaches and crunchy pine nuts, is to come out at the end of a meal, I would include a jug of pouring cream, too.For the batterground almonds 80gplain flour 100gbaking powder ¾ tspbutter 180gcaster sugar 180geggs 3 largelemon 1 pine nuts 2 tbspLine the base of a 20cm round, deep, springform cake tin.

Place the slices on a foil-lined grill pan, trickle over 2 tablespoons of the honey then leave under a hot grill till their edges have started to caramelise. Watch them carefully throughout the process. Finely chop the rosemary needles.Mix together the ground almonds, plain flour and baking powder. Cut the butter into small dice then beat to a pale, thick cream with the sugar using a food mixer. Break the eggs into a bowl and beat them lightly. With the beater turning at low speed, alternately add the egg and flour mixtures until you have a smooth, thick cream. Finely grate the zest of the lemon and stir in. Spoon into the lined cake tin.Place the grilled peaches on top of the cake – they look best randomly distributed rather than neatly arranged – then scatter over the pine nuts and the chopped rosemary needles. Bake for 45 minutes, until lightly firm and golden, then remove and brush with the remaining honey. Leave to cool before turning out of the tin.Dr Bircher’s classic muesli is one of my favourite breakfasts, though I will admit to removing the raisins, which I find introduce an unwelcome sweetness.

Like suncream and sandals relegated to the back of the wardrobe, fruit ices are sent to the back of the mind during the months of jumpers and thick soup, except maybe for a Christmas palate cleanser.Their return is directly related to the weather. As days get warmer – and, this year, sweltering – smooth scoops and icy shards progress from being a novelty, to a pleasure, to a relief, to an absolute necessity.These are days when cold showers and frozen things are essential. A spoonful of granita seems to slide down the throat, chilling as it goes. Making it, or a sorbet, by hand is like loitering in the frozen food section of a supermarket in August, enjoying the great wafts of icy air that drift from the open freezer doors.I am not sure if I should call today’s recipe a sorbet or granita. According to US writer Jeffrey Steingarten, the difference between a sorbet and a Sicilian granita is texture: sorbet is smoother, whereas granita has a coarser, more crystalline texture, often due to agitating with a fork. I use a fork, but achieve something that is quite smooth, which I will come to later, but for the sake of a title, let’s call it “granita”. The method is the same basic one I use for watermelon and mulberry granita – fruit juice or pulp is mixed with sugar, a pinch of salt, maybe lemon to sharpen the edges, then frozen. No real need for strict measures or a machine.Plum sorbet was necessary, because three kilos of reduced-price plums from Testaccio market turned out to be the wrong side of ripe. As I unpacked the rest of the shopping, which had sat in the car for two hours, the plums snaked on to the work surface like flat tyres into a pavement and welcomed a halo of fruit flies. Plum granita was the solution – and a revelation. I have always thought a ripe, red plum has something custardy about it, both in texture and taste. .It was the exceptional ice-cream maker Kitty Travers who taught me the additional sugar isn’t just to augment the natural sweetness of the fruit, it also has an important job to do: it changes the nature of the ice crystals, which means the granita is smoother, and also prevents it from freezing too hard. I reckon 1.2kg fruit to 200g sugar and a pinch of salt. Alcohol does this job, too, so you could substitute some of the sugar for a tablespoon or two of vodka, gin or kirsch. .1.2 kg ripe, purple plums200g sugar1 pinch of salt2 tbsp vodka or lemonWash the plums, then split them and remove the stones. Using a food processor or immersion blender, puree the plum flesh. Dissolve the sugar and a pinch of salt in 100g hot water, and add to the puree along with the vodka or lemon juice, and pulse again.Scrape the mixture into a glass or plastic box, then put in the freezer for a couple of hours, by which time it should be partially frozen, especially at the edges. Use a fork to scape the frozen mixture from the edges of the container and to scratch and disturb the surface, then put it back in the freezer for another hour.Repeat the scratching and return to the freezer until the granita is softly frozen. If it gets too hard, 10 minutes in a warm spot should make it soft enough to stirscratch, and serve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0d3cb53c23b1068d81ac9dfa1bd5aa0301adbbd/0_372_5600_3361/master/5600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d03a79dfa546598d689714e7d4d499be","title":"seven ways to improve your balance","story":"Lack of balance is associated with elderly people, but deterioration can start in your 20s. Here’s how to avoid the wobblesAgeing often leads to a loss of balance, which can result in an increased risk of falls. But, as a report from the Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago shows, a lack of balance has other consequences. “A tendency to lose balance among elderly people often results in an overall reduction in the level of physical activity,” it says, “and to a decreased ability to function satisfactorily in social roles.”Ear infections, vertigo and medications, including some antidepressants, antihistamines and pain relief, can cause problems with your “vestibular function” – the system in your inner ear that aids balance and spatial orientation. You should always see a doctor if you experience any sudden, unusual or severe problems with your balance. Hearing Link has a list of the most common causes.Balance can start to deteriorate in your mid-20s. However, strength training can help, whatever your age. A 2013 study that examined the effects of strengthening exercises on balance concluded: “Improvement in lower limb strength may lead to balance enhancement in neurologically intact older peeople.”Simple balance and proprioception exercises can be done at home without the need for equipment. Try alternate balancing on one leg (bending the standing leg slightly at the knee will help if you are wobbly, as will focusing on a stationary point in front of you). Closing your eyes makes it much harder. Most people are “better” on one leg than the other – single leg exercises can help to strengthen the weaker side.Using a single step or stair, step up with your right leg in a slow and controlled manner, then bring your left leg up to join it. Step down and repeat, alternating leading legs. To make it more difficult, find a higher step or use a box in the gym. This simple exercise helps to build hip stability, as well as strengthening knees.Sitting on a stability ball challenges your core and balance. Start with your arms by your sides and your feet on the floor, then lift and extend your right leg while raising your left arm to shoulder height. Return to a sitting position, then do the same on the other side. Repeat 10 times. Note, though, that a study at the University of Waterloo in Canada concluded there is no benefit to sitting on a ball all day instead of an office chair.Exercises such as lunges and squats will help to make you stronger, increase your range of motion and challenge your balance. Good form is important to maximise benefits. For a squat, stand with feet facing forward, hip distance apart. Making sure not to arch your back, hinge at the hips and push them back – imagine there is a chair behind you that you are about to sit on. Keep your abs engaged and don’t go too low if it causes your back to arch. Hold for a couple of seconds, then drive up through your heels, back to standing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d87a449d4b2537bcc243dd917f8606bbf0f3d4fc/42_16_3145_1888/master/3145.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=721c27be1c1a566d27b5bf89ceef1d31","title":"russia 2018 world cup england guardian support","story":"Our senior sports writer Barney Ronay explains how you can help keep the ’s football coverage in playHere we are then.

PHA Until relatively recently, because of your age, if you didn’t have the money needed to pay off your interest-only mortgage at the end of its term, your choice would have been between selling up and downsizing or taking out an equity release plan to raise the cash needed to pay off the mortgage. Those options are still available to you, but as a result of the relaxation of the rules about the sale of interest-only mortgages by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), there has been a growing number of specialist “later life” lenders offering both interest-only and repayment mortgages to older borrowers excluded by mainstream lenders because of their age. So if your current lender won’t let you extend your mortgage, there is likely to be a specialist lender who will let you take out a conventional residential mortgage provided you meet its affordability requirements."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6ad12d3c976ab9d9eaaa5e08179082608ddcdb7/0_6_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d583df0387dbd09487d0e8c45f1ae59","title":"back second brexit vote says conservative mp justine greening","story":"Call from former minister comes as Theresa May suffers another resignation in protest at her Chequers plan Justine Greening has said she believes other senior Conservative MPs also support the idea of a second referendum to end a likely parliamentary deadlock on Brexit, after she became the most high-profile Tory to endorse such a move.The former education secretary and remain supporter said Theresa May’s Chequers plan “in practice suits no one” and would be rejected by both remainers and leavers. A new referendum would provide “a route forwards”, she said.Writing in the Times, the MP for Putney said the “only solution is to take the final Brexit decision out of the hands of deadlocked politicians” by letting voters choose from three options: May’s final deal, a no-deal Brexit or staying in the EU.Speaking later on Monday on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Greening said she expected other senior Tories would support the idea. “I think what I’m saying is what everyone is seeing in parliament,” she said. Asked whether that meant other leading Conservatives would support her specific plan, she said: “Yes, I believe so.”Also on Monday, May suffered another resignation in protest at her Chequers plan. Scott Mann, the MP for North Cornwall, stepped down as parliamentary private secretary to the Treasury, saying he could not support a “watered-down Brexit”.“Over the coming days, weeks and months, I fear that elements of the Brexit white paper will inevitably put me in direct conflict with the views expressed by a large section of my constituents,” he said.Greening said she thought May’s Chequers proposal was now dead. It was a “genuine, clever attempt at a compromise” but had proved to be unworkable, she said.“Yes, because I think in practice is suits no one, and whether you’re a remainer who looks at it and thinks, actually, we’re signing up to all the rules but now we won’t be around the table to influence them, or indeed you’re a leaver, who says this doesn’t give us the clean break we want, it doesn’t keep anyone happy,” Greening said.“I think that millions of people who voted for leave will feel that this approach is not what they voted for in the referendum in 2016. The basic problem we’ve got is that Westminster works on party lines, but Brexit is above party politics, and so in a way it’s not set up to deal with this issue.”What was needed was “a clear route forward that settles this European question once and for all”, Greening said. “We have to be pragmatic now about the fact parliament will not be able to take a decision on this final deal.“I don’t believe what we need is more time. What we need is a proper decision that we can follow through on as a country.”The idea was dismissed by Bernard Jenkin, a hardline pro-leave Tory MP. “It’s a little ill-thought out, I’m afraid,” he told Today. “If we wanted to extend the uncertainty for another long period, this is one way of doing it.”He said the solution to the deadlock was more MPs supporting his view of Brexit. “It is stalemated because the elected politicians are, some of them, refusing to implement the decision that was taken by the British people,” Jenkin said.Given that parliament could not agree to May’s plan, he continued, a no-deal Brexit based on WTO rules should be looked at. Challenged on the strong opposition to this from business groups, Jenkin said: “Well, businesses are lobbying for their bottom lines and their profits.”Greening’s move has already been seized on by campaign groups seeking a second referendum, as well as by the Liberal Democrats, who said the comments “show that the sensible MPs in the Conservative party recognise the chaos wrought by a ided government”.Unhappiness from the Tory right over May’s proposed Brexit deal, and their threats to vote it down when a promised meaningful final vote is held in parliament around the turn of the year, have prompted growing speculation that the prime minister may struggle to ensure that whatever she negotiates will be approved by MPs, placing Britain’s future relationship with Europe in limbo.Other high-profile figures have started to use the belief that there is political deadlock to advance arguments for a second referendum. On Sunday, Tony Blair said in a post on the website for his Institute for Global Change that there should be another national vote, because there would be no House of Commons majority for May’s Brexit, a no-deal Brexit or for remaining in the EU.Blair also suggested there should be three choices for voters. “The question may be complicated because it really involves three choices: Clean Break, ‘soft’ or stay. But the complexity is not insuperable,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/653d6b81c79d6f9b8976b72111afb6e8e486137e/0_158_4740_2844/master/4740.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f24a683dc12ffbc7e931991d88e8dcc9","title":"can you solve it head spinning bicycle puzzles","story":"Run your brain through the gearsAs we are almost midway through the Tour de France, I thought it would be a good moment for some bicycle puzzles.1) The King of the Mountains went up the col at 15 km an hour and down it at 45 km an hour.

They reported it to Historic England who commissioned Wessex Archaeology to investigate. Trenches dug along the sides have revealed well preserved curved hull timbers.Archaeologists are hoping to recover evidence for the cargo and possessions of the crew, but initial results of dendrochronology and other tests suggest the tree which supplied one oak plank was felled in 1531, and a possible 16th-century date for other elm, larch and beech timbers.The ship is believed to be a single-masted, carvel-built merchant ship of up to 200 tons, precious because the humble working vessels of shipping history are far less likely to survive than gorgeously carved state barges. It may have been carrying copperas, also known as green vitriol – hydrated ferrous sulphate – extensively used as a dye fixative to make ink and known to have been produced around Whitstable from 1565.Mark Harrison, director of Timescapes, a local history group, said: “Our group of volunteers was looking for exploded world war two pillboxes along the Kent coast. Adjacent to a lump of exploded concrete, we were amazed to see the timbers of a ship appearing out of the sand. “We reported the find to Historic England and are pleased that what turned out to be a medieval wreck has been given protection and that this excavation could tell us more about its story.”The Camber Sands wreck was reported by a member of the public who first saw a single stump of timber showing at low tides, but in autumn 2016 realised the outline of a ship was emerging. It is gradually being scoured free of the silt which protected the heavily built vessel 47.2 metres long by 9.5 metres wide, lying parallel to the beach. It is believed to date from the late 18th or early 19th century. It may be the Avon, built in Nova Scotia in 1843, reported to have “stranded and drifted alongshore to the east of Rye harbour and received considerable damage” in August 1852, while returning from Le Havre with a cargo of timber. Duncan Wilson, the chief executive of Historic England, said the two ships were very different but equally fascinating. “Many of the ships that Historic England protects are accessible only to ers but when the sands shift and the tide is right, visitors to these beaches in Kent and Sussex can catch a glimpse of these incredible wrecks.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4792f3ec1ffc2a4d1682389c217eb8e91a486b6c/0_243_4636_2782/master/4636.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0ff3b5cbc50cfc6ede65edb6634ecd3","title":"athletics world cup shows sport struggling post bolt","story":"The competition was enjoyed by casual fans but track and field still feels like it’s fumbling in the dark since losing star attractionJust under a year ago in London Usain Bolt grabbed the relay baton for the final time in his career, swapped it from his left hand to right and then pressed down hard on the afterburners. First he soared. Then he hopped before, as the pain from a torn hamstring hit, dropping to his knees.It could have been a metaphor for the next 11 months of the sport: the thrill of the 2017 world championships, with its stadiums packed and 10 million watching Bolt’s and Mo Farah’s farewell, replaced by a slowing down and indifference from casual observers.Right now athletics feels like a sport fumbling uncertainly in the dark, trying to find a way to make the public care in the post-Bolt world. The Jamaican was not only its biggest weapon but its greatest crutch.And so to Saturday night in the Olympic Stadium, for the inaugural Athletics World Cup – a new and much-hyped eight-nation event. Once again as the first day drew to a close the British, American and Jamaican teams were squaring off in the 4x100m. Only this time the names were very different.None of the British team who set a national record of 37.47 to take gold at last year’s world championships was there. Nor was any of the Americans who finished second or, indeed, the Jamaicans. In fact none of Britain’s 10 fastest 100m runners was competing – with the team led out by Reuben Arthur, who has the 23rd-fastest time in the UK in 2018.Does this matter? You might think so. After all the British Athletics chief executive, Niels de Vos, had promised that the overall quality would be “astonishing”. But many of Britain’s stars, including Dina Asher-Smith, Laura Muir and Reece Prescod, were missing – along with many other marquee names including Caster Semenya and American sprinter Noah Lyles, fastest man in the world this year.Imagine having a World Cup with no Ronaldo, Neymar and Messi, and with Jermain Defoe up front for England. It wouldn’t fly, would it?And yet British Athletics would argue – with some justification – that filling more than half of the London Stadium on a Saturday when England’s footballers and cricketers were in action, as well as the Wimbledon women’s singles final, was a decent first stab. Sunday had fewer fans, but they still enjoyed seeing the US team run away with the trophy and the sight of a makeshift British team battling to third.Perhaps there is something to the idea of team competition. After all, racing’s Shergar Cup does not attract the best horses yet its team-based event attracts big crowds to Ascot. Certainly those in the stadium seem to enjoy the action. A friend of mine who had spent £70 on his ticket seemed happy enough for a one-off – although he admitted the athletics was “far from world-class”.That seemed to sum up the general mood. Reasonably entertaining, interesting format, quality and TV coverage leaving a lot to be desired.But the final judgment needs to wait: until UK Athletics’ balance sheet has been properly assessed and scrutinised, until after the impact on the crowd for this week’s Anniversary Games is known, and – in the longer term – on whether it brings new fans to the sport. Ultimately it also needs to create a genuine legacy. There is talk of China being interested in hosting in 2020. But how many stars will be tempted to turn up in an Olympic year?We can certainly say there were far too many teething problems. Why was the competition announced after athletes had signed kit deals for 2018 – often meaning their priority was elsewhere? And why did some kit manufacturers, whose sponsorship provides athletes with the majority of their income, only find about the event in the newspapers?There is a potential parallel here with Nitro Athletics, a new competition launched with great fanfare in Australia in 2017 with the help of Bolt. The media coverage was extensive. The crowds decent. There was talk of it saving the sport, despite warnings that people were simply coming to tick seeing Bolt off their bucket list.And in its first year Nitro – which was run as a subsidiary company of Athletics Australia – lost $1.826m (£1.02m). The event was not held in 2018 and its future is uncertain.I hope the Athletics World Cup has a rosier future, for track and field needs a shot in the arm. There are some diehard fans who insist this is only a minor post-Bolt lull, and the sport has had similar wobbles before. That is not the sense I get from speaking to athletes, administrators and agents. Appearance fees are down. TV coverage is shrinking. And they fear sports such as MMA are more appealing to younger audiences.One influential voice told me last week that athletics was in danger of becoming a sport people care about only once every four years during the Olympics. While Greg Rutherford warned recently: “It’s probably a sign of the times that more people want to talk to me about Strictly Come Dancing. Can you imagine that happening in the era of Seb Coe and Steve Ovett, or even Sally Gunnell and Linford Christie? Now nobody cares about athletics.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9130171cafc73eb4bbd42dc0ed41200b5db8d7da/0_676_2149_1288/master/2149.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa5368256711e8faea5abce2687d0d13","title":"patrick reed us masters the open carnoustie","story":"Masters champion believes, having won a first major, he is now ready to go for the career slam and next on his list is The OpenFour years have passed since Patrick Reed, giddy with excitement following a World Golf Championship success in Florida, declared himself a world top-five golfer. Oh, how they laughed. Who does he think he is?In April, Reed delivered on that promise in emphatic style. Rory McIlroy was among those who could not keep pace with the Texan as he marched towards Masters glory. “The best thing about that is I get to go back every year now,” says Reed. “When I am 70 years old, I’ll be able to have my grandchildren caddie for me in the par-three contest.”History tells us how unwise it would be to discard Reed’s next ambition as improbable. “It would mean a lot to win another major,” he explains. “But you are either a major champion or you are not. Then you are a career grand slam champion. Those are the two bars.“I want to win them all. My goal is to have the career grand slam at some point in my life. There is nothing better than the Claret Jug, though. I would love to take it home. It means a lot to me. The history behind it and winning at a place that is so different from home would mean a lot. That would mean you have full control of your game. It basically means you can play on and win on anything.”Reed’s bid for stage two and the most iconic trophy in golf starts in Carnoustie on Thursday. He is rightly regarded as one of the favourites. Masters success was sandwiched between a second in last year’s US PGA Championship and fourth at the recent US Open. Nobody has performed as well as Reed over the same major .“It means I’m confident that, if I put myself in position, I have a chance to win,” he says. “The nerves were definitely more settled at the Masters because of what I did at the PGA. Once I was able to close out Sunday at Augusta, it felt like I had no pressure at the US Open. I know I can do it, which eases the mind and lets me just play golf.”Reed’s focus has been essential. Perhaps only Tiger Woods has encountered such a scale of headlines associated with his personal life on winning a major. The reality is Reed’s relationship with his estranged parents is both nobody else’s business and mysterious in circumstance. The 27 year old has no willingness to address the matter, as is entirely his prerogative. “I’m busier now,” he adds. “I feel the same when I go to the course and play. But I have to manage my time a lot better.“Before, I could get away with hanging out and talking to some people at the course. Now I’m grinding 24-7. I don’t have a lot of free time. Which is a great problem to have. I’m the guy who gets to the course, puts on the headphones and goes to practise. Once I get my work done, I have all the time in the world for fans and media. But inside the ropes, I’m grinding.”Reed is articulate and engaging. Speaking on Friday at the Scottish Open, ire at a “piss poor” performance soon dissipated. There was, however, a strong rebuke towards any sense Reed’s targets have altered since he added a Green Jacket to his wardrobe.“My standards have always been ridiculously high, even before I won the Masters,” he says. “I show up to win golf tournaments, not make cuts or finish top 10. If I don’t do it, it’s a bad week. I don’t feel any more expectation because I’m a major champion. I go out to play golf for myself and my family. I play as hard as I can. I never quit. Whatever happens, happens but I don’t feel any heightened expectations. I feel like I can win every week.”Reed will not have encountered an Open such as the one this week. Scorched Carnoustie fairways have been likened to airport runways – the Masters champion hit a seven-iron 295 yards on a scouting trip last week – with the forecast levels of pre-tournament rain unlikely to make much of a difference. Reed’s links alliance was formed when he won the 2006 Junior Open at Heswall.“Carnoustie is a great course,” says Reed. “It’s ridiculously firm and fast. A lot will depend on the wind. If the prevailing breeze blows, I will probably only hit one driver per round. The ball is going miles. So you have to put it in play. You have to know where you can run out and where you can’t.I enjoy the different questions we get asked over here. There are, like, 10 different ways you can hit every shot.“They were watering the rough. It was nasty in some areas. But in others it was a little thin. It gives us a chance but the water will make it a little healthier and thicker. If they were doing what they were doing to get the rough to where it is supposed to be, it will be nasty.”Reed will inevitably embrace the challenge. It would be a surprise if he doesn’t supply one of his own."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c35500304b1f6337ca4d2eeb55f8fb9039cab6f3/157_112_2371_1423/master/2371.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b73f1434e31e04c2d6ff85fca897e4e","title":"rfl 2m losses over 300000 nigel wood","story":"The former chief executive of the Rugby Football League, Nigel Wood, will be paid more than £300,000 as part of his severance package from the game’s governing body: almost a sixth of the total losses of more than £2m which the RFL incurred last year.The RFL will publicise their 2017 accounts after all 38 professional clubs have attended the sport’s Annual General Meeting later this month, but the  has seen details prior to publication which reveal the significance of Wood’s exit payment after agreeing to step down as CEO.Listed in the directors’ remuneration section of the accounts is confirmation that Wood received a provision for loss of office totalling £328,840. The majority of that sum will be paid this year, though is included in the RFL’s accounts for last year after the decision was made to part company in advance of the year end.Detailing the extent of the payment remaining, the accounts state: “Further to the agreements made between N Wood and the Board in 2017, N Wood left the RFL on 31012018. An agreement was made that N Wood would receive £288,963 in 2018. This amount has been accrued in the 2017 accounts to be paid in 2018.” Wood has already received the remainder of the sum.The accounts also reveal that all the RFL’s non-executive directors – including the former Football Association chief executive, Brian Barwick – received wage increases in 2017. Barwick, who agreed to join the sport in 2013, was paid £81,550, almost £1,000 more than he received in 2016.Overall the total remuneration of the chief executive’s senior management committee is £905,000. That is a significant increase on 12 months earlier, when the committee were paid £674,000.Final interviews have taken place for Wood’s replacement and an announcement is expected before the end of this month.The RFL also announced last week that a reduction in the valuation of Odsal Stadium, which the governing body bought in 2012 to safeguard the future of the former Super League champions Bradford, also significantly contributed to their extensive losses.The stadium was bought six years ago and was valued at one stage in excess of £1.3m. However, following a depreciation in value of more than £200,000 and a re-evaluation adjustment of £372,361, the site is now valued at £750,000.

She opens up about shame, rage, her autism diagnosis and the meaning of Louis CKDuring the live run of Hannah Gadsby’s standup show, Nanette, she found herself sleeping 15 hours a night, then taking naps during the day. “I got bronchitis in London,” she says. “A tooth wrenched out in Edinburgh. Then I got carbon monoxide poisoning from the flat in New York. I was Googling ‘neurological disorders’, I had the tremors and my speech was slurring. I kept telling people I was really tired, texting them coffin emojis, and they’d say: ‘Of course you are, this show is exhausting.’”But she doesn’t think you should really suffer for your art. Well, not any more. “I’m against that theory,” she says firmly.She performed Nanette for 18 months – including a one-month stint in New York that turned into four – and has now become accustomed to people expressing concern for her wellbeing.We meet in a crowded Melbourne cafe, and when another journalist, early for her slot, walks by, she puts a gentle hand on Gadsby’s shoulder, unbidden. Gadsby takes this in her stride. “I’ve had psychiatrists reach out to me, saying: ‘You know, there’s no precedent for what you’re doing.’ It’s been a strange old ride and I think it’s going to take a long time before I know what I’ve done to myself.”Gadsby is keen to go incognito. The easiest way to spot her is that she is the only person in the cafe hiding their face with their hand. But anonymity may no longer be possible. Nanette went up on Netflix a month ago, and has since elicited thorough analysis in the New Yorker, the Atlantic, the Washington Post and Vanity Fair, while Lily Allen, Thandie Newton, Monica Lewinsky, Ellen Page and Roxane Gay have raved andor wept about it on Twitter (in a tweet to Gadsby, Gay wrote: “You moved me and have really made me think about humour, the self, self-deprecation and the uses of anger”). Across Gadsby’s social networks, the general public also gives effusive thanks. Nanette is not merely an hour of standup. It’s a mass bloodletting.Gadsby can’t bring herself to look right now. In fact, she has asked her manager to mute any exciting offers. “I’m living somebody else’s dream,” she says. “Now everyone wants a piece of the Gads.”Standup comedy relies, of course, on creating tension and release. In Nanette, Gadsby exposes and then destroys that formula. She reveals experiences of homophobic and sexual violence, which escalate throughout the set, until finally she is delivering them from a precipice of rage. “This tension is yours,” she tells the stunned Sydney Opera House audience. “I am not helping you with it any more. You need to learn what this feels like.”“I broke the contract and that’s what made this work,” she says. “I betrayed people’s trust, and I did that really seriously, not just for effect.”Nanette debuted at the Melbourne International Comedy festival in 2017, the year of Australia’s same-sex marriage postal plebiscite, and during fierce debate around the Safe Schools programme designed to support LGBTQI students. Homophobia was making its way back into the public sphere a clear, disturbing regression.In the first third of Nanette, Gadsby deconstructs the autobiographical material she has aired over the years, including a tale about nearly getting beaten up at a bus stop, which gets the audience laughing gamely. In the second, she deconstructs comedy itself, and announces her intention to quit the circuit. To use self-deprecating humour when you are already deemed worthless, she suggests, is further humiliation. In the final third, she deconstructs misogyny, including her own internalised misogyny. She had never told the full story of the bus-stop incident, for example – that the man had come back and beaten her up, that nobody had stopped him, and that she didn’t go either to the police or the hospital afterwards, because she didn’t think she was worth it. Gadsby desperately needed to hear stories like hers when she was younger, but instead had been complicit in silencing them. No more.Gadsby grew up in small-town, bible-belt Tasmania. Homosexuality was a crime there until 1997, so – she says jovially in her set – the likes of her were supposed to “pack up your Aids in a suitcase and fuck off to Mardi Gras”. But the island state is also the butt of incest jokes from mainland Australia, so she felt instinctively protective of it. It is not the only time she has found that loyalty can be at the expense of the self at the end of Nanette she reveals painfully, briefly, that she was sexually abused as a child and raped as a young woman, but doesn’t go into details. How that silence – within a show about breaking silence – must sting.“It’s this murky area where you know the people and it has repercussions for their families,” she says, “so I don’t know how to put that out there in the world in a constructive and safe way for both me and all involved. We only have an existing narrative framework for a stranger doing violence to you.”The idea of “stranger danger” persists in the collective psyche, but we now know that sexual offences against children are the crimes least likely to involve strangers. Most children will be abused by opportunists in adult relationships: the married relatives, the family friends, the pillars of the community, the good blokes. “A lot of people who have experienced trauma at the hands of people they’ve trusted take responsibility, and that is what’s toxic,” Gadsby says. “It’s bullshit that as a kid I’d care for a person that was abusing me, but you just do and that’s the horrific thing.”Shame and rage are the twin forces behind Nanette, but rage, at least, has velocity. It is purposeful, powering her to the final third, whereas shame welds the feet to the ground. Gadsby considers this delineation. “Shame has its place,” she says. “Shame is what you do to a kid to stop them running on the road. And then you take the shame away and immediately they’re back in the fold. You should never soak anybody in shame. It’s the prolonged existence of shame that then flips out into destructive rage. We can’t exist in that. It’s like treacle.”More remote support has come from fellow comedians many see Nanette as a game-changer (it was the joint winner of best show at last year’s Edinburgh fringe festival). “I’ve been a professional comic for 30 years,” tweeted Kathy Griffin. “I’ve been studying comedy for even longer. I thought I had seen everything …” Kristen Schaal advised her followers there was nothing better and more important than Nanette. Writing for New York magazine’s Vulture blog, Sara Schaefer and Sabrina Jalees discussed How Nanette Will Change Standup.The burden of talking about complex issues usually comes down to the most marginalised people. On the rare occasions that a white, heterosexual man steps up – Louis CK pointing out, for example, that “there is no greater threat to women than men” – they are hailed as heroes.Louis CK’s predilection for talking about masturbation in his sets became a metaphor in Gadsby’s mind for the rudimentary question-answer setup of punchline jokes – “like rubbing one out” – and made her determined to pursue more sophisticated narratives. “A joke is a wank, but a story is intimacy,” she says.Before getting into comedy, Gadsby drifted, taking a variety of jobs across different states, from planting trees to cinema projectionist – surely the introvert’s dream vocation. At one point, she was homeless. It wasn’t until she was in her late 20s, around 2006, that she tried her hand at comedy, and she credits the newfound creativity with saving her life. “Comedy is great in that it’s accessible to someone like me, from a low socioeconomic background, struggling in life. The gatekeepers are a lot stronger in other art forms.”The darker side is that a comedy scene can harbour personalities that might be expunged from other professions. In Melbourne in June, a young female comedian, Eurydice Dixon, was murdered by a man who followed her home from the club where she had just performed. A week before our interview, a male comedian called Andy Nolch was charged with defacing the site where people had left floral tributes by painting a giant penis. The attention Dixon’s death had received, he said, was part of the media’s anti-men agenda.“He’s obviously an unwell kid and there’s a lot of that in comedy,” says Gadsby. “It’s often young men trialling their philosophies on life, and we’ve got a generation of young men who believe that they are victimised, because they’ve been promised the world. That’s a poisoned chalice, because now there’s a gap between what the cultural narrative is and what their experience is. Looking back, I think it’s done me more good than harm to be promised absolutely nothing. I was always told I didn’t matter to the world, but the world still matters to me. That’s why I haven’t responded to the more brutal aspects of my life with violence or bitterness.”Gadsby is happy to be back home in Ascot Vale, the neighbouring suburb to Moonee Ponds, made famous by Dame Edna Everage. She lives a stone’s throw from her brother’s fruit-and-veg shop. Life is simple. There are her dogs and her Royal Enfield motorcycle, and she is a keen gardener. “If a documentary crew were to follow me around, they’d probably think they were making a film about the saddest person in the world,” Gadsby says, “but I’m throwing the best thought orgies.”Three years ago, she was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. “It’s clarified why the comedy lifestyle is so difficult for me,” she says. “It’s a lot of noise and moving around.” A child wails, as if on cue, and she flinches.Gadsby explains that people with autism have an increased sensitivity to traumatisation due to their difficulty in communicating and regulating emotions. They are also more vulnerable to becoming victims in the first place. A Swedish study this year revealed that women who screened positive for autism are nearly three times more likely to have experienced sexual abuse.When the Australian TV celebrity Don Burke was at the centre of #MeToo allegations last year, he blamed autism for his actions – and Gadsby took aim on social media. “If there’s one thing that a spectrum brain is great at, it is identifying patterns,” she wrote. “So let me show you a fascinating pattern that I have noticed recently: Don Burke told us he had Asperger’s under the very same circumstances that Kevin Spacey came out of the closet, which is exactly the same kind of moment that Harvey Weinstein reframed himself as sex addict, and when Louis CK chose to acknowledge his peculiar special needs clause.”Now, she points out that Nanette was built from her ability to see patterns. “Having the framework of autism boils down to not looking out to the world to see how I should exist, but knowing I don’t actually have to be social, knowing that it exhausts me and that I will get confused and look like an idiot,” she says. “Because I also know that I understand things a lot deeper than a lot of people.”Everyone wants to know what’s next on the agenda for the Gads.

Rent one and discover all kinds of small wonders that aren’t in the guidebooks. In particular, Nørrebro and Vesterbro are great areas to explore by bike, because of their many small streets. It is an easy way to get around, but beware: some Danish cyclists can be a bit aggressive towards people who do not follow the rules.This bike route goes all around the harbour: 13km offering beautiful and rare views of the city, a mixture of modern and old architecture, including the Opera House, the Royal Library and Blox, the city’s hotly debated latest architectural feature – a massive building of glass boxes hosting a museum, offices, gym, restaurant and housing. Two large bike bridges cross the main harbour canal, including Cirkelbroen (Circle Bridge): designed by the artist Olafur Eliasson and inspired by traditional Danish fishing boats, it consists of five round platforms across Christianshavns Kanal.• visitcopenhagen.dkIn the heart of Nørrebro at Assistens Kirkegård, is a churchyard where people still bury their loved ones, and a park where the locals come to sunbathe, celebrate birthdays and have picnics. The churchyard dates from 1760 and you can find the graves of Søren Kierkegaard and Hans Christian Andersen among a roll-call of Danish musicians, writers and celebrities. It is said that Nørrebro would be the literary and spiritual centre of the country if it were allowed to count the dead. When Assistens opened, sailors brought trees and plants here from all over the world, which is why there are stunning blooms and foliage from South America, India and Japan. It is a beautiful and peaceful place. • Entrance from Nørrebrogade, Kapelvej eller Jagtvej, assistens.dkFor those who have built up an appetite wandering around the cemetery, there are lots of small restaurants in the Elmegade area, such as Selfish, a great sushi place. But the king of them all is Manfreds in the vibrant Jægersborggade. This advertises itself as “probably the world’s only veggie-focused restaurant famous for its raw meat” – steak tartare with cress and rye bread (medium portion £12) is the creation of former Noma chef Christian Puglisi. With Noma’s former assistant manager Kim Rossen he has created a laid-back neighbourhood diner where customers can get a meal for £12-20, most of the food and wine is organic, and the vegetables come from Manfreds’ own farm, 40km away. • Jægersborggade 40, manfreds.dkStop here and rest in the lounging chairs on the waterfront outside the Black Diamond, the library which is one of the most significant architectural landmarks on the Copenhagen waterfront (it is also known simply as the Diamond). Inside, there’s also a concert hall, bookshop and a little cafe that serves wonderful pastries (around €3.50). The old reading hall on the second floor is where Lenin sat and worked in 1910, and many of my Danish colleagues and I have spent hours writing in there. Remember to look up when taking the escalator to the reading room: there’s a bridge that connects the old and the new buildings, and the ceiling is decorated with a 210 sq m fresco by Danish artist Per Kirkeby, who died in May 2018. • Den Sorte Diamant, Søren Kierkegaards Plads 1, kb.dkdaindex.htmlThis is one of the best lunch options in the city. Of course, visitors should walk around the stylish museum and see the evolution of celebrated Danish design, with exhibits from Poul Henningsen, Kaare Klint and Arne Jacobsen, but save time to eat lunch here in the cafe, which is named after Klint, and which serves traditional Danish smørrebrød with a New Nordic twist, such as beef strips, raspberry, rocket and hazelnuts, at reasonable prices (£15 for two pieces). In the summer, sit out in the courtyard of this former hospital building, which dates back to 1752. • Bredgade 68, designmuseum.dkKødbyen is the old meat hall in the once seedy but now uber-cool Vesterbro neighbourhood. The butchers have left and it is now a hotspot for food lovers in the evening and clubbers at night. For those who enjoy fish and shellfish, Fiskebaren is the place to go – scallops, lobster, shrimps and crabs are served raw here, or cooked New Nordic cuisine-style. The atmosphere is trendy and relaxed, and there are basic tables for eating outside.• Flæsketorvet 100, small dishes from £11-35 , fiskebaren.dkIf you want to visit an old-style Danish bar, head to Bo-Bi. The beers are cheap, the atmosphere is fuggy, because you are still allowed to smoke, and the only things to eat are hardboiled eggs and peanuts. Just across from the bar you’ll find the oldest Danish publishing house, Gyldendal: many a poet has finished a meeting, walked the 20 steps to Bo-Bi, and spent his whole advance in one sitting. • Klareboderne 14, on FacebookThis beautiful baroque church on Christianshavn has a spiral staircase on the outside of its spire walk to the top of this for a splendid view of the famous free town of Christiania. Sadly, this utopian society, formed 40 years ago, has turned nasty, so look at the rest of the city instead, especially Christianshavn, with its old colonial warehouses. It’s a lovely place to visit, with small cafes and restaurants in the narrow, cobbled streets.• Skt Annægade 29, vorfrelserskirke.dkAlso known as Big House, 8-tallet – a housing block in the shape of a figure eight – was designed by Danish architectural wonderkid Bjarke Ingels. It is a favourite spot of mine, on the periphery of Ørestad, the newest part of Copenhagen, and I love it because of the clash between the best modern architecture and full-blown countryside, with sheep and cows, just nearby.

Sitting through the largely tiresome pilot of Baron Cohen’s latest program Who Is America? inspires longing for a simpler past, when Baron Cohen’s profile was still low enough that he didn’t have to mask his face with nightmare-inducing prosthetics just to go incognito. He plays four characters in the first episode of this new series – an obese quack doctor, an NPR-listening uberliberal, a limey ex-con, and a gruff Israeli commando – all of whom evoke fonder memories of sweet Borat, the good-natured traveler in thrall of a “very nice” world full of “great success!” As hardliners on the left and right, gun nuts and bleeding-heart activists, confrontation is baked into the very premise of this new quartet.But the real nostalgia is for Borat’s era, the comparatively low-stakes idyll of the Bush administration’s tail end. Baron Cohen is now returning to a form he popularized during a time marked by a different set of notions about how comedy best functions, and a different viewership to receive it. For Borat, wannabe rudeboy Ali G, and flamboyant talk show host Brüno, George W Bush was the perfect bad President, an ideal target. He was just incompetent enough to provide endless fodder for mockery, and yet not so calamitously harmful that there would be no fun in making fun. And the people proud to identify themselves as living in Bush’s America revealed the psychosis under heartland values, as gleefully racist as they were hospitable. Baron Cohen was looked on as a daring subversive for turning politeness against his unwitting victims, feeding them the rope by which they could then happily hang themselves. (His “throw the Jew down the well” segment remains surreal, hysterically funny, and deeply disturbing.)Much has transpired since then, and Baron Cohen knows it. He’s unabashedly political in his aspirations for this program, attempting to define an American identity by interviewing its wild and woolly citizens. The implication here, as with all comedy that dares to skew political in the year 2018, is that this is urgent work for an urgent moment. Early threats of legal action from such well-known reprobates as Joe Arpaio and Roy Moore promised cathartic comeuppance after watching these slimy characters take every page of the circumlocution playbook on news programs trying their best to remain decorous, the public would get the chance to watch them go up against someone who didn’t have professional scruples getting in the way of his hate.And when he does, by god, it works. Baron Cohen saves the clear standout segment of the first episode for last, in which, with minimal difficulty, he convinces a handful of congressmen to support a bill arming four-year-olds with firearms. It will go down as one of the more effective works of Trump-era satire, as damning and chilling and disarmingly strange as the latest tweet from the commander-in-chief. The sight of a geriatric man brandishing a semiautomatic rifle outfitted with cute bunny-rabbit ears will not leave the memory of those who gaze upon it any time soon.To Baron Cohen’s detriment, that only throws the shortcomings of the other segments into sharper relief. In the first three parts, he ribs Bernie Sanders as a yokel with a fundamental misunderstanding of what the “one percent” is, discusses his daughter’s free-bleeding onto an American flag over dinner with small-town staunch conservatives, and pitches his bodily-secretion artworks to a Laguna Beach dealer. While the latter of the three has the distinction of being astonishingly weird (the woman that gladly clips a lock of her pubic hair is, hands down, the most game person Baron Cohen has ever interviewed), they’re all hamstrung by a sense of inconsequentiality.With Baron Cohen going out of his way to position Who Is America? in a fractious and chaotic nation beset by families torn asunder, militarized forces suppressing protests, and lives lost, he sets the bar extremely high for himself. When he manages to clear it, the results are dazzling (the final segment has already become viral gold on Twitter), but anything less feels like a waste of time. The woods are burning, and he gives us poop jokes? The line on Baron Cohen was initially that he may be too dangerous for the US, a country that loves nothing more than getting worked up over incendiary comedy gunning for that exact reaction. Odd, fascistic twists of fate have reversed the situation, however. After a sojourn in the unforgiving wilds of feature acting, Baron Cohen returns to the American mainstream to find that it has grown too dangerous for him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b015d601343fdf3926052c994e673351e351794/0_538_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00c7899364fa2bcd48a476aa83103099","title":"what did the doctor who trailer tell us","story":"Bradley Walsh reading the Beano, Alan Shearer talking about football, pizzas mysteriously reanimating – the quick-fire Who trailer wasn’t long but it did give us something to chew onIt’s been BBC convention for a while now to give away big Doctor Who news in the middle of massive sporting events. Pearl Mackie’s casting announcement as Bill was revealed in the middle of the Euro 2016 final and Jodie Whittaker’s unveiling came at the climax of last year’s Wimbledon. So it’s great to see that Auntie still has enough faith in its biggest property to give the same platform to the new era of Doctor Who, with a brand new trailer shown halfway through the World Cup final. And yet I feel undernourished?Just about the only thing we can be totally sure of is that this new gang of the Doctor’s “friends” – as the publicity material carefully puts it (no longer “companions”, certainly not the reductive “assistants”) - don’t have very healthy diets. Doctor Thirteen will lead a somewhat crowded Tardis of four made up of: near-national cheeky chappie treasure Bradley Walsh neglecting The Chase as Graham, and talented Hollyoaks alumni Mandip Gill as Yasmin and Tosin Cole as Ryan. The micro-trailer introduces the trio in a scene that features florid World Cup commentary and various food items being transformed seemingly because Whittaker’s new Doctor is incoming. Ryan is seen tucking into a Full English. Yasmin takes delivery of a deep-dish pizza, while Graham is seeing eyeing up battered sausages in the chippy. Suddenly, the flashes in space-time seem to improve their lots in life just a bit just as the Doctor approaches their various locations, and meals, get a cosmic upgrade. When the time came, at half-time during the France v Croatia final, Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer could not have looked less interested during their forced intro to the clip. A little more enthusiasm came with the radio dialogue from the BBC team throughout. “The first touch was out of this world,” gushed Shearer. Rio Ferdinand added: “They’ve got the makings of a really strong team. They’ve got great energy, they’ve got great flair. I’m really excited to see what happens.”Amid all this the main emotion I’m feeling is frustration about how little was on offer. No dialogue, no interaction, certainly no monsters. But what more were we to expect from an early trailer for a series not expected to screen until October? In this case though, perhaps, a little more. A minor scandal recently saw a scene leak online from an unnamed source which delivered a bit of real Tardis-team action. Who-watchers suggested producers may be opening the flap after the cat had already bolted and, perhaps optimistically, called for a proper look rather than just a teaser. The brief glimpse did remind me of Tennant’s tenure in the Tardis, a bit more down to earth, a bit less serious. Incoming showrunner Chris Chibnall’s predecessor Steven Moffat delighted in casting the Doctor as out of the ordinary. Matt Smith played the character as a manic imp, while Peter Capaldi managed to emote all of the Doctor’s history with the slightest of tweaks to the crumples on his face. It’s far too soon to judge Whittaker on the basis of seconds of footage: all we’ve seen her do so far is smile. Tennant regularly tops best ever Doctor polls, so maybe a more relatable Doctor is just what’s needed, and Whittaker’s take could provide just that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031c97edaacca795957c1ddc4e94480475a5b3e4/0_312_961_576/master/961.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e882ce50d40e601b7cf456ed680289c","title":"what its like when ice detains you they own you youre impotent","story":"I spent 11 months in US immigration detention. Here’s what happenedIt was a regular Sunday when they arrested me. I’d just gotten paid – back then I was working in the fields, picking grapes – and the kids decided they wanted to go to IHOP for breakfast.We got in the car and my oldest daughter, Jennifer, was driving and joking around, and we were all laughing. She was just being so silly. We got to the restaurant, the little ones ordered pancakes, and Jennifer and I had omelettes. We finished and got back in the car.That’s when they came. I don’t know where they had been hiding, but suddenly there were seven Ice officers, all in uniform. I don’t know how they found me, but they thought I was driving the car. One of them started knocking on the driver’s side window and asking Jennifer: Are you Floricel Liborio Ramos?One officer, he spoke Spanish. He said: You have to get out of the car and answer some questions. Then he said: Sorry, but we’ll be taking you in, and the kids will be staying here. Is there anyone who can come and get them?I had to phone my friend who was miles away. She asked me if I was allowed to wait for her to arrive – after all, the youngest kids were only 10 and 12. The officer said no, they had to take me right now. IHOP is always busy on a Sunday. There was a line of people waiting to eat and they were all standing there watching as the commotion happened. One officer told me I was going to go through deportation, that I couldn’t see a judge. I cried out: I have a life here! I have three kids who live here! They’re citizens!They put me in handcuffs in front of my kids and put me in the back of a car. I looked at my children’s faces. All I felt was sadness.I kept eye contact with them until the car started moving. Then I sat in the back, alone. The ride was silent.I came to the United States from Mexico in 1998, when I was 18. I come from a humble background, five brothers and sisters, from an indigenous family. I always wanted to help my parents out, but nobody would give me work in Mexico, so I decided to cross the border. I went first to Los Angeles, then I went to San Jose.Once I was there, I got my chance – two jobs, working six days a week at each of them. I worked at McDonald’s, starting a shift at 5am and getting out at 2pm, then I went to work in a taqueria from 5pm until 11 or 12 at night. It was really tiring and stressful. The work had to be done really quickly, and one of my jobs was washing the dishes, so I would get home and my clothes would be dirty and damp, but I would just fall asleep sitting down on the sofa. But when I got my paycheck I’d feel so pleased, because at least I knew my parents would have something to eat.That was when I met my children’s dad. He worked at the taqueria and was an undocumented immigrant from Mexico too. I would get out really late, and when I’d leave at midnight he would give me a ride home. We started hanging out, and then it turned into a relationship. He was deported in 2012 – one day he left for work and didn’t come back. The kids still talk to him, but he’s not really part of our lives any more.One Monday in the detention facility, an officer walked around and called out names. There were nine of us. We were told we’d have to get up at 3am because we were going to be taken away. This feeling of fear came over me – normally they would only take people out at that time of night when they were going to be deported. They said: No, you’re actually going to be transferred. The facility had gotten too full.They drove us to Gilroy and put us in a small van to transfer us to the next place. By this time it was hot outside, over 100 degrees, and there were too many people to fit inside. We were squeezed in, shackled at the wrists, the waist, the ankles. There was no air conditioning, and it was even hotter inside the van than it was outside. It was like getting in a furnace everything was so dark. I felt like I was choking.That’s when the chaos started. One woman was older, she had diabetes, she started feeling dizzy and throwing up. Another lady was claustrophobic, and she started screaming and tearing off her clothes. We hadn’t had anything to eat, and they didn’t give us any water – all we needed was just a single drop of water—and we were all still chained up, handcuffed, our clothes drenched in sweat, banging on the grill shouting, saying, We can’t breathe! Then one woman just passed out. We couldn’t tell if she was alive or dead. We started telling the driver, Please! Stop! Somebody’s unconscious! I couldn’t breathe any more. I thought I was never going to see my kids again. But he didn’t stop the van, he just told us to shut up. He just sat there, driving and texting on his phone. I think we’re only alive by a miracle.Sometimes I thought it was going to be my last night in the cell. I’d be mentally prepared, I’d go to see the judge, optimistic that something would happen. Then it wouldn’t, and I’d leave feeling even worse, because we had nothing concrete. But the worst thing was that I couldn’t be there when my kids needed me. All of their birthdays, Thanksgiving, Christmas. Those were the days I would just cry and cry. I worked cleaning the toilets for a dollar a day – nobody else would do it, but that dollar was money I could use to make a phone call to speak to my children. One minute costs 10 cents. When I called them I was desperate to have a long conversation, but I couldn’t afford it. They’d say: When are you coming home? We’ve been alone for a long time now, what’s happening? I’d try and dodge the questions, tell them to be good and to stay out of trouble. Daisy, my youngest daughter, would just cry. My heart was broken. Then the phone would just go dead, and I’d have to borrow minutes from someone else because I couldn’t let the conversation end like that. When you are detained, you don’t see the daylight. You’re stuck in the process. When they would take us to a court appearance, they would chain us up: at the hands, the waist, the ankles. In reality, we were only being taken to a different room in the detention center – we would only ever talk to the judge by video link. But we’d be shackled the whole time.They never gave me an interpreter at court hearings, so I would try and understand what the judge was saying by looking at her face. I used to see how she would talk to other people she would act much more patient with some of them than others. For me, her body, her behavior … they were very harsh. I would see the reactions on her face, it heightened my fears.To them, I was a single mother who had started using alcohol. I’d never drunk a drop before, but I was having problems sleeping because of anxiety – and after a long shift one of my co-workers offered me a beer. I started drinking to help me sleep, and that’s when I got a DUI. I know I made mistakes, but I’d taken parenting classes. I’d done a rehab program. I wasn’t drinking anymore. But in court they would say I had no right to be free because I was a danger to society. They’d say: Imagine what could happen if she was released and then went and killed someone. It really darkened my feelings. I used to think: Am I a risk to society?I never really slept for a whole night while I was there. When it was hot at night, the officers would turn off the air conditioning. The mattresses were made out of plastic, and they would get so hot. So we used to clean the floor with our sanitary towels and then sleep on the floor because it was made of concrete, and so it was colder. I felt like I was choking.There were a lot of nightmares that something would happen to my kids. I’d wake up at three in the morning, the anxiety running through my head. I would close my eyes and think I was about to fall asleep and then the nightmares would start again. Sometimes I’d dream that I’d been released and then open my eyes and all I’d see is the wall and I’d realize that I was still in detention.They would let you have a paper and pen in your cell, so I kept a journal. It helped to write my experiences and feelings down. But the trauma is never going to go away. One day, when I feel ready, I want to sit down with a coffee and go through it and read it over. I’m not ready yet.One day, after 11 months in detention, they put on the shackles, put me in a van, and drove me to the detention facility in San Francisco. I was taken into a room and they started giving me documents to sign. You’re about to be released, they said. Who are you calling? Does your lawyer know?I was afraid. I thought: If I answer these questions wrong, maybe they’ll send me back. I couldn’t believe them. But then they took off the shackles, led me out through this huge door, pushed me out, closed it, and just left me there in the street.I saw this Mexican man walking by slowly, he looked so happy, I could see him just enjoying his liberty. I was thinking: Does anyone know about me? It was only when I saw my lawyer coming down the street, when I was able to hug her without anyone yelling NO TOUCHING!, when I could walk about without shackles, that I was finally able to believe.Right now my goal is to be with the kids, support them, help them stay in school. It was a long time I was gone, and for now I am free – but they were put in a difficult place. My youngest daughter always cries, she wants me to sleep in the bed with her every night because she’s worried she’ll wake up one day and I won’t be there. I’m relieved, but I still feel like a prisoner – without documentation, I’m not allowed to work, I’m not allowed to drive, and I don’t have anyone to really talk to. If I get scared, or if I have a strange feeling, I just text my lawyer.The process is difficult, but the hardest thing is the uncertainty. Not knowing. When you’re in detention, they own you. You’re impotent. They take a hold of you. And that’s where the uncertainty comes in. You don’t know if it will be weeks, months, or years until they make a decision. It becomes difficult to tell reality from fiction. It changes your state of mind. It’s like you are dead, but actually you are alive. It’s like when they put meat in the freezer. You’re stuck in time.Floricel Liborio Ramos is one of 50,000–70,000 undocumented immigrants who have been denied bond hearings by the US government.

But the teacher said that I should forget it, because Indians were only fit for giving birth.”Twenty years later, Cruz is an anthropologist and curator at the Gustavo Paige archaeological museum – and she has played a key role in a project bringing together archaeologists, historians and astronomers to help solve a 500-year-old enigma.The investigation focussed on rows of cairn-like pillars – known in the indigenous Quechua language as the saywas, or markers – which are dotted throughout the desert, close to the ancient pathways of the Qhapaq Ñan – an Inca road network stretching from southern Colombia to central Chile.Dr Cecilia Sanhueza, of Chile’s Pre-Columbian Art Museum, had studied the saywas for some 20 years.But their true purpose was elusive. They were built in the middle of the desert, too sporadic to be milestones, and little use as signposts. “They had to have another function,” said Sanhueza.Sanhueza turned to the illustrated chronicles of Quechua nobleman Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala and 16th-century Quechua-Spanish dictionaries, which suggested that many saywas had a calendrical, astronomical and religious purpose. On the winter and summer solstices, the sun god, Inti, was believed to “rest” atop them.Sanhueza approached astronomers at the nearby Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA) and European Southern Observatory (ESO), where astronomers Sergio Martin and Juan Cortés ran simulations of sunrises on selected dates – and found that the sun appeared to align perfectly with the markers.“It was completely different to what we normally do,” said Martin. “But by collaborating we were able to understand the saywas more deeply.”It seemed that – somewhat akin to Stonehenge – the saywas had a simultaneous calendrical, ritual and political purpose. The uncannily precise solar phenomenon above the Inca stonework was designed to broadcast the “sacred power” of the Inca, even 1,000 miles away from Cuzco, Sanhueza suggested. Others marked borders between different climactic zones.Meanwhile, Cruz interviewed retired nomadic llama herders who had trudged the Qhapac Ñan a few decades ago. “I wanted to understand what the Inca would have experienced if they passed through here in winter,” said Cruz.The team braved extreme heat, freezing cold and altitude sickness to properly survey the saywas for the first time in over 20 years. Finally, on the autumn equinox in 2017, they waited for sunrise at a site called Vaquillas. Cruz performed a small ceremony with coca leaves. As if on cue, the sun rose directly atop the line of the saywas. “It was a very emotional and beautiful moment,” said Sanhueza. Three months later, on the winter solstice, they observed the same phenomenon at a separate site.But the alignment of a third location remained a mystery. Cruz, recalling childhood family rituals observed in honour of Pachamama, the Andean earth mother, on 1 August, suggested observing them on that date. The suggestion paid off. “Being behind the saywa and seeing that the sun rose exactly above it … it was incredible,” said Cruz.Cruz is recruiting local volunteers to help preserve them.The findings – announced in April this year – are a personal vindication. But they are also likely to fuel growing interest in the distinct indigenous heritage of northern Chile. “We’re from an Andean culture that has its own vision,” agreed Esteban Velásquez, former mayor of the nearby city of Calama and a congressman for a new regionalist movement. “Today, we’re writing and recovering our own history.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3566599.1531739352!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin water restrictions to be reviewed next week","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPressure will be cut to homes and businesses for seven hours each night from 10pm until 5am. Photograph: Frank MillerWater restrictions in the greater Dublin area will be reviewed in a week by Irish Water. On Friday the water utility said night-time restrictions would be put in place, from 10pm to 5am, across the city centre and in 33 suburbs in Dublin and Wicklow from Monday. Irish Water said the restrictions will be reviewed next Monday. This morning senior management met to discuss the water network difficulties, brought on by the recent high temperatures and sustained drought. The management team reviewed supply levels to over 100 under-pressure water schemes across the country. Since a critical high point in late June, where demand outstripped the supply capacity of the Dublin network, the amount of water being drawn down by homes and businesses has declined. A national ban on households using their garden hosepipe introduced at the start of the month is in place until the end of July. The greater Dublin water network can supply 610 megalitres of treated water a day. Some 590 megalitres was used on July 3rd this dropped to 568 ml a day by July 9th and was down to 559 ml yesterday. Some 3,500 restaurants stand to be affected by the Dublin night time water restrictions. Most residential suburbs affected are in Dublin, but Bray, Co Wicklow, is also included in the conservation measures.Pressure will be cut to homes and businesses for seven hours each night from 10pm until 5am, Irish Water has said. Most customers will experience low night-time pressures but “no loss of supply”. Supply to some customers on high ground and at the remote end of networks may reduce to a “trickle” at the kitchen sink.Irish Water have said a sustained period of rainfall over two weeks would be needed to address supply problems. The knock-on effects of the drop in supply due to the exceptional period of warm weather may affect the water system into the autumn. The next level of restriction would see the reduction in supply extended from 9pm to 7am, but Irish Water said this is not currently planned.

Photograph: Cyril Byrne Irish Water is to be separated from Ervia and established as a single national utility to operate the State’s water services.The proposals, which were presented to Cabinet by Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy last Thursday for approval, will come into effect by 2023, The  has learned.It is understood the plans, approved by Cabinet, will allow for Irish Water to become solely responsible for the production, distribution and monitoring of drinking water and for the provision of public waste-water services.Currently the utility has service level agreements (SLAs) with local authorities to operate such services on its behalf, but under these new proposals such arrangements would be brought to an end by 2021.The ending of the agreements with city and county councils is likely to result in job losses at local authority level, but the precise details or the scale of such are not yet known.Government figures said Irish Water was always a standalone entity within the Ervia group. However, given the abolishing of domestic water charges and planned new oversight measures of Irish Water by the Comptroller and Auditor General, it “is time to separate it out of Ervia entirely”.Ending the SLAs early will help “deliver savings for taxpayers”, a senior source said.Irish Water has estimated it could result in savings of €70 million per year.The board of the utility and Ervia are to be formally notified of the changes this week, it is understood.The decision follows weeks of water shortages across the country, and comes as restrictions on water pressure begin to take effect across the greater Dublin area on Monday.Meanwhile, Mr Murphy has confirmed he has received advice from the Attorney General Séamus Woulfe on potential wording for a referendum on enshrining public ownership of water services in the Constitution.In a letter to the Oireachtas Committee on Housing, the Minister said he could not accept the initial wording proposed by Independents4Change TD Joan Collins as it may have unintended consequences for group and private water services.However, in his correspondence, Mr Murphy added: “My intended outcome is to be in a position to bring a recommendation to Government on a wording capable of being prepared as an amendment to the Bill. My aim is to have clarity on the intended approach when the Dáil resumes after its summer recess in September.”Last October, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar ruled out a referendum on ownership of the public water system. However, the Government’s Water Services Policy, published this year, contradicted that position.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps "},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Slaughter at breeding farm carried out in response to killing by crocodile of local manVernon Unsworth \u0026lsquoastonished and very angry\u0026rsquo over baseless tweets by billionaireThe results in four upcoming by-elections could change the course of politicsThe Wild Boars soccer team owe their lives to some expert ers\u0026rsquo improvisational skillsPolice link arms and battle Sharif supporters to escort 68-year-old former PM off aircraftEscalating tensions over return of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif ignite violenceFinding boys and coach alive nine days after entering cave \u0026lsquowas a massive, massive relief\u0026rsquoThe best of muscle and brain power from around the world helped save the 12 boysOusted prime minister Nawaz Sharif faces arrest on his return to country on FridayProtection of monument from environmental degradation a \u0026lsquohopeless cause\u0026rsquo, court rulesTwelve boys and coach lost average of 2kg during ordeal but they are in good conditionAyumi Kuboki arrested on suspicion of injecting disinfectant into intravenous bagsWorkers scrambled to reach high ground after water levels rapidly rose in cave systemAll boys in hospital majority are in good health - two have suspected lung infectionsQ+A: How can children who can\u0026rsquot swim be brought through miles of dark, subterranean passageways?Japan struggles to get help to victims of the country\u0026rsquos worst flood in 36 yearsAn evening of exploration ends up in disaster after heavy rain traps 12 boys and coachLiu flies to Berlin for medical treatment after eight years under house arrestTokyo Letter: Proving rape is very difficult here but one victim, Shiori Ito, is undeterredOfficials say conditions still good for rescue mission, with water levels in cave declining"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3566483.1531728008!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"justine greening calls for second brexit referendum","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tConservative Party MP and former cabinet minister Justine Greening (in pink) sits with Pamela Castle, as former Conservative Party leader William Hague speaks to Mary Cameron, mother of former Prime Minister David Cameron in the Royal Box on Centre Court at Wimbledon. Photograph: Peter NichollsReutersJustine Greening became the most high profile Conservative to endorse the idea of a second referendum, to end what she said would be a likely parliamentary deadlock over Brexit, warning that Theresa May’s Chequers plan did not represent “a workable compromise” that a majority of MPs could get behind.The former education secretary and remain supporter said that Ms May’s plan was “a fudge I can’t support” and, in a blow to the prime minister, said it amounted to “the worst of both worlds” - complying with EU rules without the influence of being a member of the multi-country bloc.Writing in the Times, the MP for Putney said that “only solution is to take the final Brexit decision out of the hands of deadlocked politicians”.She added that voters should be given three options on the ballot paper, and a first and second preference vote to ensure that the preferred model achieved more then 50 per cent of the final vote.The choice should be between “the PM’s final negotiated Brexit deal, staying in the EU, or a clean Brexit break and leaving with no deal”, Greening wrote in a break from her party’s position that is likely to be picked up by the campaign groups seeking to overturn Brexit with a second referendumUnhappiness from the Tory right over May’s proposed Brexit deal, and their threats to vote it down when a promised meaningful final vote is put to parliament around the turn of the year, have prompted growing speculation that the prime minister may struggle to ensure whatever she negotiates will be approved by parliament, placing Britain’s future relationship with Europe in limbo.Other high profile figures have started to use the belief that there is political deadlock to advance arguments for a second referendum.On Sunday, Tony Blair said in a post on the website for his Institute for Global Change that there should be another national vote, because there will no Commons majority for May’s Brexit, a no deal Brexit, or for remaining in the European Union.Blair also hinted there should be three choices for voters: “The question may be complicated because it really involves three choices: Clean Break, ‘soft’ or stay. But the complexity is not insuperable,” he said. – "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/06/27/TELEMMGLPICT000167700946_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqY0XMnE4berkpvWhc-fw2CHnYvmhjopjBo5wANh2lLAw.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"turning fan around can help sleep better heatwave","story":"digitalservices@telegraphThe unusual method of pointing a fan out of a window can help you keep cool in a heatwave digitalservices@telegraphAs Britain continues to bask in blue skies and wall-to-wall sunshine, cryophiles with a penchant for cooler climes have been exchanging tips on how to stay cool during the heatwave.They range from the bizarre, like eating chilli and painting your roof white, to practical tips likes wearing light clothes and keeping your curtains closed during the day.One particularly unconventional method championed by a New Zealand-based eco-warrior involves pointing an electric fan outside of your open bedroom window to keep cool at night.  Nelson Lebo, an eco design adviser for Palmerston North city council in the South Pacific nation’s North Island, explains the clever fan trick works by blowing the warm air stagnating inside your property outwards, while pulling cooler air in.He explained the fan should be set up just after sunset, when the temperature outside becomes cooler than inside your home.Mr Lebo, who is originally from the US, said he learnt the trick from his grandmother who used it in New Jersey during the Seventies.“Everyone knows about cross ventilation,” he told The , “but it only works when the wind is blowing and then it works best when there is a direct route for the wind to blow through a home.“What the fan does is, it forces cross ventilation, even when the wind is not blowing. A fan will also pull air around corners, as in our home.“The overall goal is to pull the warm air out while drawing cool air in once the outdoor temperature drops below the indoor temperature. Fans use hardly any power compared to AC.”  Mr Lebo added that while pointing the fan outside the window may seem counterintuitive to some, it is a lot more effective than the standard method.“The standard way simply pushes warm air around the room but we perceive it as cooling because moving air feels cooler than still air,” he says.“My technique of forced cross ventilation actually cools indoor air down by drawing in air cooled for free by nature that is just outside from late afternoon onward.”It could be time to turn that fan around He added: “Just make sure the bedroom windows are the ones with the air entering! The outward facing fan must be in the far end of the dwelling.”The UK enjoyed the hottest day of the year on Tuesday as temperatures peaked at 30.6C (87F), with the heatwave showing no signs of abating.Donald Trump hopes for \u0026#39extraordinary relationship\u0026#39 with Vladimir Putin as two leaders meet for key US-Russia summit - live updatesCrimea, Iran and nuclear arms: What Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin want from Helsinki talksComment: Donald Trump likes Putin because he is a Brexit president – pulling America out of the old orderTrump sends envoys to Afghanistan to open talks directly with Taliban over peace dealMeet the gamers willing to spend hundreds of thousands living their video game fantasy Children to learn perils of social media at school, Education Secretary announcesChicago police release bodycam footage of fatal shooting that sparked a weekend of mass protestsIndonesian villagers kill nearly 300 crocodiles in revenge attackDuke and Duchess of Cambridge release new picture of laughing Prince Louis after his christening Drinking full-fat milk could protect against strokes, study suggestsGareth Southgate has Tube station renamed after him as England return from Russia Elon Musk launches baseless Twitter attack on Thai cave rescue er Queen watches over Prince Louis in official christening portrait - but can you spot Her Majesty?Pussy Riot claim responsibility for World Cup final pitch invasion North Korean claims he was duped into defecting by South Korean intelligenceMotorway speed limits could be lifted on weekendsThe 8 things you might have missed this weekendComment: Hipster-fying the village fair would be a fete worse than deathWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"digitalservices@telegraphHead of Digital Publishingdigitalservices@telegraphMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

He studied for 13 years at the Dar ul-Uloom Deoband, the most influential Muslim seminary in south Asia, speaks fluent Pashto and wears local dress.After working for the BBC\u0027s Pashto service in the 1990s and creating another popular soap called New Home, New Life, he then set up his own production house, Pact Radio, in Jalalabad in 2004.With a passion for Pashto radio and a mission to find “traditional solutions for modern problems” his soaps have in the past tackled women\u0027s rights, militancy, the rule of law and health.Health issues have also become a favourite of British soaps, with Coronation Street and The Archers recently tackling sepsis and several storylines revolving around mental health.“You can actually bring up issues in a soap opera which you can\u0027t bring up in day to day journalism,” he said.Recent plot lines have seen characters debate polio vaccination and question hearsay that drops are harmful. Extremists have preached against the global vaccination programme and health workers have been attacked in Afghanistan and Pakistan.“Pashtuns will just believe anything you tell them and that\u0027s the whole problem actually.“Whatever the facts say, they don\u0027t believe facts, they believe hearsay, they believe rumour and that\u0027s what the problem with polio is. If someone says its Bush\u0027s urine, okay it\u0027s Bush\u0027s urine.“There is a saying in Pashto that if you tell a Pashtun a dog has bitten off your ear, then the Pashtun will run after the dog, but won\u0027t check his ear to see if it\u0027s there or not.”Mr Butt still ides his time between Afghanistan and India.“It\u0027s a very infuriating country but then at the same time you feel that you are doing some good,” he said.But the country\u0027s complexities can provide great radio, he said.“You listen sometimes to The Archers and it\u0027s all \u0027the Environmental Agency is going to be coming and checking your land, because your land is contaminated\u0027 and this and that. It\u0027s really boring actually, the Archers.

What goes on down there affects the whole of the earth in which we live.Captain Robert Falcon Scott led a team of British explorers to become the first to reach the South Pole, on what was his second Antarctic mission.His party arrived at the South Pole on January 17 in 1912, but found they were beaten there five weeks earlier after Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen led his own expedition. Scott and his explorers died on March 29 while returning from the trek after a planned rendezvous with support teams failed.Speaking after tug boats had manoeuvred the vast steel hull down the slipway at Cammell Laird, Sir David said: “It was an extraordinarily emotional moment.

that\u0027s all he is, Unsworth added.Unsworth, who lives part of the year in Thailand, took part in the gargantuan 18-day effort to retrieve the 12 boys and their coach, a mission that ended on July 10 when the last five members were extracted.The boys got stuck in the cave after wandering in on June 23 after football practice only to find themselves trapped by rising floodwaters.Musk released images of a device by SpaceX and The Boring Company designed to help in the Thai cave rescue bidThey were found nine days later on a muddy embankment several kilometres (miles) inside.The unprecedented operation to haul them out involved sedating the footballers and swimming and carrying them through tight, waterlogged passages.The boys are all in good health and expected to be released from the hospital Thursday.Musk\u0027s tweets prompted condemnation from those who took part in the mission to save the boys.Claus Rasmussen, a Danish national and instructor at Blue Label ing in Phuket, called the allegations inappropriate and praised Unsworth\u0027s role in the rescue.He was the guy who effectively mapped most of that cave, he told AFP.He was one of the driving forces in getting everything done and clarifying for us ers what was going on.Musk had earlier provoked condemnation after tweeting that the Thai rescue chief, who had declined the submarine prototype offer, was not really in charge of the operation.Please review our commenting policyDonald Trump hopes for \u0026#39extraordinary relationship\u0026#39 with Vladimir Putin as two leaders meet for key US-Russia summit -

Jessica-Anne Allen, owner of Cheese and Biscuits Café in Queensland, Australia, has described how she was approached by a male customer in the café to complain that he was upset by a woman in the coffee shop breastfeeding her child nearby. The customer asked the café owner, 29, to tell the mother to cover up. When Mrs Allen refused to do so, he took matters into his own hands and challenged the woman himself. Staff at the café then asked the man to leaveA woman who claimed a Primark security guard had forcibly removed her child while she was breastfeeding has admitted to perverting the course of justice. Caroline Starmer sparked a series of headlines after claiming on Facebook that a store guard had taken her nine-month-old daughter Paige away from her. The mother from Leicester then repeated her claims in a number of interviews, before Primark denied the incident and handed CCTV over to the police to show there was no evidence to support the allegations. Appearing in Leicester Crown Court, she admitted the charge of perverting the course of justice by not telling the truthPope Francis has become an unlikely advocate for public breastfeeding, by encouraging mothers to feed their babies in the Sistine Chapel. During a ceremony in Vatican City on Sunday, the Pope baptised 32 babies and told their mothers: “If they are hungry, mothers, feed them, without thinking twice, because they are the most important people here”Facebook has changed its community guidelines to allow users to post photos of breastfeeding. The change comes as the wide-ranging #FreeTheNipple online campaign has built pace in its attack against guidelines used by social media websites to regulate nudity – from photos of breastfeeding to topless photos post by singer Rihanna’s on her now defunct Instagram account. Facebook’s Community Standards, which outline what users are allowed to post, never included a outright ban on photos of breastfeedingThe manager of a public swimming pool at the Lux Park centre in Liskeardhas been forced to apologise after he told a mother to stop breastfeeding her son by the waterside. 23-year-old Rebecaa Hough of Torpoint, Cornwall, was feeding 10-month-old Max a few steps from the main pool, when the manager told her to carry on in the changing rooms in case the infant was sick into the water.

Sir Simon Burns, a former transport minister, spoke on what he called a “controversial subject” in a debate in making Westminster more family-friendlyA Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) spokesperson, who also asked to remain anonymous, said:\u0026nbsp“The resolution as originally drafted placed unnecessary hurdles for mothers seeking to provide nutrition to their children. We recognise not all women are able to breastfeed for a variety of reasons. These women should have the choice and access to alternatives for the health of their babies, and not be stigmatized for the ways in which they are able to do so. HHS was not involved in the diplomatic negotiations.\u0026nbspThe move follows a trend of the Trump administration to play into considerations of private industry and eschew cooperation in multilateral organisations and treaties like the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), the global UN Paris Agreement on climate change, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato), and various trade agreements.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

My dad would probably like him. However, the reason I can imagine his frowning ghost at my shoulder is that it is Matt, and not me, who is painting my ceiling.I can imagine his look now, part bemused, part amused, part disappointed. Why, he would wonder, unless you are in traction or have had to undergo emergency amputation of all your limbs, would you not paint your own ceiling?Indeed, it’s something\u0026nbspthat doesn’t sit happily with me, hence the nervous hovering. I am wretchedly keen to be useful. Does Matt want a third cup of coffee? Should I move something? Maybe it’s enough to stand there, staring critically at the ceiling, rubbing my chin? Matt, on the other hand, really just wants to get on with the job at hand.My dad wouldn’t have been nonplussed at me getting someone in to do a simple job through any ideas of masculinity or anything like that it’s simply that he was a builder by trade and almost supernaturally handy.\u0026nbspA trait that, despite my best efforts over the years, has utterly failed to manifest itself in my genes.We are a nation of DIYers. Last month, the Confederation of British Industry revealed that there had been a boost in two areas of the retail economy, online shopping and DIY kit. This is in spite of – or perhaps because of – households still feeling that their incomes are being squeezed. Internet shopping tends to give access to more bargains while DIY is obviously a cheaper way of improving your home than getting tradespeople in.Aside from being innately handy, it was certainly economics that drove my father to carry out any household job himself, and in my own years of DIY that’s definitely been the driving force. In the 17 years or so we’ve lived in this house, there have been few projects I’ve not decided I can tackle myself. Several have ultimately required the intervention of a specialist. But I can’t deny the rosy glow of satisfaction I got from giving it a go.YouTube has allowed us to attempt jobs normally way out of our league (Getty )A survey a couple of years ago by Armstead, which supplies products to the building trade, revealed that while Brits love a good project in the home, we’re essentially a nation of bodgers, with one in ten of us actually injuring ourselves doing DIY, and there being on average more than 31 million unfinished jobs in British homes started by amateur improvers but never completed. What’s more, we spend on average almost £250 getting an expert in to fix what we’ve made a dog’s dinner of.A godsend to bodgers like me has been YouTube, where you’ll find helpful videos on pretty much anything you care to do, even projects that really should be way out of your league. YouTube has helped me take most of my house apart and put it together again in a way that you’d almost never notice.The only thing I won’t tackle is anything to do with the car, on the grounds that bodging a vehicle could quite easily end up in death or destruction of myself, my loved ones and innocent passers-by. This is despite my dad once nearly falling off his chair when I told him I’d paid a mechanic to service my car. “Why can’t you do your own oil change?” he’d said wonderingly, as though that was the most natural thing in the world, like breathing.Nomadic Homes – Architecture on the moveSo, if I’ve been so willing to roll up my sleeves and dig in, why is Matt up a ladder doing something as simple as painting my ceiling white, which is surely the easiest of DIY jobs imaginable, the sort of thing your nan could do?It’s a good question, and my nominal retirement from DIY has coincided with me becoming a full-time homeworker. Which, you might think, is a curious state of affairs. Working from home should, theoretically, give me more time to embark on projects, made doubly inviting by the lack of the usual spectators at evening and weekend fixtures who want to know if that thing really fits on the other thing, or if you should strictly be hitting that pipe with a hammer, or pointing out that you’ve missed a bit.But with the freelance life comes a more acute realisation that time is money. It’s all well and good when you’ve got a salaried job, spending a Saturday afternoon or a Wednesday night trying to work out how to re-hang the bathroom door after you’ve taken it off to saw a bit off the bottom, but once you start devoting time out of your freelance working day to this, it means you’re not actually earning money.Allied to that is the realisation that all those trades out there are in the same boat. We’re all in the gig economy together. I could take a day off to do a job and potentially lose a couple of hundred quid in earnings. Or I could pay someone else a couple of hundred quid to do a job. Swings and roundabouts, but ultimately am I not\u0026nbspsupporting my freelance colleagues by doing the latter?We spend an average of £250 getting someone in to fix what we have broken (Getty)But the primary reason for deciding to leave it to the experts is my long and ignominious list of failures, near-misses, and unfinished jobs, of which I will avail you of just a sample selection.There was the time the mixer tap broke on the kitchen sink. I resolved that we needed a new tap. The only thing was, I couldn’t get the tap out of its housing. Enterprisingly, I decided to remove the entire sink and had to walk across Bradford city centre with it on my shoulder to a plumber’s merchants to get a new one and plead with them to get the knackered one off.There is the ongoing situation with the bedroom, and I’m risking an almighty row by even just mentioning this. I decorated it from top to bottom last year, promising faithfully that I would tidy up all the scrappy bits of wallpaper hanging off corners and under coving and on skirting boards. I have yet to fulfil this pledge.And as an addendum to this sorry tale, there’s the issue of the DIYer being tempted to buy cheap to make the project even more cost effective. In this particular case, instead of going for more expensive and easier to hang paper where you paste the wall, I opted for the least expensive option which involved soaking in wallpaper paste paper that was already as thin as a Rizla\u0026nbsppaper, resulting in it ripping, tearing and sliding all over the place. For bonus points I used a knackered old stanley knife to cut the excess off. If you’ve ever tried to use a blunt craft knife to slice wet paper, you’ll be aware that the result looks like something chewed by a pigeon.DIY faecal transplants can spread diseases, experts warnI have umpteen stories of decoration going wrong, such as the time I decided to wood panel the walls in what was to become our baby daughter’s bedroom. I dutifully spent a day gluing the panelling all along the bottom half of the four walls, and got up the next morning to find it had all fallen off.But perhaps the most ill-advised project I ever undertook was tackling the problem of low water pressure in the bath, which involved taking apart an actual gas boiler. Don’t worry, I watched at least three YouTube videos before embarking on it, and I never actually touched any of the gas bits, just the water stuff. And it did actually work. But it’s not something I would advise, or would indeed have another go at.\u0026nbspAll of which is why Matt is up his ladders in my living room, painting. We had previously got him in to plaster the ceilings to render the horrible stipple effect completely smooth (as an aside, something I once briefly tried to do myself with a big tub of ready-mixed stuff. It all ended up on my head after resolutely refusing to stick). After watching him do it, I bit the bullet and asked him to come back and paint the ceilings. And now he’s going to come and paint the walls.I still do the odd thing, of course yesterday I put up two new light fittings, which took precisely three times longer than I thought it would and was accompanied by much sweating and cursing. But I make no apologies for retiring from the bulk of DIY. In fact, it’s hugely liberating.

With an estimated worth of $1bn, a trade body and a recognised marketing award, they have finally been tamedClick to followThe Independent OnlinePep talk: Kendall Jenner’s Pepsi advert was pulled shortly after it aired for appearing to trivialise demonstrations tackling social causesLast month, the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity –\u0026nbspthe biggest grouping of advertising and marketing people you could ever hope to avoid –\u0026nbspintroduced a new award: the Social and Influencer\u0026nbspcategory.Yes, those\u0026nbspgurning thumb-flexers forever punching #YOLO, #instacool and #nofilter into their smartphones as they plug products have come of age.\u0026nbspInfluencer-dom is now a fully-fledged industry. Yet only a year or two ago we were told by many (rather gleefully in some cases) that the influencer was dead or at least in crisis.Earlier this year, this seemed to be confirmed as the owner of the White Moose Cafe in Dublin turned the tables on\u0026nbsp22-year-old YouTube vlogger and influencer Elle Darby, by exposing her demand for five free hotel nights in return for exposure.His public burn spoke for many: “If I let you stay here in return for a feature in a video, who is going to pay the staff who look after you?” The twitter-mob turned on influencers. Who were they? How do they get away with it? Do they actually earn money?When the influencer marketing industry began (around 2008-10, attest the form’s historians) the notion took hold that like celebrity endorsement before it, aspirational people could become marketing tools, accessing the consumer mind as if a recommendation from a friend.YouTuber with 139,095 subscribers, was refused a free hotel stay (YouTubeElle Darby)As one observer put it:\u0026nbsp“They emerged almost overnight and in 10 years have gone from a small network to a worldwide community.” Some sources suggest that there is now a baseline of 1.1 million influencers worldwide.\u0026nbspMediakix estimated\u0026nbspthe industry was worth more than $1bn\u0026nbsp(£750m)\u0026nbspin 2017. Malcolm Gladwell’s coinage, “the tipping point”, was used a lot in meetings.\u0026nbspBy about 2014, a baffled world had started to understand influencer marketing, but the industry’s breakthrough year was probably 2016 when, as Hamda Issa-Salwe of Bravado, part of Universal Music Group, found when she did a research thesis called Investigating the Use of Influencer Marketing on Social Media.“It began to soar,” she says. “Google classified ‘influencer’ as a breakout keyword with a 5,000 per cent month by month increase in the number of times the search term ‘influencer marketing’ was typed.”Also in 2016, it was established that Kendall Jenner was paid an estimated $300,000 per social media post. Advertising agencies took more careful notice of influencers and Instagram –\u0026nbspfounded in 2010 – became the key station of the social media cross, along with other key platforms\u0026nbspsuch as YouTube, Snapchat and Pinterest.Even the fustiest legacy-media type can now see the point. The barrier to entry is low. All you need is a smartphone and a certain brio. And the research seems to add up. According to Nielsen, 84 per cent\u0026nbspof consumers trust opinions from people they know, while 70 per cent\u0026nbsptake action based on other consumer’s opinions online.vlogger Zoella reportedly has a net worth of £2.5m (InstagramZoella)The Association of National Advertisers found that 75 per cent\u0026nbspof members already work with influencers, and the growing industry will take 20 per cent\u0026nbspof the total global marketing budget by 2023.No wonder that 82 per cent\u0026nbspof millennials hope to become influencers at least, according to a survey by London-based dating app CLiKD.\u0026nbspSo the money’s talking, and influencers can do well.It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rentAs Anthony Svirskis, CEO\u0026nbspof TRIBE and a juror on the\u0026nbspSocial and Influencer award says:\u0026nbsp“On a post by post basis, brands should expect to pay £50 for someone with 3,000 followers and upwards of £300 if someone has more than 100,000 followers.” Small wonder the market is seething with aspirant influencers.\u0026nbspYet influencers are still derided as being without any particular skills: even that they’re the apotheosis of the entitled “Me” generation, spreading paid-for blandishments in vocal-fry vlogs on YouTube.While it’s hard to blame someone who travels the world in return for Instagram snaps, is there an influencer bubble waiting to burst? Paul Dyer, of marketing company Lippe Taylor, believes it will, as trust has disappeared from the sector in the sceptical Facebook-Cambridge Analytica era.“There is tremendous value in influencer marketing,” he said recently. “However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls out.”Indeed, there have been several influencer #epicfails, perhaps the most notable being\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspFestival, the ill-fated 2017 Bahamas musical festival that paid Kendall Jenner and Bella\u0026nbspHadid\u0026nbspto drum up support.\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspbombed and the repercussions are ongoing.There’s also an undergrowth of freebie-hunting influencers harassing hotels and providers. Some hotels – the\u0026nbspDusit\u0026nbspThani\u0026nbspresort in the Males among them – now use weeding out processes. “When they work hotels love them,” says one travel PR.\u0026nbspThe influencer economy … is a market irrationality. Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money“Influencers are uncritical and often share films and photographs that would otherwise be paid for. But there’s a trust problem.”There are other cracks in the influencer edifice as brands begin to ask questions about the business efficacy of influencers. As publicist Mark Borkowski says:\u0026nbsp“More brands are beginning to realise that influencer activity doesn’t necessarily drive ROI.”And the pain is on both sides, he adds. “It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rent.” Anti-influencers are coming of the woodwork –\u0026nbspand they’re not all crusty oldies with a grudge.“The influencer economy … is a market irrationality,” wrote Sam Biddle of Gawker in 2016. “Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money.” As for bots and fake followers, that’s a real problem.Fyre Festival attendees locked in airport ‘for their own safety’At Cannes, Unilever’s chief marketing officer Keith Weed called for industry action to clean out the influencer stable, and vowed never to use influencers found to be buying followers.So the sands are shifting. Hamda Issa-Salwe says that while influencer activity remains hard to define and audit, it’s still growing. Although trust and authenticity (the great influencer bon mot) are major factors, brands still spend a lot on influencers: after all,\u0026nbspInstagram has more 800 million monthly active users.And the influencers themselves are fighting back. It’s a new industry: of course legacy dinosaurs wouldn’t get it. It’s just another marketing tool. And what are –\u0026nbspsorry, were –\u0026nbspnewspapers half the time, but a vehicle of paid-for information?“Indeed, there’s a growing distrust of traditional media advertising,” says Harry Hugo, cofounder at The Goat Agency, Europe’s leading influencer agency, which claims to be growing at a rate of 600 per cent\u0026nbspa year.“Just look at the rise in ad blockers, investigations into media transparency and big networks like WPP struggling. Influencers can be one of the most trusted, and therefore highest converting, information sources for people.”\u0026nbspAlso, we jeremiahs just don’t get the craft and graft that goes into an influencer’s brand persona, adds Florencia Lujani, influencer marketing manager at agency We Are Social London.“People struggle to see why brands would pay money to partner with influencers for something which appears relatively simple,” she says. “But it takes time and effort, talent, passion and commitment.”\u0026nbspAnd even the thorny issue of disclosure –\u0026nbspthat is, whether you should know what someone is being paid to promote –\u0026nbspis a smaller issue than is often supposed, says Svirskis. “Influencers are very compliant of requirements to disclose and are often represented by an influencer agency.”There is tremendous value in influencer marketing. However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls outMost importantly of all, influencers make money for clients. Currently, the average ROI of influencer marketing is £7 back for every £1 spent, says Amelia Neate of Influencer Champions.\u0026nbspSo,\u0026nbspdo you have to be pretty? “It’s definitely not reserved for those with looks,” says Svirskis. “The cheesy smiles are long gone.” It’s about style and tone, he says, and as the industry matures it’s moving beyond lifestyle products like travel, beauty and fashion to finance, automotive –\u0026nbspeven dog food.“There are new influencers emerging every day, in every single vertical,” says Lujani. They’re marshalling themselves into communities: mummy bloggers, healthy eaters, sports fans – why, possibly even news organisations.\u0026nbspWith the maturation of the influencer world comes a shakeout: Influencer 2.0, if you will. Sheer numbers don’t matter so much anymore.\u0026nbspThe smart talk is now about engagement and micro-influencers,\u0026nbspthose with fewer than 100,000 followers and possibly as low as 5,000, but with proper peer recognition.\u0026nbspYouTuber Alfie Deyes came under fire for his recent video, ‘How I lived off £1 for a day’ (YouTubePointlessBlogVlogs)“Data shows that influence by measure of engagement actually increases as the audience size reduces,” says Svirskis. In a hedge-betting strategy, brands now prefer to work with 50 micro-influencers rather than one mega-influencer, and brands are taking influencer management in-house as influencer marketing moves into the mainstream.If children are obese then blame food manufacturers, not ZoellaInvestigation promised into Trump campaign data firmThree arrested after Facebook group raid cannabis field – only to Sexist men who abuse women on Facebook and Twitter are compensating“Most new industries go through periods of turbulence as they form foundations,” says Svirskis, who thinks that many of today’s influencers will become tomorrow’s creative directors and entrepreneurs.He has a point. Beauty influencer Emily Weiss now has a cosmetic company, Glossier, and within the last couple of weeks M\u0026ampC Saatchi bought a stake in two influencer agencies.

They have come – and will continue to crowd in for the next two hours – for two main reasons.The first is because the choice of groceries inside this unrefurbished warehouse is phenomenal: crates of fruit and veg, baskets of breads, a deli counter offering pies and pates and pickles, tinned goods and cakes. Lots of cakes. Very occasionally, you can get blast chilled chicken from Nando’s here – “although,” says Smith, “it flies out the door pretty quick”.The second reason all these customers keep turning up is because of the price for everything in here: “Pay whatever you feel.”People come in, fill their baskets\u0026nbspand then hand over as much or as little money as they want. Some people do weekly shops for a fiver, and that’s fine.What’s the catch? There is one, of course. Everything here has been salvaged from supermarket bins, restaurant leftovers and wholesale market waste. Edibles otherwise marked for landfill have been saved and piled high. Smith once got called by a food bank with a surplus of donated tins and nowhere to store them. He collected them in his van, stuck them in store and watched them get snapped up.Local branches of Morrisons, Sainsbury’s and M\u0026ampS all have his team take their unwanted goods. Today\u0026nbspthere is an abundance of potatoes here. “Too wonky even for the wonky range,” Smith explains with a shrug.This, then, is the Real Junk Food Project, an enterprise created by the 32-year-old one-time executive chef with the aim of reducing the UK’s vast quantities of food waste, while helping people struggling – or simply seeking a bargain – in austerity Britain. And it’s proving more popular than he ever imagined.After he set up his first Sharehouse shop in Leeds in autumn 2016, the scheme has expanded at a rate the Big Four would be proud of. Six more stores have opened in the interim – this one in Sheffield, along with Birmingham, Brighton, Durham, Wigan and Chester – with three more, in Halifax, Wakefield and Keighley scheduled for late summer. Each one saves an estimated six tonnes of food from going to landfill every week. Along with a series of Real Junk Food cafes and Real Junk Food school projects (more of which shortly), Smith estimates that food goes to 25,000 people across the UK every week.And it’s all sorts of people too: families, old folks, millennials and\u0026nbspthe just about managing. Last month, this particular outlet had a massive batch of asparagus come in. “We put it on social media and it went a bit crazy,” says store manager Jo Hercberg. “We got a whole new foodie customer base from that.“We make no bones about what we offer,” she continues. “Our stock is what most shops would chuck out. Maybe it’s passed its best before date, maybe the lettuce has a browned at the edges, maybe a tin is dented. But we trust our customers to understand that. They do what human beings have always done: they use their sight and smell, and if something seems okay, they’ll have it.”The contradiction that inspired the Real Junk Food Project is a bizarre but real one. Every year, according to UN figures, 1.3 billion tonnes of food are thrown away. Yet, simultaneously, some 800 million people across the planet are malnourished.This paradoxical waste and want first struck Smith while working on an Australian farm five years ago. The surplus there was so pronounced they would feed courgettes to pigs because it was cheaper than buying feed.“But in Sydney there are hundreds of people on the streets who can’t afford to eat,” he says. “It’s that contradiction I want to solve.”Sharehouse store (The Real Junk Food Project)He returned to his home town of Leeds and founded the project. It was a cafe\u0026nbspat first, a single outlet opening for a couple of lunches a week in a converted corner shop in the city’s Armley district. But it used the same principle that\u0026nbspremains at the heart of the enterprise today.“Myself and volunteers persuaded local supermarkets to let us take what they were throwing out,” he explains. “It was pushing an open door because disposing of that waste costs money, so having someone come and take it was a win-win. Then we cooked it all up at the cafe.”Menus varied depending on what they were given: curries, lasagnes and\u0026nbsphot pots. Diners were told to pay what they wanted\u0026nbsp– or even asked to volunteer themselves – in return for the meal.\u0026nbsp“It was just an experiment,” says Smith. “We couldn’t believe how quickly it took off.”Within three months a second was opened by volunteers in Bristol. Then they kept opening. Today\u0026nbspthere are more than 120 worldwide, including in Germany, South Korea and Israel.Each new venue is given basic rules to follow – 90 per cent of food used should be designated waste, for instance – but, largely, they’re left to their own devices as part of a franchise system.The other thing which happened was Smith started receiving calls from places asking him to take their food waste – which finally led him to the idea of his supermarket-style shops.Meijer and Jo Hercberg at the\u0026nbspSharehouse store (The Real Junk Food Project)“We were getting too much food just for the cafes,” he says. “So why not sell it as pay-what-you-feel groceries? The variety of places it comes from, you wouldn’t believe. I got a call the other day from a shipping yard. Someone hadn’t paid rent on a container and they wanted it emptying. It was thousands of tins of peas.”He points it out in the warehouse, which is attached to the shop. “Want to take a couple of cans?” he asks.The shoppers here seem to love the place. They come in, browse, basket in hands, taking their time, asking volunteers question about produce and products.One is Fareesa Awan, who lives near the Sheffield store. “A friend told me about it,” she says. “She told me you go in looking for a bargain but end up walking out with a week’s worth of food. I thought, ‘That I have to try’. It’s wonderful. I don’t do my shopping here because you can’t always guarantee what they will have in but I’ll come and pick up some fruit, veg, cakes\u0026nbspfor the children – and my husband. I like to cook and there’s always something unusual here which you can pick up for next to nothing and then experiment with.”I ask if it bothers her that some of it is passed its best before date and she laughs. “I trust myself to decide what’s OK,” she says. “These dates – who decides them?\u0026nbspThey’re not necessary. Besides, once it’s in our house it does not last long. Big family, lots of visitors. The food soon goes, so it is good to get it cheap.”Back in store, the big question might be: just where does the money come from? Each shop typically has an average of 10 staff (along with dozens of volunteers) and requires large premises, so how does it fund itself?“With difficulty is the honest answer,” is Hercberg’s rueful reply.Each enterprise runs its own finances. Some run paid-for catering events. Others have contracts to provide after-school dinner clubs. One or two have been given council or charitable grants. Customers are often generous when paying for their shop.“But it’s a struggle,” says Hercberg. “There’s not much money giving away food – who’d have thought?”Legally, there have been issues too. The Real Junk Food Project works in the grey area of food regulation, and in April last year\u0026nbspthe Leeds store faced prosecution from West Yorkshire Trading Standards. It was found to have 444 items beyond their expiration date – distinct from “best before”\u0026nbspdates in that, while the latter is advisory only, it is illegal to supply a food which has passed the former.“But, as we said, our food has fed more than a million people and not one has ever reported getting ill,” says Smith. “So we know what we’re doing.”In the end, the project was given a slap on the wrist and told not to stock food beyond its expiration date in future. “I still don’t agree with that,” Smith says. “These dates are arbitrary. They’re there to scare you into buying more often, but this is the law so we comply.”UK news in picturesTheresa May arives to open the Farnborough AirshowNovak Djokovic lifts the trophy after winning the men\u0027s singles final match against Kevin Anderson at WimbledonFar-right protesters demanding the release of jailed EDL founder Tommy Robinson brought chaos to central London after blockading a bus being driven by a woman in a headscarf during the marchUS President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa during their meeting at Chequers in BuckinghamshireUS President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump arrive in the UKEngland manager Gareth Southgate and his players look dejected after they lost their World Cup semi final match against Croatia at Luzhniki Stadium in MoscowSerena Williams celebrates after winning against Camila Giorgi during their women\u0027s singles quarter-final match on the eighth day of Wimbledon.

I’ve spoke to party leaders – I won’t say who – and they’ve told me there’s no votes in this. I’ve been invited down to Westminster but I’ve stopped going. They listen, ask questions, and then do nothing.”He thinks about it all for a moment and, here, amid mountainous piles of pesto and mayonnaise, seems momentarily overwhelmed.“But we keep at it,” he says. “I’ve been doing some consultancy work with a supermarket. Their managers in London got alarmed by how much food they were giving us every day. I think they calculated it up and realised how much money they must be losing by throwing so much stuff out. So, they asked us in as a consultancy to help them reduce their waste. That will mean less for us to take away each day but that’s a good thing.”Again he pauses, offers me my pick from a crate of olives. “I suppose the ultimate aim would be to put ourselves out of business because there is no more food waste,” he says. “If we ever achieve that, then I’ll consider it a job done.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Her family moved back to the UK months after her birth.Unlike her UK born siblings, who have never faced problems with their status, she has been told she is not British on the grounds that she was not born within the nation’s\u0026nbspboundaries.Vitalis’s\u0026nbspfather\u0026nbspOswald Joseph\u0026nbspVitalis, who flew in\u0026nbspthe RAF\u0026nbspfor 13 yearsMs Vitalis lived in the UK until the age of six, when she moved to the Caribbean with her mother and siblings to go to school there. She returned when she was in her early 20s and began working as a nurse.She faced no problems for 17 years, during which\u0026nbspshe gave birth to a daughter in 1999 and a son in 2005. Her partner later moved to the US after the couple split.In 2013, when Ms Vitalis\u0026nbspwent to collect her 15-year-old daughter from Gatwick Airport after a spell living with her father, she was stopped by\u0026nbspimmigration officials and taken to a detention centre.“I took the day off work and went to collect my daughter from the airport. I was waiting for six hours and then I heard them calling my name on the tannoy to go to a gate. There were two officers,” said Ms Vitalis.“They said they were arresting me and that I was liable for deportation, and that they were going to take me to a detention centre. They took me away.Windrush generation: Home Office ‘set them up to fail’, say MPsHome Office attacked by MPs over detention of Windrush citizens“I couldn’t believe that my father served this country and I was in this predicament with all this embarrassment.”Ms Vitalis was later reunited with her daughter, but she was issued deportation proceedings and therefore was dismissed from her NHS job.She then entered into a “downward spiral of depression”, during which she started gambling and became involved in illegal fraudulent activity, taking money from patients to fund her gambling addiction.“I was able to do some agency work while my case was ongoing. During that time I lost my dad, I lost my brother to suicide, I lost my grandmother. I think I went into a downward spiral because of this immigration thing,” she said.She was charged with 14 counts of fraud totalling £13,052.88 and was sentenced to 28 months in prison in March last year.“I know I did wrong. I did get into gambling. It was really getting out of hand. It got really, really bad. I didn’t object to my sentence or appeal it because I knew I had done something wrong. I served my time.”After Ms Vitalis\u0026nbspserved her sentence,\u0026nbspthe Home Office attempted to deport her.\u0026nbspShe is currently waiting for an appeal decision in October\u0026nbspand is unable to work or claim benefits in the meantime.In deportation papers issued to Ms Vitalis in March 2017, the Home Office claimed that despite her children’s\u0026nbspfather living in the US, there was “no evidence that the care of the child will\u0026nbspbe anything other than safe and effective when you are deported from the UK”.“It’s really frustrating because the information is there.\u0026nbspI was British by birth and not by descent. If my dad hadn’t been working in Germany I would be like my other siblings,” Ms Vitalis\u0026nbspsaid.“They keep saying it’s because I was born in Germany, but why was I born in Germany? My father\u0026nbspwent through so much he was the only black person on his battalion and my mum was the only black person living on the military base. My sister remembers the racism that went on in there.“Having gone through all of that, if my parents knew I was having this problem now… I can’t work, I can’t claim any benefits, I can’t study – what am I supposed to do? I feel embarrassed.\u0026nbsp“This has affected my children – they have no status. My son wants me to get him citizenship. I can’t pay £2,000 for something that I should not have to pay for. They’re suffering because of me.”The case has emerged amid mounting criticism over the\u0026nbspHome Office’s hostile environment following the\u0026nbspWindrush\u0026nbspscandal, which exposed that thousands of Commonwealth citizens had been wrongly targeted by immigration officials, with some detained and deported –\u0026nbspcosting then home secretary Amber Rudd her job.Labour MP David Lammy told The Independent\u0026nbspsplitting children from their parents was “symptomatic of the cruel and inhumane outcomes of the Home Office’s hostile environment”, and said his office had dealt with many cases similar to that of Ms\u0026nbspVitalis.\u0026nbspWindrush generation: threat of deportation from UKThe ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica, with 482 Jamaicans on board, emigrating to Britain.Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 landed them at Tilbury.

But the UK does not have any way of actually getting them into space, meaning they have to be shipped elsewhere to be launched.Now the British government hopes that this announcement and others will allow the country to launch its plans for a flourishing space industry in the UK.“The announcement of a strategic partnership between Virgin Orbit and Cornwall Spaceport is great news for the region and the UK’s ambitions for regular, reliable and responsible access to space, said UK science minister Sam Gyimah.\u0026nbspThis partnership could see Virgin Orbit’s innovative horizontal launch technology helping the UK’s small satellite industry access space from the convenience of a Spaceport in Cornwall.We will work with both partners to support their ambitions, as we take the next steps in our national spaceflight programme as part of the government’s modern Industrial strategy.”Horizontal launches such as those that will happen in Cornwall\u0026nbspare different from the famous flights that takeoff from Kennedy Space Center and elsewhere. Instead of standing up from the beginning, the rocket is attached to a plane and carried up into the air – from there, the rocket separates and flies off into space, carrying the satellite with it.Virgin claims that horizontal launches will allow for cheaper spaceflight, since they mean launches can take place away from busy launchpads.There will soon be vertical rockets taking off from the UK, however, if a plan to launch a new spaceport in Scotland is successful.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

CCTV footage shows the attack and moment he was left for dead.The tragic death that triggered the #JusticeJunior campaign has inspired New York State Senator Luis Sepúlveda and Assemblyman Victor Pichardo to propose Safe Havens for Endangered Children legislations, also called \u0027Junior\u0027s Law\u0027.Speaking alongside some of Junior’s family members outside at a press conference at the bodega where he sought help, Mr Sepulveda said more needed to be done to protect children in danger.We want to make sure that any business owner or their employees who encounter a situation involving a minor who has been abused or may be in danger has a duty to try to help,” he said. Community businesses should be safe havens for our youth. They should promptly notify police.”\u0026nbspHe added that another measure of the bill would ensure that small businesses to have first aid kits on hand “to help those who are injured to save lives”.The proposed bill has the support of Junior’s father Lissandro Guzman, who said in a statement: I feel very content and with all my heart I hope the bill that carries my son\u0027s name gets passed so it can prevent situations like this from happening again and so we can create more security for our beloved children.”If passed, businesses that fails to “provide a safe refuge for a child who had physical injury inflicted upon him or is in imminent danger of such injury until authorities arrive,” would face penalties.In the wake of Junior’s murder much of the anger was directed at the bodega, where he had sought refuge from the gang members. Surveillance footage from inside the Cruz and Chiky Grocery store showed the moment he rushed\u0026nbspinto the store and jumped over the counter.Store owner Modesto Cruz said at the time that he tried to help the teen by letting him hide behind the counter, but the gang threatened him.World news in picturesHugo Lloris lifts the trophy after France beat Croatia 4-2 in the World Cup final in the Luzhniki Stadium in RussiaGermany\u0027s Angelique Kerber beat seven-time champion US player Serena Williams in the Wimbledon final.

She was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia and died a few days later. Gemma was just 40 years old.Simon had to tell their eight- year-old son Ethan that his mum was dead, and the two of them have been trying to cope ever since.Everyone mourns the death of someone they have loved and adored in different ways.There’s no timetable for grief, and no “one size fits all” way to get through the whole soul-crushing experience. For Simon, the death of his wife felt like a physical illness and being in intensive care.He decided to leave his job at Sky Sports to be with Ethan full time and they now both have an unbreakable bond.Simon is obviously very ­protective of his young son, but that works both ways.Ethan will often tell his dad that he is OK even when he is really suffering and missing his mum, because he doesn’t want Simon to worry about him, or to add to his dad’s pain.He sounds like a remarkable young lad who is a credit to both of his parents.For Simon, one of the worst things about Gemma’s death is the acute loneliness.After he has put Ethan to bed and he is in the living room, there’s no Gemma on the sofa watching TV or just chatting about the mundane events of the day.He often breaks down while making dinner for two rather than three, or emptying the dishwasher or doing other household tasks they used to share but that he now has to do by himself.It’s those little things that bind us together, and that we miss so very much.Simon told me that there are those who have simply not been in touch since Gemma died. It’s not because they don’t care, but because they just don’t know what to say to him and Ethan.It was interesting to hear him say that the most comforting sympathy he received was from a woman he bumped into in the supermarket, who knew Gemma from meeting her at the school gate.She simply told him that it was “utter crap, totally unfair and completely f*****g hellish”.And it is.When someone you love dies, it is utterly s**t and it does no harm to say that.Telling a bereaved person you are sorry for their “loss” is well meaning and comes with the best possible intentions, but we “lose” car keys, credit cards and dog leads.Those we loved are ripped from our arms and our hearts and it feels like the end of the world.Those feelings don’t really ever go away — you just somehow learn to live with them.We need to somehow try to make that process more bearable. So don’t avoid a devastated husband, a mother whose child has died or an elderly widow who is mourning her soul-mate.Talk to them and check in with them, because one day you will need them to comfort you.Essie, portrayed by Kaye Wragg, above, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and had to undergo a complete hysterectomy, giving her no chance of ever having a much-yearned-for child of her own.Kaye gave her usual cracking performance, utterly believable and deeply moving. This storyline will have helped raise awareness of a cancer that is known as the “silent killer”.I hope we see more of Essie, as I always looked upon her as the quiet heart of Holby.If you missed this episode, make sure you go to the BBC iPlayer to catch up.WE’VE all had them – those house guests who overstay their welcome and are a complete pain in the bum.The disgruntled visitors who don’t like the food and complain the bed is too hard and won’t do a hand’s turn to help with the dishes or buy the odd loaf or bottle of wine.The ones where you do a jig when they have left and vow: “Never again.”So I sympathise with poor Mr and Mrs May, who have been putting up with the Trumps – veritable guests from hell.He’s the worst possible bullying boaster and you can imagine him dominating the conversation and being demanding and boorish.She has all the personality of a fembot and looks bored and disinterested at all times.Having the Trumps to stay was never going to be the easiest of rides for our PM and her husband.Aside from the thorny political discussions – and this week he has ripped up the rulebook and sold her down the river – there’s the distressing business of making small talk with this odd couple.I can just imagine Donald blowharding and manaplaining over pre- dinner drinks while poor Theresa becomes even more strained and develops a red stress rash on her neck.Her hubby Philip probably ended up talking to Melania about the weather.Trump has to be kept entertained like some bored little emperor, but you don’t want him to have too good a time that he will want to visit again soon.It’s a thorny one.Theresa has had the toughest of times recently, but she is made of strong stuff. While she might look a little tired around the eyes, our PM is no quitter – unlike the men who have let her down and put their own interests above those of the country.It might be trivial but I hope our PM can take some comfort in the fact she looked sensational in that sizzling red dress she wore to greet Trump.Theresa won the style battle with much younger ex-model Melania, who looked like a cut-price Belle from Disney’s Beauty And The Beast.Although Trump got it spot on as the Beast.FOR once this week, it wasn’t some poor actress who’d eaten a bowl of pasta for lunch and had a small, rounded belly being body-shamed.Russell Crowe was the subject of gleeful mirth by people who feel better about themselves by mocking others.Admittedly, the former buff star of Gladiator has piled on the pounds and looks like Thomas Markle’s older, larger brother. But by all accounts he’s chunked up for a movie role.Gladiator was 18 years ago and even Hollywood stars grow older and bigger. It appears, however, that equality in Tinseltown now means both women AND men being derided for not remaining visions of perfection and having the audacity to age.TODAY Serena Williams strides on to Centre Court to play for her eighth Wimbledon Ladies singles title.I have never seen a more majestic athlete on a tennis court since the heady days of my girl crush, Martina Navratilova.Serena is simply sensational and being a mother has made her even more hungry to win.It’s astonishing to think that just ten months ago, after the traumatic birth of her daughter and following multiple surgeries, she could hardly walk.Despite all she has gone through, I’ve never seen any athlete better prepared physically but also mentally.Serena can taste that title and no one is going to get in her way.I don’t envy her opponent, Angelique Kerber, today as it’s not just Wimbledon up for grabs.Serena also has her 24th singles grand slam in her sights, which would equal the record set by Margaret Court.Mrs Court was a hell of a tennis player but, as it turns out, not a great human being.She is a self-styled pastor in Australia and her views on gay rights and same-sex marriage are deeply distasteful.She claimed transgender children are the work of the devil, leading Martina Navratilova to label her “racist and homophobic”.So for that and so many other reasons, I’m firmly backing Serena today.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was also Donald Trump’s view in The Sun.But yesterday the PM convinced him otherwise. And she insisted “there will be no limit to the possibility of us doing trade deals around the world”.How are both positions possible? How will we enjoy such flexibility?How will our courts be supreme if we still heed ECJ rulings? How will we have total control of immigration if some EU workers can still come in as they see fit? And what will she do next if Brussels rejects it all?Leave voters’ rising anger is fuelled by the suspicion that behind the repeated assurances we are being stitched up.Mrs May must explain why we’re not. Explain how she talked round a doubting Trump. Explain how we will seize the opportunities Brexit presents. If she wants to admit her plan isn’t ideal but it’s the best there is, this is her moment.It’s time for honesty, not spin. The PM owes it to Britain. DO Remainers really not get the difference between President Obama giving his view on Brexit and President Trump doing so?Obama was egged on by Downing Street in 2016 to try to skew a democratic vote in favour of one side. He told us, falsely, that backing Brexit would put us last in the queue for a US trade deal.Trump’s argument in The Sun two years AFTER the vote was simply that Leave won and he doubted Mrs May’s strategy would fulfil on the verdict.He may be wrong.

Because once Trump replaced him, Britain hit the front of the US queue — a position only now threatened by staying tied to Brussels.Happy to help, Remain fans. WE wondered if President Trump might try to shoot the messenger when he realised how embarrassing his world exclusive Sun interview was to his host Mrs May.We’re used to that, of course.

Just as it happened, I turned my head to see it just drop to the floor and smash everywhere.Instinctively we got up to investigate what happened and it dawned on us that it had to have been the heat that smashed the glass.He continued: At that point then it was a matter of Oh my god, how are we going to pick all this up? because it had shattered into so many pieces and some of the shards were a metre away from the table so we knew this had actually exploded and not just shattered.David said as the eight-piece Miami table set, which they bought a year and a half ago, was sitting on grass, it took three days to pick up the tiny fragments of glass.He said: Myself and my wife were cutting our fingers open trying to pick all the glass because we didnt want the kids playing anywhere near it.Its crazy, you dont think about this when youre buying a table set at all. I would have thought in this day and age there would be a protective lawyer or film on it so if it ever smashed or cracked that it would still stay together, I didnt think it would shatter into a million tiny fragments, he said.He added: Its lucky we werent sitting there. Its crazy to think that only a couple of days before we were all sitting there eating at the table. Obviously if that had happened while one of my kids was leaning on it, they would have been straight through it into all that glass.It comes after outraged mum Paige Angela Tompkins from Leicester hit out at Asda after her table from the same Miami range burst into shattered glassed on her decking.He continued: “When I called them initially they didn’t seem that interested, they told me, ‘You won’t be getting a refund.“I was shocked that they didn’t at least apologise and didn’t want to recall the tables.”A spokesperson for Asda told The Sun Online: We take no shortcuts when it comes to the safety of our products, which is why we only use toughened glass in our garden furniture and test to both British and European safety standards - meaning incidents like this are rare.Wed like to reassure all our customers that this product has passed all safety requirements and of the 45,000 glass top tables we sell each year there have only been a handful of examples when this has happened.The danger of exploding glass in patio tables was highlighted by The Sun last year.Experts suggested they shatter as glass expands and contracts in hot weather."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT0004197344411.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"two words for our young three lions england team thank you","story":"Perhaps not in the way that we dreamed football would come home – because of course the Fifa World Cup trophy itself is destined to go to Paris or Zagreb.But over the past month football has come home to the country that gave the game to the world.For at this World Cup, we fell in love with football all over again.Gareth Southgate and his young England team reminded us of the game’s power to move us, to inspire us, to fill us with pure, undiluted joy.And a sense of national pride.An unapologetic love of your country.Patriotism felt like the most natural thing in the world.The flag of St George has been everywhere. In pubs, in shop windows, on cars, on scaffolding, on hats and shirts and flying above 10 Downing Street.And nobody was sneering at our flag now. Just guessing, but I doubt if anyone will be sneering at that flag any time soon.Not even Labour’s Emily Thornberry.What a ride. What a month-long high. What an adventure for those of us who are old enough to remember 1966 and also for the children who will remember this as the first World Cup they watched.Fifty years from today, those kids will still remember how they felt when England won a penalty shootout against Colombia, and when Kieran Trippier bent it better than Beckham after five minutes against Croatia.And they will remember to their dying day exactly what it felt like when we knew that England was not going to the final.The tears are real but so is the pride. And the pride — even more than the disappointment — is the overwhelming emotion today.England played with big hearts, true grit and the fearlessness of youth.They come home not as legends to rival the boys of 1966 but with their heads held high. Their nation is proud of them.And yes, it is only a game. It is not a war. Nobody died.But at a time when our nation is more horribly divided than at any time in modern history, we were reminded what a great country this still is, and how much we have to be proud of, and how much there is to love.And it was not your imagination — England was united once again.“Our country has been through difficult times in terms of unity,” said England’s young manager in his thoughtful, softly spoken manner.“Sport — football in particular — has the power to help that.“We’re a team that, with our diversity and our youth, represents modern England.In England, we have spent a bit of time being a bit lost as to what our modern identity is. I think we represent that modern identity and hopefully people can connect with us.”Gareth Southgate is right about the healing power of sport. This World Cup brought us together in a way we’ve not experienced since the London 2012 Olympics.But 2012 was before the bitter wounds of Brexit.It is Gareth Southgate himself who is the main reason this country has rallied around this England team.Southgate with his courtesy, his decency and his Yoda-like intelligence.Southgate,  who talks about “owning the process” and “managing our energy” — it is quite difficult to imagine the former England manager, Big Sam Allardyce, being comfortable with that kind of 21st Century dialogue. Southgate with his dapper shirt, tie and waistcoat combo, as suave as a suburban James Bond.Southgate who carries himself as if he is the living embodiment of Rudyard Kipling’s most famous poem.“If you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those imposters just the same . . . you will be a man, my son!”Even as England were celebrating their very first win in a World Cup penalty shootout, Southgate took time to comfort Mateus Uribe, one of the two Colombian players who had missed their penalty.This was more than an act of sportsmanship. It was an act of humanity.Because we all knew that Southgate has been there.The abiding memory of Gareth Southgate as a player — the one moment that everyone remembers — is in Euro 1996, with his shoulders sagging inside a grey England shirt and his spirit smashed after missing a penalty (we never recall the players who were too cowardly to step up and take a penalty — history gives them a pass).Stuart “Psycho” Pearce had known penalty redemption — missing in Italia 1990 but scoring in Euro 1996. Southgate’s redemption has been infinitely more convoluted.There was an image that went viral of the 25-year-old Gareth Southgate after just missing a penalty in 1996 being comforted by the 47-year-old Gareth Southgate who shook up the world in Russia in 2018.If this World Cup has gone some way to healing our divided nation, it has also gone a long way to healing the pain that Southgate has endured for half a lifetime.It is true what they say ­— success is not final, failure is not fatal.The manager was well served by this young team, who were light years away from the central casting image of the Premier League footballer — the pampered, wag-shagging, blingtastic, Bentley-crashing, multi-millionaire airhead.These England footballers — even the star striker, Harry Kane, who would cost a minimum £100million if Real Madrid came knocking — were clearly of and from the working class.They hail, every one of them, from modest beginnings. Most of the squad — 15 — paid their Premier League dues while out on loan in the lump-kicking lower leagues.“Barnsley, Leeds, Bolton, Blackburn,” said Southgate. “We’re lads who have come from those places.”This England team are not ordinary boys — they are elite professional athletes — but they have all been ordinary boys, and there was a humility about them, a work ethic and total lack of pretension that made you believe they will never forget their roots.And if they come from everywhere from the North East to Yorkshire to the Essex/East End borders, they also come from every kind of family.There were those who grew up in solid nuclear families with both mum and dad and siblings present, and those who were raised by single mums, and those who are from domestic chaos.Raheem Sterling’s father was murdered in Jamaica when he was two, and Dele Alli escaped the turmoil of his riven family life by moving in with his best friend’s family when he was 13.Their backstories are as diverse as our nation, but every one of them has grafted to get to the top.Sterling was berated for having an assault rifle tattooed on his leg but nobody ran harder or longer for the England cause than Raheem.When you watched his mesmeric, lung-busting runs, how could you not warm to him?How could you not forgive one dumb tatt?“Good lads,” said Southgate of his England squad, those boys from the Mersey and the Thames and the Tyne, from Bury and Leeds and Sheffield, and once again he said it all.They are good lads and we cheered them, and celebrated with them, and in the end, we shared their pain because it was our pain too, even in defeat against Belgium yesterday.They were a band of brothers and for one magical sun-drenched summer month, they lit up our nation.This World Cup was a roller-coaster ride that grabbed you by the scruff of your replica Three Lions shirt from the first match against Tunisia and refused to let go until the end of extra time against Croatia.They came SO CLOSE — Croatia led England for 11 minutes.That’s how agonisingly near we were to saying, “Bonjour, Monsieur,” in today’s World Cup final.It was gloriously entertaining, but it was also far more than just entertainment.It felt like Gareth Southgate and that young England team represented the very best of us.We learned — or we were reminded — that decency is not weakness, sportsmanship is not soft, and you need never feel one twinge of shame if you give your all.And we learned that we love our national game with a passion that can never be denied.I honestly thought we would win it.Typical England fan!I believed that this was the year we added the second World Cup winner’s gold star to the team shirt.When the England players were chucking around rubber chickens at a training session just before the Croatia semi-final, I thought it was a tension-busting masterstroke.It wasn’t to be.But this England team have been through the full range of human emotions — from joy to despair, hope to disappointment, and this country has been with them every step of the way.The struggle continues, the dream will never die.I reckon 50,000 England football fans will already be making plans to go to Qatar in 2022.This World Cup will be remembered for breaking our hearts and uniting our nation.And a grateful, emotionally exhausted country has just two words for those Three Lions.Thank you. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One able to set its own laws and control its borders.The idea of taking diktats from European courts, having no border control, and being unable to strike free trade deals — while paying Brussels £39billion — is not the Brexit people voted for.Mrs May should look at our poll today to see the bloody nose the Tories could be dealt at the next General Election.Unless she starts being honest with the country, then she will cause further disillusionment among voters, potentially opening the door to Jeremy Corbyn…Ushering in Britain’s first Marxist PM should not be a legacy Mrs May wants. EXPECTATIONS were not high before the World Cup began — for once.With the pressure lifted off the players’ shoulders — combined with Gareth Southgate’s leadership — our boys played with passion and determination.Despite yesterday’s loss to Belgium, they were real ambassadors for England.Meanwhile, the FA are set to apply for the 2030 World Cup. Good. About time.The tournament will mark a century since the first one in Uruguay. So where better to host it than in England, where the beautiful game was born?We have the stadiums, the transport and the passion — attributes shamefully ignored in recent years by Fifa.It is time that football’s greatest show finally came home. THE British divers who risked their lives to save the trapped Thai boys are true heroes.Their extraordinary, selfless, mission was utterly courageous, especially after a colleague died during the operation.Such heroics should be recognised.

The tweet has since been deleted.The American businessman then attacked the 63-year-old expat claiming he never saw him at the cave during the high-profile rescue mission.When asked by journalists about Musks outrageous comments, Unsworth said today: Its not finished....I believe he has called me a paedophile.Well, by definition, you’re rescuing 12 young boys, by definition that puts everybody in the same context.He revealed he is now considering legal action against Musk adding I think people realise what sort of guy he is.Unsworth said he had saved copies of Musk’s tweets  - seen by many of his 22m followers - and believed he had “lost the plot”.“I have a lot of support from people around the world astonished by his unfounded comments,” he told the .“I don’t know the guy, never met the guy, and don’t want to meet the guy,” he said of Musk.Social media users have now expressed their outrage over Musks comments.One person tweeted: I used to admire #elonmusk and what he contributes to technology, calling another person a pedo without proof is disgusting.Another said: The implication that the only reason someone would be an expat in Thailand is because theyre a pedo is so offensive on so many levels. An insult to Thailand and its wonderful people.Claus Rasmussen, a Danish instructor at Blue Label Diving in Phuket, called the attack “inappropriate” and praised Unsworth’s rescue role: “He was the guy who effectively mapped most of that cave.”The Brit, who co-led the operation to save the schoolboys from the cave, sparked the tirade when he told CNN Musks sub plan  had absolutely no chance of working.The submarine, I believe, was about five-foot-six long, rigid, so it wouldnt have gone round any corners or any obstacles, he said.In a string of tweets responding to a journalist mentioning Mr Unsworths comments, Musk said: Never saw this British expat guy who lives in Thailand at any point when we were in the caves.Only people in sight were the Thai navy/army guys, who were great. Their navy seals escorted us in - total opposite of wanting us to leave.Water level was actually very low \u0026amp still (not flowing) - you could have literally swum into Cave 5 with no gear, which is obv how kids got in. If not true, then I challenge this dude to show final rescue video.Huge credit to pump and generator team. Unsung heroes here.You know what, dont even bother showing the video. We will make one of the mini-sub/pod going all the way to Cave 5 no problemo.Mr Unsworth spent years exploring the Tham Luang cave system where the boys were trapped for 17 days, meaning he had expert knowledge that was vital to the rescue.He acquired his love of potholing in the Yorkshire Dales and was the first foreign rescuer at the scene.The expat told the Sunday Times: “The search was going nowhere, the conditions were worsening by the hour and we had no idea where the boys were.“We needed the expertise of top world-class cave divers to look for these kids and we needed it fast. If we hadn’t called them in then, it would have been too late.”Unsworth knew some of the chambers where they might have sought refuge would by then have been completely flooded.“If they’d been caught in the wrong place, they’d have stood no chance,” he said as he reflected on the operation.Unsworth, who is not a diver, was among the teams that carried stretchers during the three-day operation. He was among the last to leave the cave on Tuesday night.A former Thai Navy SEAL died while working to rescue the boys. Samarn Kunan ran out of oxygen while attempting to return to the command centre. He was 38.Musk was earlier mocked online after the lads were rescued from the caves without the help of his submarine, he has now hit back claiming the dive teams encouraged him to continue the work.Earlier Musk tweeted a screenshot of an email from Stanton who co-lead the rescue dive team telling him it was absolutely worth continuing with the developments of the submarine.He claimed Mr Stanton was the actual expert in the rescue rather than Mr Unsworth and that he was told his submarine may well be used."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000162755476.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"hatton garden brian reader free","story":"The 79-year-old — leader of the gang of villains dubbed the Diamond Wheezers — left Belmarsh prison in London last week.Reader, who has suffered prostate cancer and a series of strokes, was released with remission after half of the six-year, three-month sentence he got for the £14million safe dep­osit box centre break-in.He has since been enjoying the summer sunshine in the garden of his home in Dartford, Kent, alongside relatives and friends.He was also driven on outings in his son Paul’s red ­Porsche sports car.But there was anger he was not kept in jail over the millions of pounds worth of gems, bullion and cash still outstanding.Reader had faced a further seven-year term if he could not pay a £6.5million confiscation ord­er imp­osed on him and three other ringleaders of the 2015 Easter bank holiday heist.He should have faced a return to jail at the end of this month when the pay-back time limit expires.But the villain has been given leave by the Court of Appeal to ­challenge the order and it is understood he will remain free until that is settled.No date has been set for an appeal hearing.Former Flying Squad commander John O’Connor said: “He ruined people’s lives and until he pays back that money, or tells the police what happened to it, he should stay in jail.”Due to his health, Reader received a sentence seven months shorter than his fellow Hatton Garden ringleaders.Last year he appeared in court in a wheelchair for a confiscation hearing — and he still walks aided by sticks.A family member said this year: “He can’t see properly, can’t hear, he is very weak and is down to 8st.”One source said of his release: “Brian is hugely relieved to be out and believed he’d die inside.He’s not a well man but is taking one day at a time and enjoying himself with his family.”GOT a story?

I wanted to sing, I wanted to perform. I wanted to go back to work on a stage in front of an audience.” Former England midfielder Jamie is now rumoured to be dating Parisian model Julia Restoin Roitfeld, 37.On Friday he and Louise were praised by a judge for reaching agreement over their divorce settlement in “the best interests of their kids.They have two sons Charley, 13, and nine-year-old Beau.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It seems they are gearing up.”The cap, backed by The Sun’s People Power energy campaign, would place a ceiling on an estimated 11million so-called standard variable tariffs (SVTs) for up to five years.In the letter seen by the Sun, Ms Perry tells the Big Six: “Value, choice and excellent consumer service should be at the heart of this.“Sadly,  it is evident that for many consumers that has not been the case.“The Government will strongly condemn any efforts to frustrate the process of putting the cap in place. Digging in to defend a hold on legacy customer groups and out-of-date practices, rather than embracing change, will only harm loyal customers. And it risks damaging the reputation of the whole sector.”A source added: “Ministers and the public will not stand for any supplier who tries to hold this up.“Suppliers should see the writing on the wall and help make this work.”The Sun demanded a crackdown on the Big Six two years ago when we revealed their SVTs were ripping off families by nearly £400 a year.Business Secretary Greg Clark accused the energy giants of “milking” millions of loyal, older customers so it could launch cut-price online deals.Iain Conn, head of British Gas-owner Centrica, blamed the price cap for 4,000 job cuts in February and has been an outspoken critic of the legislation.The Big Six have incensed critics by raising prices despite the planned cap.EDF announced a six per cent hike for electricity and gas prices last week — its second of the year.There are fears that the Big Six could drag the process out by taking legal action. They need to realise that they’ve been caught with their hands in the cookie jar and take their punishment.The Government must see this one through to the end.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There is not going to be a second referendum under any circumstances.The spokesman said Mrs May was very clear that the proposal we put forward at Chequers delivers on the will of the people in the referendum.Ms Greenings comments comes with Theresa May facing open rebellion from the other end of the Conservative party - as Eurosceptics threaten to bring down the PM over her soft Brexit vision.Meanwhile, Mrs Mays allies have launched a frantic bid to shore up her premiership - as party chiefs rang around grassroots activists and Tory members who are livid with her plans.Ms Greening - who quit the Cabinet in January after being moved from her Education brief - has sided with pro-EU Tories such as Nicky Morgan and Dominic Grieve in the Commons in recent months.But in her article Ms Greening says that it will be “unacceptable” for MPs to impose a compromise on the electorate.She said voters should be presented with three choices - the prime minister’s negotiated deal, staying in the EU or a clean break.Ms Greening is said to have the support of other Remain-backing Tories including Amber Rudd, the former home secretary.Last night at least 20 Eurosceptic Tory MPs said they were ready to flout Downing Street and back four “rebel” amendments to the Government’s Customs Bill in the Commons today.One furious MP said: “Theresa May had the chance to be the Prime Minister who delivered Brexit. Now she’s the Prime Minister who f***** it up.”Separately, the PM suffered her eighth resignation in nine days as Robert Courts, the successor to David Cameron in Witney, Oxon, quit as a ministerial aide in protest at her Brexit plan.And in his most savage attack yet, hardliner Jacob Rees-Mogg branded the PM a “Remainer who has remained a Remainer”.He wrote in the  that the nation should “rediscover the spirit of dynamism” from the Victorian era.Mr Johnson resigned as Foreign Secretary a week ago along with Brexit Secretary David Davis over Theresa May’s Brexit plans."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-vern-unsworth-elon-musk_4363298.jpg?20180716110331 ","title":"british cave diver mulls legal action against elon musk after tycoon brands him paedo","story":"Mr Unsworth said it \"had absolutely no chance of working\" and called it a \"PR stunt\".\"He can stick his submarine where it hurts,\" he added.In response, billionaire Musk, 47, referred to the British caver as \"pedo guy\" - slang for paedophile - in a series of now-deleted tweets.

The temperature when the swim began was 16C (61F), and when I came out of the water after 79 minutes it had dropped to 12C (54F). Although our images show me swimming straight towards the rocks, the tide was actually perpendicular, pushing me 90 degrees sideways.Big up to skipper Stephen Praetorius, who navigated our craft and me safely through on the morning spring tide.I have never experienced such strong currents. It was like swimming in a flooding river.This evening swim then started well - we saw pods of dolphins and a sunfish - but after that it didn\u0027t go to plan.I started swimming on the wrong current, which made me swim even slower than I would have done if there\u0027d been no current at all.After struggling against counter-eddies for nearly an hour and a half I had covered only a couple of kms.I made the call to stop and try again first thing in the morning - a move we had not planned. This means we couldn\u0027t motor to Falmouth for the evening to replace our water, power and get food. We have now run out of water and are on our emergency supply bottles, having anchored in the small village of Coverack.The plan for tomorrow is to do a swim early to make up for the lost time.:: Day three - 9 miles (14.5km)Glassy sea on a beautiful Saturday in Mounts Bay, with a perfect spring tide current, which helped propel me toward Lizard Point.The crew continued fine-tuning the jellyfish watch and are now on a rota. It is difficult to keep focus after 20 minutes and very easy to be hypnotised by the motion of the sea and you glaze over in the glare. I have an active mind while swimming and I like to keep track of my thoughts. Occasionally I stop to shout a word or phrase for the crew to write down - something to trigger my memory later.The stream of consciousness can get quite interesting!Today was the first time we have encountered big ships - there was a row of three oil tankers anchored on the eastern end of the bay. Now heading back to Mullion Cove again, we will be heading back out in the late afternoon to pick up the GPS point for the evening swim.Overall, a phenomenal morning swim and it feels as though we are banking kilometres. All happy on board.I am back in the water this evening and hopefully this will take us to the edge of Lizard Point.This evening was all about the Lizard. Do we shoot it tonight, making the best that the spring tide can give, or do we take a measured approach and leave it for the morning?Today\u0027s swim was shorter, but fast, sometimes I was swimming at over four knots - that\u0027s 7.2 kph.Overall another happy day, as we say goodbye to Mounts Bay.:: Day two - 8 miles (12.8km)Another two good sessions in the morning and evening, in very fair conditions. I will be doing two swims a day and slingshotting around Land\u0027s End.I had a few periods of jellyfish activity - the biggest we saw was longer than our shortest crew member.I was stung on my arms, which we treated with vinegar after I got out of the water - it made me smell of fish and chips!We ended up setting up a jellyfish watch, with spotters armed with whistles.:: Day one - 6 miles (9.8km) Today was a day of ironing out the swim procedures. This involved working out communication between me in the water and my team, adhering to the verification protocols, working out actual distance covered versus distance swum - it\u0027s difficult to swim in an exact straight line.In total I manage to cover 6 miles (9.8km) of my journey, although this is less than the actual distance I swam.This was the first day when all nine members of the campaign were on board, and over the next few days we will learn much about the teamwork and processes that will help us get through the entire expedition.Another first today was my first jellyfish sting. It got me right on the crotch.We ended the day by sitting at anchorage just off Mousehole, finishing up dinner and getting in an early sleep before we move back to the GPS point at 4.30 am for the next swim at 6.00am. :: The eve of the swimYou are either a pioneer or a follower you can\u0027t be both. And if you are a pioneer, you know all about worry.If something has been done before, you know it\u0027s possible. If you don\u0027t know something is possible, you worry about it.I\u0027m about to embark on a swim with significant risks and consequences - financial, reputational and environmental. So there hasn\u0027t been a night in the last month that I haven\u0027t woken up.A few nights ago I was using the worry hours to plan, and remembered something Mike Tyson once said: \"Everyone\u0027s got a plan until they get punched in the mouth.\" I have a plan to try and swim 10km per day. But when I swim into my first bloom of jellyfish, that plan will become flexible.I know that I\u0027m going to get sunburnt. I\u0027m going to be frozen, I\u0027m going to be stung, and I\u0027m going to become mentally and physically exhausted. Have I done too much preparation, or not enough?What if we get the tides wrong, get caught in a counter eddy and find ourselves going backwards? This is a notoriously dangerous coastline, with the shipwrecks to prove it.Did I mention that half my expedition team is new, and half has no sailing experience?In those waking worry hours I also remembered the Stockdale paradox. Admiral Stockdale was an American pilot who was shot down in Vietnam and spent eight years in a POW camp. He said that the people who survived had two important qualities.First, they always believed they would be freed. Second - and this is the paradox - they had no optimism. Because the people who did have optimism - the people who hoped they would be free by Easter, then by Thanksgiving, then by Christmas, and had those hopes dashed over and over again - those people didn\u0027t survive. The people who survived were the ones who confronted the brutal reality of their situation.I have to face some brutal facts when I look at the chart of our 560km swim route. This is the longest swim anyone has ever done, adhering to Channel Rules in water this low temperature. I honestly don\u0027t know how I\u0027m going to do this. But I do believe I\u0027ll see the white cliffs of Dover. So that\u0027s the paradox that\u0027s going through my mind.The swimming is only part of the challenge. We\u0027ve also had to co-ordinate with sponsors, raise funds for the expedition, recruit the right people for the team, and deal with the media... all the while juggling private lives with unexpected domestic crises. As if all that wasn\u0027t enough, after six months of campaign planning and preparation, we learned that Donald Trump is coming to London on the day I start swimming. We certainly hadn\u0027t planned on such a big media story distracting from our message.Because the message is the reason I am doing this swim. The truth is we are failing our oceans.

Piers Morgan was granted an exclusive interview with Donald Trump aboard Air Force One - a chance to quiz one of the West\u0027s most divisive leaders.  We did find out some important things from their cosy chat on ITV\u0027s Good Morning Britain, from Trump\u0027s approach to a Brexit trade deal to his views on abortion.   But we also found out he thinks Air Force One is cool, the Queen is a beautiful person inside and out and the Royal family have good energy.  We\u0027ve picked out five things we learned from the interview - and five things we didn\u0027t. 5 things we learned 1. He wants a \u0027carve out\u0027 on Brexit trade  The President flip-flopped on the prospect of a Brexit trade deal during his UK visit. First he said Theresa May\u0027s Brexit plan would kill a US-UK trade deal, then he backtracked and said it would be possible. But in the interview it became clear he\u0027s insisting the US will need a carve out - special treatment - in order to strike a trade deal with the UK. He said: I said (to Theresa May), \u0027Make sure you have a carve out, you have to have a carve out\u0027 - where no matter what happens they have the right to make a deal with the United States. I think no matter what happens, they’re going to have carve outs and they’re going to make a deal with us. He added: We’re going to argue, we’re going to fight, and we’re going to end up making a deal. 2. He wants to run in 2020   Donald Trump said he intends to run for re-election in 2020 - and doesn\u0027t think anyone can beat him.  When asked by Piers Morgan whether he was going to run, the US President said: Well I fully intend to. It seems like everybody wants me to. Trump said he did not see any Democrat who could beat him. I don’t see anybody. I know them all and I don’t see anybody. 3. He looks open to banning abortion  The spectre of an abortion ban is looming over the US after Trump nominated conservative Brett Kavanaugh as the next Justice of the Supreme Court. His appointment, if confirmed, could tip the court in a more conservative direction. Pro-choice activists fear it could overturn Roe v Wade, the 1973 case that is the foundation of the current law.  Trump falsely claimed it was a 50/50 question (we\u0027ve debunked this here) adding: Someday in the distant future there could be a vote.  There’s also a very good chance there won’t be a vote. We’ll have to see what happens. A case has to get up there. It could be a long time before a case ever gets up there. 4. He gave a glimpse of the Queen\u0027s thoughts - or claimed to  The Queen\u0027s private conversations are meant to be sacred - especially when it comes to politics. But the President claimed to reveal the monarch\u0027s thoughts on Brexit, before suddenly clamming up and not offering any more. He said: She said it’s a very - and she’s right - it’s a very complex problem, I think nobody had any idea how complex that was going to be. Everyone thought it was going to be ‘Oh it’s simple, we join or don’t join, or let’s see what happens\u0027. 5. He\u0027s happy to deal with ruthless dictators   Trump gave a revealing answer when asked why he was holding high-profile meetings with brutal, pariah leaders - North Korea\u0027s Kim Jong Un and Russia\u0027s Vladimir Putin .  Told Putin was a ruthless dictator, Trump said: Sure he is, he’s ruthless, but so are others. I mean, I could name plenty of others that we deal with that you don’t say the same thing about. I mean plenty of the people that I deal with are pretty ruthless people. The answer almost sounds more like a businessman dealing with sharp practice than a world leader dealing with mass abuse of human rights. 5 things we didn\u0027t learn 1. About Russian hacking  At the very moment Trump was meeting the Queen, an indictment was issued for 12 alleged Russian spies in the long-running 2016 election hacking probe. More revealingly, special counsel Robert Mueller\u0027s indictment claims hackers tried for the first time to hack an e-mail server used by Hillary Clinton\u0027s personal office on 27 July 2016. Earlier that same day, Trump said: Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 e-mails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Mueller did not allege any link. But why not ask Trump about it? He is, after all, meeting the President of Russia on Monday morning. 2. About Stormy Daniels  Trump has been embroiled in a long-running row with the porn star Stormy Daniels, who claims she had sex with Trump in 2006. The adult actress has been fighting a 2016 nondisclosure agreement arranged by Trump\u0027s lawyer, Michael Cohen, in which she was paid $130,000 to keep silent. Trump\u0027s lawyers were seeking at least $20 million in damages from Daniels for violations of the nondisclosure agreement. In April, Daniels released a sketch of a man she claims threatened her in a car park in 2011. It\u0027s a row with many unanswered questions. No more seem answered for now.  Presenting the interview, Piers Morgan told viewers about claims Nigel Farage fired up Donald Trump to claim Theresa May\u0027s Brexit plan would kill a US trade deal. The President later backtracked on his claims, but the exact reason for his original outburst remains a mystery. That mystery, as of Monday morning, remains unsolved. 4. About his allies\u0027 ties to Tommy Robinson   Marchers for the far-right EDL founder combined with a rally that was being held to welcome Trump to London on the weekend.  And yesterday ex-Trump advisor Steve Bannon praised jailed Tommy Robinson and called for his release. Mr Bannon said: He and I disagree about the religion of Islam, okay? But I don\u0027t think Tommy\u0027s a bad guy, I think he\u0027s a solid guy, and I think he\u0027s got to be released from prison. It feeds into the debate about whether Trump is providing an outlet for the \u0027alt\u0027 or far right. That debate remains as open as ever today.

The rogue US President abused the Prime Minister’s hospitality and brought tens of thousands of protesters on to the streets. His rudeness and lies are the toxic ravings of an unstable man-child and reinforce the need for Britain to stay close to our European allies. May’s disclosure that the advice from the deranged six-time bankrupt manchild in the White House was the infeasible suing of the EU was her way of letting us know even she thinks unhinged Trump’s a turkey leg short of the full Thanksgiving feast. Downing Street, desperate to avoid May falling, is pitching the line that it’s her Brexit or no Brexit at all, plus Prime Minister Jeremy Corbyn. Tory hardline Brextremists led by Boris Johnson – who was laughed at by MPs as they watched him search in vain for the Foreign Office limo he lost on quitting – are gauging their ability to knock May over.  What’s clear from her controversial 98-page Brexit white paper is that she finally recognises European reality trumps American free trade fantasies. Britain would be poorer and weaker, stripped of influence and with its sovereignty eroded should she triumph. Our current membership of the European club is superior to any Leave option. Behind the meaningless “Brexit means Brexit” propaganda, May is acknowledging that sacrificing our manufacturing industry on the ideological altar of Brexit fanaticism would be ruinous. She’ll reduce national clout by pulling out of the Brussels institutions next March – and not travel very far.

Justine Greening, the former Education Secretary, joined the chorus of both Remain and Leave voices coming out against the Prime Minister\u0027s new \u0027soft Brexit\u0027 plan. Ms Greening is now the third pro-EU Tory MP to publicly back a so-called \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 on the Brexit deal, after Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston. And she told the BBC others agree with her privately. Her announcement heaps fresh pressure on Mrs May as she faces a rebellion from both sides in Commons votes tonight on her Customs Bill.  A furious row erupted over customs last week when the government unveiled plans to keep a common rulebook with the EU on goods imports. Brexiteers say this will keep Britain shackled powerless to the EU - and both Boris Johnson and David Davis quit the Cabinet in protest. But Remainers say it does not go far enough. Today Ms Greening said the plan was the worst of both worlds and called for the decision to be put to the people of Britain. She warned otherwise, the deal will simply be voted down by Parliament in its entirety in October leaving the country in the lurch. Parliament\u0027s deadlocked, she told ITV\u0027s Good Morning Britain. Parliament works on party political lines and we\u0027re trying to cope with something that isn\u0027t party political, Brexit.  And as far as I can see it doesn\u0027t matter what the proposal is in front of MPs, they\u0027ll vote it down [in October]. We have to go somewhere. I\u0027m also fed up frankly with all the backroom deals that are going on constantly to get various Bills through. The only way we can deal with that is to go to the people. It comes as Theresa May faces a Commons showdown on Brexit customs plans tonight. Remainers have tabled amendments to the Customs Bill that would force Britain to stay in a full customs union with the EU.  Meanwhile Brexiteer ringleader Jacob Rees-Mogg has also tabled amendments that would sabotage Mrs May\u0027s plan.   The Tory Brexiteer amendments will not pass because Labour are not backing them. But they\u0027ll reveal the number of Tory MPs prepared to defy the Prime Minister - who crucially would need 48 letters of no confidence to trigger a leadership contest. Tory Leaver Steve Baker is said to be organising the rebels just days after he resigned as a Brexit Minister. Last night a junior government aide, Robert Courts, became the latest Brexiteer to resign in protest at Mrs May\u0027s approach. The MP, who represents David Cameron\u0027s former seat of Witney, said: I have taken very difficult decision to resign position as PPS to express discontent with Chequers in votes.  I had to think who I wanted to see in the mirror for the rest of my life. I cannot tell the people of West Oxon that I support the proposals in their current form. Reports today suggested Mrs May was prepared to make concessions on some of the less contentious aspects of the amendments to try and prevent a mass revolt. But Tory Brexiteer Sir Bernard Jenkin suggested Mrs May\u0027s Chequers plan was dead. He told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: I\u0027m afraid it is neither beloved by Remainers or Leavers. It\u0027s also quite likely to be either rejected by the EU or more demands will be made upon it so it will be even less acceptable. He described Ms Greening\u0027s call for a second referendum as a little ill-thought out, saying: If we wanted to extend the uncertainty for another long period this is one way of doing it. Theresa May agreed a major shift to soft Brexit at her country retreat Chequers - prompting her Brexit Secretary David Davis and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to quit. The \u0027third way\u0027 plan for UK customs rules proposed keeping the UK closely aligned with the EU in a new free trade area for goods. This will include sharing a common rulebook for all goods including agricultural and food products - and a possible compromise on migration. To appease Brexiteers, Parliament would keep the right to block future changes to the trading rules. But Brexiteers were enraged by this close link with Brussels and David Davis said this olive branch was meaningless in practice. The deal also proposes a common rulebook with the EU on state aid rules, and agrees to step up backup plans for a No Deal Brexit. A full White Paper was due to be published on Thursday 12 July."},{"url":null,"title":"voice mirror sleazy mp andrew","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the Mirror: Sleazy MP Andrew Griffiths is a moral vacuum living in denialMP has resigned as minister but he\u0027s clearly too blinkered to see just how depraved his \"few moments of stupidity\" were and the extent of the damage he\u0027s done\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByVoice of the Mirror22:43, 15 JUL 2018NewsopinionAndrew Griffiths is clinging on to his role as MP for Burton despite the disgusting revelations last weekend (Image: Chris McAndrew / UK Parliament)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIf shamed Tory sexual predator Andrew Griffiths had an ounce of decency left in his body he would quit as an MP now.

The US President is a loose cannon, and tens of thousands of protesters from our country’s decent majority marched to demonstrate against his hate. It might be best the ogre never returns. Whoever is Prime Minister will see him at summits like the G7 and NATO anyway. We do not object to him championing \u0026shyAmerica’s interests, although half of his country detests him. But we do object to him offering half-baked assessments about Britain and lying with his frequent contradictions. That he gets along with Putin, as well as despot Kim Jong-un, is another reason why a long spoon is needed to sup with this devil.

Republicans were filmed backing a spoof programme to teach pre-schoolers how to defend themselves with firearms as part of Sacha Baron Cohen \u0027s new show.   The British comedian\u0027s new seven-episode series, \u0027Who is America?\u0027, sees him adopt four different personas as he satirises the political and cultural life of the US in the Donald Trump era.  In the first episode, which airs tonight in the UK, the Ali G star poses as an Israeli anti-terror expert to gets two US congressmen to support for his fake \u0027Kinders\u0027 scheme for kids as young as three.  The scheme includes a fake instructional video featuring children\u0027s songs and \u0027gunimals\u0027 - weapons adorned with soft toys - that would purportedly help kids confront the school shootings that have plagued America for the past decade.  Republican congressmen Dana Rohrabacher of California and Joe Wilson of South Carolina, along with former Senate Republican leader Trent Lott, who is now a lobbyist at a Washington law firm, are shown enthusiastically backing the idea, alongside gun rights advocates and a former congressman-turned-talk radio host, Joe Walsh.  Showtime and Sacha Baron Cohen both declined to comment on the series. Those shown endorsing the fake scheme, including the politicians, had not seen the finished show ahead of its premiere in the US on Sunday. Rohrabacher, Wilson and Lott did not immediately reply to requests for comment. Walsh told CNN on Saturday that he was tricked into reading the words off a teleprompter.  The show marks Baron Cohen\u0027s first television project in a decade after he launched his comedy career as subversive white English rapper Ali G, whose interviewees included Donald Trump and Newt Gingrich. His 2006 faux documentary film \u0027Borat\u0027 ridiculed Kazakhstan and Middle Americans.  In \u0027Who is America?\u0027, Baron Cohen also takes aim at the media and political correctness, with the comedian posing as a pony-tailed liberal radio reporter on a post-2016 election cycling tour, and a man in a disability scooter who purports to investigate fake news. In the first episode, Baron Cohen\u0027s radio journalist persona is shown dining at the home of two Trump supporters in South Carolina and regaling them with lurid stories about his supposed family.

The married dad quit as a minister after it emerged he sent barmaid Imogen Treharne and a pal over 2,000 desperate messages crudely detailing violent sex acts and pleading for explicit images. But yesterday the MP for Burton and Uttoxeter in Staffordshire sent a second grovelling apology to constituents as he begged: “Judge me on my actions and achievements during eight years as MP rather than a few moments of stupidity.” Disgusted Imogen, 28, said: “He’s resigned as a minister, but not as an MP. Why? “He’s accepted what he did was wrong, so why is he still clinging on?”  She added: “The only people he hasn’t apologised to is us. Where’s our apology? “It just confirms that he still just sees us as pieces of meat. He’s just saying sorry to the people affecting his future – not the people he’s actually been affecting.” Paul Walker, chairman of the Burton and Uttoxeter Labour party, said Griffiths had no option but to quit the seat. He said: “He’s disgraced himself, embarrassed his family and his constituents. He should be taking a long look at himself and considering whether he’s morally capable of continuing as MP.” Constituent Emily Sendell, 24, said: “He should resign as MP. His voting record shows he doesn’t support vulnerable, disadvantaged people, and now doesn’t support family values.” Our sister paper the Sunday Mirror revealed the former government whip, who previously served as Theresa May’s chief of staff, sent Imogen and her pal \u0026pound700 and offered to rent a flat to meet for sex.  Imogen says Griffiths, 47, had followed her on social media for months before contacting her on June 16 after she posted a racy video to her Snapchat followers. He sent her a message asking if she did it to get a “reaction” from him. There was then talk of a threesome with a pal of Imogen’s he had seen on social media, and over the next three weeks the trio exchanged thousands of messages detailing how Griffiths would make them his sex slaves, while he paid them cash for clothes and booze. Imogen and her pal engaged consensually out of curiosity, until his messages got increasingly vulgar. Imogen said: “He was responding to all our public posts. Watching us, almost.”  On June 24 Mr Griffiths said: “You knew I would see your post and it would wind me up. Didn’t you?... All the guys perving over you.” His darker texts included threats of violence such as: “She’s so cute. So sweet. I can’t wait to beat her”. Imogen said: “I’m not saying we got taken advantage of, but he knew that we liked older men and he knew why. “He could see it a mile off. He spotted a vulnerability. He thought I appeared like a dolly bird with no brain online... that’s what he wanted.” She told of her relief that a planned meeting with him in London never went ahead – as she says he went on to boast of harming women in violent sex sessions before they broke off contact on July 6. Imogen decided she had to tell her story “so people like this wouldn’t be in power”.  She added: “People are telling me he’s a horrible scumbag. A lot of women have been sending me messages saying it’s long overdue. “There’s no chance that we’re the only girls who’ve been involved in something like this. This isn’t the first time, and it won’t be the last. It always seems to be politicians.” Griffiths, who has three-month-old daughter Alice with wife Kate, 47, said in a statement yesterday: “I would like to apologise to everyone in Burton and Uttoxeter for my actions over a two-week period. “The messages were written during a period of great personal pressure and in no way represent my views or actions. “My behaviour fell well below the standards expected of me. “I hope that people will judge me on my actions and achievements during eight years as MP for Burton and Uttoxeter rather than a few moments of stupidity. “My priority now is my family, and rebuilding their trust. I am undertaking professional treatment to ensure I never make the same mistake again. No casework will slip and everything will be dealt with fully while I am seeking help.”  In an earlier statement as he quit as small business minister he said he was “deeply ashamed” of the embarrassment he caused to the Government. Local Labour campaigner Sue Greenwood said she interviewed him in 2015 about politicians’ use of social media in elections. She claimed he told her of an “epiphany” during a visit from Jim Messina, campaign manager for then-US President Barack Obama. He told her Mr Messina had asked: “What’s the first thing you think about in the morning and the last thing at night?” He added: “I said the answer was sex but it was my smartphone! It’s the first thing I reach for in the morning and before I go to bed.” Mrs Greenwood thought nothing of it until Imogen said he flooded her with messages “as soon as he woke up and as soon as he went to bed”. She said she also saw him in a supermarket on Father’s Day, less than 24 hours after he first contacted Imogen. She said he was “sweating in his suit and seemed excited and nervous”. She said he talked of it being his first Father’s Day as a dad and that he was buying treats. She added: “Now I wonder whether he’d actually just sent that treats message to Imogen.”  His messages of depravity June 26, 7.02pm: Ladies, I was in a meeting. I’m sorry I neglected you, but daddy can be very demanding. He’s wanting more than what’s on your insta. Don’t make daddy get the flogger out. July 4, 9.28pm: I want her to own you.

The day at Funland Tropicana in Weston-super-Mare in Somerset was billed as “a day of everything dinosaur related with lots to see and do”. But parents said their children were left in tears when they turned up to find just one small T-rex. The park apologised saying that part of their dinosaur exhibition were unable to attend due to last-minute transport issues. But it admitted their advertising might have “bigged-up” the event too much. They said guests who complained in at the park were offered free rides. Parents bombarded the event’s Facebook page with angry messages.  Several said their young children had been bitterly disappointed at the lack of dinosaurs and left the park in tears. Mum Charlene Harris wrote: “Dinosaur day would suggest more than just one small dinosaur! Very disappointed.” Richard Pead commented: “Very poor. One dinosaur. Just a ploy to get you to Funland and waste money on tokens. Nothing dinosaur day about it. Don’t waste your time visiting.” Charlie Rayner said: “Wow! What an absolute waste of time, disgusted that no one could even be bothered to tell the public that there is only one dinosaur. “So many disappointed children with dino t-shirts on. Brought my dino-mad 5-year-old as a well done for his school report but you left him in tears he was so upset! I’ll never be back to the Tropicana again!” Wendie Smith from Bristol said she had made the 50-mile round trip with her two grandsons, aged 3 and 7, to Funland Tropicana for Dinosaur Day.  “They were so excited, we had a sleepover and then went to see the dinosaurs,” she said. “When I got there and there was just one, I thought we were too early and they hadn’t set the rest up yet. “I’m quite cynical and I said to my partner, ‘I bet there’s just one, to get us here’.” But Wendie said that when she found out there really would be no more dinosaurs she had to break the news to her grandsons who were “gutted”. “The eldest one was absolutely gutted. I think it’s disgusting, I won’t be going back,” she said. A member of park management said it was just an unfortunate accident, not a ploy, and they were sorry visitors had been let down. They said: “It was an absolute disaster, from our point of view. We really don’t like disappointing people. “We had three dinosaurs booked. One, which was local to us, turned up but the others were coming down the M5 when the van pulling their trailer broke down.” He said the van had to be recovered meaning the dinosaurs couldn’t be delivered.

The 79-year-old left Belmarsh prison in London last week after just over three years behind bars. The leader of the criminal gang - dubbed the Diamond Wheezers - was jailed for six years and three months for his role in the brazen jewellery raid. Reader, who has suffered prostate cancer and a series of strokes, was pictured enjoying the sun with friends and family at his home in Dartford.  His release sparked anger that he was not made to serve longer in jail due to the theft of millions of valuables worth up to \u0026pound29 million - including gold, diamonds and sapphires. Reader had faced a further seven-year term if he could not pay a \u0026pound6.5million confiscation ord\u0026shyer handed to him and other ringleaders, John Kenny Collins, Daniel Jones, and Terry Perkins.  The pay-back time limit expires at the end of this month. But The Sun reported Reader has been given leave by the Court of Appeal to \u0026shychallenge the order and would remain free until it was settled with no date yet set for a hearing.  Nine people were convicted and jailed for their roles in the raid, one of the biggest in UK history. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said the department is unable to comment on individual cases.  Earlier this year, raider Perkins died behind bars - just days after being ordered to repay \u0026pound6.5million. Perkins, who suffered from diabetes and heart problems, was part way through a seven-year sentence at HMP Belmarsh when he died.

Mia-Lili Bennett has not stopped crying since she saw the cruel Instagram poll. And her parents Corrinia Bennet, 33, and John Bennett, 42, are watching her around the clock because she keeps talking about \u0027ending it all.\u0027 The post featured a photo of Mia-Lili\u0027s face with the words \u0027who thinks she ugly\u0027 plastered over it - to which 53 per cent responded \u0027hell ya\u0027. Bullies created an account called puglife123456 under Mia-Lili\u0027s name to post the survey and a family friend alerted Corrinia to it last week. The mum-of-three, who lives in Norwich, Norfolk, claims she immediately reported the poll to Instagram who have removed the post.  Shocked by what she had seen, Corrinia then faced the devastating task of showing Mia-Lili the post to find out if she knew about it, leaving her blissfully unaware little girl in floods of tears and suicidal. Corrinia, customer experience assistant at a bookmakers, said: I was made aware that this post had been going round by a friend. I reported it straight away and so did a few other people. Instagram were really good and they have taken it down. But the next day I needed to wake up my daughter and ask her about it. I didn\u0027t want to show her but I needed to know what had been going on. She saw the post and just started crying. She cried so much she collapsed and her dad had to scoop her up off the floor. She hasn\u0027t stopped crying since and neither have I to be honest. We\u0027ve had to put her on suicide watch at home. Her dad and I have to make sure someone is with her 24 hours a day because she keeps talking about ending it all.  She had hairbands tied up in a hoop on her bed and I had to take them down because I was terrified what she might try to do. It\u0027s absolutely heartbreaking. I never thought I would be dealing with my daughter being a victim of cyber bullying at such a young age. They\u0027re still so innocent at this age. Even though you\u0027re always going to be there for your kids when something happens, you don\u0027t expect something this evil to happen. It\u0027s horrible. For someone to even think about being that malicious is horrendous. It has completely destroyed her confidence, she\u0027s very self-conscious about the way she looks. We tell her she\u0027s beautiful all the time but she won\u0027t believe it. After it happened, Mia-Lili felt so self-conscious she didn\u0027t want to go to school anymore but she went on Friday and she told me, \u0027I won\u0027t let them win\u0027. I\u0027m so proud of her. She has the kindest heart. She always gives homeless people her pocket money and if you ask her if she wants something from a shop she\u0027ll say she needs to get something for her dad and sisters first.  She\u0027s so willing to open her heart to people. Even if they\u0027re horrible to her she calls them her friends. I don\u0027t understand why they can\u0027t treat her with the same kindness. The mum also contacted Norfolk police to report the cyber bullying and says they were \u0027brilliant\u0027 at consoling Mia-Lili. A spokesman for Norfolk Constabulary confirmed the investigation is still ongoing. Without her mum\u0027s consent Mia-Lili set up an Instagram account at the beginning of June but confessed to Corrinia a couple of hours later. The mum told her daughter she was not allowed to have a social media account until she meets the required aged limits - with Instagram only allowing accounts for 13 year olds and over. Mia-Lili did as her mum asked and deleted the account but in the few hours it was live, someone got hold of the little girl\u0027s profile photo and turned it into a nasty poll. Since the incident Mia-Lili\u0027s mum, dad and sisters Lexi-May Bennett, nine, and Neave-Marie Bennett, four, are giving the schoolgirl as much love and support as possible.  And Corrinia is now urging all parents to watch their children\u0027s internet activity more diligently to ensure they don\u0027t become victims of online trolls. Corrinia said: When Mia-Lili told me she had set up an Instagram account, I told her straight away it needed to be taken down and uninstalled as she\u0027s not old enough yet. She did what I asked like she normally does and took it down. We didn\u0027t hear anything else of it until we heard about the poll. Kids don\u0027t know how to set their accounts to private so it\u0027s all public and someone got hold of her photo. I reported it to the police and they have been brilliant. They told Mia-Lili it\u0027s not her fault because she has been blaming herself, she thinks it\u0027s her fault for setting up an account. She has been the victim of severe bullying before. The kids used to rub her tummy and call her fat. We used to live in London and we moved to Norwich for a fresh start. We had finally got her confidence back up but now it is completely gone again.

Gemma Hughes, 25, spotted what she says is the face of her partner Dane Curran\u0027s late father Ian in the black and white scan of her son Vinnie. The boy was a rainbow baby after Gemma had suffered a devastating miscarriage in 2015, and Gemma believes Ian was watching over his grandson. She now credits him for being behind their intuition to take Vinnie to a hospital when he was seriously ill with bacterial meningococcal meningitis at just 10 weeks old.  It felt like the family couldn\u0027t escape the infection - as Dane had nearly died from it as a baby and it had also killed his brother at just four months old. Gemma now keeps a copy of the scan on her bedside table and claims a little bit of Ian remains with Vinnie each day, as the 22-month-old has his grandad\u0027s name as his middle name. The mum-of-two, from Sheffield, South Yorks, said: We were riding home in the car after having the scan and I opened up the picture to look at it, and I was admiring it, like you do, and noticed the face at the top.  I spotted it straight away as it is quite blatant. It\u0027s just bang, there looking down. It\u0027s as if it\u0027s in the clouds looking down, it\u0027s quite magical really. Straight away we knew who it was. We put Ian\u0027s photo against it and it\u0027s the same shaped face. The nose is identical and everything. We believe he was there for a reason, and that he came down to protect the baby for fear they could have meningitis. We believe that he is the baby\u0027s  angel and that\u0027s why he\u0027s showing up on this scan picture.  It is scary how many of our family have been affected by meningitis, especially considering it\u0027s not hereditary. It\u0027s nice to have that thought that we knew who it was. It brought lots of comfort to us. Ian Curran passed away suddenly aged just 45 around a decade ago from a heart attack. He had had to watch both Dane and his brother battle meningitis and sadly Dane\u0027s brother lost his battle aged just four months.  When Vinnie fell ill in November 2016, Gemma believes it was thanks to Ian watching over the family that they got the baby to hospital so quickly. Gemma, a stay-at-home mum while Dane works at a scrap merchant, said: Bacterial meningococcal meningitis is a very serious bug so it is a good job we got to hospital in time. He was very poorly though. He was normal and then one day out of the blue he went red hot and burnt up, his eyes were blinking and he was very ill. We had no idea what it was so rushed him to the children\u0027s hospital straight away. His heart rate fell though and they had to give him a lumbar puncture to find out what it was.  I was distraught, I felt sick. Dane was so scared when he heard it was meningitis because obviously his brother had died at four months old of it and he had had it as a baby. Dane\u0027s mum Zoe was there too and it was horrible for her having to go through it all over again. It was a very scary time but it was nice to have some peace of mind that we had someone watching over him through it all. We definitely were able to take some strength from what we had seen in the photo. She added: Zoe is quite spiritual too and she couldn\u0027t believe her eyes when she saw the photo as she recognised it as her husband.

Prince George, Princess Charlotte, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are among the royals that also feature in the set of pictures unveiled on Sunday night. The family appears in awe of the new prince, in particular little Charlotte who in one snap is turning away from the camera with her eyes fixed on her younger brother as she holds his hand. She sticks close to her mum Kate in the photos and appears to be a natural poser. Meanwhile George is sat next to or on his dad William\u0027s knee - perhaps to make him sit still as he appears to have trouble sitting still and looking straight at the camera. Louis\u0027s big day was the first time the Cambridges were seen together as a family of five. Little Louis, who is just 12 weeks old, was dressed in a cream, frilly lace royal christening gown - a replica of the intricate robe made for Queen Victoria’s eldest daughter in 1841. Four official images were taken by British photographer Matt Holyoak at Clarence House after Louis was baptised in The Chapel Royal at St James\u0027s Palace last Monday. Today Kensington Palace released a new picture of Prince Louis giggling.  The picture was taken by Matt Porteous, who also photographed Prince George on his birthday last year.  Kate, dressed in a cream outfit by Alexander McQueen, looks a picture of elegance as she cradles her third chilld. The Duchess, who opted for a white floral headpiece designed by Jane Taylor on the special day, appears smitten.  In one photo, Kate and William are joined by their children, along with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, and the Middleton family including Kate\u0027s sister Pippa Matthews and her husband James. Members of the royal family appear in another photo without the Middletons, a third photo features the Cambridge five and the fourth photo is an image of just Kate and Louis. The photographs were taken in the morning room and garden at Clarence House. Princess Charlotte appears to love posing in the pictures, with a big adorable smile. In the shot of the extended family, she is even holding her knee in a cute pose showing her confidence. She is wearing a blue and white dress with a bow headband to match, while George is smartly dressed in pair of shorts and white polo tshirt. George gives the photographer a cheeky smile in the photo where he is sat on his dad\u0027s knee, but in the others his expression appears more shy and reserved.  Mr Holyoak, who took the pictures, said: I was truly honoured at being asked to take the official photographs at the christening of Prince Louis, and to witness at first hand such a happy event. Everyone was so relaxed and in such good spirits, it was an absolute pleasure. I only hope I have captured some of that joy in my photographs. Louis was sound asleep as he was carried into the Chapel Royal by Kate for the christening ceremony which lasted 40 minutes. After the ceremony, the baby prince looked content and wiggled his fingers as Kate gazed down and beamed at him as she held him in her arms. His proud parents celebrated after the service by cutting a tier of their wedding cake.  The Archbishop of Canterbury presided over the christening supported by The Dean of The Chapel Royal, The Right Reverend and Right Honourable the Lord Chartres, and The Sub-Dean of The Chapel Royal, The Reverend Canon Paul Wright. The music and religious readings chosen by the royal couple included This Is The Day Which The Lord Hath made by John Rutter which was composed for their wedding in 2011. After much speculation over who William and Kate would give the honour to, they chose three godfathers and three godmothers, all of whom are friends or family. Louis’s godfathers are Nicholas van Cutsem, one of four brothers who have been close to William and Harry since they were very young William’s childhood friend Guy Pelly and Harry Aubrey-Fletcher, who was one of William’s close friends from both prep school and Eton College.

Elisha Reamonn was travelling to Croatia with her boyfriend Cuan Rynhart when the jet lots cabin pressure and was forced to make an emergency landing in Frankfurt, Germany.  Oxygen masks dropped from overhead compartments as the plane began its rapid landing, plunging for seven minutes, reports the Irish Mirror .  In a tweet, Elisha, from Dublin, said she thought she was a “true goner” and that she “just wanted the end to come fast.” She said that there was “fizzling” in the ears and “huge pressure of the eyes” as well as an intense burning smell that circulated around the cabin.  Elisha initially thought that the aircraft was on fire. She said: “I put my hand out into the aisle and mouthed ‘I love you’ to Cuan. “I tried to write a message on my phone in case it was going to be my last to my family, but I couldn’t see properly. My eyes felt like they were popping out of my head. “An automated announcement on the aircraft’s speaker system repeated the phrase ‘emergency descent’ three times. “Passengers said that after the aircraft levelled out, a crew member announced that ‘any burning you smell is just because of the release of oxygen.’”  The pressure form the landing caused many passengers to bleed from the ears and mouth. One image circulated online shows blood spattered on the inside of one of the oxygen masks. Elisha said the cabin crew on FR7312 were very helpful during the descent and tried to help all the passengers. She said: “I appreciate the staff on the flight so much, and everybody is so grateful to the pilot for getting us to the ground safely. “But it was 30 minutes of breathing into the oxygen mask, trying to hold my ears with the pain while at the same time being utterly, utterly convinced I was going to die.” After landing in the airport, Elisha sought medical help for her eyes and ears, but refused to be put on a drip because she believed there were other people who required it more. A Ryanair spokesman said: This flight from Dublin to Zadar [July 13] diverted to Frankfurt Hahn due to an inflight depressurisation.

The country has enjoyed weeks of scorching weather, with the mercury rising to 33C in some parts. Hot and humid air from the Azores is expected to raise temperatures throughout this week, with plenty of sunshine in some parts across the weekend. But more unsettled weather will move in from the Atlantic with heavy, thundery showers forecast next week as low pressure begins to dominate. The remnants of former Hurricane Chris will merge with a large area of low pressure over Iceland and continue moving north-eastwards, picking up low pressure systems, as it tracks over the cold waters of the northern Atlantic. This will allow the changeable conditions to sweep in from the west bringing showers and longer spells of rain.  The jet stream will also move southwards increasing the chance of some heavy downpours with most widespread rain predicted for Northern Ireland and Scotland, while England and Wales will only be affected by scattered showers. Before then, sun lovers should make the most of the weekend warmth.   Forecaster Amy Hodgson, of The Weather Channel, said: “Increased cloud with outbreaks of light rain will affect Ireland and Scotland over the weekend, whilst England and Wales will be dry and mostly sunny. “It will be a hot and humid weekend in a south-westerly flow, with maximum temperatures in the mid to high 20s C across England and Wales, but cooler across Ireland and Scotland with highs in the high teens to low 20s C.” A Met Office forecaster said: Less hot, is the best way to describe next week, but it will still be warm.  There will be some sunny spells but there will be a few showers around that could be heavy and thundery. All parts of the UK will see some spells of sunshine, but there is likely to be relatively more in the way of rain or showers at times too, its website says. Some of the showers could be heavy or thundery at times. There may also be bands of more persistent rain on occasion which may bring some stronger winds too, especially to northern and western parts.

Elizabeth Lowe, 30, and husband James, 38, were married for five years before inviting Ashley Lowe and Audrie Lowe, both 22, into their marriage. The four of them - whose children are aged between one and eight - share a king-sized bed and have a rotation in bed so everyone gets a turn sleeping next to each other.  Elizabeth said the relationship feels completely natural, but it has left her mum furious and led to them being shunned by their church.   But the mum, from Columbus, Ohio in the US, said she wouldn\u0027t change a thing about her love life, adding: My two wives, husband and I are happier than ever. We don\u0027t care what society thinks, because we love each other dearly. Elizabeth met James in a psychology class at Columbus State College in June 2008, and they quickly fell in love.  They married in June 2009 and, over the next five years, had six children together. But, despite their happy marriage, Elizabeth made a shocking confession to James in January 2014 telling him she wanted to bring a woman into their relationship. She said: James wasn\u0027t sure at first but, after two months, he grew to love the idea too.  In March 2014, Elizabeth met Audrie, from San Antonio, Texas, at her college cafeteria. Elizabeth, a bank worker, said: She was so lovely and pretty. I had an instant attraction to her. The next day, I introduced her to James at the cafeteria. The three of us started hanging out at the park with our kids.  Eventually I realised that I was in love with Audrie and, six months later, we confessed our feelings for each other. In August 2014, Audrie and I became intimate with each other. James was happy for us. Six months later, Audrie and James, who are both artists, fell in love while on a road trip alone in Texas. From that moment on, Ashley shared the couple\u0027s bed and the trio became polyamorous.  But they only lasted for a month as they met Ashley, also from San Antonio. Elizabeth said: Ashley and James became gym buddies. Within six months, James confessed he had feelings for Ashley. Both Audrie and I were on board, she was an amazing woman. It wasn\u0027t until we went on a family camping trip in February 2015 when Ashley told us she wanted to join our relationship.  We told her we loved her too. That day, we bought a king-sized bed so that we had plenty of space at night. We slept together for the first time. Being intimate with three other people felt completely natural. The quad soon labelled themselves as in a polyfidelity relationship where all members are considered equal partners and there\u0027s a mutual agreement to not allow any sexual activity with people outside of the group. Elizabeth said: Three months after we all got together, I called my mum and told her about Audrie and Ashley. She was furious.  She told me that the devil follows me wherever I go. It broke my heart. The four of us make love together, and we all love each other equally the same. We all have a rotation in bed which ensures everyone has a turn to sleep next to each other. Our sexual activity is relaxed in that we can be with anyone we choose at any time, within the quad.  The foursome enjoy date nights together at restaurants, but also split up depending on who feels like going out. Elizabeth said: We all hold hands and kiss when we go out. We do get funny looks sometimes, but we just laugh it off. A lot of people at our church have said that we are bad for the church and they don\u0027t agree with our lifestyle. It was deeply upsetting, so we don\u0027t go any more. As it is illegal to marry more than one person in the United States, Audrie and Ashley married each other legally.

Not only have you just been pampered, but you look fabulous - and you know it. But when it comes to manicure trends of late, we\u0027ve certainly had some weird ones and they just weren\u0027t worth it. From miniature combs you could brush your hair with, to nails that looked like teeth. It seems people will quite literally put anything on their finger nails. But finally there\u0027s a new trend that we\u0027re a little more willing to get on board with.  And it looks set to be a big beauty hit this summer. We\u0027re talking of course about jelly nails. The bright, eye-catching look has become a big hit on Instagram, with many people opting to try the style in neon hues. Similar to the jelly shoes and jelly backpacks that were popular with youngsters in the 1990s, the jelly nails are slightly transparent.  They\u0027re also known as \u0027glass nails\u0027 because of the transparency. The jelly nails are being done in all shapes and sizes, with some going all out to have long pointed claws and others opting for a more sleek, square look. To get the look for yourself simply ask your nail technician to add a clear tip to your nails or use clear gel to sculpt the extension. But be warned that not every salon may stock the right tools or gels needed to recreate the cool manicure.  Some people have also been adding stickers and glitter to their jelly manicures to create interesting effects. People on social media are big fans of the look, with more than 3,500 posts cropping up under the jelly nails hashtag. One user said: Wow these are so cool!

The business magnate called Vern Unsworth pedo guy - US spelling for \u0027paedophile\u0027 - after the diver, who lives in Chiang Rai in Thailand, criticised Musk\u0027s offer to help in the rescue as a PR stunt. Musk, founder of Tesla and SpaceX, had claimed his prototype submarine could be used to rescue the 12 young Thai football players and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang caverns. But after the boys were rescued Mr Unsworth, 63, told CNN he can stick his submarine where it hurts - claiming it had absolutely no chance of working.  In a Twitter tirade today, Musk hit back, raging: “Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it.” Mr Musk wrote: “Never saw this British expat guy who lives in Thailand (sus) at any point when we were in the caves. “Only people in sight were the Thai navy/army guys, who were great. Thai navy seals escorted us in — total opposite of wanting us to leave.  “Water level was actually very low \u0026amp still (not flowing) — you could literally have swum to Cave 5 with no gear, which is obv how the kids got in. “If not true, then I challenge this dude to show final rescue video.

Their other brothers, Kenneth and the late Billy, were also good footballers and, more important, good, hard-working people.”Concluding on another note, Kenneth went on: “My Uncle Kenneth featured some time ago in BwB in a photo of a successful St John’s school football team.“His son, Kevin, was also a very prominent, very talented junior football player with Lochee Harp.“In fact, Kevin could

However, it wasn’t to be as while he rummaged in his bag to find the ring, he was interrupted by a group of German tourists.With the mood killed, they went to the beach, but after sunbathing for just 10 minutes, Craig said they should go back to the hotel because he was too hot.He chose the balcony of their room which overlooked the lake to ask Aimee to become his wife.Aimee couldn’t even answer and instead simply burst into tears of happiness.After careful planning by the couple, the morning of the wedding arrived and the sun was shining.Aimee said: “When I woke up and saw the sun I was so happy that I was getting my outdoor wedding.“It made the photos taken by Burfly Photography from the day look really green and beautiful.“We had a flower wall created by Celebre which was stunning and it would have been a beautiful backdrop for the ceremony too.”The bride was accompanied down the aisle by stepdad Graham and the ceremony conducted by humanist Neil Anderson was the highlight of the day.“We made sure that the ceremony wasn’t boring and it was very personal,” said Aimee.“Neil was absolutely incredible and delivered our story in a fun way.“The night-time reception was brilliant but the day-time was our highlight.”The pair took to the floor to have their first dance as a married couple to The Verve’s hit song Lucky Man, which was performed by band Paper Tiger.Craig and Aimee would like to thank their wedding planners Katy and Fiona, videographers I Do, bridal shop Annarose and all their family and friends.Aimee added: “I wouldn’t change a thing about my wedding.

I know a few of the boys there and they had a very good season last year, so they’ll be looking forward to coming to Tannadice and trying to get a good start to their season.”This will also be former Hibs and Partick Thistle man Booth’s first home game as a United player and he admits the chance to turn out at Tannadice on a regular basis was a factor in his decision to sign up on a two-year deal last month.“I’ve played there a few times down the years and it’s a great stadium,” he added.“Add that to the training facility over in St Andrews, which is brilliant, and it was definitely one of the reasons I was delighted to join United.”When he decided to end his three-year stint with Patrick at the end of last term, it was widely expected Booth would stay in the Premiership. Several top-flight clubs were credited with a strong interest and it was something of a surprise when he opted for the Dundee United option.He admits stepping down to the Championship with United was something he had to think long and hard about.Ultimately, he believes while in terms of division he’s taking a temporary step down, in the longer term it’s going to prove to be a case of onwards and upwards.“It was a big decision but once I thought it through I knew it was the right one.“I’ve got a bit of experience now but at 27 I, hopefully, still have a few years left and I should be coming into my prime.“When I look at the potential at this club, I know where it can go and, hopefully, I will be back playing in the Premiership before too long.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b487d4c7653f-805x564.jpg ","title":"sacked dundee fc worker takes further legal action against club and director john nelms","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA man who won £10,000 at a tribunal after he was sacked by Dundee FC for being off work while battling cancer has launched a fresh action against the club and managing director John Nelms.John Brown, who was then in the club’s commercial department, successfully pursued the Dark Blues on the grounds of disability discrimination in 2016 after he was sacked for being absent while suffering from life-threatening cancer. An employment tribunal awarded him more than £10,000.But now Mr Brown, who runs events and production company The Longest Forty, is taking the club and American director Mr Nelms to a tribunal again – this time citing post-employment victimisation and harassment.The action stems from a dispute over a Legends of the Ball – Champions 2013/2014 event which was due to take place at the Doubletree by Hilton on the outskirts of the city in February.It is understood that Mr Brown alleges that Dens Park chief Mr Nelms contacted Hilton boss Richard Ellison and forced him to cancel the event – leading to a breach of contract – and said he was unhappy someone who was successful in a claim against the club was working alongside the hotel.He also alleges Mr Nelms prevented current Dundee players Craig Wighton and Cammy Kerr from attending the event, despite them having already agreed to do so and having been advertised as appearing.The event was cancelled and Mr Brown alleges this was due to his previous case against Dundee.He now wants damages and alleges that Mr Nelms’ actions were maliciously motivated.It is understood both the club amd Mr Nelms dispute Mr Brown’s claims and insist he did not intervene and that official permission was never sought for players to attend the event.Dundee FC and representatives for Mr Nelms declined to comment.Solicitor Ryan Russell, of Muir Myles and Laverty, confirmed he had been instructed to pursue a claim on Mr Brown’s behalf.He said: “Due to the ongoing legal proceedings, it would inappropriate to comment at this stage on the specifics or merits of the claim. There will be no comment until the conclusion of the case.”The case called at an employment tribunal on Friday for a preliminary hearing.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b3f7302d1f2c-846x564.jpg ","title":"special boat tours to give insight behind dundee landmarks","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBoat trips will be running on the Tay later this month, offering an insight into the engineering behind Dundee landmarks.The event is being organised and run by members of the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) as part of its 200th anniversary celebrations.The trips on Saturday and Sunday July 28 and 29 will enable people to get up close to the new V\u0026ampA museum, Broughty Ferry Castle, Telford Docks, the road and rail bridges and the Pile Lighthouse.A spokesman said: “The hour-long trips will be a wonderful family day out on Rib Roy, a rigid inflatable boat, or the Terra Nova, a cruiser with a cabin, both of which will depart from Newport.“We hope the trip will inspire the next generation of civil engineers and showcase the invisible superheroes on whom our quality of life depends.“There will be invisible superheroes goodies to give away for budding engineers”To find out more, email Richard.trist@ice.org.uk.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/GOLF-Open-170069.jpg-870x564.jpg ","title":"tiger woods hails special carnoustie ahead of the open practise session","story":"\t\t\t\t\tTiger Woods found some unusual conditions as he enjoyed his first look at Carnoustie ahead of the 147th Open Championship.Woods, who has not played in the Open since missing the cut at St Andrews in 2015, completed eight holes on Sunday as he experienced at first hand the bone-dry course where he finished 12th in 2007 and ninth in 1999.The 42-year-old, who also played Carnoustie in the Scottish Open as an amateur, said in quotes reported by ESPN: \u0026#8220I have missed not playing The Open in a while because this is our oldest tournament.\u0026#8220And then coming here to Carnoustie, it is special.

He has also raised concerns at Westminster about such firms on several occasions.He said: \"People should not be charged inflated fees when they have paid for parking in good faith.\"The British Parking Association confirmed to me in person it is their view that people should not be charged if they have made an error inputting their registration.\"This guidance must be heeded by parking operators and, where it is not, there needs to be greater enforcement.\"He added: \"It is high time that operators like Smart Parking were removed from our city centres once and for all.\"The MP was responding to the case of Roger High, from Nottinghamshire, who failed to persuade Smart Parking to overturn a charge issued to him and will now have to cough up \u0026pound100.He said: \"In my appeal I explained that I had transposed two of the letters [in my registration number] and the fact that the registration number was so similar to my postcode that it was easy to make such a small slip.\"I was appalled and livid to receive an email rejecting my appeal, even though they acknowledged that I had purchased a car parking ticket, on the grounds that I had not purchased it for the correct registration number.\"Visiting the area frequently to see family, Mr High insisted Smart Parking\u0027s actions \"would not change\" his love of this part of the world.However, he revealed the experience had left him \"miserable and depressed as well as outraged\".Highland Council trading standards officer William Paul, who has been involved in long-running discussions with Smart Parking, said he was surprised to hear about Mr High\u0027s problems, believing there had been positive changes at the site.It is understood ticket machine key pads have been made bigger to reduce the chance of errors and new software aims to eliminate charges being issued when easily detectable genuine mistakes are made.\"We are encouraged by recent improvements in the operating procedures of the car park and to be fair to the company, these improvements do seem to be making a difference,\" he said.\"We are assured that these improvements are based on a firm commitment to resolve the previous reported issues, including incorrect vehicle registration mark (VRM) entries.\"He encouraged any drivers affected by charge notices to follow Smart Parking\u0027s appeals system and, if necessary, report the matter via the Citizens Advice Consumer Service on 03454 040506 or at www.citizensadvice.org.uk/scotland/consumerA spokesman for Smart Parking said: \"It is a contractual requirement for motorists to input their correct registration mark when parking at Strothers Lane Car park and failure to do so is a breach of the terms and conditions of parking there which can result in a Parking Charge Notice being issued.\"However Smart Parking acknowledges that motorists can make minor mistakes when entering their registration and as such working closely with Highland Trading Standards, has put in place measures to try to identify genuine mistakes against actual registration marks using the car park. Where the mistake is minor and the actual registration mark can be cross referenced Smart parking will endeavour to identify this and not issue the Parking Charge notice.\"Motorists are encouraged to double check their registration number before entering it and if those using the car park have entered a registration mark and subsequently received a Parking Charge Notice they are encouraged to engage with Smart Parking through our British Parking Association accredited appeals process.\"Monday 16 Jul 2018 12:34 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116630.jpg","title":"Schoolgirls inspiring bid to wipe out racism","story":"\u0026nbspA DETERMINED eight-year-old has been praised after taking an inspirational stand against racism in her community by personally removing a vile message she found defacing a local mural.Breagha Gowans spotted the anti-Muslim slur scribbled on the wall of an underpass near Culloden Wood while out for a walk with her mother Michelle.After the pair had a chat about what exactly the message \u0026ndash which the Courier will not print \u0026ndash meant, the youngster decided to step up and take it upon herself to erase it, gathering a bag full of cleaning equipment for the job.\"I wanted to clean up the graffiti because I have a friend at school who is Muslim and I didn\u0026rsquot want her to be upset,\" she said.\"I wanted to be kind towards others.\"The underpass where Breagha spotted the graffiti passes below Barn Church Road and is covered in a colourful mural in a deliberate bid to dissuade would-be vandals from defacing the walls.After scrubbing the wall clean again, she appealed to everyone to show more respect towards those around them.\"Please don\u0026rsquot do it because it is hateful and no-one likes bullies,\" she said.\"It isn\u0026rsquot good to hurt people\u0027 feelings and I didn\u0026rsquot like to see something that would make someone feel bad.\"Breagha\u0027 father is Inverness South councillor Ken Gowans who said he was proud of the way she had decided to tackle the problem head-on.\"I told her it was fantastic \u0026ndash though like a typical eight-year-old she was off doing something else,\" he said.\"Breagha and her class have been learning about different religions at Inshes Primary School and she has a very strong sense of justice and fairness.\"It is a testament to what they are teaching in school.

A friendly at Inverness Caley Thistle on Wednesday had to be called off due to injury problems.Summer signing Stephen Gleeson (knee), Niall McGinn (thigh), Mikey Devlin (groin) and Frank Ross (groin) are injured.The Reds are still awaiting the full results of a scan which will reveal the extent of Gleeson’s injury.He will miss tomorrow’s friendly with Cove Rangers, but the Dons are still hopeful he could feature against Burnley in the Europa League second qualifying round, the first leg of which is on July 26.Another summer signing, Chris Forrester (groin), and Sam Cosgrove (calf) were also injured but are expected to be fit to face Cove tomorrow.So far this summer the Dons have only signed three players with £200,000 outlaid for the capture of Forrester from Peterborough United.Republic of Ireland international Gleeson was secured on a free. An SPFL tribunal will decide the training compensation due for teenager Lewis Ferguson who signed from Hamilton.Polish defender Krystian Nowak is currently training with the Dons and is set to feature as a trialist in tomorrow’s friendly.The 24-year-old is a free agent having had his contract with Greek side Panionios terminated earlier this summer.Aberdeen also had a bid for Doncaster striker John Marquis, understood to be for £250,000, rejected.Boss Derek McInnes confirmed that bid was the highest the Reds could go to and they will now look at other potential targets for centre-forward.Celtic and Rangers have both invested heavily in their squads this season.But Considine insists the heavy spending of the Old Firm will only inspire Aberdeen.He said: “Celtic always generate so much money through their transfers and whatever.“You expect it from them.“Due to the situation with Rangers they haven’t been able to do that, but this year they have. It is great to see and is healthy for Scottish football.“A strong Rangers is good for the league.“It also brings us on.“In the past few years or so we have still remained second so regardless of what they are going to spend we are still going to challenge this season again.”Aberdeen’s preparations for the Euro tie with Burnley conclude with a friendly against West Brom at Pittodrie on Friday.The Baggies were relegated to the Championship at the end of last season.Considine said: ”When we play West Brom here that will be a good indication of what is coming.“Although they were obviously relegated, in my eyes they are still a Premier League team.“That will be a good test for us and will show where we are at and what is coming opposition wise.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/07/Chap-logo.jpg ","title":"welcome to well connected city living at marchstone point 2","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA peaceful haven with all the home comforts and convenience of modern living right in the heart of Aberdeen?Sounds too good to be true, right?That’s where Marchstone Point in Old Aberdeen comes in: CHAP Homes’ new development in the vibrant city center represents the very best of contemporary, urban living.\u0026nbspWith construction underway, the first phase in the development of 31 stylish new two and three-bedroom apartments is set for completion early 2019, with a show apartment available to view from early autumn this year.With a price release coming soon \u0026#8211 watch this space! \u0026#8211 some of the properties will be available under Help to Buy: the Scottish Government-backed initiative offering purchasers 15% of the property’s value on a shared equity basis, paid back when the home is sold.The spacious apartments give purchasers, including professionals and first-time buyers, a rare chance to own their very own relaxing space in the heart of the city: a space in a thriving neighbourhood that’s a stone’s throw away from all the world-class amenities the granite city has to offer.With audio entry security systems, each apartment effortlessly combines low maintenance, urban sophistication with home comforts including superfast broadband and satellite TV, private parking, a secure cycle store and fully-maintained, landscaped gardens \u0026#8211 so you can relax in the outdoors without having to lift a finger.Quality fitted Spanish bathrooms and en-suites \u0026#8211 featuring Porcelanosa’s contemporary tile range \u0026#8211 complement open-plan German kitchens with integrated modern appliances that lead on to living areas beautifully combining light and space.The Nobilia kitchens include co-ordinating worktops and splashbacks, combined with feature glass panels behind every hob while Roca’s sanitaryware’s stunning modern lines mean every bathroom is a haven of peace and tranquillity.CHAP’s sales supervisor, Karen Davidson, said: “As you’d expect with a new build apartment, each home represents low maintenance, energy efficient living.“These aspects will be front and centre in every apartment right across the development, from design through the construction, and include high quality insulation and energy efficient combi boilers.”The bustling neighbourhood of which Marchstone Point will become a central feature is as much a selling point as the properties themselves.Karen said: “While each apartment is finished to a high specification with meticulous attention to detail, buying a home at Marchstone Point goes beyond bricks and mortar.“At the heart of this development is the chance to truly connect: to be part of a community in its widest sense.“Today, this dynamic city is a global commercial hub that\u0026#8217s also home to world-renowned medical expertise and pioneering universities, existing hand-in-hand with a vibrant cultural, leisure and social scene. And here at Marchstone Point, you’re right in the middle of everything that’s going on.”For work, study or leisure, Marchstone Point is a great base to reach all four corners of Aberdeen and beyond, including nearby universities and medical centres the established business hubs of Altens and Dyce as well as Westhill’s renowned subsea centre of excellence.And it’s not all work and study.The development is perfectly located too for all of Aberdeen’s pubs, clubs and film and live entertainment venues. And it’s close to Marischal Square \u0026#8211 which offers a great combination of attractions including popular coffee shops and restaurants such as All Bar One and Mackie’s 19.2 ice cream parlour.For something more active, you’re less than an hour’s drive from the Cairngorms National Park \u0026#8211 Britain’s largest \u0026#8211 and the city has a thriving sport and leisure scene, with one of the best facilities in the UK, Aberdeen Sports Village, just minutes away.Plus, if you fancy a change of scene, Marchstone Point is close to excellent road, rail, sea and air links for domestic and international travel.But what about the name?The development may be modern with the latest home comforts, but CHAP Homes is keen to point out the development’s links with Aberdeen’s heritage.Karen adds: “Close to the development are two march stones (59ABD and 60 ABD) \u0026#8211 their name taken from the 16th century meaning of march as a boundary.“These stones marked the edge of lands that ultimately came under the responsibility of the Royal Burgh of Aberdeen: giving Marchstone Point its very own connection with the way Scotland’s third largest city acquired its boundaries.”Interested in finding out more?

You see how tired we were on Saturday – we’ll be a lot more tired tomorrow.“We went there last year and lost 5-1, but we actually played quite well.“Hopefully the score’s not as bad this time. We will try to win.”Spectators will be looking for a bit more excitement tomorrow than was on offer at Glebe Park.However, McInally, who only had four substitutes because of injuries, thought his players – some only playing their second 90 minutes of the summer – looked the part against a team from the league above them. He said: “It was a poor game.“I don’t know if it was the heat – the pitch is really lush. The ball was slow and I wouldn’t like to have paid to watch that.“It was nice to get the bonus point and not concede a goal.“I thought our two young centre-backs (Brown and new boy Cameron Eadie) did really well again. They’ve done well in pre-season.“They’ll get a testing again tomorrow night. We can play miles better than that, but it’s early in the season.”In the opening period at Brechin, Blue Toon skipper Rory McAllister was denied twice when through on goal – first by a brilliant Jordan Tapping tackle and then seeing a left-footed volley deflected just past the post.Up the other end, the busy Callum Tapping dragged a glorious opportunity past the far right post.City should have been in front by the break, with Callum Tapping spurning more chances as Dene Shields also saw a back-post header saved and Sean Burns’ free-kick hit the bar.There were less in the way of chances after half-time, but again it was Brechin who should have taken the lead, with Greg Fleming tipping the game’s best chance, a Shields header from point-blank range, over the bar.In the shoot-out, Peterhead were first to blink, with full-back for the day Willie Gibson hitting the right post with his side’s third. However, Brechin defender Paul McLean then rolled his past the left post.In sudden death, Giuliano Moreno’s blast was tipped on to the bar and out by the diving Fleming, which left Brown to smash into the top-left corner for the extra point.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/06/18, 3:50 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The last thing David MacInnes sees himself as is a hero.Be we believe differently.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty.

Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done.

So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"exciting shinty at the macaulay sixes","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 22/06/18, 8:15 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowNo fewer than 29 youth shinty teams travelled to Oban\u0026#8217s Mossfield Park for the annual Macaulay six-a-side competition.The winners of the main competition for P7 and under were Inverlochy, who defeated Taynuilt 1-0 in the final with Taynuilt taking the Oban Celtic Shield.The Alastair Campbell Shield for P5 and under was won by Braxi Boys from Inverlochy who defeated Bute in a very exciting final after extra time by one penalty to nil.The Macaulay Development trophy was won by Rockfield Rapids.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scrum for burgers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 7:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Mid Argyll Rugby Club had its annual end-of-season barbeque and awards ceremony at the Ropework park on Sunday June 24.The kids from P4/5 and P6/7 that played a big part in winning the league and runners up in P4/5 also received medals.Of the primary six and sevens, player of the year went to Murray MacDonald, most improved player of the year went to Aileen Barr, the coaches award went to Campbell Shaw and best newcomer went to Rhys Coffield.Of the younger kids of primary four and five, the player of the year award went to Arran Martin most improved player of the year went to Fergus Bennet the coaches award went to Jorja and Jemma MacDonald and best newcomer went to Logan Cinnamond.On top of their awards, all the kids were also given a new training top sponsored by Jewsons.The players also clubbed together to get all the coaches a gift each.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inverarays sale of the summer gets underway","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/07/18, 6:37 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe famous Inveraray summer sale has started.On Monday June 25, Inveraray’s parish church hall opened its doors, brimming with exquisite odds and ends.Ornaments, sports equipment and anything else you can think of can be found at the church for a fair price.Volunteer Wilma Wood said: \u0026#8216Anyone looking for something in particular can give us a shout.

All four girls contributed valuable points, with Jemma excelling in the 75 metres sprint recording a time of 12.65 seconds. Jorja was the top Mid Argyll girl in the long jump reaching 3.03 metres and also had a respectable 10.55 metres throw with the 500g turbo javelin.The girls B team finished ahead of the A team in 28th overall, mainly due to an excellent 14.25 metres javelin throw by Sophie Balkeen.

The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve. The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

Councillor Dougie Philand commented: \u0026#8216With Scottish Canals owning the business it is hoped this will provide stability to the business, allowing it to flourish in an area which is under re-development.\u0026#8217Councillor Donnie MacMillan added: \u0026#8216It is good to see something happening at the Ardrishaig pier buildings and I wish them the best of luck in their venture.\u0026#8217Sandy Taylor welcomed it as a step in the regeneration of the area, adding: \u0026#8216I hope it will prove to be a place where visitors can stop and learn more about the Crinan Canal and its place in Scotland’s and our local history.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 11/07/18, 6:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe pages of the July 6 edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser contain too many stories of sadness and pain.

The drama and uncertainty of the Yot Spot era can now be forgotten in Ardrishaig, as the new Steamer Terminal cafe opens.

On a lovely summer evening the rafters of Strachur Memorial Hall dirled to the sound of pipers showing off skills learned during the week in front of proud family members. John Kelly of Dunoon performed his master of ceremony duties with his usual wit and dexterity.An award, presented by his family in memory of the late Niall Campbell, is presented each year to the pupil who has shown the biggest improvement in the eyes of the tutors. From a shortlist of six young players, this year\u0026#8217s recipient of the Niall Campbell trophy was Mid Argyll\u0026#8217s own Camron MacPhail.Strachur and District Piping Association made another surprise award this year for services to the piping school. Association chairman Colin Stevenson made the presentation to Allan McLean of Kilmartin for his support over two decades. Not only has he driven mini buses to allow children from Mid Argyll to attend but he has offered a helping hand in many different aspects over the years.Winding up another successful week as the concert concluded, Mr Stevenson thanked parents, pupils and all the tutors for their support, while acknowledging the hard work of committee members and everyone who helps.PIC:Alastair McLean performs a Gaelic song to add a little variety. 06_a28PipingSchool01The success of Mid Argyll Pipe Band was celebrated as a group of band members performed on stage. 06_a28PipingSchool02The inimitable piping tutor Annie Grant, right, was assisted in her intermediate piping group by Alastair MacLean, left. 06_a28PipingSchool04Camron MacPhail was presented with his trophy by Jamie Campbell, a grandson of the late Pipe Major Niall Campbell. 06_a28PipingSchool06There was a surprise for Allan McLean when he was presented with a gift to recognise his contribution to the piping school over many years.

The biggest cheer of the day was reserved for this year’s Queen Chloe Macdonald, who together with her Princesses Caitlyn Prentice and Cara Mackie were introduced to the crowd by Rev Robert Macleod and Councillor Anne Horn.Tarbert’s new Royal Family then led the famous festival parade where locals and visitors alike dressed up and joined in with this year’s Heroes and Villains theme.  Pirates and superheroes watched on as Cruella De Vil and her dogcatcher tried to capture more Dalmatian puppies. And the Batmobile was hot on the trail of the Joker who was seen heading through the village with Poison Ivy.One of the festival’s most eagerly anticipated events is the cookery demonstrations, once again led by Mike Leslie of Kilsyth’s Coachman Hotel. The market area was packed as cooks got some professional tips on how to prepare and cook seafood.While the adults tucked into some of Tarbert’s finest fish and shellfish, younger festival-goers were being wowed by the gravity defying Clan Stunt Bike Team, before learning new skills in the circus workshop.Highland dancing displays plus performances by festival regulars Mid Argyll Pipe Band ensured there was something for everyone, before Sunday’s Beer on the Pier, where party people of all ages packed Tarbert’s quay, ready to be entertained.Girl band Feeva promised and delivered ‘cheesy tunes’ and were closely followed by Scotland’s number one Take That cover band, Could It Be Take That, to keep the party atmosphere going. Local band The Democrats brought the curtain down on this year’s festival in style.With just three people in the festival committee it fell to organiser Margaret MacNeill to comment on this year’s event saying: \u0026#8216Thank you to everyone who came and joined in with this year\u0026#8217s Seafood Festival.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12468674.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_240218grant_07JPG.jpg","title":"maybole super school one step","story":"NewsMaybole super-school is one step closer to being builtCouncillors have approved the results of a public consultation in the town that will see a 1400-pupil campus erected at Carrick Academy.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson15:27, 10 JUL 2018NewsNew Carrick Academy artist impression (Image: Copyright Unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA \u0026pound42million super-school has taken a step closer to being built in Maybole. Councillors have approved the results of a public consultation in the town that will see a 1400-pupil campus erected at Carrick Academy. Plans will see Cairn and Gardenrose Primaries merge to become a new school located at the purpose-built campus. Nurseries for both schools would also merge to be ready for August 2021. St Cuthbert’s Primary – where parents responding to the consultation issued a rejection of the move – would also relocate but operate as a stand-alone school. A bid for funding will now be made to the Scottish Government. A total of 87 written responses were received during the council’s consultation that officials noted was “low considering the size of Maybole with a population of 4,700 people”.  Council schools spokesman William Grant said: “There is a general agreement of all schools to come together. “Where we had a more mixed response regarded the possible move of the swimming pool. “It is important as we progress the design that too much is not crammed in to this new campus. “It must be open and spacious.” Maybole Tory councillor Ian Campbell hailed the project as a “wonderful step forward”.

Bids of \u0026pound1.5million are being sought for Enterkine House, perched above Annbank. The luxury four-star retreat, which boasts 74 acres of land, employs around 50 staff. Kirk House and Steading, a six-bedroom farmhouse currently used as overspill accommodation for the hotel, is also included. Agents Christie \u0026amp Co and Galbraith said the plot offered “potential for development under a new owner”. It follows a long-running noise battle at the hotel which saw bosses spend \u0026pound80,000 soundproofing their wedding marquee. Council chiefs were told that slapping an 11pm curfew on party bands could put the hotel out of business.  But they finally got the all-clear earlier this year and revealed plans to build a permanent structure. However, the hotel is now being offered to the market. Bob Cherry, a partner with Galbraith, said: “The purchaser of Enterkine would find it relatively straightforward to continue the current business, which is well-established, and there are further opportunities for diversification or expansion of the tourism and events facilities on the estate, subject to the necessary consents. “This is a beautiful estate with a thriving hotel business and potential for further development.” Brian Sheldon, of Christie \u0026amp Co, added: “The market for country house hotels such as Enterkine House has vastly improved in recent years. “Its location in South Ayrshire and within such an enviable estate and countryside will attract local, regional and potentially international operators. “Whilst the business is trading well, there is certainly scope for further growth.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"royal troon golf club make","story":"NewsRoyal Troon golf club make generous donation to hospital unitIt follows a charity 18-hole golf event with Troon Portland and Troon Ladies, writes Charlene Bennie.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post15:39, 10 JUL 2018News\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRoyal Troon Golf Club has made the generous donation of \u0026pound1k to Crosshouse Hospital’s Acute Stroke Unit.

That’s the shock ultimatum delivered by warring SNP councillors to their embattled leader. Douglas Campbell has been ordered to regain control of his split ranks during the council’s summer break. It comes as rival camps “fight like rats” to wrestle the council’s power base back on track. A racism storm and failed coup on Councillor Campbell has plunged the SNP into crisis. And the Post understands another plot to oust the leader is now brewing. It follows all SNP group members signing a declaration of support for their under-fire boss just two weeks ago. But a party insider has revealed growing disquiet is threatening to tear the group apart.  Within hours of the public show of support, Cllr Campbell was being placed under increasing pressure to step down of his own accord, rather than face another bruising challenge from within, the Post has learned. A senior source said: “People agreed to fall in line and sign the declaration for the sake of the bigger picture. “But it’s widely accepted that a change is required and this can’t go on. “The group is in a position where people will fight like rats to get what they want. “However, the even bigger concern is trying to keep the administration intact.” Worries over a potential walkout from Labour colleagues has, until now, ensured enough SNP support behind Cllr Campbell. A potential change in the their leadership is thought that have strained relations with administration partners, who have indicated they are happier working with Cllr Campbell.  But the Post understands that Cllr Campbell’s Labour past is forming a big part of the problem for the SNP leader as he battles factions within his new party. And a new warning – issued as councillors left for their summer break – stressed that he must crack the whip among his troubled ranks. The source added: “It was made very clear that if he doesn’t, the matter will be taken out of his hands. “The party is being crucified every week and it cannot be allowed to continue. “Some see Douglas as being far too close to Labour and that is undoubtedly a big issue for him. “Either way, he’s been given the message in clear terms that he needs to get everyone behind him and on the same page.” When asked about the warning, the group’s depute leader, William Grant, insisted: “This is news to me.” Cllr Campbell added: “Cllr Grant responded to your enquiry that ‘This is news to me’ and I have nothing to add.” "},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-scott-street-to-be-resurfaced-later-this-month","story":"RESIDENTS on one of Galashiels\u0027 main thoroughfares are set to face disruption as resurfacing works prepare to get underway later this month.\nScott Street will be resurfaced in two phases starting from Monday, July 30 until Friday, August 10.\nPhase one will see works take place from the junction of St John Street to immediately before the junction with Balmoral Place, between July 30 and August 3.\nPhase two will see the section from Balmoral Place to Roxburgh Place resurfaced from August 6 to 10.\nEach section of Scott Street will be closed from 8.30am to 5pm while the works take place in these locations.

Identity cards can be faked \u0026ndash phone the company to verify their identity.\n\u0026bull Some companies offer a password system. Ask your utility providers if this can be used and if you have a password with a company make sure the caller uses it.\n\u0026bull Never let people try to persuade you to let them into your home even if they are asking for help \u0026ndash they may not be genuine. If someone is persistent, ask them to call at another time and arrange for a friend or family member to be with you.\n\u0026bull Never agree to pay for goods or give money to strangers who arrive at your door.\n\u0026bull Don\u0026rsquot keep large amounts of money in your home.\n\u0026bull Remember, it\u0026rsquos your home. There\u0026rsquos no reason why anyone should ever enter your home against your wishes.\n\u0026bull If you\u0026rsquore not sure, don\u0026rsquot answer the door.\nFor more information, visit the Police Scotland website or contact your local community officer on 101.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"town-centre-building-set-for-facelift","story":"THE owners of a Bridge Street building in Kelso have applied to give their town centre property a makeover.\u0026nbsp\nDavid and Graeme Brechin, of Grant Avenue, Edinburgh, have applied to Scottish Borders Council for permission to renovate and repair the exterior of 6 Bridge Street.\u0026nbsp\nThe building is home to commercial properties, with a women\u0026rsquos clothes shop and charity shop occupying the ground floor, and the upper floors are divided into office accommodation.\u0026nbsp\nThe application outlined the aims of the proposal: \u0026ldquoRecently stonework had fallen off the building resulting in building standards involvement on public safety grounds and a scaffold has been erected.\n\u0026ldquoVarious options for repair have been considered, including renewing all the damaged stone with new natural stone indents but with 75 percent of the elevation delaminating it is prohibitively expensive and disproportionate to the capital value of the premises.\u0026nbsp\n\u0026ldquoRepairing individual stones in lithomix was also consider but is also not possible because of the large proportion of the fa\u0026ccedilade needing repaired.\n\u0026ldquoThe option the applicant wishes to pursue is for a more extensive render repair by cutting back virtually all of the facing stone, fixing an expanded metal base then expertly and uniformly stucco-rendering the fa\u0026ccedilade, scoring it to simulate ashlar stonework.\u0026nbsp\n\u0026ldquoCareful treatment around the window dressing, decorative eaves cornice and quoins will be carried out prior to the render coat application by a reputable, local stonemason, who will replace or repair the decorative stone to retain the character of the building.\u0026nbsp\nThe application will now be considered by Scottish Borders Council planning officers.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"noel-gallagher-tribute-band-to-play-galashiels-gig","story":"NOEL Gallagher fans in the Borders will be feeling supersonic as a tribute band rolls with it into the MacArts centre in Galashiels next week.\nThe band, named Acoustic Gallagher will be in town on Friday, July 13.\nThe gig will celebrate the songwriting talents of Oasis, as well as playing well-known classics and B-sides including Wonderwall, Champagne Supernova and of course, Don\u0026rsquot Look Back in Anger.\nDoors open at 7.30pm and music starts at 8pm.\nTickets\nare \u0026pound10, and are available by calling the box office on 01896 756852, or can be booked online at www.ticketsource/date/483994\nincluding \u0026lsquoWonderwall\u0026rsquo, \u0026lsquoChampagne Supernova\u0026rsquo, \u0026lsquoThe Masterplan\u0026rsquo, \u0026lsquoIf I Had a Gun\u0026rsquo, and of course, \u0026lsquoDon\u0026rsquot Look Back in Anger\u0026rsquo.\n\u0026lsquoSome might say\u0026rsquo that the Manchester band\u0026rsquos classics will receive an airing, along with work from Noel\u0026rsquos solo act, the High Flying Birds.\n\u0026lsquoWhat a life\u0026rsquo fans will also be in for a treat at the gig too.\u0026nbsp\nAdditionally, a licensed bar will be in operation on the night.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"galas-gareth-has-a-wicked-time-with-west-end-star","story":"AN aspiring performer from Galashiels has realised a lifelong dream by sharing the stage with one of musical theatre\u0026rsquos biggest stars.\nNineteen-year-old Gareth Williams, who is currently training for a BA (Hons) degree in Musical Theatre at The MGA Academy of Performing Arts in Edinburgh, was given the opportunity to provide backing vocals for West End and Broadway star Kerry Ellis during her 20th anniversary concert at The Queen\u0026rsquos Hall in Edinburgh.\nKerry is widely considered to be the one of musical theatre\u0026rsquos biggest stars and has previously starred in Wicked, We Will Rock You, My Fair Lady, Miss Saigon, Oliver!

Galashiels has been especially hard hit, with its proportion of vacant retail units now standing at 15% representing a total of 37 empty stores.\nHawick and Selkirk lag not far behind, with 14% apiece of their shops lying empty, and 13% of Jedburgh\u0026rsquos shops are also going spare.\nPeebles, Kelso, Duns, Melrose and Eyemouth have all kept their proportion of empty shops in their town centres at 8% or below, though.\nThe purpose of the town centre core activity area pilot study is to suggest updating the council\u0026rsquos planning policy in a bid to save the region\u0026rsquos high streets.\nIn it, lead planning officer Charles Johnston says: \u0026ldquoRetailing patterns continue to fluctuate, and the role of town centres is changing\u0026nbsp for example, the increase of online shopping and competition from larger national retailers.\n\u0026ldquoThe impacts of the current challenging economic climate are being felt across the country, and these trends are not unique to the Scottish Borders.\n\u0026ldquoPlanning policy must adapt to these changing circumstances.\n\u0026ldquoIn recent years, the council has amended its town centre policy in its local development plan to adapt to such changes, and whilst these changes have helped, it is acknowledged that a further review of relevant planning policy could be tested via this pilot study.\n\u0026ldquoThere are specific immediate concerns regarding Hawick and Galashiels, where reduced footfall and vacancy rates have had a detrimental impact on how these town centres have performed.\n\u0026ldquoThis is of particular concern as Hawick and Galashiels are the two largest towns within the Borders and have a strategic economic and social significance for the region.\nThe report recommends the council tries out pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels, either scrapping or altering their core activity area status marking out the boundaries of their commercial centres to allow a greater range of activity to take place within them.\nPlanning permission is usually only granted in such town centres if proposals are for business use in keeping with the surroundings of the sites in question, but\u0026nbspabolishing core activity area status would allow non-commercial enterprises to occupy empty high street properties.\nIn Hawick, the report says, a radical approach is needed, so it recommends councillors to vote to abolish the core activity centre there altogether.\n\u0026ldquoReducing the core area completely would, in essence, allow a greater number of other uses within the town centre, it says.\n\u0026ldquoWhilst there is the threat that complete removal of the core activity area may cause longer-term footfall issues, it is considered that some significant action is required in Hawick.\n\u0026ldquoTo implement this as a test case via a pilot scheme would seem an appropriate course of action in the circumstances.\nIn Galashiels, it is recommended that core activity area is retained but that the scope of activity allowed be expanded to include professional service businesses, non-profitable institutions and leisure activities.\nThe outcomes of those proposed pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels would then be used to draw up similar proposals for other towns.\nFootfall figures % change from 2007 to 2017:\nHawick

customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current period of hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer usage has increased significantly.With the current weather conditions forecast to continue people should take simple but important steps to conserve public water supplies.In some areas there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water during the summer and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely and  to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Some water treatment works and distribution networks are working at near capacity to meet demand.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of usage and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce usage wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their usage and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible, use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.Scotland’s public water supply is the lifeblood of the country, for household and business customers and more than 1.3 billion litres is used per day.There is a strong and resilient water distribution network but everyone will need to play their part as Scotland

Campbeltown Town Councillors found themselves asking this time and again during a long debate on council housing for key workers at their monthly meeting on Monday evening.Bailie George McMillan had put forward a motion \u0026#8216that this council decide that all applications for a let of a council house should be accompanied by a certificate from the Ministry of Labour, in consultation with the Board of Trade.\u0026#8217Bailie McMillan said that some workers classified as key workers had been allocated houses under a \u0026#8216great stretch of imagination.\u0026#8217\u0026#8216Stick by the rules,\u0026#8217 added the bailie, \u0026#8216and let the application lie for 30 days for investigations.\u0026#8217Seconding Bailie McMillan, Councillor Charles Kennedy said that nobody classed as a key worker had been allocated a house under his convenership of the housing committee.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOSaturday July 13, 1918If the success of the fishermen’s concert held in the Victoria Hall on the evening of Saturday last is to be taken as criterion \u0026#8211 and we think this is the manner in which it should be regarded – the local effort in connection with Scotland’s present July movement on behalf of the Red Cross funds bids fair to establish another record for whole-souled generosity on the part of the community of the town and district.Excellently organised by the joint secretaries, Messrs A. Ollar and D. Robertson, who had the energetic assistance of a most representative and capable committee of boat-owners and band of other devoted workers, the appeal made to the public for a full measure of that liberal support for which this locality has earned a name which is second to none struck a most responsive chord, with the result that the large hall was crowded to the door.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"kitchen firm cooks up charity cash","story":"Recently Raymond Harvey of the Campbeltown Christmas lights group on left and Lewis MacKay from Castlehill primary football collected cheques from Howden\u0026#8217s manager Archie Martin centre. 25_c28howdens01_RaymondHarvey_ArchieMartin_LewisMackay\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"simple pleasures of working outside in good weather","story":"NFU president Andrew McCornick said: \u0026#8216This year started with a long and expensive winter, caused by a combination of poor weather and a hangover from the previous year’s difficult harvest.\u0026#8216The recent dry spell has been a welcome relief for many of our members.\u0026#8216After suffering a dreadful 12 months of weather they have had an opportunity to cut hay and silage, graze livestock outdoors, and generally enjoy the simple pleasures of working outside in good weather.\u0026#8216The quality of winter fodder made to date is likely to be tremendous.\u0026#8216I am always wary when discussing the downside of warm weather in Scotland, as it is such a rarity.\u0026#8216That being said, many parts will be hoping for a spot of rain.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.

ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.

Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.  The site had long been earmarked for Sainsbury\u0026rsquos after it won a lengthy battle with Tesco to build on the site in 2013."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8009220.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"dunbar-student-heading-off-to-the-olympics-of-tech","story":"  A games development team, made up of students from Abertay University, will take on the best in the world at the Microsoft Imagine Cup in Seattle.  The competition \u0026ndash dubbed the Olympics of Tech \u0026ndash seeks out the most innovative and potentially world-changing software solutions and comes with a first prize of $100,000.  Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.  She said: \u0026ldquoThey are sending the first and second place teams out to Seattle for the competition, which is in the last week in July.  \u0026ldquoIt is quite exciting, I\u0026rsquom just the artist on the team.  \u0026ldquoI do the models and particular effects and textures.  The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.  In April, the team from Abertay University took part in the UK finals of the Microsoft Imagine Cup in London.  A team from Manchester University was crowned the overall UK winner with Abertay finishing as the runner-up.  Now, both universities will send teams to the final.  The Abertay team are focusing on making the simulator better before they head to Washington.  Twenty-year-old Emily\u0026rsquos involvement in the project is the latest step as she attempts to land her dream job.  She added: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove wanted to work in computer games from like primary school.  \u0026ldquoMy end goal is to try to get a job doing 3D somewhere, which is doable."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8010369.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"wrong-site-for-youth-shelter-say-residents","story":"  North Berwick Youth Project is keen to carry out work to the run-down shelter to give their members a place to spend their time.  A post from the youth project said: \u0026ldquoOver the past three years, young people have been looking at youth provision in North Berwick and have been shocked to learn just how much has been lost and never replaced.  \u0026ldquoThe team have been working hard to receive advice from East Lothian Council on what can be put in place to ensure a safe environment for all, as well as actions which can be taken to discourage anti-social behaviour. The young people would like to re-build the shelter with wider community involvement.  But Kathryn and Douglas Paul, who live at Glasclune Gardens, would prefer to see the shelter demolished.  Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.  The couple told the Courier they had experienced long-standing anti-social behaviour from youngsters who already gather at the shelter.

Lauren Cowie, project manager at North Berwick Youth Project, insisted plans were \u0026ldquostill at a very early stage.  She added: \u0026ldquoWe are committed to working with the entire community and in particular those who live near the proposed shelter.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.  Paul, of Burns Wynd, is now planning to return to Napier after the summer to complete his Master\u0026rsquos Degree.  Angela, who has been Paul\u0026rsquos full-time carer, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom incredibly proud of Paul.  \u0026ldquoDespite his challenges he just gets on with things and has achieved his degree.  \u0026ldquoHe has had a tough life but he does not give up and is an incredibly caring young man.  \u0026ldquoNothing is going to stop Paul.  Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.  Paul hopes that his achievement will inspire others with illness and disabilities to follow their dreams and aspirations.  He said: \u0026ldquoTo graduate with a degree is massive. It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.

A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt needs to look at the impact on economic development and benefits it is bringing into East Lothian as well.  The committee agreed to ask for a detailed review of the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.

However, at a meeting last week, the board was told that Mr Darling had parted company with the pub owners and the premises was currently closed.

Mr Hughes told the board that he was preparing to sign a five-year-lease of the pub with its current owner in a deal which would allow him to buy it at the end of the lease.  He said that there were plans to renovate the building to open it up more and make it a family-friendly site.  Mr Hughes told the meeting: \u0026ldquoWe plan to make it a good country food and beer premises.  \u0026ldquoIt is in an area steeped in history with [Belhaven] Brewery and a popular tourism area, and we want to turn it into a good welcoming family pub.  Mr Hughes, who has been at Dunbar Golf Club for several years, told the board he had more than 23 years of experience in the licensed trade and had worked in Edinburgh before moving to East Lothian.  He said that if given approval to go ahead the pub could re-open early next year.  The board agreed to transfer the licence to Mr Hughes, wishing him luck with the venture."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-open-2018-trophy-tour-finale-at-tranent-school","story":"  Beth Allen, ambassador for ASI and member of the Ladies European and LPGA Tour, was there on the day and attended a special assembly and Q\u0026ampA session with pupils to give more insight into her life as a professional golfer.  Tranent\u0026rsquos Active Schools coordinator Adam Martin also presented information about both the men\u0026rsquos and ladies\u0026rsquo Scottish Opens coming to Gullane before primary five students took part in a ClubGolf session, led by East Lothian Golf Development Officer Kate Green with assistance from Scottish Golf, Active Schools, the Stephen Gallacher Foundation and Beth Allen.  A ClubGolf mass participation session was then held over lunchtime to give all children at the school a chance to experience golf, using everything from plastic ClubGolf equipment, professional clubs and golf balls to Scottish Golf inflatable nets.  About 14,000 primary and high school pupils in East Lothian have been visited at their schools as part of the trophies tour in the run-up to the Scottish Open, which takes place from next Thursday (July 12), and the Ladies\u0026rsquo Scottish Open which begins on Thursday, July 26.  Mr Martin said: \u0026ldquoThe trophies tour finale at Sanderson\u0026rsquos Wynd was an amazing day and these children not only got to see the trophies up close but also got to grill a brilliant professional athlete in Beth Allen. It was also fantastic to give them the opportunity to swing a golf club for the first time.  \u0026ldquoI hope that the trophy tour has inspired children across East Lothian to come down to Gullane in July and continue to get involved in golf.

Assembly host Bryden McKinnie, told the Courier, he received news from the Food Assembly UK operators on Friday afternoon that they were no longer operating in the UK.  The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.  However Mr McKinnie said alternatives would be looked at if it received a boost in its support.  He said: \"During the summer months orders can fall as low as 10 a week which is not sustainable. It really is a case of \"use it or lose it\".\"  A spokesperson for the Food Assembly said no public statement on the withdrawal was being made before the end of August.  She said: \"The announcement has been made to our network of hosts and producers, many of them will communicate to their members when they are ready, and we will do a public communication in August.\""},{"url":null,"title":"talented-teenage-drummer-clara-wilberforce-joins-national-youth-pipe-band-of-scotland","story":"  Clara Wilberforce, who has been playing the snare drum since she was in P6 at King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, has linked up with the National Youth Pipe Band of Scotland\u0026rsquos development band.  That came after a rigorous audition process, which saw the 15-year-old perform to a group of judges.  Proud mum Juliet told the Courier it had been an eventful period from the audition to finding out that Clara had been successful.  She said: \u0026ldquoShe went to the National Piping Centre in Glasgow and she did her audition and she came out and said \u0026lsquoI did so badly, I messed up\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe was so disappointed and I said to her that she was very young.  \u0026ldquoShe was terribly disappointed but I said \u0026lsquonever mind, you are young and will get another chance another year\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe had been in tears and she felt she let herself down.  \u0026ldquoWe forgot all about it and then suddenly emails were coming through to her and myself.  \u0026ldquoShe came tearing down the stairs screaming at the top of her voice that she got into the development band.  \u0026ldquoShe was running round the house, up and down the stairs screaming with joy.  Her first event will feature Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain at the Phil and Aly RSNO St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day Concert at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on November 25.  Music runs in the family, with older brother Ninian, playing the pipes, while Juliet plays the piano and dad Marcus is a member of Haddington\u0026rsquos Siancio Singers.  Clara, who is in S5 at Knox Academy and studying Higher maths, English, geography and human biology, is also a member of the school\u0026rsquos pipe band as well as Haddington Pipe Band, where she is a senior drummer.  Her mum, who praised the efforts of Davey Barnes, who runs Knox Academy Pipe Band, and Dave Henry, drum teacher, said Clara \u0026ldquoloves the drumming and she had made a number of good friends through music and boosted her confidence.  Alastair Bruce, chairman of Haddington Pipe Band, congratulated Clara, who lives in the town, on the achievement.  The youngster won the band\u0026rsquos Niall Fairgrieve Award in 2014 for most improved drummer and has continued to impress.

Now his son Kit, who lives in Belhaven, has released a new version of the tale which looks at Chris\u0026rsquo 30-year career with the company, its characters and ships.  The company, which provides a link to many of the Scottish islands from the mainland, dates back to 1851 and has become famous for the red and black funnel, complete with the Lion Rampant, on its ships.  Kit said: \u0026ldquoWe self-published it the first time and having, finally, persuaded him to write down all the stories I found a way of getting it published.  \u0026ldquoWe printed about 400 copies and the punchline is, despite him giving a few away, we got enough money back to cover the publication cost.  \u0026ldquoAs far as I know it is sold out \u0026ndash I have got a copy and so do both my sons but I think that is about it.  \u0026ldquoThe reason we published it in the first place was, certainly to us, the highly entertaining stories about MacBrayne.  \u0026ldquoThere was a lot in it about his army service and, after coming back to it after all those years, the reason for publishing it again was just to make sure those reflections on a way of life long gone did not die with him.  Kit \u0026ndash who last year released The Triumph and Tragedy of the Bantams, which focused on a band of \u0026ldquobrave but largely forgotten soldiers \u0026ndash has added his own stories of being a \u0026lsquoMacBrayne Child\u0026rsquo.  He added that his dad was known as the \u0026lsquostoryteller\u0026rsquo in the family and he wanted to make sure the stories were available to a new generation.

The 51-year-old, whose nephew is Scotland rugby star Huw Jones, has driven a taxi for nine years to pay his way through university and has built his own film studio and edit suite at his home in Longniddry.  The dad-of-three said: \u0026ldquoThe TV course has been a brilliant journey.  \u0026ldquoColleagues often ask where I find my energy, and sometimes I have to ask myself the same thing, especially at 4am when I have forgotten to go to bed. Perhaps my endurance and resilience comes from my 12 years as a commando.  \u0026ldquoThere have been sacrifices, the biggest of them being to have had no social life throughout this time, but I am passionate about television and I am now talking to production companies and hoping to make my mark in the documentary genre.  While Matt admits it was \u0026ldquoeasy to feel envious of weekend revellers partying, he said driving taxis allowed him to refine his interview skills for his TV career ahead.  And among those to grace the back seat of his cab over the last nine years have been the likes of Angus Deayton, Ian Lavender, Paul Merton, Alexei Sayle, Ruth Madoc and Steven Berkoff.  Matt, who served with the Royal Marines in Northern Ireland, has already completed a music production with National Museums Scotland for a new exhibition on Scottish pop from the 1950s to present day.

Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history. Residents of Musselburgh and visitors will no doubt appreciate this latest addition to the public art within the community.  Michael Johnson of Nottinghamshire created \u0026lsquoThe Mussel\u0026rsquo with input from local schoolchildren, and its installation was recently highlighted in the Courier. He has been making artworks for public places since 1991 and has now completed more than 180 commissions for both rural and urban sites throughout the UK and Ireland.  Mr Goodfellow added: \u0026ldquoThis is a work of outstanding beauty that truly complements the town and its cultural heritage.  East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Arts Service formed a working group to select and commission artists to create the new public artwork. The group included representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership, Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, Musselburgh Conservation society, East Lothian Council officers, councillors and other community representatives.

Dunbar and East Linton ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire encouraged members of the public to go along and have their say.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere is a high demand for the parks that we have in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoAs the town grows in size, we have got to make sure we make best use of every bit of green space that we have.  A proposed theme for the park would be to celebrate the varied geology of the county.  Information cairns and distance markers could be created around a circular path.  The creation of paths, additional trim trail equipment and the retention of the putting green are among the ideas highlighted, as well as a new football area with permanent goals.  However, potentially the most ambitious aspect of the scheme is the creation of a new pavilion with access to public toilets.  The potential of a pavilion comes after Winterfield Pagoda, which dated back to the 1920s, was torn down in March last year.  Capital investment could also be made in a tree shelter belt, rural parkour \u0026ndash or free-running \u0026ndash elements in timber and additional benches and seating.  Another major project could be the creation of \u0026ldquoa low-key but iconic \u0026lsquogateway\u0026rsquo feature which would welcome walkers off the John Muir Way and into the park.

Five of those who lost weight suffered a \u0026ldquosignificant loss, according to the report by the Care Inspectorate officers who visited the home during an unannounced three-day inspection in May.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership confirmed it had suspended admission to the home following the report, which has now been fully revealed, after it emerged last month the home had been ordered to make urgent improvements after inspectors raised \u0026ldquoserious concerns.  HC-One, which operates the home, says it has introduced a new home manager and it pointed to some of the more \u0026ldquopositive comments in the report which acknowledged staff were praised for their approach to residents.  A spokesperson for HC-One said: \u0026ldquoThe health and wellbeing of our residents is our highest priority and we take all feedback from the Care Inspectorate extremely seriously. We are pleased their full report included some positive comments about the home, particularly noting our staff team are \u0026lsquokind and caring\u0026rsquo in their approach to residents.  \u0026ldquoWe also recognise we need to do better in some other areas. To do this, we have a new home manager in place who is being supported by the wider management team, and we continue to work closely with the Care Inspectorate and relevant authorities as we implement our improvement plan.  \u0026ldquoWe are pleased significant positive progress has already been made, and are confident the home is in a better place than at the time of the original inspection.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue working hard each and every day so that we are consistently providing the standard of care that Residents deserve.  \u0026ldquoThe Care Inspectorate have recently returned to the home to commence a new inspection, and we look forward to demonstrating the positive changes to them.  Drummohr is the second nursing home in East Lothian operated by HC-One to have admissions suspended in two years.  In 2016, Tranent Care Home was temporarily stopped from admitting new residents by the partnership, which oversees adult care services, after reports of residents being ignored as they asked for help to eat, with others eating with their fingers because of a lack of cutlery or being unable to cut their food themselves, while others were seen wearing clothes soiled or left unchanged after spilling food on themselves.  The report into Drummohr said: \u0026ldquoThere was a lack of oversight and management of food and fluid intake in the home. Nineteen residents were recorded as having lost weight in March 2018. Five had significant weight loss.  \u0026ldquoWe observed instances where residents did not take their meal and nothing else was offered, teas were often left cold and untouched and one resident walked around taking others\u0026rsquo meals and drinks.  \u0026ldquoWe also noted that there was specific guidance in a care file from the dietician in respect of food and fluids that one resident could have. The instructions were not followed. These issues, together with the lack of guidance to staff in respect of monitoring, recording and evaluating intake, is concerning.  The report added that \u0026ldquosome of this lack of care could be attributed to a lack of staff.  Drummohr scored a 2 out of 5 on all four areas inspected, a score regarded as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo. The four areas were quality of care and support environment staffing and management and leadership.  An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe wellbeing of residents is always our paramount concern and in this case we will continue working closely with Care Inspectorate to ensure that HC-One delivers the required improvements as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoAs an interim measure, we have decided to suspend new admissions to Drummohr to enable staff there to focus on what needs to be done.

WHAT do we remember of our childhood in our later days? Think for a moment of the key happy memories which have framed your childhood. They are often simple ones involving play outside. Sadly, research is showing that children are increasingly less able to explore and play in the outdoors.  There are various reasons for this and there is a horrible irony at the centre of it. We have become far more obsessed with material things, it\u0026rsquos all around us. We are literally buying into the idea that happiness is about purchase and we are passing this on to our children.  It\u0026rsquos in our brains that the economy needs us to spend our money on things we don\u0026rsquot need. We are fed an ideology that spending money on stuff is not just a pleasure but a civic duty. It keeps the economy going and makes us all prosperous. That\u0026rsquos what we are made to believe.  But the result is that more than ever, for our children and ourselves, we are enslaved to the interests of corporate profit at the expense of what really matters: simple time to be and enjoy free pleasures.  These were my thoughts as I set off for the second of this summer\u0026rsquos journeys of discovery. I didn\u0026rsquot share them at the time, and of course I stopped thinking about them as the magic of the wood engulfed us.  We began our journey amongst yew trees which surrounded the ancient kirk of Garvald. It was a scorching day and the shade of trees was such a relief. The plan was to spend the day exploring the wood and discover Stoneypath Castle.  Garvald Kirk has a simple beauty. While parts of its wall are 800 years old, it has been subject to renovation and alteration over the last 200 years. There is a welcoming atmosphere inside and I reflected that when not being used for services it would make a perfect storytelling venue.  By the door there is a reminder of how religion can change its spots. A set of jougs hangs on the wall: an iron collar and chain once used to humiliate and degrade \u0026lsquosinners\u0026rsquo by chaining them up. The victims of this would have been mainly young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.  It\u0026rsquos right that it remains there, I think, as a reminder that religion can be used as a justification for intolerance, hate and cruelty as well as a source for love and compassion. The choice of which version to adhere to is a human one.  We followed the rabbits which scattered from the kirkyard into the wood. I was surprised that the Papana Water, which flows through the wood, was so full given there had been no real rain for weeks  It\u0026rsquos impossible to be bored in a wood. Hours were soaked up under the cooling shade of the tree canopy. It was quite simply a day of utter magic. We had our picnic under the shade of two giant Scots pine trees with the sound of running water in the background. It was the only real quiet moment in what would be hours of constant play. The kids just sat for a while, listening to the running water, and looking up at the trees. It was a communion of simple joy.  The walk isn\u0026rsquot so long in distance but it took us around five hours to complete. It could be done in 20 minutes or less if you just walk. But we didn\u0026rsquot just walk, we explored. There are three bridges which cross the Papana. Each one had a different attraction. Shoes were soon off and clothes got wet but the heat meant none of this mattered. A new game was devised when our youngest, Lewis, tried to use a piece of half-eaten banana as a substitute for a stick while playing \u0026lsquoPoohsticks\u0026rsquo . The girls rushed into the river to reclaim it, but then came up with a new game \u0026lsquohunt the banana\u0026rsquo.  After spending time at various points by the river, getting wet and discovering lots of things, we finally reached the walk\u0026rsquos end: Stoneypath Tower. It suddenly appears above the trees as if out of a fairy tale, its newly restored red walls and parapets a contrast to the green we were surrounded by.  There is much history in the castle, but then again there is history in the woods and hills.  As we headed back to Garvald the kids were quieter, tired by adventure, but in a joyful way. The image of my kids standing in the water, playing and searching for fish seemed to symbolise something immemorial: a powerful and simple truth that what we really need is an immersion in nature, not stuff that hijacks our wellbeing in the name of profit.  We surely stepped on the footprints of Robert Neillans on our return. He was a well-known cooper who lived in Garvald over 200 years ago. Perhaps he came foraging here, I thought. As the water sparkled in the sunshine I reflected that the making of \u0026lsquoillicit whisky\u0026rsquo was once common hereabouts and that Robert was, according to local historian Irene Anderson, one of those involved.  We walked past the house he built on the banks of the Papana when we returned to Garvald. What tales this village could tell!  We\u0026rsquod been \u0026lsquoaway\u0026rsquo for a total of nearly six hours in a magic place. But we\u0026rsquod met only one person walking her dog. In one sense that was a joy, and the absence of litter was another.  But it was tinged with a sense of sadness that the magic is something being lost to so many of us, and indeed that so many of the magic places are themselves being lost.  But my melancholy did not last long. It was a day of joy and we thanked the wood as we left."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8067093.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"day-two-of-the-aberdeen-standard-investments-scottish-open-at-gullane-golf-club","story":"  Rock is 13-under-par, two shots better off ellow countryman Tyrell Hatton.

Taylor Wimpey East Scotland has teamed up with Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ndash both of which are already building on the adjacent Letham Mains site, where more than 800 homes are being built \u0026ndash for the plans on Haddington\u0026rsquos south-western edge.  The early proposals, which will be unveiled to the public later this year, show about 300 homes, with a quarter of those being affordable.  Included in the plans are provision for roads and drainage infrastructure, off-site road improvements, as well as land being set aside for play areas and open space.  The Proposal of Application Notice (PAN) is the first step in the planning process, with the idea of housing on the site, off the A6093.  The land outlined for the development is identified for housing in the new Local Development Plan and, according to the developers, will be designed to integrate with the Letham Mains development.  The public exhibition will give both housebuilders the opportunity to share their proposals for the development with members of the public and other interested parties, and for feedback to be passed to the developer.  A detailed planning application is expected later this year.  Joanne Casey, director of Mactaggart \u0026amp Mickel Homes, speaking on behalf of both developers, said the PAN allowed the developers to \u0026ldquobegin the important process of community engagement.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe are fully committed to a detailed programme of engagement with local communities throughout the lifetime of our developments.  \u0026ldquoFor large-scale development projects like this one at Letham Holdings, we are especially keen to fully engage as early as possible in the overall process to allow us to understand and consider the views from as many stakeholders as we can.  \u0026ldquoWe will hold a joint public consultation event during the next few months and we would like to take this opportunity to encourage all interested individuals to become involved.  \u0026ldquoThis event will allow the local community to share their views so that we may consider these as we develop our emerging development proposal in order to make a detailed planning application around October this year."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8064331.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"east-lothians-chief-nurse-takes-on-health-director-role","story":"  Alison Macdonald has been appointed to replace David Small, who left the post last month to take up a new role as director of primary care transition with NHS Lothian.

The 63-year-old passed away on March 2, having been minister at St Mary\u0026rsquos Parish Church for more than a decade.  Now her sister Susan Gibson, along with daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, will be joined by nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess in the running-themed fundraisers.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom the runner in the family and I have always done a fundraising event every year.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was a great supporter, she was not a runner herself but she would tease me about the time I had done at the event.  \u0026ldquoShe was a huge supporter and always contributed generously to what I was running for.  \u0026ldquoAfter she had the terminal diagnosis, one thing we talked about was that I would organise some kind of running thing for the family.  \u0026ldquoIt was her choice to go with Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre because she had such amazing support there.  The charity, which has been based in Edinburgh since 1996, offers support to people with cancer and their family and friends.  The centres offer not only practical advice about benefits and eating well but qualified experts provide emotional support and the centres offer a chance to meet people or simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.  Team Jenny, which includes seven-year-old Isla, will in varying combinations be clocking up nearly 200 kilometres of timed runs throughout the summer.  Originally, the plan was for the seven family members to take part together in the same event.  However, with the family spread out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Coleraine, it proved impossible.  Instead they are taking on half a dozen different events before combining both the distance and fundraising totals together.  Elaine, 32, has already completed the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen, while Kara, 28, and her husband, Duncan, will be joined by Clare, 32, Elaine and Susan at the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, this month.  Meanwhile in Portrush, Northern Ireland, Susan will join Laura, 36, together with her daughters Ciara, 13, and Isla, at the Portrush Park Run.  Clare, Elaine, Kara and Susan will all take part in the Great Aberdeen Run 10k next month before Susan\u0026rsquos attention turns to the Scottish 10k, which starts and finishes at Musselburgh Racecourse in September.  Finally, Elaine and Susan will take on the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon in Glasgow, with Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry competing in the Belfast City Half Marathon in September.  The family set an initial fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 before increasing that to \u0026pound3,000 but both have already been smashed, with nearly \u0026pound5,000 already raised.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoIt is amazing.  \u0026ldquoPeople are just so incredibly generous and I think that is a measure of Jennifer and Maggie\u0026rsquos and the affection and respect people have for Maggie\u0026rsquos.  \u0026ldquoWe are very fortunate it is a very close family.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was very caring, had a great sense of humour and she was honest.  \u0026ldquoYou could always depend on her \u0026ndash it might not be what you wanted to hear but what you needed to hear.  \u0026ldquoShe had that ability to be completely honest without ever being harsh or unkind.  \u0026ldquoShe was incredibly supportive of the family and everybody in it.

The 90-year-old, who also met Scotland\u0026rsquos new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman MSP, added: \u0026ldquoMy first memory of work was the knowledge that the hospital was getting much busier and there were more children coming in and going out cured. Before that, the parents couldn\u0026rsquot afford medical help and were leaving it too late for their children to come in and many of them didn\u0026rsquot make it.  \u0026ldquoAlso I remember saying to the sister I was working with at the time: \u0026lsquoThe parents coming in now have lost their terribly haunted look because they know now they can bring their children in.\u0026rsquo  She told how the nurses had to live on-site in those days and would therefore tend to give up work when they became married.  Mrs Reid added: \u0026ldquoWe weren\u0026rsquot allowed to live out of hospital, we had to stay in the nurses\u0026rsquo homes.  \u0026ldquoI loved it \u0026ndash I loved the camaraderie, I loved the company, I loved everything about it.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot all drudgery and hard work, we had lots of fun into the bargain.

Business Secretary Mr Clark was challenged about the potential revolt on the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill, often referred to as the customs bill.  On BBC Radio 4\u0026rsquos Today programme he urged Tory colleagues who \u0026ldquowant to get on with Brexit to acknowledge that the Bill was \u0026ldquoessential and should not be impeded.  Asked if there was a suggestion that ministers would accept the amendments he said: \u0026ldquoNo. The Bill is an important part of preparing for the world after Brexit and I would have thought that all colleagues would respect the fact that we need to get those preparations in place whilst having this important negotiation to make sure that our trading arrangement can continue to support prosperity in the future.  Sir Bernard told the programme that the Chequers plan was \u0026ldquodead, with opposition from both wings of the Tory party.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom afraid it is neither beloved by Remainers or Leavers.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos also quite likely to be either rejected by the EU or more demands will be made upon it so it will be even less acceptable.  Mr Rees-Mogg, the leader of the pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG), played down suggestions over the weekend they were seeking to topple Mrs May, saying she still had time to change course on her proposals.  However, the danger to the Prime Minister was underlined by the disclosure that Brexiteers had set up a WhatsApp group to co-ordinate voting tactics, organised by ex-Brexit minister Steve Baker, who quit over the Chequers plan.  The Daily  reported more than 100 MPs had joined the group, more than double the 48 needed to submit letters of no confidence in the Prime Minister to force a leadership contest.  North Cornwall MP Scott Mann quit as a ministerial aide to the Treasury, the former postman saying he would not \u0026ldquodeliver a watered down Brexit.  The threat from the Brexiteers is not the only danger facing Mrs May, with pro-EU Tories tabling amendments of their own to the customs bill and the Trade Bill, which returns to the Commons on Tuesday, which would keep Britain in a customs union with the EU.  It was unclear whether they will actually press them to a vote after some pro-EU MPs backed Mrs May\u0026rsquos Chequers plan and EU white paper.  However, in a sign of just how volatile the party has become, former education secretary Justine Greening, who backed Remain, denounced the plan, saying it offered the \u0026ldquoworst of both worlds and called for a second referendum.  \u0026ldquoThe only solution is to take the final Brexit decision out of the hands of deadlocked politicians, away from the backroom deals, and give it back to the people, she said in an article for The Times.  The Prime Minister\u0026rsquos official spokesman responded: \u0026ldquoThe British public have voted to leave the European Union. There is not going to be a second referendum under any circumstances.  The spokesman said Mrs May was \u0026ldquovery clear that the proposal we put forward at Chequers delivers on the will of the people in the referendum.  The Chequers plan was \u0026ldquothe only way to enable us to get a deal with no friction at the EU/UK border, to resolve the Northern Ireland border issue and to ensure that we can strike free trade deals around the world, said the spokesman.  \u0026ldquoCabinet is behind it, businesses have come out to support it and now we need to get on with negotiating with the EU.  Negotiations on the withdrawal agreement and future relationship resumed at official level in Brussels on Monday, with new Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab due to hold his first face-to-face talks with the EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator Michel Barnier on Thursday.  Labour Brexit spokeswoman Jenny Chapman criticised Mr Raab for failing to attend the start of the new round of talks: \u0026ldquoOver the past week the Government\u0026rsquos Brexit strategy has descended into utter chaos.  \u0026ldquoBut rather than trying to repair the damage and negotiate with Brussels, the new Brexit Secretary has decided to take the evening off and attend a summer drinks reception. This is simply not good enough.  Meanwhile Boris Johnson, in his first public intervention since his resignation last week, appealed for people to take a more positive view of Britain\u0026rsquos prospects outside the EU.  In a sign that he was keeping his powder dry, he said in an article for The Daily  that he would resist \u0026ldquofor now the temptation \u0026ldquoto bang on about Brexit."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8075929.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"world-cup-triumph-afterglow-raises-french-spirits","story":"  \u0026ldquoEternal Happiness read Monday\u0026rsquos headline in sports daily L\u0026rsquoEquipe, summing up the mood of many after France defeated Croatia 4-2 in a thrilling match in Moscow.

The French, though, are more enamoured of the players, like 19-year-old star Kylian Mbappe, who scored the fourth goal, and of their coach, Didier Deschamps, with a parody photo circulating online suggesting Paris\u0026rsquo most famous avenue should be renamed \u0026ldquoDeschamps Elysees.

The latest figure is the lowest for any 12-month period since the year to March 2013, when it stood at 95,000.  Overall net migration \u0026ndash the difference between the numbers of people arriving and departing for at least 12 months and including non-EU nationals \u0026ndash was around 282,000 in 2017.

Immigration figures published since the EU referendum have sparked claims of a \u0026ldquoBrexodus \u0026ndash though commentators pointed out more people are still coming to live in the UK than departing.  While net migration has fallen from record levels of around a third of a million in 2015 and 2016, it is still well above the Government\u0026rsquos target of less than 100,000.          Our overall assessment based on all available sources is that net migration has fallen following record levels in 2015 and early 2016 and has been broadly stable since https://t.co/U0vwojGKDy pic.twitter/1CPJkbXoOu          \u0026mdash ONS (@ONS) July 16, 2018  The latest Office for National Statistics migration report shows:  \u0026ndash A fall in the number of EU citizens coming to the UK \u0026ldquolooking for work, which decreased by a third (33%) from 55,000 in 2016 to 37,000 last year  \u0026ndash Emigration of EU nationals went up by a fifth year-on-year, with an estimated outflow of 139,000 in 2017  \u0026ndash Net migration from eight eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004 \u0026ndash Poland, Lithuania, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia, Estonia and Latvia \u0026ndash has fallen from 42,000 in the year prior to the referendum to 6,000 in 2017  \u0026ndash Net migration from 14 longer-term member states such as Germany, Italy, Spain and France, has almost halved since the vote, falling from 84,000 in the 12 months to June 2016 to 46,000 last year  \u0026ndash An estimated 40,000 more Romanians and Bulgarians migrated to the UK than left last year \u0026ndash the joint lowest net migration figure for the two countries since the year to September 2014  \u0026ndash Non-EU net migration was estimated at 227,000 last year \u0026ndash more than twice the figure for the EU  Nicola White, of the ONS\u0026rsquos migration statistics division, said: \u0026ldquoWith around 280,000 more people coming to the UK than leaving in 2017, these latest figures show that migration has continued to add to the UK population.  \u0026ldquoNet migration fell following record levels in 2015 and early 2016 and has been broadly stable.  Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch UK, described the figures as \u0026ldquovery disappointing.

The latest findings sparked fresh calls for Tories to scrap their aim to bring net migration below six figures.  Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: \u0026ldquoLike the \u0026lsquohostile environment\u0026rsquo, it\u0026rsquos clear to almost everyone except Theresa May that the net migration target should go.

She added: \u0026ldquoMore EU nationals continue to arrive than leave and as the ONS have made clear, net migration has been broadly stable since late 2016.  \u0026ldquoBut while it is not unusual to see quarterly ups and downs, we know more needs to be done if we are to bring net migration down to sustainable levels."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7729339.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"day-in-the-life-of-a-radio-presenter-competition-now-open-how-to-apply","story":"  s1jobs is allowing a would-be radio host to work behind the scenes to see first-hand what it\u0026rsquos like to work at Heart Scotland.

At Islay Ales they produce a range of both cask and bottles conditioned beers. The bottled beers are real ale in a bottle. The beer is neither filtered nor pasteurised prior to being bottled and therefore continues to ferment and mature in the bottle. This process produces sediment in the bottom of the bottle.    They have recently started to make use of the fact that many individuals have bottled their own whisky on Islay and are looking for something special to do with the empty cask. They fill these casks with part of a brew and then allow the influences of the whisky and the wood to act on the beer by maturing it for at least six weeks up to almost three months, depending on the requirements of the customer.  This year Islay Ales were delighted to have been asked by WW100 Islay to produce an ale to commemorate the ending of the First World War and to remember those lives lost in the tragic sinking of two troops ships off Islay  Visitors are more than welcome to visit the Brewery, they are happy to show how the beers are brewed in the 4-barrel plant, which produces 1150 pints (640 litres) at a time. Depending on what day you come to the brewery you could see the brewing in action or it might be the casking, bottling or labelling, all of which takes place on site.  Before or after a tour of the brewery you can sample some of the available ales, sometimes Islay Ales might even have some on draught for you to try. You can also purchase bottles of the beers as well as Thistly Cross Cider. If you are looking for presents or something to remember them by, the Brewery shop has a range of clothing, glasses and other items.    The Brewery and shop is open from 10.30 to 5.00 Monday to Saturday during the summer but only to 4.00 in the winter. They generally do not open on Sundays unless a special request has been made.  A large number of establishments on Islay take the ales, either in bottle form or on draught so when you come to visit the island you are sure to be able to find Islay Ales near to where you are staying.  www.islayales  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The Brander Lodge  Nestled within a scenic and tranquil location, The Brander Lodge offers comfortable and stylish facilities for those looking to relax and explore.

The Twin Pioneer had its wings removed in order to be transported to Mains Farm in Thornhill where it will be reassembled by Mr Steedman before a kitchen and bathroom is fitted inside.    He said: \"G-APRS, or Primrose as she is affectionately known by those who flew her, was one of the last flying Twin Pioneers in the world.  \"She faithfully served on civilian and military missions for nearly 50 years, before being retired because of her ageing wing struts. We\u0027re delighted to be bringing her back home to Scotland where we\u0027ll convert her into a first-class glamping experience.  \"We\u0027re sure that like our Sea King she\u0027ll attracts tourists and aviation enthusiasts alike, which is great news for the rural economy and local jobs.\"  Designed and built in Prestwick, Twin Pioneers were said to be Scotland\u0027s most successful and recognisable aircraft of the era used for civilian and military duties.  Their unique high wing design meant they were able to take off and land within small areas.  The aircraft still has 14 passenger seats inside which will be replaced by a bedroom but its cockpit will remain for visitors to check out.  Mr Steedman said: \"We\u0027ll be drawing on our experience of converting the helicopter and preserving as much of the interior as possible for future generations to enjoy, including the stunning two-seater cockpit.  \"Primrose will turn 60 next year, so we\u0027re hoping to get her into tip top shape for her big birthday.  \"We\u0027d love to track down the team who built her and involve them in her transformation.\"  VisitScotland regional director Neil Christison has praised the unique camping site.

In a typewritten letter sent to the Sunday Post, Byrne, best known for the Slab Boys trilogy of plays, branded the Charles Rennie Mackintosh building \u0026ldquothe school that died of shame.  Byrne also insisted that even before last month\u0026rsquos devastating fire, it was \u0026ldquono longer in use as a working art school (neither students nor staff can actually draw).  Tom Inns, director of the Glasgow School of Art, last week moved to end speculation about the future of the gutted building, saying it would be rebuilt, in a painstaking process involving the dismantling of sections by hand, with the bricks logged and stored for possible reuse.  Mr Inns said: \u0026ldquoThe Mackintosh Building will be rebuilt and will be a working art school. We will rebuild so the Mack can continue to provide creative inspiration to students, staff and visitors.  However, the plan has sparked fierce debate, with critics questioning the suggested \u0026pound200 million cost and insisting the new building would only ever be a fake Mackintosh.  Some have called for a contest for young artists and architects to design a new school while supporters insist famous buildings around the world have been rebuilt successfully.  Byrne, however, said: \u0026ldquoI really don\u0026rsquot care if they rebuild it or not \u0026ndash the soul of the art school is completely gone, never to return.  Byrne, who attended the art school in the late \u0026lsquo50s, said the ethos of the school had been lost to the crass commercialism of modern art, embodied, for him, by the New York pop artist Jeff Koons who once sold a sculpture of an orange balloon dog for $58 million.  He wrote: \u0026ldquoIn 1958, when I enrolled at Glasgow School of Art, I was in no doubt whatsoever that I was going to be working in a great work of art itself and for the next five years that\u0026rsquos what I did, growing to love it even more and to recognise that it possessed, through Mackintosh\u0026rsquos genius, a Life and Soul of its own.  He wrote that in his view, the building \u0026ldquowas no longer in use as a working art school (neither students nor staff can actually draw) but switched roles to become, instead, a \u0026lsquomuseum\u0026rsquo, then throws itself onto the funeral pyre on the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of Rennie Mackintosh\u0026rsquos birth.  He added: \u0026ldquoI believe that every genuine work of art has a soul... the GSA had a Great Soul which it gave up when \u0026lsquoArtists\u0026rsquo on the Sunday Times Rich last, together with \u0026lsquoThe Infantilist\u0026rsquo from Madison Avenue, introduced the notion that becoming rich and famous should be the goal for young \u0026lsquohopefuls\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash but, never mind, we will surely met the \u0026lsquoart\u0026rsquo we deserve."},{"url":null,"title":"more-than-43000-sign-petition-to-keep-boys-in-glasgow","story":"  Areeb Umeed Bakhsh, 13, and brother Somer, 15, fear Islamic extremists will kill them if they return to Pakistan.

The UK Government has repeatedly rejected the family\u0026rsquos asylum applications, largely because officials do not believe they would be at risk in Pakistan.  The family have been told they have exhausted the process and have no right to appeal but are prepared to launch a legal challenge.

She said: \u0026ldquoTens of thousands of people want their names to count in the campaign to allow the Bakhsh family to stay in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThis is a family who call this country home and the uncertainty they are living with is cruel.  \u0026ldquoScotland used to be a place renowned for its welcome.

Officials want to use the rugged backdrop for scenes in The Long Night, set 10,000 years before the original fantasy series.  They visited Skye to seek out beauty spots that would be ideal for use as action and scenery.  Earlier this month, it was announced that work on the spin-off will begin in Belfast\u0027s Titanic Quarter Film Studios in October, the same venue used to shoot many of the indoor scenes for Game Of Thrones over its eight series, while outdoor locations around Northern Ireland have also featured.  Fans of the must-see TV drama have already created online maps featuring every location used for Game of thrones, including Doune Castle which was used for the pilot episode. Scenes have been shot around the world, including in Iceland, Malta and Croatia and all countries have benefited from a rise in tourist numbers thanks to the programme\u0027s global following.  A record 2.1million overseas tourists visited Northern Ireland in 2016, upping revenue from this sector by 12 per cent, according to Tourism Ireland figures.  Belfast Airport also had the highest passenger increase of any destination, with 388,486 more customers in 2016 than the previous year.  HBO have green-lit five prequel series and commissioned a pilot episode.  A source said: \"This would be a massive development for Skye. Game Of Thrones had a huge impact on tourist numbers wherever it was filmed. The same will most likely apply to the prequel. Skye is definitely a potential venue for the The Long Night.  \"The show is set 10,000 years before Game Of Thrones so the makers need new ideas and locations. Skye ticks a lot of boxes for them.\"  Filming of the eighth and final series of Game Of Thrones finished earlier this month in Northern Ireland.  Most of the show has been filmed there since 2010.  The scenery of Skye has proved increasingly popular for movie and TV producers in recent years, with films shot there including 2008\u0027s Made of Honour, featuring Kevin McKidd and Patrick Dempsey the Alien sequel Prometheus in 2012, Macbeth with Michael Fassbender in 2015 and Roald Dahl\u0027s The BFG in 2016.  Blockbusters Transformers: The Last Knight and King Arthur: Legend Of The Sword both shot there last year.  The prequel series is being created by Game Of Thrones author George RR Martin.  Jenni Steele, film and creative industries manager at VisitScotland, said: \"Film tourism in general is booming in Scotland in recent years with Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom and Avengers: Infinity War on the big screen and Outlander continuing to prove its popularity on the small screen.  \"VisitScotland work closely with Scotland\u0027s film location offices as productions shot here not only boost the local economy during filming but also provide a shop window for the country\u0027s amazing landscapes and can have long-lasting effects for tourism.\""},{"url":null,"title":"scots-author-quintin-jardine-labels-ian-poulter-an-ahole-after-exchange-during-scottish-open","story":"  Jardine, who is also a member at the host course of Gullane, was marshalling in Saturday\u0027s third round when Poulter hit a wayward drive on the opening hole.

Croatia defender Dejan Lovren pushed a male protester, helping a steward to detain him.  \u0026ldquoI really was mad because we\u0026rsquod been playing at that moment in good shape, he said.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquod been playing good football and then some interruption came.

Putin was watching the game alongside his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron and Fifa president Gianni Infantino.  The protest was briefly shown on international TV broadcasts, even though Fifa policy is usually to cut away from field invasions.  The group said the police uniforms symbolised how Russian police\u0026rsquos actions fall short of their \u0026ldquoheavenly depiction in literature and called for reforms.

The Internet TV channel Dozhd identified one of them as Pyotr Verzilov, one of the group\u0026rsquos most prominent members.  Under barking queries from a man off camera, Verzilov says: \u0026ldquoI am for Russia, just like you \u0026ndash if you are for Russia.  \u0026ldquoI sometimes wish it was 1937, the man off screen says, referring to the year in which Stalinist purges were at their height."},{"url":null,"title":"one-in-seven-adults-give-up-their-time-to-look-after-relatives-says-report","story":"  Almost 15% of adults now give up their time for free to look after relatives, providing an average of 19.5 hours of care per week, independent think-tank Social Market Foundation said.  The study found that the number of family carers in Britain \u0026ndash 7.6 million \u0026ndash had risen by a million over the course of a decade, while the proportion of those providing 20 or more hours of help a week had increased by 4% between 2005 and 2015.  Age UK, which sponsored the research, warned more support was needed for so-called informal carers, and urged the Government to direct more funding to the care system.  Charity director Caroline Abrahams said: \u0026ldquoThe informal carers we meet at Age UK are usually deeply committed but they also often tell us that they are completely exhausted. Not only do they need more opportunities to take a break, they also require the back up of a reliable, effective social care system.  \u0026ldquoWhen informal carers are trying to cope all on their own, this is a recipe for burn out and the collapse of an arrangement which could otherwise work really well for an older person.  \u0026ldquoIt would be dangerously complacent for policymakers to assume there is an infinite supply of wonderful people able and willing to provide informal care for their loved ones. For all kinds of demographic, social and economic reasons our current system of social care is living on borrowed time \u0026ndash it urgently needs transforming and in 2018 we must make a serious start.  The report, which comes as the Government prepares to publish its green paper on social care, said family carers provided 149 million hours of care each week \u0026ndash equal to the work of four million full-time paid care-givers.  More than half (59%) of those caring for an elderly relative are women, while 19% of women in professional jobs provide care \u0026ndash up from 18% in 2005, the study added.  Caring can also have an impact on earnings, the report said, as people are more likely to work less than those without caring responsibilities.  Kathryn Petrie, Social Market Foundation economist, said: \u0026ldquoMore women with professional and managerial jobs are trying to combine work with family care.  \u0026ldquoWe know that carers are often driven to reduce their hours or leave work altogether and, without proper support for these carers, there is a risk that women are increasingly driven out of professional careers, reversing recent progress towards equality in the workforce.  The Department of Health and Social Care said its forthcoming social care green paper would look at long-term sustainable solutions for the social care system."},{"url":null,"title":"laughing-louis-pictured-with-kate-to-mark-christening","story":"  The baby prince is pictured alert and with a wide open-mouth smile as he is held upright in Kate\u0026rsquos arms.

The amendments could be used as a show of strength by the Brexiteers, who are furious at the Chequers plan, but there were signs at Westminster that Mrs May could be prepared to compromise in an effort to avert a damaging blow to her authority.  A senior Government source said \u0026ldquono decision yet had been made on whether to accept the amendments supported by arch-Eurosceptics including Jacob Rees-Mogg, Sir Bernard Jenkin, Priti Patel and Iain Duncan Smith.  A Brexiteer source said that while ministers \u0026ldquohaven\u0026rsquot yet accepted the amendments \u0026ldquoall the noise is in that direction.  Business Secretary Mr Clark was challenged about the potential revolt on the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill, often referred to as the customs bill.  On BBC Radio 4\u0026rsquos Today programme he urged Tory colleagues who \u0026ldquowant to get on with Brexit to acknowledge that the Bill was \u0026ldquoessential and should not be impeded.  Asked if there was a suggestion that ministers would accept the amendments he said: \u0026ldquoNo. The Bill is an important part of preparing for the world after Brexit and I would have thought that all colleagues would respect the fact that we need to get those preparations in place whilst having this important negotiation to make sure that our trading arrangement can continue to support prosperity in the future.  Sir Bernard told the programme that the Chequers plan was \u0026ldquodead, with opposition from both wings of the Tory party.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom afraid it is neither beloved by Remainers or Leavers.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos also quite likely to be either rejected by the EU or more demands will be made upon it so it will be even less acceptable.  Mr Rees-Mogg, the leader of the pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG), played down suggestions over the weekend they were seeking to topple Mrs May, saying she still had time to change course on her proposals.  However, the danger to the Prime Minister was underlined by the disclosure that Brexiteers had set up a WhatsApp group to co-ordinate voting tactics, organised by ex-Brexit minister Steve Baker, who quit over the Chequers plan.  The Daily  reported more than 100 MPs had joined the group, more than double the 48 needed to submit letters of no confidence in the Prime Minister to force a leadership contest.  North Cornwall MP Scott Mann quit as a ministerial aide to the Treasury, the former postman saying he would not \u0026ldquodeliver a watered down Brexit.  The threat from the Brexiteers is not the only danger facing Mrs May, with pro-EU Tories tabling amendments of their own to the customs bill and the Trade Bill, which returns to the Commons on Tuesday, which would keep Britain in a customs union with the EU.  It was unclear whether they will actually press them to a vote after some pro-EU MPs backed Mrs May\u0026rsquos Chequers plan and EU white paper.  However, in a sign of just how volatile the party has become, former education secretary Justine Greening, who backed Remain, denounced the plan, saying it offered the \u0026ldquoworst of both worlds and called for a second referendum.  \u0026ldquoThe only solution is to take the final Brexit decision out of the hands of deadlocked politicians, away from the backroom deals, and give it back to the people, she said in an article for The Times.  Meanwhile Boris Johnson, in his first public intervention since his resignation last week, appealed for people to take a more positive view of Britain\u0026rsquos prospects outside the EU.  In a sign that he was keeping his powder dry, he said in an article for The Daily  that he would resist \u0026ldquofor now the temptation \u0026ldquoto bang on about Brexit.  \u0026ldquoIt is time for all of us, at this critical moment in our constitutional development, to believe in ourselves, to believe in the British people and what they can do, and in our democracy, he wrote.  \u0026ldquoPeople around the world believe passionately in Britain.

While I appreciate that Inverness is the larger and most busy airport, there is a real public perception that, at present, Inverness gets a lot of public money spent on it in terms of development and jobs, to the detriment of other regional airports.The Caithness, Sutherland and Ross MSP added: \u0026ldquoI have consistently made the case that Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport should be considered as a real possibility for the future of the air traffic control service in the Highlands, not least because of the real benefit and impact it would have on the socio-economic climate of the county.\u0026ldquoWe need sustainable, quality jobs and I am worried that this decision will limit many who have seen themselves as having a career in the aviation industry in the Highlands to only being based in Inverness.Mrs Ross added: \u0026ldquoIn May, the rural economy and connectivity committee, of which I am vice-chair, took evidence on this issue and were assured by the then minister, Humza Yousaf, that a full consultation and scoping exercise would take place and that there would be no decisions made until this work was carried out.\u0026ldquoI was very disappointed to learn of the decision to base the new service in Inverness, which seems like a real kick in the teeth to smaller airports that have been working hard to train, support and develop the expertise in their ATC staff.Trudy Morris, chief executive of the Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was also unhappy with the decision.She said: \u0026ldquoWe were extremely disappointed by the Hial board\u0026rsquos decision to select Inverness in principle as the location for a planned centralised air traffic management facility. Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport would have made an excellent base for this facility, and would have offered an opportunity for Hial to reverse the trend of centralisation of public services in Inverness.\u0026ldquoIt is our understanding that Inverness offered significant benefits to Hial with regard to retention of existing and recruitment of new staff, and we can appreciate why this proved to be a significant factor in the decision-making process. Unfortunately the end result will be a loss of skilled jobs from the rural communities which most need them.Ms Morris added: \u0026ldquoAt a time when the future for the north Highlands is looking bright, with significant investments in oil and gas, renewables, tourism and indeed the airport itself, we feel this is a missed opportunity to maximise these. We will be working closely with Hial, public agencies and local businesses over the coming years to understand and address the impact that this decision will have on the north Highlands.Inverness was picked as the preferred location for a new state-of-the art air traffic control centre following a study by consultants.Monday 16 Jul 2018 12:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116574.jpg","title":"High calibre medical staff recruited in Caithness","story":"\u0026nbspNHS Highland yesterday confirmed the full and part-time appointments, which include two advanced nurse practitioners and a physiotherapist.Bill Fernie, chairman of Caithness Health Action Team, said: \u0026ldquoIt is definitely good news that the posts which were empty for a long time are being filled and that is welcomed by us.\u0026ldquoThis is a success for NHS Highland but it has been a long time coming. They still have some way to go with other vacant posts but it is good to see GPs being recruited.\u0026ldquoHaving locums all the time means patients don\u0026rsquot see the same person, but with GPs you have a better chance of continuity.Dr David Carson and Dr Mike Ruse are set to join advanced nurse practitioner (ANP) Colin Armer \u0026ndash a recent recruit \u0026ndash at the Riverbank Medical Practice in Thurso.Dr Herjit Sutherland is to join the Riverview Medical Practice in Wick along with new ANP appointment Vicki Kelly.Mike Flavell, who is giving up his post as NHS Highland\u0026rsquos Caithness district manager, is an advanced physiotherapist and is to begin weekly clinics shortly in the Riverbank and Riverview practices as well as in the Lybster medical practice. He will leave his present post in September, although he will be replaced.Mr Flavell thinks his clinics will provide a number of benefits for patients and practices alike.He said: \u0026ldquoTwenty-five per cent of appointments at GP practices are for muscular skeletal problems. So, in theory, my physiotherapy clinics could help to take 25 per cent off the GP\u0026rsquos workload.\u0026ldquoAnd for people aged over 75, that figure goes up to 38 per cent, so I may be able to provide even more support.Kath Jones, NHS Highland\u0026rsquos associate medical director north and west, said: \u0026ldquoThree Caithness GP practices run by NHS Highland have recently attracted six new clinicians to permanent posts including three GPs, two ANPs and a physio practitioner.\u0026ldquoThe appointment of so many high-calibre clinicians within such a short time is a credit to the quality of the teams working in these practices. The recruitment of three GPs is particularly remarkable considering a quarter of GP practices across Scotland have vacancies.\u0026ldquoThe recruitment of all the clinicians will improve the continuity of care provided by the practices while introducing access to a specialist primary care physio at the three sites.\u0026ldquoReducing the reliance on temporary locums will enable NHS Highland to save money while improving care. With two of the clinicians moving into the district to take up post, this will be good for the local economy too.Mr Armer has already taken up his post at the practice on Janet Street, Thurso. Dr Carson is due to start in August and Dr Ruse in October.Vicki Kelly is to start her post at the Martha Terrace practice in Wick next week with Herjit Sutherland due to begin work at the end of August.Monday 16 Jul 2018 12:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116297.jpg","title":"Sir Anthony Cleaver very pleased to see progress made by Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhile he says he is sad to be leaving his role as chairman of the partnership, he feels the time is right for a change. He will be succeeded by Ian Ross, the former East Sutherland and Edderton Highland councillor.Sir Anthony\u0026rsquos decision to step down ends a long association with the area which started in 1993 when he was appointed as chairman of the then UK Atomic Energy Authority. He later chaired AEA Technology and in 2004 took on the role of leading the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) which was responsible for decommissioning Dounreay.In 2008, the then local MP John Thurso asked Sir Anthony to chair Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership. He took on the role and says it has been \u0026ldquoan honour and a privilege to do it.\u0026ldquoI have enjoyed all my time here in my various jobs, he said. \u0026ldquoI do think the partnership has made a major contribution.\u0026ldquoTen years ago the mood was pretty depressed. People were very gloomy. I would say the mood now has changed and is pretty optimistic, although there are challenges. That will always be the case.\u0026ldquoThe big advantage we have here is that it will be a number of years before Dounreay is closed so we had an opportunity to plan for the future. If it had been a car plant it would have been closed in three months.Sir Anthony highlights positive developments such as the improvements at Scrabster and Wick harbours as well as the pioneering MeyGen tidal energy project and the Beatrice offshore wind farm.The North Coast 500 is also making an impact and bringing economic opportunities to the area. The Nucleus archive across from Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport is another plus for Caithness, he adds. Sir Anthony played a part in bringing the facility to the county during his time as chairman of the NDA.Engineering and environmental courses at North Highland College UHI can also help regenerate the Caithness economy. \u0026ldquoThere are real opportunities here, he declared.Improving infrastructure and transport links in the far north are key to helping the area\u0026rsquos economy. Good schools and hospitals are another factor.\u0026ldquoI think the partnership has made a real contribution in the last 10 years, Sir Anthony said. \u0026ldquoWe have worked with other agencies to help create around 1000 jobs over that time but we all had to work together to do it. I am very pleased to see progress being made.Sir Anthony feels it is important to make Caithness as \u0026ldquoattractive as possible for people to come and work in the area.\u0026ldquoThere are still issues to be addressed but, overall, I think significant progress has been made. We played a part but it has always been a contributory role. The partnership is an enabler. The Scottish government has said this area could be an example for other places to follow.Sir Anthony says there is an expertise at Dounreay which \u0026ldquoa lot of places would give their eye teeth to have and it could be used to help the local economy.Caithness strengths are its people, their skills and the natural beauty of the place, but access to the area needs to be improved.Asked about any disappointments during his time as chairman of the partnership, he replied: \u0026ldquoI hoped MeyGen would have got the Contract for Difference \u0026ndash it covers an agreement on the price for the electricity generated \u0026ndash from the UK government, but they did not. That was disappointing. They will now have to find another way forward but are looking at opportunities.Sir Anthony decided to retire as he felt 10 years as chairman was long enough. \u0026ldquoI wanted to leave before people wanted me to, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was time for a change.\u0026ldquoI am delighted with the choice of Ian Ross as my successor. I have had discussions with him and would be willing to help him in any way I can.Sir Anthony, who is 80, will keep a watchful eye on what is happening in Caithness and plans to stay active with his many other interests and hobbies. He enjoys opera, and swims five times a week.He started his career as a systems engineer with IBM in 1962 and went on to become its chief executive and chairman.Sir Anthony and his wife Jennie live in London and have a son, Paul, and a daughter, Caroline.Monday 16 Jul 2018 12:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116401.jpg","title":"Sunny conditions set to continue all week in Caithness","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCAITHNESS and other parts of the north are set to enjoy more dry and settled conditions under gin-blue skies coupled with virtually unbroken sunshine for the remainder of the week and beyond.On Sunday afternoon the air temperature in Wick peaked at 21.6C (70.9F).\u0026nbspLast Thursday morning the town witnessed a high of 22.5C (72.5F), making it the warmest day in the burgh for any day in June since 2011.The highest temperature recorded in Wick since 1910 is currently 26.7C (80.1F), witnessed on June 6, 1939.

I found countless deserted and remote beaches piled high with it \u0026ndash plastic bottles, cotton-bud sticks, fishing gear, plastic bags, she said.\u0026ldquoThe worst-affected beaches in Scotland were on the west coast. On the east coast there was noticeably less on the beaches, but I was still paddling past beaches with nesting birds that had multicoloured plastic littering them.\u0026ldquoPaddling up the north-east coast, and particularly around Duncansby Head, I picked up several large plastic bags.\u0026ldquoThe inland canals were the worst affected.

Storm Hector was approaching, so I had just one window to get around the Mull.\u0026ldquoI set off at 11.30pm, just as it had got dark, and paddled 14 miles across Luce Bay.\u0026ldquoThe darkness made it very hard to navigate so I used GPS and, once I could see lights on the opposite landmass and the lighthouse at the Mull, I focused on that.\u0026ldquoWith the Isle of Arran, I set off with a five-hour window to get to Arran before a storm was due to come in.\u0026ldquoThe winds were strong the entire time, mostly behind me but enough of a crosswind to make the paddling incredibly challenging and painful.

Last November, Loganair flew Teddy over 200 miles back to Kirkwall for a tearful homecoming with his young owner.Officially launched to mark Teddy Bear Picnic Day, this Tuesday, July 10, the furry keepsakes come with their very own Loganbear luggage tags as well as outfits mirroring the tartan look and feel of the airline’s own uniforms. Throughout the summer months, children will be able to pick between a Logie or Lotti bear once they come onboard a Loganair aircraft, distributed by the airline’s flight crew.The airline is running a number of social media competitions and promotional activity featuring the bears throughout July and August and will also be launching its Instagram channel to showcase the two toys.Kay Ryan, Commercial Director at Loganair said: “We’re very much looking forward to giving some of our youngest passengers a special memory of their trip with Loganair and what better day to unveil the two newest members of our crew than Teddy Bear Picnic day.“Logie and Lotti will be flying with us all summer and our crew can’t wait to introduce them onboard.“Last year the airline did everything it could to reunite a young girl with her lost teddy so this summer we thought we’d try and share some of that joy with children travelling with us.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This could run into millions of pounds and put at risk the future viability of the business.The company have also met with local Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur, to express their concerns about the delay.As the start of this month, as Mr Matheson stepped into the shoes of the previous minister for transport Humza Yousaf, it was announced that lack of agreement between the Scottish Government and Pentland Ferries had led to no discounted fares being introduced in Pentland Firth ferry routes, by the Government\u0026#8217s self-set deadline of the end of last month.Andrew Banks, Managing Director and Owner of Pentland Ferries said: “We want these passenger subsidies implemented as soon as possible but we need to be 100 per cent sure that the scheme complies with state aid rules.  We have never had any subsidy from the government and even though this scheme gives money to the passenger, not the operator, the minister has told us that we would be liable for any repayment if at a future date the scheme is deemed illegal. This could run into the millions and could finish us off.“We cannot take that risk and we have a responsibility to our staff, our community and family to make sure the scheme works for everyone. We want to work with the Minister and his team to discuss a way forward so that we can all benefit from reduced fares. This scheme will be fantastic for our business, attracting more visitors to the islands and making it cheaper to travel to the mainland for residents. So we want this unlocked as soon as possible. We welcome the Minister’s willingness to gain a full understanding of the detail and very much hope to be able to meet him in Orkney soon.”The minister, Mr Matheson, was asked for a response to the comments from Pentland Ferries and Mr Banks. At the time he replied, Transport Scotland said the invitation had not yet been received so the minister could not comment.However, Mr Matheson did say: “The Scottish Government remains committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles. I am conscious that there is a great deal of interest in this issue amongst users of the services. As I begin my new role as Transport Secretary, I want to ensure that I gain a full understanding of the detail — it is already very clear to me that planning to introduce reduced fares on the Northern Isles network has been a complex and challenging piece of work.“As a first step, we will cut fares on the Aberdeen-Lerwick and Kirkwall-Lerwick services from June 30. These reductions will be around 20 per cent for both passengers and cars.“On routes to Orkney, it has been necessary to engage with commercial operators on the Pentland Firth. We set out a very fair and reasonable proposal that would maintain competition, enabling them to protect their existing market share. Unfortunately, not all the commercial operators have felt able to agree to our proposals. This means we cannot currently implement reduced fares on any of the routes to and from Orkney without the risk of legal challenge.“This is both disappointing and frustrating, but I am determined to work through the issue to see what more can be done. I have asked Transport Scotland to undertake some further work to see what measures, if any, we can take. As part of that, we are willing to reopen talks with commercial operators.  I will provide a further update to stakeholders and to Parliament as soon as I can, with a view to bringing the full benefits of the scheme to the people of Orkney and Shetland.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It\u0026rsquos not an easy decision.\"We\u0026rsquove listened to customers, colleagues, communities and elected representatives and we continue to do so.\"We\u0026rsquove committed to making no further changes to the size of our branch network in Scotland until at least 2020 \u0026ndash and not to remove or replace, at a suitable nearby location, the branch ATM if there\u0026rsquos no other free-to-use ATM within 1km of the closing branch.\"The way our customers are banking is changing and it is important that we respond to that change. Across Scotland, usage of our branches is down 42 per cent since 2014. Only one per cent of our customers in Scotland visit their branch on a regular weekly basis. Seven in 10 customers are using mobile or online banking.\"\"We recognise that every customer will have different banking needs and we are committed to ensuring all our customers receive the best possible service.\"We\u0026rsquove invested to provide more ways to bank with us now than ever before.\"He added: \"We\u0026rsquove committed to keeping 10 branches open until the end of 2018.\"Johnston Carmichael has been appointed to carry out an independent review into these 10 branches and are meeting with local customers, representatives, employees and stakeholders in all ten communities to understand the impact of each individual closure.\"We have committed to accepting the recommendations of this review in full.\"Monday 16 Jul 2018 12:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

In more recent times, it has seen the fairytale rise of Ross County from Highland League to Premiership \u0026ndash and a notorious Town Hall appearance by the Beatles when the Fab Four were on the brink of global success.Now, history hunters are being targeted by DCDC which has sought to work with the public to create a new vision of the town.Fascinating facts are being assembled by Dingwall History Society for panels dotting the town and shining light on its rich past.Secretary\u0026nbspSandra MacDonald said: \"Dingwall has a very long and significant history and we have the information available.\"The group will gather facts and suggest significant sites worthy of interpretation but will not have the final say.Mrs MacDonald, whose late husband David \"DD\" MacDonald chaired the society for a decade, said: \"There are the obvious sites like the Tollbooth \u0026ndash the tower and the clock.\"Other sites being considered include the war memorials at Station Square and the Hector Macdonald Monument and Moot Hill in the Cromartie Memorial car park, where the Vikings are believed to have held gatherings.Mrs MacDonald added: \"A board can carry a minimum amount of information but can indicate where people can access far more online.\"DCDC secretary Robin Lingard revealed the heritage trail is one of several items being proposed by the group, set up as a charity two years ago to tap funding pots for improvements. He told a recent open meeting that membership had more than doubled. \"We are very pleased,\" he said. \"I think out of it new ideas will come forward.\"Community activist George Murray, project manager for Dingwall Means Business, targeting the establishment of a business improvement district (BID), said: \"I think the DCDC is the perfect body to spearhead and develop plans like the heritage trail. I see it as being beneficial not only for local community development and participation but also as a way of presenting our community heritage to the world, especially as we get busier with the advent of the cruise tour coaches beginning to discover the town and the success of the NC500 route.\"If suitable funding can be put in place a heritage trail round the area could be a real boon to the town.\"Dingwall councillor Angela MacLean said a trail is \"a fantastic opportunity\" to showcase the town.She said: \"Many of the DCDC group\u0026rsquos wish list buildings are in the ownership of the Highland Council and if DCDC or another local group would like to take over and run of any of these buildings I am more than happy to lend my support.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4768723.1531508582!/image/image.jpg","title":"benjamin sachs eight ethical questions about exploring outer space","story":"        Metallic shrapnel flying faster than bullets the Space Shuttle smashed to pieces astronauts killed or ejected into space.                The culprit? Space debris – remnants of a Russian satellite blown up by a Russian missile. The one survivor, Ryan Stone, has to find her way back to Earth with oxygen supplies failing and the nearest viable spacecraft hundreds of miles away. Over on Mars, 20 years in the future, an exploration mission from Earth is going wrong. An epic dust storm forces the crew to abandon the planet, leaving behind an astronaut, Mark Watney, who is presumed dead. He has to figure out how to grow food while awaiting rescue.            Hollywood knows how to terrify and inspire us about outer space. Movies like Gravity (2013) and The Martian (2015), present space as hostile and unpredictable – spelling danger for any intrepid human who dares to venture outside Earth’s hospitable confines.            This is only part of the story, however – the bit with people centre stage. Sure, no one wants to see astronauts killed or stranded in space. And we all want to enjoy the fruits of successful planetary science, like determining which planets could host human life or simply whether we’re alone in the universe.But should we care about the universe beyond how it affects us as humans? That is the big question – call it question #1 of extraterrestrial environmental ethics, a field too many people have ignored for too long. I’m one of a group of researchers at the University of St Andrews trying to change that. How we ought to value the universe depends on two other intriguing philosophical questions.READ MORE: Life on Mars a real possibility as Nasa finds ‘organic matter’Question #2: the kind of life we are most likely to discover elsewhere is microbial – so how should we view this lifeform? Most people would accept that all humans have intrinsic value, and matter not only in relation to their usefulness to someone else. Accept this and it follows that ethics places limits on how we may treat them and their living spaces.People are starting to accept that the same is true of mammals, birds and other animals. So what about microbial beings? Some philosophers like Albert Schweitzer and Paul Taylor have previously argued that all living things have a value in themselves, which would obviously include microbes. Philosophy as a whole has not reached a consensus, however, on whether it agrees with this so-called biocentrism.            Question #3: for planets and other places not hospitable to life, what value should we place on their environment? Arguably we care about our environment on Earth primarily because it supports the species that live here. If so, we might extend the same thinking to other planets and moons that can support life.But this doesn’t work for “dead” planets. Some have proposed an idea called aesthetic value, that certain things should be treasured not because they are useful but because they are aesthetically wonderful. They have applied this not only to great artistic works like Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa and Beethoven’s Fifth, but also to parts of the Earth’s environment, such as the Grand Canyon. Could that apply to other planets?Supposing we could answer these theoretical questions, we could proceed to four important practical questions about space exploration.Question #4: is there a duty to protect the environment on other planets? When it comes to sending astronauts, instruments or robots to other worlds, there are clearly important scientific reasons for making sure they don’t take terrestrial organisms with them and wind up depositing them there.            Otherwise, if we discovered life, we wouldn’t know whether it was indigenous – not to mention the risk of wiping it out entirely. But is scientific clarity all that matters, or do we need to start thinking about galactic environmental protection?READ MORE: Touch the sky: 40 years of space travelQuestion #5: what, besides biological contamination, would count as violating such an obligation to treat that planet’s environment with respect? Drilling for core samples, perhaps, or leaving instruments behind, or putting tyre tracks in the dirt?Question #6: what about asteroids? The race is well underway to develop technology to harvest the untold trillions of pounds of mineral wealth presumed to exist on asteroids, as already reported in The Conversation. It helps that no one seems to think of asteroids as environments we need to protect. The same goes for empty space. The movie Gravity gave us some human-centred reasons to be worried about the buildup of debris in space, but might there be other reasons to object? If so, would our obligation be to merely create less debris, or something stronger – like not producing any new debris or even cleaning up what we’ve left already?Question #7: what considerations might offset arguments in favour of behaving ethically in space? Of the various reasons for going there – intellectual/scientific, utilitarian, profit-driven – are any strong enough to override our obligations?            We also need to factor in the inevitable risks and uncertainties here. We can’t know what benefits space missions will have. We can’t be certain of not biologically contaminating the planets we visit. What risk/reward trade-offs should we be willing to undertake?Discussions about outer space have the advantage that we have very little attachment to anything out there. These ethical questions might therefore be some of the only ones humans can address with a large measure of emotional distance. For this reason, answering them might help us to make progress with Earth-bound issues like global warming, mass extinction and nuclear waste disposal.Space exploration also directly raises questions about our relationship to Earth – once we overcome the technological puzzles preventing the terraforming of a planet like Mars, or find ways of reaching habitable exoplanets. I’ll leave you with one extremely important one for the future:Question #8: given that the Earth is not the only potential home for human beings, what reasons for protecting its environment would remain once we can realistically go somewhere else?Benjamin Sachs is a senior lecturer in philosophy at St Andrews University.

In an article published by his Institute for Global Change think tank, he said he understood the arguments of business leaders who supported the plan in order to end the “agony” of Brexit, but said their position was “fatally flawed”.            “I fully accept the Prime Minister is putting forward the government white paper as a well-intentioned attempt to do Brexit whilst minimising the economic disruption to Britain,” he said.“But this solution – half in/half out – won’t work, won’t end the argument and will simply mean a confused outcome in which we continue to abide by Europe’s rules whilst losing our say over them. Parliament should reject this solution decisively.”He went on: “A genuine ‘soft’ Brexit would obviously be less damaging than a hard Brexit, though it would highlight the ‘what’s the point’ nature of this choice. But this Brexit is just mush.“It is not making the best of a bad job. It is the worst of both worlds. This is where true Remainers and true Leavers make common cause.“The practical upshot of this proposal is to tie us to Europe over large parts of economic life, without a say in its rules. This is intrinsically a dismal outcome which reduces British influence for no or negligible gain.”            Mr Blair said that in “any rational world” the solution would be to go back to the people for a resolution.“It would not be a re-run of the 2016 referendum. Two major things have changed since then,” he said.“Our quantum of knowledge about the issue and particularly about the consequences of leaving the single market and customs union is vastly enlarged. “And there is fundamental disagreement about what Brexit means between supporters of Brexit.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4769204.1531733432!/image/image.jpg","title":"none of this really amounts to taking back control from eu","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        Theresa May\u0026#8217s leadership has been plunged into fresh turmoil over Brexit after warring Tory MPs condemned her \u0026#8220common rulebook\u0026#8221 plan to broker the UK\u0026#8217s departure from the EU.                The Prime Minister suffered another resignation last night and was branded a “Remainer who has remained a Remainer” over the Chequers proposal, which sceptics fear will mean the UK remains a “rule taker” from Brussels.            The stand-off with some of her MPs is set to intensify this week as she faces a series of tests in the House of Commons. A potentially damaging resignation speech from former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is feared, along with critical votes on key Brexit legislation.            Escalating Tory tensions prompted trade minister Lord Duncan, a key ally of the Prime Minister, to warn hardline Brexiteer MPs against a potential leadership challenge.Mrs May yesterday insisted that her controversial plan for trade in goods after Brexit is a “good deal” for the UK and urged MPs to get behind it.She has been under pressure since publication of the plan last week prompted the shock resignations of David Davis as Brexit Secretary and Mr Johnson as Foreign Secretary. Last night, Robert Courts quit as Parliamentary Private Secretary in the Foreign Office, citing his discontent with the Chequers plan.“I had to think who I wanted to see in the mirror for the rest of my life,” he said in a resignation statement.Mrs May admitted yesterday she had to make changes to the UK’s initial Brexit blueprint to meet trade concerns of the EU.            She told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “We needed to come forward with another option in order to ensure that we can get those negotiations on trade – the clock is ticking.“But this is a deal that has benefits. Our companies will abide by these rules anyway. Giving them frictionless borders means that the jobs that depend on that frictionless trade will be protected.“It means we deliver on the Northern Ireland border. It means we have got benefits out of this deal. This is a good deal for the UK.” The revised approach, she added, came after the EU offered two options for a deal – neither of which was acceptable to the UK.She acknowledged that there were strong feelings about the terms of Britain’s withdrawal. “Many people voted from the heart to leave the European Union. My job as Prime Minister is to deliver for them,” she said.            “But also I have got to be hard-headed and practical about this and do it in a way that ensures we get the best interests for the UK.”Mrs May denied that Mr Davis had been “cut out” of the plan and therefore had no choice but to resign.But he hit out at the proposed common rulebook with the EU at the weekend. He said: “None of this really amounts to taking back control. “What is more, it is likely that the EU, having achieved a break in the UK’s position, will simply pocket the concessions and ask for more. For that reason alone this is a very bad decision.”Mr Davis insisted the climbdown on regulation is far from an “arcane technicality”. He said: “It would mean that the UK is simply not running its own economy.            “How laws are made is also a central indicator of whether we have a functioning democracy. If Parliament determines laws, we have one. Otherwise, we do not.”Another leading Brexiteer, Jacob Rees-Mogg, also went on the offensive, branding the common rulebook plan as a “retreat” which effectively means obeying EU laws. “The government unfortunately believes that Brexit is not a good thing in itself,” he said.“The Prime Minister said people voted with their hearts and she’s doing something with her head – in my view and in the view of most Brexiteers, head and heart come together.“Brexit is enormously positive, a huge opportunity for the country, and I’m afraid the Prime Minister doesn’t see that. It is why I think she is a Remainer who has remained a Remainer.”Mrs May has said her plan would end both the free movement of people and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in the UK. But Mr Rees-Mogg said the ECJ would have a role that is “effectively the same as it has now”. Tory MPs are believed to be close to hitting the 48 “no confidence” letters they need to trigger a leadership contest. Although it seems unlikely that such a vote would see half of Tory MPs vote her out as party leader, the Prime Minister declined to say whether she would stay and contest such a battle if it was instigated.However, Lord Duncan called for party unity, saying: “Anyone who thinks they might write a letter needs to stop and think about what the effects eventually would be. “Actually I think she would win any vote of confidence hands down if it were to come to that. “But the very fact people think they might do this is utterly destructive, utterly unnecessary and they should back her to the hilt.”MPs will today vote on amendments to the Customs Bill tabled by members of the European Research Group, which Mr Rees-Mogg leads, intended to scupper her plans for a “UK-EU free trade area” based on a common rulebook.With no Labour backing, the changes stand little chance of getting through, although the votes could provide Conservative Brexiteers with the opportunity to stage a show of strength in Parliament.Mrs May could face a further challenge tomorrow, this time from pro-EU Tories seeking to amend the Trade Bill to keep the UK in a customs union with the EU,  although it is unclear whether they will now put it to a vote.Former Brexit minister Steve Baker, who quit with Mr Johnson and Mr Davis, said the Chequers plan was drawn up in the Cabinet Office while the Department for Exiting the EU had been reduced to a sham “Potemkin structure”."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4768262.1531468928!/image/image.jpg","title":"progress at north sea s catcher field gives boost to premier","story":"        Premier Oil has hailed progress at a major North Sea field.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 19 ","story":"Shetland’s young sports competitors retained their hold on the Stuart Cup at the weekend, with the margin of victory, in the end, being fairly comfortable.\nGoing into the last event of the junior inter-county, the netball, Orkney had to win by 32 points to overhaul the visitors’ lead. Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward.

But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone.

Any avoidable delay in receiving essential treatment is unacceptable.\n\u0026#8220Many of these passengers have been waiting for their appointments for months if not years, and have no way to access the treatment and specialists they need at home.\n\u0026#8220Travelling out with the isles for medical treatment is already stressful for vulnerable isles residents without the added anxiety caused by cancellations. Rescheduling appointments is not easy for those living in remote communities and patients may have a lengthy wait for another opportunity to travel.\n\u0026#8220The right to strike is an important one and I understand that strikes have to cause disruption in order to be effective.\n\u0026#8220But, I urge your members to carefully consider this compromise: Loganair flights from the North Isles use smaller aircraft which require a lower level of fire service cover.\n\u0026#8220Therefore, Unite members could guarantee a minimum level of fire and security coverage on the proposed strike dates, allowing life-line Orkney and Shetland flights to continue for essential medical travel.\n\u0026#8220I hope further discussions will resolve the dispute before any strike action goes ahead and that the needs of North Isles passengers are at the forefront of your decision making.\u0026#8221\nMeanwhile, Loganair is giving passengers in Shetland the chance to change their flights.\nAbout 170 members, including key airport staff, security workers and firefighters have voted in favour of striking – with more talks expected next week involving conciliation service Acas.\nTwenty-four-hour strikes are planned for Friday 20th July as well as on Thursday 2nd August and Thursday16th August.\nLoganair managing director Jonathan Hinkles said passengers could change their flights free of charge.\nHe said: “Although there is still time for the strike to be averted and we hope it will be, we are offering customers booked to fly to or from Aberdeen on the strike dates the opportunity to change their travel date or route if they wish.\n\u0026#8220This is free of charge and designed to offer certainty of alternatives for those booked to travel.\n\u0026#8220We also have contingency plans to operate Aberdeen flights to alternate airports on strike days if this does go ahead, and will announce details of those if this action cannot be averted. Our website is up to date with the latest information.”\nUnite regional officer Wullie Wallace expected talks with Acas next week. The dispute is over pay for airport workers. A total of 88 per cent of workers rejected the latest pay offer.\nThe union said members had rejected two below-inflation wage offers on the back of below inflation increases over the last two years.\nMr Wallace said: \u0026#8220Aberdeen International Airport’s latest derisory pay offer has been emphatically rejected by Unite members. The workforce for several years now has received below inflation increases and the company’s idea of rewarding its hard working employees is by offering more real terms pay cuts.\n\u0026#8220Aberdeen Airport has been investing heavily into improving the airport facilities and amenities. It’s high time for the company to invest in its employees. Unite remains open to further discussions with a view to resolving the dispute.\u0026#8221\nAn unattributed quote from an Aberdeen spokesman stated: \u0026#8220We have been informed by Unite of their intention to take industrial action on Friday 20th July.\n\u0026#8220This follows the rejection of our proposed pay offer. We believe we have made an offer that is entirely fair and reasonable and we are committed to continuing discussions to reach a resolution acceptable to all parties.\n\u0026#8220We have made contact with Acas which has agreed to mediate between both parties. We are seeking a suitable date to continue our discussions in an attempt to reach a mutually agreeable position.\n\u0026#8220We will, as a matter of course, ensure contingency plans are in place in the event of any planned industrial action.”\nI am amazed that the Scottish Government will allow a union to hold hostage urgent healthcare for 45,000 citizens in Shetland and Orkney.

conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government will be free to make its own arrangements regarding the design and collection of any replacement tax\u0026rsquo, yet, as we have seen time and time again with this Government, the arrangements on offer, limits the ability of the Scottish Government to make changes to benefit the Scottish economy.\u0026nbsp\nIn his response to the Highland MP, Mr Jenrick confirmed that his department was willing to work closer with the Scottish Government to find a solution to the problem, recognising the commitment outlined in the Smith Commission.\nResponding after the debate, Mr Hendry said: \u0026ldquoI am glad that the UK Government recognises it has failed to hand over APD in a workable way, and that Airport Departure Tax cannot be implemented by the Scottish Government without a solution to this problem.\n\u0026ldquoI hope that the assurances from Mr Jenrick today, are followed up by meaningful action from the UK Government, to enable the Scottish Government to introduce its reduced Airport Departure Tax, while protecting the Highlands and Islands exemption.\"\nMonday 16 Jul 2018 12:38 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-visitorthebest-360px_Page_4.jpg","title":"former sabhal mor ostaig chairman","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nFormer Sabhal Mòr Ostaig chair Duncan MacQuarrie was celebrated this week with the first road in the new Kilbeg Village development, Rathad MhicGuaire (MacQuarrie Road) named in his honour during an official ceremony held on Monday.\nThe ceremony was carried out by Kate Forbes MSP and recognised the key role which Mr MacQuarrie has played in the college\u0026#8217s development over many years. Sabhal Mòr Ostaig principal Prof Boyd Robertson said, \u0026#8220This is a richly-deserved honour for Duncan which recognises the hugely important contribution he has made to the development of the college over many years and the vital contribution he has made to the development of the Gaelic language and culture and to the advancement of Gaelic and Gaelic-medium education, both as a teacher and as a former HM Inspector.”\n“Duncan\u0026#8217s critical input to Sabhal Mòr Ostaig’s development in its challenging formative years was marked by his steady stewardship, as a former chairman and his pioneering work, alongside that of his fellow trustees, demonstrated an exemplary vision and commitment without which what is now the National Centre for the Gaelic Language and Culture would not have existed.”\n“For that, all who have benefited from this wonderful and inspiring place, over the intervening years, owe him a great debt of gratitude and it is for that reason we celebrate with him here today.

The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve. However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales-large.jpg","title":"top four prepare to lock horns in ross cup","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe top four teams in the Skye and Lochalsh League will meet this weekend with two places in the Ross Cup Final up for grabs.\nLast season\u0026#8217s league champions Kyleakin will travel to Broadford to play Sleat and Strath, while Mallaig host Portree Juniors in the early kick-off.\n\n In what is their debut season in the Skye and Lochalsh Football Association, Mallaig have made a marked impression in the league \u0026#8211  where they currently sit fourth \u0026#8211 and in the associated cup competitions \u0026#8211 in which they are seeking to reach their second final today.\nWith six wins from their eight league fixtures so far, the Lochaber side are keeping pace with the top teams in the league. Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies.

That is a fact,\" she explained. \nThe Sinn Féin Leader told Mr Juncker that the backstop agreed in December, which would see the north remain in the customs union and elements of the single market, must be maintained. \n\"Last December, the people of Ireland were told we had a \u0027cast-iron guarantee\u0027 that that in the event of a no-deal scenario there would be no hard border on the island of Ireland.\n\"The backstop was to be Ireland’s insurance policy to prevent the imposition of WTO trading rules if negotiations ended without a comprehensive agreement. We were told that this draft agreement would be converted into a legally binding agreement by March. This never happened.\n\"Mr Junker, it is absolutely essential that Ireland is provided with this legal guarantee.\n\"The message must go loud and clear to London that the Backstop agreed in December is the bottom-line. And that Backstop must remain in place as long there is an absence of a trade agreement,\" she said. \n\nDeputy McDonald also described the upcoming EU Council meeting is \"crunch time\" for the Brexit negotiations. \n\"If the architects of Brexit still can’t agree what Brexit looks like, that’s their problem. It will not become Ireland’s problem.\n\"The upcoming Summit cannot become another exercise in kicking the can down the road. It is crunch-time.\n\"In absence of the British government demonstrating how they will avoid a hard border, uphold the Good Friday Agreement and protect citizens’ rights, it would be extremely reckless to allow talks to progress to the next phase. Do not make that mistake,\" she said. \nEarlier, Tanáiste Simon Coveney said there could be no agreement unless the issue of the border is resolved. \n\"Let\u0027s be very clear, there will be no withdrawal agreement, no transition agreement and no managed Brexit if the British government do not follow through on their commitments in writing to Ireland and the whole EU.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27405  ","story":" Declan Kearney\nSinn Féin National Chairperson\nSinn Féin is absolutely committed to bringing about a rights-based and integrated shared society in Ireland.We believe anti-sectarianism should be at the heart of our political and civic institutions. - Declan Kearney\nSectarianismis synonymous with the political and economic history of the north of Ireland.\nIn thedecades following partition it was institutionalised within the structures of governmentand society.\nSectarianismdefined the North: it dictated employment, education, housing and votingrights.\nIn thesouthern Irish state post partition, catholic doctrine directly influenced thenature of the state and social policy, and alienated sections of the protestantpopulation.\nThelegacy of sectarianism has been a blight on society, north and south.\nTodayit remains endemic in northern society.\nIt isat the crux of all political, social and communal divisions.\nIt isomnipresent, yet many try to pretend it does not exist.\nIt isour ‘elephant in the room’.\nWe tryto avoid it because it’s too challenging: too close to home.\nIt’sthe rat in our collective, societal consciousness.\nSectarianismisn’t some abstract concept.\nItsattitudinal it’s a state of mind it directly and indirectly influencesbehaviour patterns as well as policy practices.\nIt isalso an instinctive reflex: a default position which categorises fellowcitizens as belonging to ‘them’uns’ or us’uns.\n\nAll ofthese factors provoke and perpetuate a sense of difference.\nTheynormalise communal segregation and division.\nSectarianismco-exists within a framework of differential assumptions about society whichalso legitimises racism, homophobia and intolerance.\nIt is fuelledby a psyche which breeds and rationalises a sense of exclusivity andsuperiority among some over others – even in circumstances of shared poverty orinequalities.\nTheresult is a mutually reinforced sectarian segregation.

That problem here emanates from so-called dissident elements who are behaving in a manner that no person could describe at any stage to be a republican behaviour,\" she said. \nShe also called on those orchestrating the violence to listen to the voice of the local community and stop immediately. \n\"The important thing is that they listen to the people of Derry because these street, this place is their home, this is where they have grown up, generation after generation, raised their kids, made good lives in what is a fantastic city often in very difficult circumstances and I tell you this, particularly the older residents, have said \u0027we are not having this, nobody every broke us and the dissidents and their sick approach will not break us either\u0027 so I hope they hear that, not from me, but from the people of the Bog.\" \n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a2605f.jpg","title":"65077  ","story":"    \nA NEW �10,000 indoor cricket facility has been officially opened at Parkhall Integrated College.\nThe impressive equipment boasts the latest technology in the form of 2G Flicx Pitch floor mats, which have been proven to give the most realistic \u0027bounce and turn\u0027 in an attempt to recreate the most accurate playing conditions in a practice situation.\nAmong those who attended the event were members of Muckamore Cricket Club who hope to take advantage of the facility in the winter months.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a2604f.jpg","title":"65078  ","story":"    \nA FOURTH World Superbike Championship is looking ever more likely for local motorbike racer Jonathan Rea after back to back wins in the USA at the weekend.\nRea recorded his first double victory at Laguna Seca in California, extending his championship lead to 75 points with five rounds to go.\nVictory in Sunday\u0027s race was his 62nd career triumph in the series and his eighth win of the season.\nRea, who currently lives on the Isle of Man, dedicated his wins to road racers Dan Kneen and Adam Lyon who were killed in accidents at this year\u0027s Isle of Man TT.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a2602f.jpg","title":"65080  ","story":"    \nDISGRACED Antrim councillor Brian Duffin is clinging on grimly to his seat on Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council in the wake of being convicted of sexually assaulting a teenage girl - and despite being asked to step down by his former colleagues in the SDLP.\nThe 73-year-old, who was found guilty of the offence after a contest at Antrim Magistrate\u0027s Court, resigned from the SDLP in February but remains on the Council as an Independent member.\nA Party spokesperson said that the SDLP \u0027unreservedly condemn\u0027 Mr Duffin\u0027s actions and called for him to \u0027resign his seat immediately\u0027.\nMr Duffin has remained tight-lipped after the verdict, saying only: I have notified my solicitor to prepare for an appeal against the decision made against me.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a2601f.jpg","title":"65081  ","story":"    \nAN Antrim mum has bravely opened her heart for the first time about the downward spiral of drug abuse that cost her daughter her health - and ultimately her life.\nShaneen Pearce stepped from the crowd at a community drugs meeting this week to tell her own shattering story of the devastating impact dealers dealt to her family.\nLife as she knew it ended when the phone rang just a few days before Christmas 2015.\nHer 24-year-old daughter Tamara had been found dead in a bedroom in Randalstown.

We are getting ready for a busy summer season and are sure the visitors will enjoy the improved gardens on site.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n    try { _402_Show() } catch(e) {}    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.7966667.1495101436!/image/image.jpg","title":"in full all 18 venues for this year s twelfth of july demonstrations","story":"\nThe Orange Institution has confirmed the 18 venues across Northern Ireland which will host Twelfth of July demonstrations this summer.\n\n\t\t\t\t\nPreparations are at an advanced stage for the largest day in the parading calendar, with upwards of an estimated half-a-million people expected to participate or spectate in what is widely regarded as the largest annual festival in the Province.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAs is tradition, Armagh will once again host the biggest Twelfth gathering ‘in the world’ as Orangemen and women from across the county congregate in the village of Richhill.
