Brazil\u0027s government called the session an \u0027affront to democracy,\u0027 while the top-ranking U.S. diplomat in Latin America called Sunday\u0027s events in the chamber a \u0027farce.\u0027\u0027This morning´s phony National Assembly session lacked a legal quorum. There was no vote,\u0027 Assistant Secretary of State Michael Kozak said on Twitter.       National Assembly President Juan Guaido, Venezuela\u0027s opposition leader, tries to climb the fence past National Guards to enter the compound of the Assembly, after he and other opposition lawmakers were blocked Guaidó said lawmakers would gather later Sunday at the headquarters of El Nacional - the country\u0027s last major opposition newspaper - where they are expected to ratify their support for him.Guaidó faced a major test in uniting articulating a new vision Sunday in his year-long campaign to remove Maduro. But his re-election for a second straight year as head of congress - the source of his legitimacy in the eyes of many in the world - had been widely expected.The weeks leading up to Sunday\u0027s vote were marked by tension, with the opposition denouncing a covert government campaign to intimidate and bribe lawmakers into voting against Guaidó.Parra is one of a small handful of lawmakers who recently broke with Guaidó and have since been expelled from their parties for alleged involvement in a corruption scandal involving allies of Maduro.Socialist lawmakers argued that Guaido\u0027s absence forced them to initiate their session without him. But all day, opposition lawmakers faced resistance by security forces who set up several barricades downtown.       National Assembly President Juan Guaido, Venezuela\u0027s opposition leader, argues with police as he and other lawmakers are stopped a few blocks from the Assembly At one checkpoint, security forces demanded that each lawmaker present their credentials, arguing they were under orders to deny entry to several lawmakers banned from carrying out their duties by the loyalist supreme court.\u0027Is your family in Venezuela?\u0027 Guaidó asked the young police officers, who stood firmly in silence.\u0027Today you´re complicit with the dictatorship, you´re complicit with those who are responsible for the hunger inside Venezuela,\u0027 he added.Support for Guaidó inside the opposition has taken a hit after several minority parties in November splintered off to create a separate bloc to negotiate directly with Maduro - something that Guaidó has refused, arguing that talks are simply a time-buying exercise aimed at keeping Maduro in power.The small group of opposition lawmakers who broke with Guaidó argue that in stubbornly sticking to a naive plan of removing Maduro by force, he has put his political ambitions above the needs of Venezuelans who have largely tuned out from the political fight while enduring an economy in shambles and under stiff U.S. sanctions.       Pro-government lawmakers hold up their fists and shout that Chavez lives, referring to late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez\u0027In 2019 you represented the hopes of the nation, but today you\u0027re its biggest deception,\u0027 said José Brito, one of the lawmakers who turned against Guaidó amid accusations they used their position to enrich themselves and do the bidding of Maduro.Guaidó declared presidential powers over Venezuela on January 23, 2019, saying Maduro\u0027s reelection was illegitimate because the most popular opposition parties and political leaders had been disqualified from running.Venezuela sits atop vast oil and mineral resources, but it has been imploding economically and socially in recent years. Critics blame the plunge on years of failed socialist rule and corruption, while Maduro\u0027s allies say U.S. sanctions are taking a toll on the economy. The South American nation\u0027s 30 million people suffer soaring inflation and shortages of gasoline, running water and electricity, among basic services.       Lawmaker José Brito speaks to the press outside the National Assembly. Brito is a critic of Guaido       The opposition-controlled National Assembly is expected to decide whether to keep Guaidó as its leader for a second year in a special session        Guaido later opened a parliamentary session on Sunday at the offices of the El Nacional newspaper after being denied entry to the National Assembly An estimated 4.5 million Venezuelans have abandoned their nation in an exodus rivaling war-torn Syria.Maduro, who took over after the 2013 death of former President Hugo Chávez, says Guaidó is a puppet of the United States. Maduro also says he\u0027s determined to win control of the National Assembly in elections later this year.\u0027Despite perversions of the imperialist United States against Venezuela during 2019, we´ve managed to hold onto our independence, peace and stability,\u0027 Maduro tweeted recently.The two men remain locked in a power struggle. However, Maduro maintains military backing and control over most branches of the government, despite the deepening crisis and hard-hitting financial sanctions from the United States.\u0027Guaidó will have to not only re-energize his base and convince them to stay engaged, but keep his coalition in line as well,\u0027 said Geoff Ramsey, a researcher at the Washington Office on Latin America. \u0027And the clock is ticking.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Tory MP branded CHILDISH wearing T shirt predecessors face it","story":"Share this articleAngry ex-Labour MP blasts his Tory successor for wearing T-shirt mocking him ¿ The Sun"},{"url":null,"title":"Vandals SAW legs Zlatan Ibrahimovic statue Swedish hometown Malmo","story":"Share this article   Malmo deputy mayor Frida Trollmyr said: \u0027I can understand that many people are disappointed in Zlatan\u0027s behaviour but vandalising a statute is simply unworthy.\u0027Better to express your dissatisfaction in a democratic way.\u0027But she added a citizens\u0027 initiative to move the sculpture will be considered in February.

Ask yourself: \u0027What do I need?\u0027 and \u0027What can I lose?\u0027You don\u0027t have a monopoly on ideasWhat gets cadets through Sandhurst\u0027s 44-week course is teamwork and mutual support. There is a lot of marching in formation, which teaches cohesion, discipline and attention to detail. But it also involves teamwork, because if a single person messes up their footwork, salute or shouldering of arms, it throws everyone else off their game.The British Army is made up of teams within teams, in which every person has a role. A tank cannot move without a driver nor can it fire without a gunner and it can\u0027t do any of those things without a commander.         This is the Sandhurst Way, and if I had to distil it down to one piece of advice, it would be: Stand Up StraightLoyalty — earned through professionalism, humility, decency and integrity — is the glue that binds iniduals into teams. An excellent team is one that feels good about itself and believes in its mission, and in its ability to succeed.In my experience, honesty is the most important aspect of leadership. The people you work alongside need to believe in you if they are to go the extra mile. But trust works best when it flows both ways, and the art of a great leader lies in listening to others, consulting with them, deciding on the best course of action and then leading the way forward.If, in your work, you find yourself managing a team of people, my advice is to create a culture where everyone feels confident enough to share their own ideas. Be flexible enough to listen to others\u0027 suggestions — after all, you don\u0027t have a monopoly on ideas.Go back to go forward When our cadets are high up in the Brecon Beacons in Wales on a mountain exercise, in freezing weather and blanketed in fog, one rocky outcrop starts to look like very much like all the others. Before they know it, they have become hopelessly disoriented.Admitting you are lost is not always easy, especially if you have a whole platoon of soldiers following you. It takes courage.But it\u0027s when we lose sight of our path and our sense of direction that we can take measure of ourselves, for better or worse, both as leaders and as people.The lesson here is not to panic when you lose your way. Take a second and breathe. Remember that getting lost is sometimes part of the journey to finding your way to where you want to be.Take a look at your surroundings and try to find a waypoint — the last time you felt you knew where you were. Then head back there. From this safe spot you can now reset yourself and start planning where you want to go, clearly mapping your destination.Take a \u0027Condor Moment\u0027Under pressure, it\u0027s imperative not to let your blood rule your brain. Instead of rushing in, stand back, take stock of the situation, reset, recalibrate. This is what we call a \u0027Condor Moment\u0027.The term originates from a 1980s series of commercials for Condor tobacco, where a pipe smoker deftly deals with anyone ruining the peace of his meditative smoke. For us, it signifies the presence of mind to take a moment to consider your options and plan your next step. In a crisis, stepping back from the situation, taking a breath and letting the adrenaline dissipate is vital.As a leader, backing yourself is crucial when you\u0027re under pressure. It\u0027s your job to invigorate your team with certitude, confidence and to give them hope, assuring them they are the best people to overcome the challenge and that you believe in them.By staying calm, others will be calmed too. Likewise, a display of panic will be reflected back in the behaviour of your team. So when you\u0027re confronted by the unexpected or the unfamiliar, give yourself a second and let your mind catch up instead of rushing head-first into it. Give yourself the space to think and you will find the solution.Lead from the frontThe Sandhurst motto is \u0027Serve to Lead\u0027. Cadets are taught to ensure the needs of their troops are served before they think about their own to always eat last and to lead from the front. This kind of selflessness is at the core of what makes a fine officer.And it works. As one alumnus told me: \u0027Sandhurst gives cadets a chance to really discover their strengths and weaknesses. You learn that you can never stop improving yourself and no goal is too big for you.\u0027We all have it in us to be heroic every day, to be less focused on ourselves and more aware of others\u0027 needs. So, keep a clear and uncluttered mind, sleep deeply, train hard and take care of yourself, inside and out.Above all, stand up straight and make your best nature second nature.Adapted from Stand Up Straight: 10 Life Lessons From The Royal Military Academy Sandhurst by Major General Paul Nanson, published by Century at £12.99. © Crown Copyright 2019.

The evolution of drone technology allows new ways of seeing, not possible even from the most manoeuvrable helicopter. The German photographer Tom Hegen has been a pioneer of such opportunities. Shooting directly downwards from a hovering near-stationary drone, he can flatten out perspective to the point that the Earth’s surface seems like a stretched canvas. His images of salt production landscapes in southern Europe give the sense that Google Earth has been hacked by abstract expressionist painters.This picture was taken above the pink lakes and white mountains of the salt industry at Aigues-Mortes near Montpellier in the south of France. Salt has been processed continuously from the marshes here since Roman times. To create table salt, seawater is channelled through 45 miles (70km) of intricate canals or roubines. The area is now restricted to visitors because of its unique ecosystem.Hegen says he was drawn to photograph here partly to document the brutal recasting of the landscape by centuries of human activity, and partly to capture the glorious geometries and colour contrasts.

This is generally interpreted as also avoiding products that are cooked with meat.The marketing director of the fast-food chain, Katie Evans, described the product as a “game-changer”.“We wanted our first plant-based Whopper to replicate the indulgence and flame-grilled taste of the real thing as closely as possible, and we’re thrilled with the result,” she said. “We’re delighted to satisfy the demand for this highly-anticipated product and finally bring the Rebel to the UK.”The burger, made in conjunction with meat-free food company the Vegetarian Butcher, has tomatoes, lettuce, mayonnaise, ketchup, pickles on a seeded bun, with a patty made from soy – a common meat substitute.Growing awareness of the impact of meat and dairy production on the climate has contributed to a spike in veganism in recent years, with the UN a long-standing advocate of reducing animal product consumption.Last year, 250,000 people pledged to go vegan in January, with vegan celebrities including Venus Williams, Zac Efron and Ariana Grande credited with raising the profile of the movement.The Rebel Whopper launch comes after Greggs’ debut of its vegan steak bake, a meat-substitute version of its popular pastry, in partnership with vegetarian food brand Quorn.The sandwich chain Subway has also made attempts to capitalise on a growing trend towards dairy, egg, and meat-free diets, adding a vegan marinara meatball sandwich to its offering , after launching a vegan patty in 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1051765c5e9bf447fe3670f79f4e7432218cfb3b/0_2_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c451d08964020dd8824a3cd785ec6932","title":"20 for 2020 rising stars unmissable things","story":"Sally Rooney’s Normal People gets a 12-part TV adaptation, Lana Del Rey performs her acclaimed new album, Top Gun 2 is finally given permission to land, and there’s new talent galore…Thalissa Teixeira was hoping not to die in 2020. But she’s playing Bianca in Thomas Middleton’s Women Beware Women at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, so sadly she will cop it at the end (no great spoiler – it is a Jacobean tragedy after all). She laughs. “At the audition I said: ‘Do we have to see another woman die?’ So many plays I’ve done, women die: in Yerma, Billie died in Julie, Vanessa died in Blood Wedding, Aoife died…”Teixira has a point, but this bloody litany also serves as a handy summary of the 27-year-old’s impressive CV. Since graduating from the Royal Welsh College in 2014, she’s played opposite Vanessa Kirby in Polly Stenham’s Miss Julie at the National Theatre, and with Billie Piper and Aoife Duffin in the Lorca plays Yerma and Blood Wedding at the Young Vic.Teixeira is a memorable performer, even in supporting roles – but this looks to be a break-out year. She stars opposite Maisie Williams in Sky’s crime caper Two Weeks to Live, playing a “stone-cold” cop, and in Trigonometry – a BBC Two comedy written by Duncan Macmillan and Effie Woods about a flatshare that turns into a polyamorous relationship.“It’s nothing to do with maths – thank God, because I would not be able to act that!” says Teixeira. She was so desperate to get the part, she wrote a pleading letter to the director Athina Tsangari after her audition. “It’s funny: so many people are wanting to use the term ‘controversial’ because it’s about three people falling in love together, but it’s never been a word we used,” says Teixeira.Live performance is still her main love, however: Teixeira is part of storytelling group the Embers Collective. “It’s one of the most terrifying performances: you’re retelling an ancient story that’s been told millions of times before, in your own words, no one’s directed you, you have nowhere to hide. It’s so revealing – which is probably why I love it. I’m a bit addicted to it.”She links this urge to perform to her heritage: born in Bradford to a black Brazilian father and white British mother, she was raised in El Salvador, returning to the UK when she was eight. “It’s probably why I became an actor, because in Brazil everyone is performing all the time.”Teixeira considers herself lucky that she’s rarely been cast because of her race – but adds that she “hates” the term “colourblind casting”. That change needs to be seen in the writing, she says. “Why are we putting on plays written by long-dead, white, fascist, racist men, and then putting some black people in it? Why don’t we put more money into plays about people Ian McKellen would never be able to perform?”Holly WilliamsIt promises to be a tremendous year for fiction, with an embarrassment of big-name novelists returning to the fray. There will be new novels from Anne Tyler, Isabel Allende, Lionel Shriver, Roddy Doyle, Sebastian Barry and JM Coetzee, but it will be hardest to miss Hilary Mantel, who will publish the third and final book in her Thomas Cromwell trilogy in March – an event looked forward to with as much feverish longing as the follow-up to The Handmaid’s Tale last year. The first two books in the series, Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies, both won the Man Booker prize (a unique achievement for successive novels), so it’s a good bet that The Mirror and the Light will make for a triumphant finale. Maggie O’Farrell’s Hamnet (March) marks a departure for a much-loved and acclaimed author as she too takes on historical fiction. “Dazzling. Devastating,” says Kamila Shamsie of the novel, which was inspired by the family tragedy of Shakespeare’s son, who died aged 11. Also eagerly awaited is the debut novel by US nonfiction author Ta-Nehisi Coates. The Water Dancer merges historical and fantasy fiction in a slavery story that Oprah Winfrey says is one of the best books she has read in her life. Phew!Ursula KennyCats arrived to widespread derision last month, but hopes remain high for several splashy, stage-derived musicals in 2020. While the world waits for a Hamilton movie, Lin-Manuel Miranda fans will be tided over with the film of his earlier Broadway smash In the Heights, a vibrant ensemble piece set within New York’s Latin American community, with a score encompassing salsa and hip-hop. It’ll make for an interesting contrast to Steven Spielberg’s Ansel Elgort-starring remake of the beloved West Side Story, adapted by Pulitzer-winning playwright Tony Kushner. Here in Britain, meanwhile, surprise West End hit Everybody’s Talking About Jamie is coming to the screen with a cast of bright young things and stalwarts including Richard E Grant this feelgood story of a teenage drag queen could be the next Billy Elliot.Guy LodgeThe plot of Sally Rooney’s phenomenally successful second novel presents no obvious barriers to adaptation: this story of two young people negotiating the pitfalls of love and tertiary education in post-crash Ireland is ripe for onscreen drama. Whether the new 12-part TV version of Normal People for the BBC and Hulu (airing this spring) can match Rooney’s razor-sharp psychological observations and weightless narrative flow is another question. But the talent behind it bodes well, with Lenny Abrahamson, the Irish director of Room, Frank and Garage, overseeing the series alongside Hettie Macdonald (Doctor Who, Fortitude). Cold Feet actor Daisy Edgar-Jones and newcomer Paul Mescal play Marianne and Connell.Killian FoxIt’s often said that change in British theatre will only come about when you change who’s in charge. And a new trend in 2019 has proved quietly progressive: job shares. The artistic directorship of Manchester Royal Exchange is now split between two rising directing talents: Bryony Shanahan and Roy Alexander Weise. They join other recent appointments – Charlotte Bennett and Katie Posner at Paines Plough Debbie Hannan and Gareth Nicholls at the Traverse – in opening up possibilities for more collaborative arts leadership.“Who we are and what we look like and the point at which we are in our careers is maybe a bit different,” Shanahan says. She met Weise in 2013, when they both had a BBC theatre fellowship in 2016, each won emerging director awards, resulting in shows at the Young Vic – Trade by Debbie Tucker Green for Shanahan and Katori Hall’s The Mountaintop for Weise. Shanahan has since directed Queens of the Coal Age at the Royal Exchange, while Weise has directed Nine Night and Master Harold and the Boys at the National Theatre.That they have an easygoing friendship is evident when we meet, but their differing styles complement each other too: Shanahan is softly spoken, a little more cautious, while Weise tends to jump into answers, all beaming grins and belly laughs. When he says she’ll be looking after all the spreadsheets, he’s joking – but she might just be the more practical one. On the day Weise moved house from his native London to Didsbury, just outside Manchester, she turned up at his doorstep with bags of groceries.The job share came about because they are mates – a friendship that really developed when Weise stayed with Shanahan in Manchester, where she’s lived and worked for four years (she grew up in Staffordshire). “Bryony was coming home every day with this great passion for the theatre and what it could be,” Weise recalls.And Shanahan does believe the theatre’s in-the-round space is rather special. “It’s a democratic arena – it doesn’t let you be dishonest, audiences can sniff it out. So there’s a really healthy lack of pretension here.”“A lot like Manchester,” laughs Weise. “People tell you how it is!”HWIf nothing else, 2020 looks as if it’s going to be a vintage year for live music, with a number of major tours on the horizon. Kicking off proceedings – injuries permitting – Madonna plays a run of London dates from 27 January to 15 February, touring her latest album Madame X.Next, purveyor of swooning melodies Lana Del Rey brings Sad Girl winter to our shores (25 Feb, London to 29 Feb, Birmingham) a new album, White Hot Forever, is in the works.Nick Cave \u0026amp the Bad Seeds (2 May, Birmingham to 15 May, London) tour their latest double album, Ghosteen, which is largely about the death of Cave’s teenage son. Its tender, intimate songs may not feel like obvious arena fillers, but the tour is set to be an emotional experience for everyone involved.Dressed like a Soundcloud rapper and murmuring vaguely threatening lines about teenage hormones and death, Billie Eilish returns with her genre-shredding ASMR bangers (21 July, Manchester to 30 July, London).He set trends, dem man copy: Michael Omari, AKA Stormzy, AKA Big Michael, returns to live music after his victorious Glastonbury headline set with a powerful second album, Heavy Is the Head (2 Sept, London to 22 Sept, Bournemouth).Finally, the Rocketman himself. After a mammoth run of dates around the world, the UK leg of Elton John’s widely anticipated Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour starts and ends in London (2 Nov to 17 Dec), via various other cities, before he retires from live performance. So long, tiny dancer.Kathryn BromwichA jubilant ensemble drama about a group of Hackney teenagers, Rocks was a hit on the festival circuit last year. The film’s title may allude to something rough and grey but the movie is anything but – each performance is its own shimmering, incandescent diamond. Newcomer Bukky Bakray is Shola, aka Rocks, an enterprising sixth former who makes quick cash perfecting her classmates’ makeup on her lunch break. When her depressed mother disappears, Rocks must temporarily assume the role of caretaker for younger brother Emmanuel (D’Angelou Osei Kissiedu), simultaneously juggling lessons, friendship dramas, and the looming threat of social services. It’s unclear when – or if – her mum will return.Among the film’s more experienced female crew members are casting director Lucy Pardee, who has worked with Andrea Arnold, and cinematographer Hélène Louvart (who shot Happy as Lazzaro and Beach Rats). Even more moving than its background though is the film itself, which despite its courageous, downbeat ending is thrillingly alive in its depictions of adolescent joy.Simran HansLondon theatre holds a perennial appeal for the A-lister who wants to prove their acting credentials – but by any standards, 2020 is a bonanza year for big names. The Old Vic kicks off with Daniel Radcliffe in Beckett’s Endgame in January, with Timothée Chalamet arriving for Amy Herzog’s 4000 Miles in April. In the West End, Jessica Chastain stars in a production of Ibsen’s A Doll’s House at the Playhouse in June, while in March, Game of Thrones star Emilia Clarke will make her West End debut there in Chekhov’s The Seagull, adapted by Anya Reiss and directed by Jamie Lloyd. Jake Gyllenhaal brings his acclaimed performance in Sondheim’s Sunday in the Park With George to the Savoy come June. At the Young Vic, Cush Jumbo takes on the big one: see her Hamlet from July. In the same month, the actual Whoopi Goldberg really does get back in the habit as Sister Act hits the Hammersmith Apollo. And it’s not just Hollywood actors: West Wing screenwriter Aaron Sorkin brings his Broadway-conquering adaptation of To Kill a Mockingbird to the Gielgud theatre from May.HWComedy sketch duo Freya Parker and Celeste Dring, AKA Lazy Susan, are describing their feelings about being named rising stars in 2020 by this paper. “We’re glowing,” deadpans Dring. “Buoyant. It’s tricky to get things done because we keep floating up off the floor.”Trying to interview the pair involves separating fact from their flights of fancy. “We’re both from showbiz dynasties,” claims Dring. “Our parents are clowns.”Parker picks up the baton: “And we met at Eton. It’s a heartwarming riches-to-riches story.”They’ve actually been writing and performing together for five years, after being introduced by a mutual friend when they’d left university and were “doing bits and bobs” in fringe theatre. “We started off trying to write a play together but it was so bleak and awful, I shudder when I think of it,” cringes Parker. “We kept dicking around doing characters instead, so we accidentally began writing comedy.”Last year, the duo released a well-received sketch show pilot on BBC iPlayer, which then got a terrestrial airing on BBC2. It was based on their sellout Edinburgh run, which sent up post-#MeToo sexual anxiety and saw them greet the audience with: “Good afternoon, ladies and predators!” This year, more TV projects beckon, but they’re currently top secret. “You’ll definitely be seeing more of us in 2020,” says Parker.Parker grew up in Teesside, worshipping Vic and Bob (“They were like gods in the north east”). Dring comes from Wolverhampton, where her early comedic influences were Nickelodeon cartoon Rocko’s Modern Life and 1999 beauty pageant comedy Drop Dead Gorgeous: “It’s got a dynamite cast and was the first time I saw lots of women being funny together, so it was an important film for me.”The Lazy Susan name can be a bit of a liability when it comes to the opposite sex. “It’s a joke that lame men make,” explains Parker. “Which one’s lazy and which one’s Susan? Hur-hur-hur.”“And I’m like, Are you single?” trills Dring sweetly. “But I like it because it’s both an object and sounds like a description of a woman.” Parker chips in: “I like the fact that it’s got a Z in it.”“You’re not playing Scrabble, mate,” says Dring.As well as having projects together in the pipeline, they’ll both be popping up elsewhere in TV comedy this year. Parker is among the ensemble cast of BBC Two’s The Mash Report. “It’s coming back in spring and I’m chuffed to be part of it,” she grins. “These are dark times, so we need satire more than ever at the moment.”Dring plays Princess Eugenie in royal sitcom The Windsors. “We just shot the new series, which airs next month,” she says. “You’ll have to watch it to see if there are any scenes set in Pizza Express in Woking.” No sweat.Michael HoganWith Woolf Works (2015), Wayne McGregor pioneered a new form of full-length narrative ballet that yoked together three contrasting acts under one banner. His latest epic piece for the Royal Ballet, where he is resident choreographer, sounds even more ambitious: a journey inspired by Dante’s The Divine Comedy, moving from Inferno, through Purgatorio to Paradiso, with a newly commissioned score by Thomas Adès that is symphonic in scale, and designs by the artist Tacita Dean. McGregor’s muse Edward Watson stars, alongside Francesca Hayward and Matthew Ball at the Royal Opera House (6 May - 1 June). Inferno premiered in Los Angeles in 2019, where it was warmly received much anticipation surrounds the completed piece.Sarah Crompton“Life kit” podcasts have been around for a bit – think Gretchen Rubin’s Happier podcast, or all those shows on how to become better at businessbeing mindfulnoticing how crappy your life is – but there will be even more coming in 2020. Such podcasts have tended to be American (NPR even launched a specific “life kit” strand around a year ago), but now the UK is joining in. Elizabeth Uviebinené and Yomi Adegoke, authors of the best-selling Slay in Your Lane, are launching Slay: How to Succeed in Your Career Alex Holder, whose book Open Up: Why Talking About Money Will Change Your Life was another hit this year, will be bringing out Awkward Conversations About Money. (Both of these will be on Audible.) Money 101, presented by Bea Duncan, another “how to manage your finances” show, this time aimed at young adults, will be coming out in January on BBC Sounds. Expect a plethora of career and life management podcasts, so you can listen and feel as though you’re actually doing something about that crappy life of yours.Miranda SawyerFyzal Boulifa is a hard man to pin down for an interview. When his schedule finally permits a moment on the phone, he’s up in the mountains at France’s Les Arcs film festival, the latest stop in a crammed festival tour. The Paris-based Brit arrived directly from Marrakech, following visits to Macao and London, for the British independent film awards, where he was nominated for best debut director. “I haven’t been home in a couple of weeks,” he says, sounding sprightlier than you might expect. “I’m honestly excited to get back tomorrow and do laundry.”Boulifa is busy promoting his first feature, Lynn + Lucy, a shattering study of female friendship riven by tragedy and community gossip. An exercise in subtly stylised social realism set in a working-class, predominantly white pocket of Essex, it’s not the breakthrough film many people expected Boulifa – the gay, Leicester-born son of Moroccan parents – to make after his last two shorts won top prizes in Cannes.But Boulifa delights in surprising people. “Diversity can be a poisoned chalice,” he says. “Identity politics are very primary right now: people in the industry have ideas of who you are and where you come from, and expect the stories you tell to directly use that cultural currency. We’re in a progressive moment, but there can be a regressive side to that.”He sees Lynn + Lucy, inspired by a real-life Bristol case that made tabloid headlines, as his lateral way of processing the society he grew up in, but he has no interest in declaratively personal or autobiographical work. He describes the late German auteur Rainer Werner Fassbinder as his greatest inspiration, “because none of his films were definitive – each was its own strange object”.With that in mind, he’s developing two very different follow-up projects: the first a Moroccan-set drama drawn loosely from family lore, the second a teen horror film based on a Junji Ito manga. Having dropped out of film school to take a more self-taught route into the business – “I needed to make my own mistakes,” he laughs – he’s been mostly settled in Paris since attending a film-makers’ residence and meeting his boyfriend there in 2013. The French film world, he says, is less gatekeeper-oriented than the British industry. “And with Brexit…” his voice trails off, no follow-up needed. He is, as I said, not a man to be pinned down.GLShiny new shows often steal the limelight, but plenty of our favourite series will also be returning like long-lost friends. First out of the blocks is the second season of bawdy Netflix teen comedy Sex Education, which arrives on 17 January.This will be followed by the eighth and final season of CIA saga Homeland on Channel 4 on 16 February. We’ll also see Sky Atlantic’s Save Me too, a sequel to Lennie James’s down and dirty southeast London thriller, and a BBC1 return for JK Rowling’s sleuth Cormoran Strike in Lethal White.Nicola Walker and Sanjeev Bhaskar return in ITV’s cold case whodunit Unforgotten, as does Elisabeth Moss in The Handmaid’s Tale season four. Finally, after leaving on a killer cliffhanger, HBO’s Succession sails its super-yacht back on to our screens this summer and it won’t be plain sailing for the rich but deeply dysfunctional Roy dynasty. We can’t wait.MHRevolutionary, visionary, genius, Beethoven made a colossal impact on the history of music. Already the most performed composer, in the 250th anniversary of his birth he’ll reach new ubiquity, but with 650 known compositions there’s much to discover. Worldwide celebrations will centre on Bonn, city of his birth, and Vienna, where he made his name. In the UK, hear all nine symphonies in a blockbuster weekend at the Barbican or follow the LSO’s series with Simon Rattle. Check out Southbank Centre and Wigmore Hall too.Manchester’s Hallé, Birmingham’s CBSO, Liverpool’s RLPO and Poole’s BSO all have big events planned. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are busy too. BBC Radio 3’s Donald Macleod will explore Beethoven’s life throughout the year on Composer of the Week: an epic 125 hours in total.Fiona MaddocksFor fans of super-luxe lifestyle porn and extravagant stunts featuring (and frequently damaging) the world’s most beautiful travel destinations, a new James Bond movie is always a cause for celebration. The latest in the series, No Time to Die, out 3 April, sees Bond stepping back from active service, only to clash with a new breed of 00 agent and a heavily armed, tech savvy villain. Locations include Italy, Norway and the Scottish Highlands and Cary Joji Fukunaga (True Detective) directs.Another class act in the world of action is Tom Cruise, who gets to pull on his flying jacket and aviator shades once more in a sequel to Top Gun. Not much is known about Top Gun: Maverick (out 17 July), which is set 34 years after the original. But expect plenty of breathtaking aerial stunts, numerous shots of Tom Cruise grinning devilishly while driving recklessly fast, and an acknowledgment that, in the age of drones, pilots like Maverick are a dying breed.For sheer spectacle, however, action fans should put 27 March in their diaries: that’s the release date for Whale Rider director Niki Caro’s lavish remake of Mulan, which promises to be a martial arts extravaganza of staggering scale and ambition. More serious in tone than other Disney live-action remakes, so think Crouching Tiger rather than Little Mermaid.Wendy IdeTraditional guitar bands are dead: in 2020, long live the raucous, provocative, sprawling collective. Black Country, New Road are the latest in a wave of interesting groups in this mould, following the Mercury-nominated Black Midi, Squid and Working Men’s Club. Mixing sounds from post-punk and post-rock with new ideas, the seven-piece, who met at school in Cambridge, have only released two singles so far, but their live shows have been thrilling, packed affairs.The songs help. Dark, twisting creatures powered by saxophone and violin, as well as guitar, bass, drums and synths, they’re taken in peculiar directions by frontman Isaac Wood’s constantly bifurcating lyrics. Sex, pop culture and gloomier matters are their primary subjects. “She flies to Paris, France, I come down in her childhood bed,” begins first single, Athen’s France (the misplaced apostrophe is deliberate). “Leave Kanye out of thisLeave your Sertraline in the cabinetAnd fuck me like you mean it this time, Isaac,” wails the insistent Sunglasses.Wood doesn’t always do interviews, which suits BC, NR’s collective spirit: saxophonist Lewis Evans and bassist Tyler Hyde speak today from their adopted home of London. Both are 21, sparky and brightly polite. “Isaac didn’t write lyrics before 2018,” Evans starts. “He was brilliant out of nowhere. It’s bizarre he’s so good.” Hyde agrees. “We like how what he writes feels so honest – he’s not hiding behind anything. Also, they say a lot literally and texturally. They’re part of the overall ensemble.”The band’s obvious musical fluency comes from most of them having played together since they were 15 (apart from new recruit, guitarist Luke Mark) they “gravitated towards each other” at school, Evans says. “The music department there was amazing,” he is at pains to point out. “Properly funded, with brilliant teachers. It absolutely paved the way for us to do what we do now.”They were another band, Nervous Conditions, until January 2018, driven by the principles of free improvisation. Regrouping later that year with a new frontman and name (which Wood has described as meaning “a good way out of a bad place”) they released their first single on influential south London label Speedy Wunderground in April. Sunglasses followed in August. Both quickly sold out.Feverishly received gigs at Brixton’s Windmill Club and summer festivals also helped cement who the new band were. “We were interacting, developing and even doing a lot of songwriting live – and that helped us feel confident together,” says Hyde, excitedly. The new material will be released soon, she hopes. So does the whole indie scene. That dark tarmac’s glistening brightly.Jude RogersIf 2019 was the year of the single-girl memoir, with confessional writing by the likes of Dolly Alderton (All I Know About Love) and Elizabeth Day (How to Fail) flying off the shelves, 2020 looks set to be a year of memoirs exploring a very different aspect of women’s lives: motherhood.Motherwell by the late Deborah Orr is a story about her girlhood in the shadow of the Ravenscraig steelworks she both loved and hated and her escape to university. But more than that, it is a tender, unflinching account of her relationship with her difficult, controlling mother, made all the more poignant by the fact that Orr did not live to see it published (it will be out later this month).Nell Frizzell’s The Panic Years, out in May, explores how she grappled with that “mother of all decisions” that looms over almost every woman in their 30s: whether or not to have a baby. And in The Hungover Games, coming in March, Sophie Heawood describes how it feels to have an “accidental” baby on your own at the same life-stage - two contrasting experiences of becoming a mother that nonetheless share universal truths.Candice Brathwaite highlights another far less talked-about aspect of becoming a mother in I Am Not Your Baby Mother, out in May. Her book is an account of how, finding herself pregnant, she began to notice the way motherhood is portrayed in the British media. Where, she wondered, are all the black mothers? The experience led her to start blogging about the subject and found the initiative Make Motherhood Diverse, which aims to encourage a more inclusive depiction of motherhood in the media.Lisa O’KellyWhatever happened to fictional detectives cracking imaginary cases? The TV trend for true crime dramas will continue with a vengeance this year, starting with this week’s White House Farm on ITV, which finds Freddie Fox playing gunman Jeremy Bamber.This will be followed by Quiz from playwright James Graham and director Stephen Frears, telling the story of the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire “cough-gate” cheating scandal. Its mouthwatering cast includes Michael Sheen as Chris Tarrant, Matthew Macfadyen as Major Charles Ingram and Fleabag’s Sian Clifford as his wife, Diana.David Tennant will play Muswell Hill murderer Dennis Nilsen in ITV drama Des, while Stephen Merchant plays so-called “Grindr killer” Stephen Port in BBC1’s The Barking Murders. There’s also Salisbury, about the 2018 novichok poisonings The Serpent, about backpacker killer Charles Sobhraj and Honour, about the real-life “honour killing” of 20-year-old Londoner Banaz Mahmod.MHStep inside Aria Wells’s incense-smoked flat in south London and you immediately get a waft of her character: there are mini-shrines of candles and trinkets from her travels to Mexico, India and Peru on practically every surface one wall is plastered with posters of Hindu gods to match the Om symbol tattooed between her eyebrows a tiny kitten named after the dancehall musician Buju Banton skitters across the floor. “Everything I do, I need to find a ritual in it,” she says, lighting a nub of palo santo. “It’s got to be magic.”There is certainly something cosmic about her ascent. The 25-year-old singer performs as Greentea Peng, so named because she’s a fan of green tea and the word “peng” (peng is slang for something that’s attractive, or a type of “high-grade weed”), and her rise to hot tip for 2020 has been swift yet effortless. In just one year, she has gone from working behind the bar of an east London club to supporting Neneh Cherry on tour and working with Goldie and Mike Skinner.Her tracks Mr Sun (Miss da Sun) and Downers seem to capture a mood: sad summertime soul that suggests a more bohemian Amy Winehouse and a Lahndahn Lauryn Hill. “I definitely feel like a London artist,” she says, having moved back to the capital from Kent in her late teens. “The bleakness of it in the winter brings out something in me.” Downers, in particular, evokes the isolation of the city and how you can “numb yourself to your surroundings too much”.When we meet, it’s UK election day and Wells had just put a spoken-word “rant” called Bun Boris on YouTube. She says the next song she releases will be political, too, aiming to “spark questions in people’s brains” – though her lyrics tend to be searching and introspective rather than didactic. “A lot of music is all materialistic,” she says. “One of the reasons why we’re in such a crisis with our young people is that our priorities are warped.”Some have called her music spiritual, which Wells doesn’t necessarily agree with, but it’s clear that she is looking for a higher purpose. Her latest ink is a spiral on her cheek, representing “the journey from ignorance to enlightenment” and an eye on her “throat chakra”, so placed “to make sure I always sing and remind me to communicate truthfully”. Which is handy, as she’ll be doing far more of it in 2020. Magical, indeed.Kate Hutchinson2020 is another sensational year for art. Three cult artists get their full due at London’s Royal Academy – shadowy night painter Léon Spilliaert, fantastical illustrator Aubrey Beardsley, charismatic performance artist Marina Abramović, filling the entire RA with her provocations and spells. Dürer, Raphael and Titian all get huge surveys at London’s National Gallery, along with Cézanne (RA) and Warhol (Tate Modern). The balance continues to adjust with much-anticipated retrospectives of the artists Angelica Kauffman (RA), Magdalena Abakanowicz (Tate Modern), Zanele Muholi (Tate Modern) and Haegue Yang (Tate St Ives).But the show of the year, at the National Gallery, has to be the greatest heroine of them all – Artemisia Gentileschi, Italian baroque painter, precocious successor to Caravaggio, self-reliant traveller and sometime visitor to London. Courageous witness against her rapist in court, Gentileschi painted some of the strongest women in art – defiant victims, fiery warriors, and herself in different guises. Her speciality was the story of Judith beheading the Assyrian general Holofernes, who was about to destroy her city. This will be a lightning strike of a show – and, amazingly, our first in this country.Laura Cumming This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

South Africa’s Durban delivers 320 days of sunshine every year, as well as surfing, foodie adventures and sensational land and sea safariOnce seen as the quiet cousin of cosmopolitan Cape Town and fast-paced Johannesburg, the natural wonders and cultural charms of Durban and its surrounds put it firmly on South Africa’s must-see map. Fly direct from London Heathrow to Durban with British Airways, then get exploring.The best place for a first-look at “Durbs” – as the locals call it – is down on the Golden Mile, an iconic stretch (nearly three-miles long, not one, as its name would have you believe) of powdery beaches backed by a colourful pedestrian promenade, all of it smartened up for the 2010 World Cup.Shimmering off to the north is another legacy project of the tournament, the Moses Mabhida Stadium. An 80-metre freefall and 220-metre arc makes the Big Rush Big Swing from the stadium arch the world’s tallest swing, while the more sedate SkyCar delivers superb views of the city and its beaches.With miles of golden sand, and water that rarely dips below 20C, Durban richly deserves its reputation as South Africa’s surfing capital. Surf schools on the promenade – try Xpression or Learn 2 Surf – will have you up and riding in no time. The smaller waves of South Beach are best for beginners, while expert surfers will delight in the long tubes of New Pier.From May to November, these seas are also home to humpback and southern right whales, while Bryde’s, sperm and minke whales inhabit the oceans all year round. Look out for lobtailing, when a whale slaps its tail on the water to create waves, and breaching, when a whale launches out of the water as if ready to backflip. And that wasn’t enough, you can often spot dolphins ing in the crests of the waves. Whale and Dolphin Tours offer daily aquatic safari cruises from Durban marina the company is committed to training tour guides from disadvantaged communities and supporting Whale Time’s environmental research.Oceans aside, Durban is giving Cape Town a run for its money when it comes to culinary adventures. On tree-lined Florida Road you’ll find a neat cross section of the city’s resurgent kitchen creativity, from pan-African flavours at Dukkah to the ice-cream-filled macaroons of chef Zakeeya Mitha’s Sugarlicious. The falooda-inspired Bombay crush ice-cream is the go-to here.But when it comes to dining, Durban is all about curry. Don’t leave without braving the famous “bunny chow”: a quarter-loaf of white bread, hollowed out and filled with bean or mutton curry. You’ll find bunny chow across the city, but in Durban central the Oriental restaurant is an institution. A mutton bunny will set you back just R79.95 (£4.19).It’s also just a short walk from the colourful Victoria Street Market, where spice shops are piled high with fiery bespoke blends. Around the corner, the Juma Masjid is worth a look. It’s one of the largest mosques in the southern hemisphere, the domed facade completed in 1943.There’s certainly plenty to keep you busy in the city, but as the capital of KwaZulu-Natal province Durban is also the perfect starting point for adventures farther afield. With public transport thin on the ground, an Avis rental car is your best bet.A 20-minute drive north of the city brings you to the seaside suburb of Umhlanga, long favoured by South African holidaymakers. You’ll want to spend time exploring the walking trails of the Umhlanga Lagoon Nature Reserve, or browsing the weekly Wednesday morning farmers’ market, but first drop your bags at the Oyster Box hotel, an elegant grande dame of South Africa’s seaside hotels. The pool terrace delivers impressive views – of breaching whales and the ocean – but the attentive staff will also happily set up deckchairs and umbrellas on the beach for you. And there’s no need to venture out in search of dinner: the generous curry buffet here is legendary. Beware the fiery beef vindaloo.Another 30 minutes’ drive along the Dolphin Coast brings you to Zimbali Coastal Resort, where the Fairmont Zimbali Resort offers 154 luxury rooms, secluded beaches and easy access to the resort’s excellent 18-hole golf course, which plays through lush coastal forest. Bring plenty of spare balls.South Africa is synonymous with safari, and Phinda Private Game Reserve and Hluhluwe-iMfolozi park are just two hours’ drive farther north, with a clutch of upscale safari lodges dishing up five-star luxury and Big Five sightings. As well as lions, leopards, rhinos, elephants and buffalo, you may even catch a glimpse of the elusive cheetah.Or head west from Durban, towards the rugged peaks of the Drakensberg mountains. The uKhahlamba-Drakensberg park was declared a world heritage site in 2000, noted for its ancient San rock art and rugged scenery. The historic battlefields of central KwaZulu-Natal are also within easy reach for travellers with a car, with talented guides bringing the drama and tragedy of the protracted Anglo-Zulu wars of the late-1800s to life.So now, the choice is yours. Battles? The Big Five? Beaches? Bunny chow? One thing’s for certain, Durban is no longer second fiddle when it comes to cosmopolitan coastal escapes in South Africa.How to bookWith direct flights from London Heathrow to Durban, British Airways Holidays can help make your South Africa fly-drive unforgettable.

The meandering drive – stretching more than 120 miles from Mossel Bay in the west, to Storms River in the east – takes in dappled forests, still lakes and surf-pummeled beaches. It’s best explored on four wheels, but be sure to take your time. British Airways flies direct to Cape Town, where you can pick up an Avis hire car, belt up and settle into a truly picturesque ride.Humpback whales can often be spotted breaching clear out of the water at Hermanus, just a 90-minute drive from Cape Town. You can even spot whales lolling metres from the shoreline – keep your ears primed for the huff of a humpback whale exhaling right by your feet. The town hosts an annual whale festival each September – when huge southern right whales pass by in large numbers – and there’s even a whale crier, who alerts crowds to the presence of the animals by blowing on a kelp horn. July to October is a great time to see pods of migrating mothers with their calves and, if you’re feeling languid, the Marine Hotel is perfectly situated on a clifftop overlooking the ocean, so you’ll be able to spot barnacle-clad beasts from your balcony.A 40-minute trundle down the road, you’ll find Gansbaai. Known by locals as the Serengeti of the sea, the waters here are bristling with sea creatures, including the marine big five: whales, dolphins, seals, penguins and sharks. The latter can be seen in their menacing masses in Shark Alley – a sliver of ocean that roils with cape fur seals, the great white’s favourite prey.It’s a four-hour journey from Gansbaai to Oudtshoorn, but you’ll have plenty of screensaver scenery to gawp at along the way, including the craggy Tradouw mountain pass and the twisty-turny Huisrivier pass, which clings to the side of a mountain where cape leopards still roam. As well as the Cango Caves – an impressive prehistoric limestone system, dripping with troll-like rock formations, stalagmites and stalactites – Oudtshoorn boasts the largest number of ostriches in the world, with many of the farms offering tractor rides or walks out in the fields with the colossal birds.Head almost due south towards the coast and you’ll soon reach Knysna – a charming holiday town right at the heart of the Garden Route. Here, you’ll find a vast aquamarine lagoon spilling out into the ocean from between two huge sandstone headlands, helpfully known as the Heads. Hike through the lush forest – thought of as the lungs of this beautiful town – or take a trip out on to the water where you can fish, kayak, water ski and swim.A half-hour drive east is Plettenberg Bay. Home to the rocky Robberg Nature Reserve – where you can snorkel with rambunctious seals – a satisfyingly sandy central beach and the Nelson Bay caves, which date back to the stone age. This is also a great place to take part in a township tour (run by Ocean Blue Adventures). Meet up with a local from the Qolweni community and join them on a visit to the township’s Siyakhula crèche, the central shebeen and other lively spots, meeting some of the friendly locals and learning about the township’s rich history along the way. Come evening, stay at the remarkable Tsala Treetop Lodge just out of town – a collection of elegant elevated hideaways decked out in Afro-baroque style and hidden among the canopy of the ancient indigenous forest.Locals like to call Tsitsikamma, just north of Storms River – “the garden of the Garden Route”. An old Khoisan word, Tsitsikamma means “place of much water”, and whether it’s the yawning river valleys, the flinty ocean or the dew-daubed forest that clings to the mountains, this place is most certainly lush. Don your hiking boots for a lung-cleansing hike around this beautiful landscape, then make your final drive to Storms River, where – if the mood strikes – you can mark the end of your epic road trip by hurling yourself off the Bloukrans Bridge – the world’s highest bridge to bungee off.How to bookWith direct flights from London to Cape Town, British Airways Holidays can help make your South Africa fly-drive unforgettable.

This is also how the UK and continental Europe accesses a lot of email, social media, online shopping, Netflix and other internet services. “Everything with the word smart in front of it has a data centre behind it,” said Ben Bryan, Digital Realty’s technical operations manager in Dublin.But there is a catch. The surge in Irish data processing will require significant new energy infrastructure and increase emissions, complicating Ireland’s response to the climate crisis. The cloud can create carbon: it is estimated that when the music video Despacito reached 5bn streamed YouTube views in 2018, the energy consumption was equivalent to powering 40,000 US homes a year (it has now exceeded 6.5bn views).It is already Europe’s data centre capital, with Amazon, Google and Microsoft siting operations there. Dozens of centres have opened in recent years, bringing the total to 54, with a combined power capacity of 642MW. Once a leading exporter of floppy discs and CD-Roms, Ireland has successfully transitioned to the big data era.It is just the beginning. With the state’s blessing another 10 centres are under construction, including a €1bn (£845m) Amazon hub in Mulhuddart, west Dublin, that together will add 202MW. Another 31 centres have planning permission, which would add 629MW. There has been one setback: planning approval delays prompted Apple to scrap a planned €850m (£743m) centre last year.“The data centre industry is growing so fast it’s hard to fathom,” said Patrick Bresnihan, a geography professor at Maynooth University in Ireland. “But somehow the tech companies get far less attention than aviation or fossil fuel companies.”Ireland faces a dilemma. The expanding web of data centres is part of a strategy to anchor tech companies that drive economic growth. They have been designated as “critical infrastructure”, facilitating planning approval. “Data centre presence in Ireland raises our visibility internationally as a technology-rich, innovative economy,” said a spokesperson for the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation (DoBEI).But the boom will exact a price. Ireland is one of the EU’s worst carbon emission offenders and faces fines of more than €250m for missing 2020 targets on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Missing later targets will trigger steeper fines.Ireland’s data centres have a low profile. They tend to operate from anonymous-looking business parks with high-security perimeter fences and intruder detection alarms. A Google centre has colourful murals but the rest are grey and nondescript, with discreet signage.Digital Realty, whose headquarters is in San Francisco, has a relatively small centre in Profile Park, part of a cluster in west Dublin. Its two data halls are powered by 9MW, a fraction of some neighbours but enough to require an electricity substation.It powers the servers and fans which during winter suck in cool air from outside. If the power – and cooling – stopped the machines would swiftly overheat, said Bryan. That has never happened but just in case there are backup diesel generators on the roof.Google and Amazon representatives also said their Irish data centres were energy efficient and entirely supplied by – or soon would be - renewable energy. Earlier this year Amazon Web Services announced backing for a 91.2MW windfarm in Donegal and a 23.2MW windfarm in Cork.Such deals could act as a catalyst for renewable energy investment, said the DoBEI, citing a 2018 government report.Asked about the estimated 1.5m tonnes of carbon emissions, it replied: “The department is not in a position to comment on the accuracy or otherwise of the estimates of the IAE study, which it is not a party to.”Bresnihan, the academic, said Ireland’s dependence on big tech companies should not obscure their environmental cost. “If they left Ireland would be in a pretty bad situation but there’s only so long you can put off these contradictions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5373261224c9ea1433722c8a1388cb23b2df1a14/0_3069_4912_2947/master/4912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7e4d56aea7efb2832e2fab7155c2e7a","title":"could i go a year without buying any new clothes","story":"It’s been the great love of her life, but for Lauren Bravo the time has come to break up with fast fashionI can’t remember a new year when I haven’t made a resolution. Get more sleep, drink more water, drink less booze, eat more fruit, learn Spanish. But there was only one pledge I’ve ever managed to stick to for longer than a few weeks, and possibly the only one that made me feel better about myself instead of worse – I broke up with fast fashion.No new clothes (or at least no “new-new” clothes) for a year. No more payday hauls or bad day pick-me-ups. No more casual flirtation with one of the most exploitative and wasteful industries on the planet. Goodbye, my problematic friend.Before you say it, I know. Swearing off shopping shouldn’t be a hardship. For plenty of people it’s a default state, through lack of funds, lack of choice or just lack of interest. As a sometime-fashion journalist working in the fickle world of women’s media, with trends that rise and fall on the back of a hot-or-not barometer, I know clothes take up a larger space in my life and brain than they do for the average person. But I also know so many people who feel shackled by fashion without the professional pressure so many other women who shop as if it’s a side hustle they’re obliged to keep afloat. And if not buying, then browsing, scrolling, trying on, returning, thinking, thinking, always thinking about shopping.That said, it’s remarkable how many times this year men have fallen over themselves to tell me, proudly, that they never buy clothes. Never! Hate shopping! As though it’s pure coincidence I picked up the message that as a woman, my clothes matter more than theirs do. Like there’s no patriarchal whiff to the whole situation. Like simply opting out might not have occurred to me.Of course it’s occurred to me. On all those harried shopping missions, every time the Asos scroll threatened to give me carpal tunnel syndrome, the thought would always be there in the back of my mind: why do I even care? Why does anyone?But what the Jeremys with their homogenous, wife-bought wardrobes fail to recognise is that loving clothes isn’t a character weakness to be stamped out like smoking. Clothes can be cultural currency, tribal identity and a precious tool of self-expression. An outfit can set you apart from one crowd, and win you a place in another. Virginia Woolf got it: “Vain trifles as they seem, clothes have, they say, more important offices than to merely keep us warm. They change our view of the world and the world’s view of us.”Over the years, clothes have been my comfort blanket and confidence boost. They’ve been a recreational hobby, a competitive sport and a way to bond with people in pub toilets. I’ve hunted for those holy grail garments the way a hardcore collector might hunt out rare stamps or action figures (then, to my shame, kept them nearly as boxfresh). I’ve used clothes to draw attention to myself and I’ve used them as camouflage, buying the illusion of grown-up professionalism in weekly instalments at Zara at a time when my salary barely covered my bus pass. Like Cher from Clueless, I too have a “most capable-looking outfit”.But, of course, once you invest a thing with so much potential to make you feel good, it has equal potential to make you feel bad. Each outfit an exam, to be passed or failed. At least once a week I would have a wardrobe crisis before leaving the house standing in my pants and flinging clothes around my bedroom, believing I had nothing to wear even as I was elbow-deep in evidence to the contrary. On those days, I would plan emergency trips to H\u0026ampM at lunchtime, the way you might nip into Boots for painkillers to ease a headache. Somewhere along the way, I think I gave clothes too much power.I know I gave them too much time. And money. Once I stopped shopping, spare cash appeared in my account and periods of free time began to appear in my week. It’s incredible, the things you can get done when you’re not forever standing in a Post Office queue with an armful of Asos returns. I’m not saying I’ve launched a startup or finally learned Spanish, but I’ve read a lot more books and had precisely zero existential crises in the changing rooms at \u0026amp Other Stories. I’ve watched myself rise, incrementally, out of the depths of my overdraft, with each dress and bag I haven’t bought. It’s progress.To be clear: I haven’t stopped shopping entirely. Charity shops have filled the gap left by the high street, along with the occasional preowned gem from eBay and Depop. But secondhand shopping is a very different beast it’s the slow-release energy to fast fashion’s sugar rush. While the high street sells the idea that every shopping trip should end in a purchase, thrift stores manage your expectations. You learn to appreciate the trawl as much as the haul, getting gooey-eyed about the history stitched into each seam. Going home empty-handed feels less like defeat. You’ve saved the money and still had a nice day out.Of course, it’s important to acknowledge that second- hand shopping isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. It’s harder to find larger clothes in thrift shops, and the sustainable fashion world in general has a long way to go before it caters for all bodies equally. But then, so does the high street.I always knew I hated changing rooms, but it wasn’t until I quit shopping that I realised just how much self-loathing lurked behind those curtains. Fast fashion made me feel as though I was failing it, every time the zip didn’t do up, or the buttons gaped, or the outfit that looked chic and insouciant on the mannequin looked strange and lumpen on me. I blamed myself, my body, when in fact – and I’m furious it took me 31 years to grasp this – it’s the clothes that should be auditioning for you. Not the other way round.I’d love to say that breaking up with fast fashion has cured the morning meltdowns. They’re certainly less frequent, but the wrong recipe of weather, schedule and hormones can still tip me into sartorial crisis. And I still get struck down by “trend flu” – that feverish, all-consuming need to buy some viral item you hadn’t even liked the week before. This year: giant pearl hairclips, puffer jackets and the Zara dress. I went to bed and rode them all out.I also learned new tricks to eke more wear out of my existing wardrobe: like layering – an artform I’d previously believed you could only do if you were Scandinavian or owned your own kiln. Turns out no! You simply take your clothes and… put them on top of other clothes. Slimfit polonecks under summery slips, shirts under short-sleeved sweaters, jumpers over dresses over jeans. Aside from one mishap with a mustard tank top and a white shirt that can only be described as “Disney woodcutter”, I’ve had a surprisingly good success rate.As so many business gurus will tell you, constraints force creativity. And when you limit your shopping options, you find yourself getting inventive with new tools instead. Sometimes superglue, sometimes scissors. My sewing skills have rusted since their GCSE Textiles heyday but since I stopped shopping, I’ve started tinkering more. I’ll take up a hem, change a neckline. Put press studs between the gaping buttons. When a hankering for new jeans hit last month, I unearthed an ancient pair of mid-rise stretch bootcuts – bootcut! – and chopped them into ankle-length flares. They’re not exactly the jeans of my dreams, but they’re close enough. And I’m old enough to know by now that the jeans of my dreams don’t exist.I also know I’m not a “capsule wardrobe” person. Even so, a good wardrobe cull can be cathartic, and there’s a strong argument for stripping back your wardrobe to an edited selection of reliable, high-quality pieces (I can see clearly now the rayon is gone, as Johnny Nash almost sang). But it can also be counterintuitive, especially if you’re not ready to swear off trends entirely. Not yet.Ignore anyone who tells you to get rid of everything you haven’t worn in a year. Fashion is cyclical – come on, we know this – and no sooner have you sent a tired old trend off to the charity shop than Vogue will suddenly declare it hot again. “The most sustainable item is the one you already own,” says Fashion Revolution (the global movement that scrutinises industry practices). It’s amazing how often you can medicate trend flu with something that’s already in your wardrobe.And if not yours, someone else’s. Peer-to-peer rental platforms such as HURR Collective and My Wardrobe have arrived on the scene to formalise and monetise the process, the latter even hiring former Whistles CEO Jane Shepherdson as chairman. Meanwhile, groups like Swap Rebellion and Swapaholics UK are hosting good old-fashioned clothes swaps on a grand scale. Sharing and borrowing from friends is a secret weapon that most of us don’t take nearly enough advantage of. The wardrobe of the future is open-source I really believe that. Especially if your Rixo dress is my size.Meanwhile, social media has taken on a new role in my life. I’ve unfollowed every brand and influencer that might have led me into temptation, and let slow fashion advocates like Jade Doherty (@notbuyingnew) and Hannah Rochell (@EnBrogue) set a new pace on my feed. In a galaxy of #gifted single-wear wardrobes, their willingness to show off the same items again and again feels gently subversive.Following their example, I’ve become a serial outfit repeater – and proud of it. I’ve started to dress like a toddler who has to have their favourite jumper wrestled off them for washing. And since over-washing is another sustainability no-no (all those plastic microfibres leaching into the waterways, not to mention the ageing and fading effect), I’ve shrugged off the shame along with the odd gravy stain. Nobody has said anything.In fact, one of the more ego-bruising but ultimately liberating parts of the whole process has been realising just how little anybody cares what I’m wearing – be it at a work meeting, a party or, because apparently I am this shallow, a funeral. Every time I’ve pulled on the same old outfit I’ve braced myself for pointed fingers, covert sniggers or disapproving scowls that haven’t come. Because, and I really can’t stress this enough: people do not care what you wear. Most won’t even remember.You will, but in a good way. Those much-loved, time-worn outfits become part of the memories dependable series regulars rather than novelty guest stars. And that, really, is the mindset that carries you through a year without shopping. Instead of pining over my break-up with fast fashion, I’m trying to focus on my relationship with the clothes I already own. Romancing them, looking after them, taking them out dancing. Reminding myself why I fell for them in the first place.If received wisdom is to be believed, it takes half the length of a relationship to move on after a break-up. Which means I could have nearly a decade ahead of me before the thrill of a DPD delivery has completely left my system before each invite and mood swing and season-change triggers a flashing light in my brain that reads “SHOP!”Unpicking the seams that bind my clothes so tightly to my self-esteem is going to take longer than a year on the wagon, but already I’m at a point where I can’t imagine ever going back to the high street – for all the urgently important reasons, of which there are millions, multiplying with each painful crank of the production line. But for a selfish one, too: I just don’t have the energy. Not any more.Now, I’m the kind of person who goes around warning others off their toxic ex. Babe, you can do so much better than fast fashion. The planet can. We all can.Try these top tips to kick your habit and take back control1.

Women older than 75 stop spending on fashion altogether, even though they have significant savings and say they are still interested in looking stylish, according to the findings.Diane Kenwood, a ILC trustee, said: “For too long the fashion and beauty industries have been bewilderingly resistant to recognising just how fashionable and stylish the generation of older consumers are and want to remain.“The potential of these consumers is huge and it has been shamefully sidelined. I do, though, sense a shift in attitudes starting to stir, and I’m hopeful that change will gather momentum.”Older models have been increasingly used in advertising during the past decade, but it has never become the norm. In 2015, Phoebe Philo, creative director at Celine, chose then 82-year-old author Joan Didion to star in a campaign. Since then, Jane Fonda and Helen Mirren have modelled for L’Oréal, Charlotte Rampling became the face of Nars lipstick, Joni Mitchell joined St Laurent, Lauren Hutton was brought onboard for Calvin Klein lingerie, and Julia Roberts became the face of Lancôme.But although a lot of the big brands – including Gucci – appear to be increasingly age-inclusive in their advertising, the issue is still sensitive. Photographer and author Ari Seth Cohen is the creator of Advanced Style, a project devoted to “capturing the sartorial savvy of the senior set”. He said the fashion industry was hampered by its fear of mortality.Cohen said: “Fashion and beauty brands have been ignoring their older customers for ages. Rather than trying to reach this savvy demographic, they prey on their insecurities and use fear and ageist propaganda to sell beauty products that promise the ridiculous and harmful ideology of ‘anti-ageing’.“I have noticed a growing trend towards inclusion for older models and senior social media stars for more than a decade. There have been numerous beauty and fashion campaigns featuring silver-haired models, but I don’t think brands have quite figured out what their older customers want and how to reach them.“One huge shift that seems to be making a difference is the power of older women on social media and Instagram. Rather than needing to create content specifically geared towards older consumers, brands are beginning to approach a growing population of senior content creators to make more organic and believable sponsored posts and ads focused on their own micro-communities.”In 2017, a group of models aged 47 and older protested at the opening of London fashion week against their lack of representation on the catwalk – although it was at her show there that Simone Roche cast three septuagenarians and a 50-year-old.Jilly Johnson, 65, who was one of the protest’s organisers, said at the time: “People seem to think that once you reach 40, you’re not interested in clothes and you don’t buy anything – but that’s simply not true. A huge percentage of clothes are bought by older women – so fashion is making a huge mistake by ignoring that grey pound.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c4174154230067551a22ec1dde4dcfce8235b41/0_148_4521_2713/master/4521.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=983260f3126d5dfa0b400ce974c8522f","title":"london fashion week grace wales bonner 70s london reggae","story":"Designer who dressed Duchess of Sussex drew on classic designs and colours of Jamaican flagLovers Rock, the reggae genre popular in London in the 70s and 80s, had an unexpected moment in the fashion spotlight on Sunday night at the capital’s menswear shows. Grace Wales Bonner, a much hyped designer who has dressed the Duchess of Sussex, dedicated her London fashion week collection to the music, and the scene that surrounded it over 40 years ago.Linley Hall, a grand building in equally grand SW1, was transformed into a homage to a youth centre. Guests including the artist Isaac Julien, the footballer Héctor Bellerín and poet Wilson Oryema sat at round tables, and fruit punch and Jamaican patties were offered as refreshments. In the show notes provided, Wales Bonner explained that she was inspired, in part, by John Goto’s photographs of second-generation British Caribbean and Asian young people at Lewisham youth centre for Lovers Rock parties. The soundtrack – put together by Jamie XX – was blasted out of speaker stacks, as it might have when these images were taken.The collection stuck close to the theme. It began with a crisp wool suit with a poloneck – a classically 70s combination, but with a minimalism that did away with any accusations of retro. Across women’s and menswear, trenchcoats, knits, tracksuit trousers and donkey jackets followed, along with shirts printed with paintings by British-Guyanese artist Frank Bowling.The colours of the Jamaican flag were used on hats, vests and coats. All the clothes felt modern despite the references. This is one of Wales Bonner’s strengths. While her references are so academic that she provides a bibliography for each collection, she is able to translate her area of historical interest – be it Lovers Rock, Howard University in the 60s, or the court dress of Haile Selassie – into clothes that people want to wear.After the show, Wales Bonner – a somewhat serene presence in the usually frenetic world of a fashion show – explained that the inspiration for this show had been, as she put it, “inevitable” because of its proximity to her own background, and her Jamaican father’s experiences in London in the 70s. “I was thinking a lot about people coming into community centres and creating their own parties,” she said. “I was looking at John Goto’s Lovers Rock series and saw my family reflected in it.”Last year was a big one for Wales Bonner, starting with the curation of an exhibition at London’s Serpentine Gallery in January. She also won the BFCVogue Fashion Fund prize – an investment of £200,000 – in May. The designer’s pedigree is writ large in the company she keeps. The white coat-dress worn by the Duchess of Sussex to present her son in May was Wales Bonner’s, and she collaborated with Christian Dior’s Maria Grazia Chuiri on items for the megabrand’s cruise collection in April. She also partnered with Solange on a performance art happening, Devotional Sound, in New York.Wales Bonner highlights the work of other people of colour excelling in their field. Recent posts on her Instagram include a clip of poet London Kwesi Johnson reciting his piece Inglan is a Bitch in 1980, Bowling paintings, and a notice of a talk between Wales Bonner and artist Theaster Gates, for his show at the Tate Liverpool. Scroll further down and you’ll find musicians including Steve Lacy and Jorja Smith wearing her designs. It’s perhaps part of a wider vision for the designer’s label.“It is my ambition to build a brand that comes from a black cultural perspective and has the same authority, presence and impact as any esteemed European house,” she said to Vogue in May. “In the long term, I want Wales Bonner to exist on that same level.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9563bb8e38b239590d2fb02fce182641bb2c354/0_338_5347_3210/master/5347.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7e34b0e2557d464173e0a8bbdf5ba93","title":"the 2020 golden globes fashion on the red carpet in pictures","story":"Billy Porter, Jennifer Aniston, Cynthia Erivo, Jennifer Lopez and more flaunt big sleeves and long trains at the 77th edition of the film and television awards"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb31197c22a80f4812b4bd013b244a04a9a24103/0_45_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69e30fd4a1f579ca80de6a2e877d383b","title":"golden globes 2020 1917 and fleabag lead british invasion with major wins","story":"The first big awards show of the year saw British victories across the board, including for Olivia Colman, Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Sam MendesIt was a night of stratospherically high star-wattage – Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio, Taylor Swift, Beyonce, Elton John, the list goes on – and big wins for British productions at the 77th Golden Globes, a night overstuffed with largely unsurprising awards, host Ricky Gervais’s apathy toward award shows, and calls to vote in 2020.Top of the British victory wave was 1917, Sam Mendes’s technically audacious film following two British soldiers in the first world war, which won for best picture – drama and best director. Best actor – drama, meanwhile, went to Joaquin Phoenix for Joker, who gave a rambling speech frequently obscured with network bleeps, and Renee Zellweger wining best actress in a drama for Judy. On the comedymusical side, the night tipped in favor of Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and its supporting actor star Brad Pitt, as well as Brit Taron Egerton for his portrayal of Sir Elton John in Rocketman.It was also a night of historic firsts with The Farewell star Awkwafina becoming the first Asian-American woman to win for best actress in a musical or comedy (“If I fall on hard times, I can sell this,” joked the first-time Golden Globes attendee) and composer Hildur Guðnadóttir winning best score for Joker, becoming the first woman to win solo in the category.On the television side, the Globes extended the Emmys’ British invasion with numerous wins for stars from across the pond – Phoebe Waller-Bridge continued her awards season roll with best actress and best comedy for Fleabag, Olivia Colman ruled again for her takeover of Queen Elizabeth II in The Crown, and Brian Cox triumphed as best actor in a drama for Succession, whose British creator Jesse Armstrong picked up a win for best drama series. Uncharacteristically for the Globes, the television wins largely tracked with critical acclaim or consensus besides wins for the much-lauded Fleabag and Succession, awards went to the well-reviewed Chernobyl and its star Stellan Skarsgaard for supporting actor in a limited series, and what could be seen as a “best new artist” award to Ramy Youssef for his role in Hulu’s small but mighty series Ramy.Blasting stars’ enthusiasm to work for massive streaming companies, Gervais told the crowd to not use their speeches “as a platform to make a political speech”, and instead “come up, accept your little award, thank your agent and God, and fuck off”.Several of the winners pointedly ignored Gervais’s advice the night’s two most rousing speeches belonged to veteran speech-givers Patricia Arquette and Michelle Williams. Arquette, accepting for a repeat win as best supporting actress in a limited series for The Act, urged viewers to look past the pomp toward real issues. “While I love my kids so much, I beg of us all to give them a better world,” she said. “For our kids and their kids we have to vote in 2020 and we have to get – beg and plead for everyone we know to vote in 2020.”Williams, accepting for best actress in limited series for FosseVerdon, built on her memorable Emmys speech on giving space for women to do their best work with a moving call for women’s right to choose. “I’ve tried my very best to live a life of my own making and not just a series of events that happened to me, but one that I can stand back and look at and recognize my handwriting all over,” she said – choices not possible without her right, as a woman, to “choose when to have my children and with whom, when I felt supported and able to balance our lives, knowing, as all mothers know, the scales must and will tip towards our children”. She concluded by calling on women “18 to 118”, to vote in their self-interest, because “it’s what men have been doing for years, which is why the world looks so much like them – but don’t forget we are the largest voting body in this country. Let’s make it look more like us.”The night’s other most resonant speeches belonged to the evening’s two lifetime honorees: Ellen Degeneres, accepting the Carol Burnett award for achievement in television from Kate McKinnon, who described the impact the comedian’s coming out had on her as a young woman, and America’s great everyman, Tom Hanks, introduced for the Cecil B DeMille by Charlize Theron as, simply, a man who “makes the world a better place”.Phoenix also took a political, if slightly less coherent than Arquette and Williams, stance in his speech. “It’s really nice that so many people have sent their well wishes to Australia but we have to do more than that,” he said, referencing the country’s devastating bush fires. “I have not always been a virtuous man. So many of you in this room have given me so many opportunities to get it right … Together, hopefully we can be unified and make some changes,” such as, he added, not taking a private jet to Palm Springs.The climate change-fueled disaster in Australia received much attention throughout the night best supporting actor in a limited series Russell Crowe wasn’t in attendance due to the fires, sending word instead to take climate action seriously, while Aussie native Cate Blanchett thanked well-wishers and urged for donations to first responders and those affected by the raging bushfires, because “when one country faces a climate disaster, we all face a climate disaster”.Even Gervais had to agree, ending the night with a call to “get drunk, take your drugs, and also: donate to Australia.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/488366c6340eee4886977be75cbec5e90444265a/0_124_3672_2203/master/3672.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35c36d959b4cde2cb95d9212acb71704","title":"harvey weinstein trial new york metoo movement","story":"The trial, which begins 6 January, will include testimony from two alleged victims and Annabella Sciorra amid concerns he may not be ultimately held legally accountableHarvey Weinstein is set to face his toughest legal challenge yet – a criminal trial for rape and sexual assault that could send him to prison for the rest of his life.Only a handful of women will be allowed to testify at the trial in New York supreme court in Manhattan, which begins on 6 January. But watching from the sidelines will be scores of women who have alleged sexual misconduct and abuse at the hands of Weinstein.In the New York trial, the 67-year-old movie producer is accused of raping a longtime lover, who has not been publicly named, in 2013, and of forcibly performing oral sex on his production assistant in 2006. The trial will include testimony from these two alleged victims, as well as from Sopranos actor Annabella Sciorra, who said Weinstein raped her at her apartment in the early 1990s.The alleged 1993 incident was initially deemed too old to be considered as evidence, but was recently admitted under the legal theory that the testimony could help support charges of predatory sexual assault, which carry a maximum life sentence and requires prosecutors to show a pattern of misconduct.The prosecution will attempt to prove that Weinstein is guilty of all five counts brought before the court, including two counts of predatory sexual assault, one count of a criminal sexual act in the first degree, one count of rape in the first degree and one count of rape in the third degree. Sciorra’s allegation cannot be charged separately, according to prosecutors.Weinstein has denied all wrongdoing, saying any sex that took place was consensual.Zoë Brock, a former model and writer from New Zealand who was part of that civil settlement, told the  that watching proceedings will be agonizing.“I’m heartbroken that I won’t have the opportunity to face him in court myself. I’m really disappointed. It’s been devastating,” said Brock, who has alleged Weinstein made unwanted sexual advances in a hotel room in 1997, forcing her to lock herself in the bathroom to escape.“I can definitely paint a picture that he was aided and abetted by people who worked for him, and some of the people who worked for him admitted to my face that he did it repeatedly.”The trial comes two years after New York Times and New Yorker investigations into widespread allegations of sexual abuse and harassment by Weinstein helped galvanise the #MeToo era – and a year after his arrest in 2018, when he was released on $1m bail.It also comes amid concerns that though Weinstein’s fall from Hollywood royalty to criminal defendant was a watershed cultural moment, he may not ultimately be held legally accountable for most of his alleged conduct.Such concerns were heightened in December, following reports that the Weinstein Company had reached a tentative $25m settlement deal in a civil case with more than 30 alleged sexual misconduct victims, which would not require Weinstein to admit any wrongdoing or pay anything out of his own pocket to his accusers.Weinstein’s lawyers insist he is innocent and will only need to sow doubt in the jurors’ minds since it’s up to the prosecution to meet the burden of proof, which is higher for criminal cases than civil ones.“Mr Weinstein maintains that all of these allegations are false, and he expects to be fully vindicated,” Weinstein lawyer Benjamin Brafman said in a statement. The road to the trial has been long and gruelling. In October 2018, Weinstein lawyers got one of six criminal sex charges dismissed. But the defense subsequently failed to get other charges against Weinstein dropped in December 2018, after the judge ruled the court had found “no basis for the defendant’s claim of prosecutorial or law enforcement misconduct”.Last summer, prosecutors obtained a new indictment allowing for Sciorra to testify – a move a Weinstein’s lawyers called “desperate”. Weinstein’s lawyers faced another setback in October when the defense lost its bid to move the trial to another city: the court rejected the former producer’s concern that he wouldn’t get a fair trial in what his lawyers referred to as the “circus-like atmosphere” of media in New York. Unlike other high-profile court cases in the US, this trial will not be televised.﻿“I’m trying as much as I can to brace myself for the worst possible scenario,” the actor Katherine Kendall, one of the first women to speak out against Weinstein, told the . “And at the same time I feel really hopeful because this is a historic moment and it feels like the message could get out there to people that your stories matter and the judicial system will do something about it.”Kendall came forward as part of the New York Times’ initial investigation into Weinstein, alleging he harassed her in 1993. She has since sought out therapeutic resources, like the trauma workshops led by fellow Weinstein accuser Louise Godbold.“If this man walks free it is not just an insult to those of us who have lost friends, families, careers as a result of coming forward with the truth,” Godbold told the , “but it is sending a dangerous predator back into the world.”The former actor and screenwriter Louisette Geiss emphasized her frustration with the limited scope of the criminal trial. “In the class action we know of 150 women he’s affected,” Geiss told the .A mother to four, Geiss left Hollywood for real estate after she said Weinstein tried to make her to watch him masturbate in front of her as she was pitching a movie at the Sundance film festival in 2008.She now serves as co-chair of the $25m civil settlement against Weinstein and the Weinstein Company.“We all know that the court of public feelings are very important around these decisions and if he’s seen as this poor guy … that’s not going to fly,” she said, in reference to his recent media appearances.Weinstein has begun appearing with a walker, and while recovering from spinal surgery, he granted a rare photo opportunity and interview to the New York Post.“I feel like the forgotten man,” he told the Post. “I made more movies directed by women and about women than any film-maker, and I’m talking about 30 years ago. I’m not talking about now when it’s vogue. I did it first! I pioneered it!”Weinstein has said he sustained a serious back injury in a car accident in August last year. But some are skeptical of the optics of his interview.“He’s a wealthy man – he knows how to do PR for himself … So it is very important for us since we can’t be on the stand to make sure we let America know what a bad guy he is,” Geiss said.Things will only more heated once the trial begins on Monday, a housekeeping day when the judge will outline the schedule, and it’s expected to drag on for weeks. Jury selection is set to begin on Tuesday, and jurors have been told to prepare for a case lasting up to two months.The Los Angeles district attorney’s office is considering whether to bring charges in eight separate cases against Weinstein. London’s politan police force continues to investigate allegations of misconduct. But for now, all eyes are on the New York trial.“Considering every other horrific thing that happened so far in this criminal case with Harvey, I now live in the worst-case scenario,” Brock said.“The system is broken,” Brock continued. “And therefore no, I do not feel confident any more that the right thing will happen because life is not a Spielberg movie. I wish it was.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/458de95a43591d3e1f77d4bb2fdfca1a64542772/0_604_3712_2227/master/3712.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87b7aaada6c266ee856cd24a67966aa6","title":"paolo sorrentino my characters struggles are the struggles i have","story":"The Naples-born director and screenwriter Paolo Sorrentino had his first screenplay made when he was in his 20s, and has since written and directed nine films, winning an Oscar and a Bafta for 2013’s The Great Beauty. In 2016, he created and directed his first TV series, The Young Pope, which starred Jude Law. For the follow-up, The New Pope, John Malkovich joins the cast.Was it always your plan to make a sequel to The Young Pope?No, initially I intended to end the story with The Young Pope. It was while editing the first season that I had the idea that opened up the game again.We left the first series with Pope Pius XIII (Jude Law) in a coma. Now the Catholic church is seeking a replacement, right?Exactly. They appoint John Paul III (John Malkovich), who is quite the opposite of his predecessor. Pius was ambitious and had always wanted to become pope. John Paul III is a reluctant pope who does it despite himself. He’s moderate with a natural inclination towards compromise, whereas Pius was much more hardline and conservative.So the new pope is more like a politician?Yes, like a smart politician. Which are increasingly rare creatures. It’s interesting. The church still believes in training its people and preparing them for power. Politics used to be like that too, but nowadays we have more and more improvised politicians with no experience.Why did you decide to make John Paul III a Brit? There’s only ever been one British pope and that was nearly 900 years ago.I made him English because he’s a key figure in converting as many Anglicans as possible to the Catholic church. That’s why he’s selected to be pope.But then Pius wakes up, which is considered a miracle, and a power struggle ensues. What were your inspirations for that rivalry?I don’t tend to get inspiration from outside sources, but from inside myself. In all the stories I tell, the struggles of my characters are the struggles I have within me.Sharon Stone and Marilyn Manson guest star in this series. Tell us about that?They play themselves. Our new pope has that kind of mundane secular side and, ever since he was a kid, he’s had an inclination to meet celebrities.Michelangelo’s Pietà gets damaged by a terrorist bomb in the new series. Did that feel like sacrilege?Not really. I saw it as quite a likely scenario. We’re living under the clear and present threat of terrorism. In Italy, there has been talk of possible targets for terror attacks and the Vatican is one of them, so why not fantasise about what could happen?Has TV caught up with film now, in terms of its scale and ambition?I don’t think television and cinema are in competition. But in recent years, TV at its best has become like an extension of cinema. In the 60s and 70s, the so-called cinéma d’auteur movement enabled directors to make long, impressionistic films. Now that’s impossible in film-making, but TV allows you the opportunity to tell those long-form stories.You’ve made films about a pair of Italian prime ministers: Il Divo, about Giulio Andreotti, and Loro, about Silvio Berlusconi. Any more planned?Two is enough! I don’t feel the need to make any more. They’re quite delicate. I have a big imagination and I like to use it, but when you’re dealing with well-known real people, you have to be very careful and respectful. That’s a game I’m no longer interested in playing.You can’t write without listening to music. What sort of music is best?Yes, I always have music in the background as I write, but the volume is usually very low. Sometimes I forget there’s music in the room. I have eclectic taste. I just got that end-of-year report from Spotify about what I’ve listened to and it’s all kinds of genres.You once said that Diego Maradona saved your life. How?It was literally fate. When I was 16, I was supposed to go on holiday with my parents but decided to stay home because I really wanted to go and watch my football team Napoli play. My parents had an accident on holiday and died. So yes, my passion for soccer – and for Maradona in particular – saved my life.Do you still have that passion? Very much so, but not just for Napoli, for all soccer. I often find myself stopping to watch matches in parks or schoolyards. I used to play, but I turn 50 this year and it’s important in life to know when to stop doing things! I wish I could have been a football coach, but I never studied to be one and it’s too late now.How do you feel about turning 50?It was more fun when I turned 20! I might have a party, but I always say I will, then get the fear and cancel it two weeks beforehand.What was the best film and TV show you saw last year?Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman was wonderful. On TV, Modern Love, which is based on the New York Times column.Where do you keep your Oscar?In a cabinet in my study. Let’s pretend that it’s just one award, sitting among my many others!Do you have any new year resolutions?I should give up smoking, but won’t. Recently, I switched to cigars. I probably would have given up long ago if I didn’t have half the world telling me to stop. Everyone around me says I must, which only makes me more determined to continue.The New Pope launches on Sky Atlantic and Now TV on 12 January"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acc739aebffec70b1e40073b2a3cd8472c2d60f8/0_6_4442_2664/master/4442.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd03c74e95d5ea59cfe462c55ad618fb","title":"ricky gervais targets apple epstein and cats in golden globes monologue","story":"The controversial host returns to the Golden Globes with a monologue skewering everyone from Felicity Huffman to Joe PesciWith a drink in hand and an immediate promise that this would not happen again, Ricky Gervais kicked off his fifth time hosting the Golden Globes with a monologue skewering, among others: Twitter callouts, Felicity Huffman, Jeffrey Epstein, and award season’s moralizing speeches.The controversial British comedian, 58, promised before the show he’d go after “the general community. I’d go after cinema and I’d go after television and I’d go after actors and I’ll go after pretension and hypocrisy,” and for the most part, stuck to his promise. “Let’s have a laugh at your expense, shall we?” he said. “Remember, they’re just jokes, we’re all going to die soon.”Known for drawing audience gasps and Twitter outrage for his jokes – his 2016 bit on Caitlyn Jenner’s transition and her car crash in which another driver died drew particular ire – Gervais trained most of his scorn this year on the Hollywood industry. He traveled to the show in a limo, for instance, though his had a “license plate that was made by Felicity Huffman,” a reference to her trial over illegally buying her child’s way into college.From there Gervais stayed generally true to his don’t-care beat, sending up Hollywood’s ties to Jeffrey Epstein (“I know he’s your friend, but I don’t care”), Leonardo DiCaprio’s dating life (he attended The Irishman’s premiere and “by the end, his date was too old for him”) and Hollywood film and TV executives who are “all terrified of Ronan Farrow – he’s coming for you.”Gervais had some predictably uncomfortable bits: calling talk show host James Corden a “fat pussy” and a bleeped-out joke about Dame Judi Dench lifting her leg and licking ... something, but saved his most biting words for the industry’s moneymakers. “You say you’re woke but the companies you work for – Apple, Amazon, Disney – if Isis started a streaming service, you would call your agent, wouldn’t you?” he said, referencing Apple TV+’s The Morning Show’s theme of morality, “which is rich coming from a company that runs sweat shops in Asia”.“So if you do win an award tonight, don’t use it as a platform to make a political speech, right?” he continued. “You’re in no position to lecture the public about anything. You know nothing about the real world.”Noting that most people in the room “spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg”, Gervais capped his monologue with a caustic edict to the winners: “If you win, come up, accept your little award, thank your agent and God, and fuck off.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/525e54f9124f67dc168230cff237b7c101815993/0_51_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ffe0510cfa4cb1911b07255ef5692b01","title":"rosanna arquette set to attend harvey weinstein trial","story":"Actor accuses Weinstein of derailing her career after she ‘resisted his advances’The actor Rosanna Arquette, one of Harvey Weinstein’s most prominent accusers, says she plans to attend the trial of the disgraced film producer when it starts in New York on Monday.Arquette will not be giving evidence in the case, but she said she will be there to lend support to the handful of women who have been allowed to give testimony in court of Weinstein’s alleged sexual misconduct and abuse.“I feel very protective,” Arquette said of those due to give evidence. She added: “Whatever happens, it’s still going to be hard for the people that came forward.”Arquette, who appeared in the Weinstein-produced film Pulp Fiction, is close friends with Annabella Sciorra, the Sopranos actor who claims Weinstein raped her in 1993.The alleged incident occurred too long ago to be tried separately, but will be used by prosecutors to support accusations of a pattern of behaviour by Weinstein.The 67-year-old faces two counts of predatory sexual assault, one count of a criminal sexual act in the first degree, one of rape in the first degree and one of rape in the third degree. He denies the charges.Arquette said: “This is a man that is a real predator. He’s destroyed many women’s lives ... We need to keep the focus on this crime, and this case with Harvey Weinstein is huge because so many people are looking at it.”She was one of the first women to come forward in 2017 at the start of the #MeToo movement after New York Times and New Yorker investigations into widespread allegations of sexual abuse and harassment by Weinstein. She accused Weinstein of derailing her career after she resisted his advances, a claim he denies.Arquette is hoping the testimony of Sciorra and others will lead to an eventual conviction against Weinstein, which if successful could result in him being jailed for life.She said Sciorra’s life was “shattered by this experience for many years”.Arquette, who is best known for appearing alongside Madonna in Desperately Seeking Susan, added: “The justice system works in a way ... people can get out of criminal behaviour, and we’re praying that that doesn’t happen and that justice is served.”Rose McGowan, another of Weinstein’s most well known accusers, has decided not to attend the trial fearing it will be too traumatic.She said: “I also have to focus on what’s healthy mentally for me and seeing him is extremely difficult.” McGowan has accused Weinstein of raping her over 20 years ago and destroying her career charges he also denies.Weinstein has denied all wrongdoing and all accusations.McGowan said: “I had body flashbacks for years when I would see and receive photos of him or if I saw him in person, I would lean over and throw up in a trash can and my body remembered, you know, things that my brain wanted to silence.”McGowan said seeing Weinstein face criminal charges “will speak volumes to people in the world that have been hurt. And I hope it gets justice for the women involved. Personally, I have justice. My justice might just look different than that.”She added that if Weinstein is found guilty of even one charge, “it’s a victory, but it’s also a victory to still be standing after all this damn time. It’s also a victory to spread the news to other survivors, that is not our shame. It’s also a victory to basically have him as the face of rape for all time.”On Monday, the judge will outline the schedule for proceedings for a trial that is expected to last up to two months. Jury selection is due to begin later on Monday or Tuesday.The Los Angeles district attorney’s office is considering whether to bring charges in eight separate cases against Weinstein while Scotland Yard continues to investigate allegations of misconduct."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee4c5d603ec0d096adcd1e77a9a74faffc1daa51/0_125_4782_2869/master/4782.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb6a630b81d06207d171399807fda8a1","title":"the full list of golden globes 2020 winners","story":"All the winners of the 77th annual Golden Globes from the world of TV and filmChristian Bale, Ford v FerrariAntonio Banderas, Pain and GloryAdam Driver, Marriage StoryJoaquin Phoenix, Joker – WINNERJonathan Pryce, The Two PopesDolemite is My NameJojo RabbitKnives OutOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood – WINNERRocketmanDaniel Craig, Knives OutRoman Griffin Davis, Jojo RabbitLeonardo DiCaprio, Once Upon a Time in HollywoodTaron Egerton, Rocketman – WINNEREddie Murphy, Dolemite is My NameTom Hanks, A Beautiful Day in the NeighborhoodAnthony Hopkins, The Two PopesAl Pacino, The IrishmanJoe Pesci, The IrishmanBrad Pitt, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood – WINNERKaitlyn Dever, UnbelievableJoey King, The ActHelen Mirren, Catherine the GreatMerritt Wever, UnbelievableMichelle Williams, FosseVerdon – WINNERBong Joon Ho, ParasiteSam Mendes, 1917 – WINNERTodd Phillips, JokerMartin Scorsese, The IrishmanQuentin Tarantino, Once Upon a Time in HollywoodBeautiful Ghosts, CatsI’m Gonna Love Me Again, Rocketman – WINNERInto the Unknown, Frozen IISpirit, The Lion KingStand Up, HarrietFrozen IIHow to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden WorldThe Lion KingMissing Link – WINNERToy Story 4Marriage StoryParasiteThe Two PopesOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood – WINNERThe IrishmanBrian Cox, Succession – WINNERKit Harington, Game of ThronesRami Malek, Mr RobotTobias Menzies, The CrownBilly Porter, PoseThe FarewellLes MisérablesPain and GloryParasite – WINNERPortrait of a Lady on FireChristina Applegate, Dead to MeRachel Brosnahan, The Marvelous Mrs MaiselKirsten Dunst, On Becoming a God in Central FloridaNatasha Lyonne, Russian DollPhoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag – WINNER"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/718e198fcb121dcf2c06c83a3bea5f7eef8455b3/0_185_3690_2214/master/3690.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1e63f7aadee5d36ba38bad5c17a2e91","title":"golden globes 2020 the winners the losers the return of ricky gervais live","story":"Fleabag and 1917 were big winners in a night that saw Ricky Gervais try to offend the Hollywood eliteIt was a rather lacklustre night at the Globes, a shame for a star-packed ceremony that can often be rather loose and fun, despite some wacky choices. There were less alcohol-fuelled antics and although host Ricky Gervais kept promising to set fire to the rich and famous, all he did was throw a wet sparkler.The awards themselves were a mixed bag but one with more treats than tricks with some deserved small screen prizes for Fleabag, Succession and Chernobyl and some pleasing wins for Sam Mendes, Renee Zellweger and Awkwafina on the big screen. Interestingly, one of the biggest contenders of the night, The Irishman, went home empty-handed and its backer Netflix almost did the same, scooping up just two awards from its 34 nominations.By the end the night told or reinforced to us a number of things: being an awards show host remains a thankless task, 1917 is a genuine best picture contender at the Oscars and Michelle Williams gives a more convincing speech than most politicians. For now, it’s over but awards season has just begun. Aaaaand here’s the full news wrap:Here’s another one of the night’s most emotive speeches in case you haven’t yet seen:It’s not just Gervais who critics are faulting but the event itself. Here’s Vanity Fair’s Richard Lawson:“What are the Golden Globes for in 2020? Mostly just a few hours of celebrity gazing, at this point. A stretch of time that, yes, can occasionally swell to something grander, something dimly approaching important, but is otherwise only a starry and distant evening to enjoy—or not—in January, just as the page has turned on another year. Maybe that’s all the show can be right now, for better and worse. Or that’s just complacency talking and the real solution—to the Golden Globes, not the world’s troubles—is to do some kind of radical shakeup next year. To introduce some actually edgy host, to honor a bold and forward-thinking array of nominees, to conjure up a sense that all the glitz has a real cultural sum to it. I’ll toast to that possibility, even if it means I’m lame for caring.”Here’s a look back at some of the most notable outfits on the red carpet:Here’s that Michelle Williams speech that you’ll all be reading about tomorrow:While Netflix went into the night with the most nominations, on the small screen side it was HBO who came out on top with four wins and, importantly for the network long-term, none of them were for Game of Thrones.For the New York Times, James Poniewozik had the following to say about Gervais:“Gervais himself doesn’t care about the Globes so much that he was hosting them for the fifth time. He and everyone knew why he was there: to administer Hollywood a mostly consensual lashing, to be the Nihilist-in-Chief, the guy who doesn’t care what anyone thinks. He had a joke about Felicity Huffman’s jail sentence in a college-admissions scandal, and a heavily censored one imagining Judi Dench, of “Cats,” grooming herself in, er, a feline manner.It was sometimes uncomfortable, but not especially daring.”A cursory look of Film Twitter and some early reviews might suggest that Ricky Gervais was a flop host tonight but not if you look much further to the right.Controversial former NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch tweeted that he was “the ballsiest host ever”. Breitbart reporter Alana Mastrangelo tweeted that he’s “the only one who deserves an award tonight”. Ben Shapiro called it “the BEST THING EVER”. Candace Owens praised him as “a celebrity with the balls to clue Hollywood in on the painstakingly obvious truth that we DO NOT CARE WHAT THEY THINK”. So congrats to Ricky.Yeah about those Joaquin F-bombs that were removed from the almost live broadcast earlier. Here they are! “To my fellow nominees, we all know there’s no fucking competition between us” “There is no fucking best actor”“Contrary to popular belief, I don’t want to rock the boat. But the boat is fucking rocked” Full video on its wayAnd here’s how it all began with what’s allegedly, hopefully the last ever Ricky Gervais Globes opening monologue:This is an important and deeply embarrassing question:It’s been a night as long as an Irishman so in case you need to go back and check who won what then here’s a handy list:Another first of the night: Awkwafina has become the first Asian-American woman to win the Golden Globe for best actress in a comedy filmSad but true but also amazing"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1019d9c3a88c28b360f17640d526c53d972841b/123_135_2555_1533/master/2555.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e1a3f20fb66ef4cbf56a2412249f74e","title":"chelsea reading womens super league match report","story":"Sam Kerr’s all-action Chelsea debut yielded everything but a goal as Emma Hayes’s side came from behind at home to Reading.“It was pretty high-paced,” said the forward of her introduction to the Women’s Super League just over a week after landing in London. “I’ve been a bit rusty coming back from a break but I always want to start.”The Australian provided her first assist in a Chelsea shirt, for Beth England, and was responsible for Reading’s reduction in their numbers after Grace Moloney was shown red for taking out the NWSL and W-League record goalscorer. Second-half goals from Guro Reiten and the substitute Erin Cuthbert ensured the Blues keep pace in the title race after Fara Williams had given Reading an early lead.After the game Kerr highlighted the devastating bushfires ravaging her home country. “It has been really tough. You feel quite helpless over here. Hopefully it can gain the media coverage it deserves like other natural disasters,” she said. “It is really sad and tough but hopefully everyone at home has had some rain overnight and it gets better.”Hayes was keen to praise the attitude of her recruit. “She’s a doll,” she said in her best faux-Aussie voice. “She’s humble, hardworking, honest, thoughtful. An unbelievable team player, she cares about what the team think of her and she will work and do her job for the team at any point. You have top players but to have a top player who is a top person? Happy days.”Ebony Salmon punished her former club Manchester United as Bristol City earned their first league win of the season. The 18-year-old’s run from the left was followed by a finish past Mary Earps to lift City off the foot of the table. Liverpool replace them after losing 1-0 at Brighton,\u0026nbspAileen Whelan the scorer. Arsenal maintained their three-point lead at the top – Kim Little’s header and a half-volley from Jordan Nobbs sealing a 2-0 win over Birmingham. Manchester City stayed one point ahead of Chelsea with a 4-1 win over Tottenham. Two goals from Pauline Bremer and one each from Ellen White and Lauren Hemp cancelled out Rianna Dean\u0027s penalty.\u0026nbspIt took only two minutes for Kerr to find herself clean through and yet, having taken a touch to set herself up, the prolific striker skied her shot over the bar. New club nerves perhaps? “I was nervous,” said Kerr, grinning, who has an ability to peel off the shoulder of defenders like no other. “It was my first one on one in a few months. I haven’t been playing much so I was nervous. But it will come, get the jitters out and it’s only my first game. I can go from here.”Talk before her arrival about whether the in-form England would lose out was quickly fast answered when the pair were handed starting berths alongside each other in a 4-1-3-2 designed to get the best out of both. “Two years ago,” joked Hayes when asked when she had decided to start Kerr.And it was the new strike partnership that would find the equaliser after Williams’ opener. “Oh what a backheel,” purred Hayes, of the pass to England, who then rounded the stand-in goalkeeper Rachael Laws to score. “It’s exciting to see the pair of them together and I’m sure they’re happy to get the first one out the way.”The celebrations from the forward looked full of the relief of a player who has had to field and dodge questions about the threat of Kerr to her own position since the latter’s signing was announced in November. “It’s nice playing with Beth,” said Kerr. “I feel like we’ve just connected really quickly. She’s a quality player and hopefully she can keep scoring because we need her.”What one of the hottest forward lines in the league could not hide though is a defensive fragility.One minute after Williams had swept low past Ann-Katrin Berger, Kerr sprung to life up the other end. Catching some hesitation between Jo Potter and her goalkeeper, Moloney, the forward swept across the edge of the box, nicking the ball ahead of the keeper, who clattered into her and handled the ball outside the box at the same time, earning a red card.In the second half an excellent Laws was helpless as, after blocking a Kerr effort with her legs, the ball looped to the feet of Reiten on the edge of the box and her side-footed volley flew over her into an otherwise unguarded net.Chelsea extended their lead with 15 minutes to play, Jonna Andersson flying down the left and volleying a cross on to the head of England. Laws did well to keep the shot out but Cuthbert was first to the loose ball to kill the game."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/005594ed35c873444f24631f84c8c0a8fdd4f2af/0_110_2856_1714/master/2856.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74226dabcfb79a9b0adcf71843a9738f","title":"liverpool curtis jones winner everton fa cup jurgen klopp","story":"• Eighteen-year-old hits stunning goal from outside the box• Jürgen Klopp hails ‘very confident, unbelievable’ playerCurtis Jones said his stunning winner for Liverpool against Everton at Anfield in the FA Cup was beyond his wildest dreams as Jürgen Klopp savoured the triumph of a line-up packed with inexperienced players. Jones struck with a curler into the top corner from outside the area in the 71st minute to give Liverpool a 1-0 win – it was the 18-year-old’s first senior goal – and he admitted that it was overwhelming.“I dream of a lot of things but this one was ahead of a dream,” Jones said. “I can’t sum up my emotions. There are world-class players all over this team but I think I went out and showed what I could do. The ball came to me and I only had one thing in mind – to shoot. It’s massive for me and the rest of the young boys. At times it’s frustrating thinking you might get a chance but then having to sit on the bench and watch.”Klopp was annoyed to lose one of the few established players he used – James Milner – to a hamstring injury but he described the rest of the occasion as “absolutely perfect.” He added: “It’s very important we give the boys this opportunity. I tell them in training that it’s important not all of them, in their first impulse, go out on loan. There is something to learn here, as well. We saw these boys come closer and closer to being ready to play for us.”A full-strength Everton team missed chances in the first half and were dreadful after the break. “It was not good,” Carlo Ancelotti, the manager, said. “I will speak with them and tell them that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f10cf1cfb84690ecf9c403b484ae0f51b445b49/119_113_2926_1756/master/2926.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fcfcb096155a9c11552d9f09dfefd283","title":"mario balotelli accuses lazio fans racism","story":"Mario Balotelli criticised Lazio fans after offensive chants towards the striker caused play to be briefly stopped on Sunday.Balotelli gave Brescia the lead after 18 minutes but the game was held up while an announcement was made that reportedly warned against further discriminatory chanting.After the 2-1 defeat Balotelli posted on Instagram: “It’s a loss that hurt but we will come back stronger and we are on the right way!

Every few years the PlayStation 3 evolves, with seamless inevitability, into the PlayStation 4, and so on, each numerical tick of the counter promising fertile turf from which previously inconceivable video game miracles will sprout. This year will mark the next round of the so-called console wars, as Sony’s PlayStation 5 competes with Microsoft’s Xbox Series X (destined to be confused by bewildered grandparents with the current Xbox One X). Like Blur v Oasis, or Star Wars v Star Trek, the true beneficiaries of this kind of tribalistic framing of capitalist enterprise will, surely, be the companies behind the products. As in the past, the rival machines will likely be equivalently powerful and share many of the same games.As in the film industry, in 2020 video game companies continue to invest the majority of effort and expense to provide old, nostalgia-commanding games with a lick of digital paint. Chief among the renovations is Final Fantasy VII Remake, a vastly expensive project to rebuild the dearly beloved, eco-terrorism-themed 1997 adventure game for modern audiences. Final Fantasy VII is, to a generation of ageing millennial video game nerds, a cultural monolith that, like Star Wars before it, continues to cast a long and consuming shadow over entire identities. So great is the task at hand that the publisher has split the remake into a series of chapters, to be released in stages. How and when the project ends will, no doubt, depend on the success or failure of the opening gambit.Those eager to return to the virtual worlds of their younger days will be similarly delighted by Half-Life: Alyx. It may not be quite the homecoming to City 17 that Half-Life’s faith-keeping fans have clamoured for since 2004, when the last mainline entry to the series was released, but, as a fully featured and exquisitely lavish virtual reality game, this may be a more interesting prospect. You’ll just need a PC of climate-change-quickening-power in order to run the thing.This year will not only see eager returns to dusty franchises. Cyberpunk 2077, a Blade Runner-esque role-playing game starring a digital Keanu Reeves, is the standout attraction of the year. Made by CD Projekt Red, the well-regarded Polish studio behind The Witcher series (an adaptation of which launched on Netflix in December), expect a slickly finished game that allows its players to pick a unique way through the humming city, according to inidual whim or character. Regardless of your chosen approach, however, expect a certain baseline of bespattered violence. So, too, in The Last of Us: Part II, the next game from Sony’s cinematically minded, multi-Bafta-winning studio Naughty Dog. Here you’ll play as 19-year-old Ellie, a likable, if troubled teenager who, having survived the various traumas of the first game, must now contend with a death cult operating in a post-apocalyptic United States.If all this sounds too stressful in a world that feels, so often, as if it’s spiralling towards a similar bloody endgame, Microsoft Flight Simulator will offer serene pleasures as you yoke and yaw your way through unblemished skies. Or, if you prefer to conjure your own escapism, Dreams, from the British studio and LittleBigPlanet series creator Media Molecule, provides all of the creative tools required to fashion a soothing reality of your own.If that sounds like too much effort, opt for the long-delayed Animal Crossing: New Horizons, which will allow you to retreat to a virtual village and live out your days in harmony (or passive aggressive co-dependency: no judgment here) with a community of jabbering animals, while you pay off your mortgage via pastoral errands.

Repeated licking can remove the oily surface film that protects the lips from losing moisture, leading to lips cracking. The digestive enzymes in saliva can also irritate the lips.”“You want a lip balm that has emollient properties, smoothing the surface of the skin and acting as an occlusive agent, locking in moisture,” says the cosmetic dermatologist Sam Bunting. “I like lanolin and petroleum, which do both. If you are skiing or hitting the beach this winter, you’ll want the addition of SPF, as lips burn easily.” Reapply lip balm every few hours and before bed, “as many of us with colds will mouth-breathe during sleep, which is very drying”.“Lip balms can sometimes contain ingredients such as camphor and menthol, which create a pleasant, tingly ‘active’ sensation when applied,” says Bunting. “But they can irritate, leading to lips, paradoxically, getting drier with use, so I don’t recommend them. And if you use actives-based skincare, such as retinol, be sure to barrier off the lips with lip balm before applying it at night to avoid flaky, irritated lips.” Some lipsticks can also be drying.“Don’t confuse a recurring cold sore with chapped lips. And don’t ignore a non-healing scab – lips are a common site for skin cancer so get your GP to refer you to a dermatologist for further assessment,” recommends Bunting. If your lips do become dry and chapped, Glass explains they “can be effectively treated by gentle exfoliation to ensure you are removing any dry, flaky skin from the surface and regularly moisturising with a good quality lip balm or moisturiser”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/989f975fc28a6463f723dcb86c69176aef532ab3/0_206_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=461cf342f51d86e3cd3d281707c8db35","title":"most affordable commuter towns five uk cities revealed","story":"Property website Zoopla ranks Grays in Essex as best-value location within hour of LondonThe most affordable towns for people commuting into London, Bristol, Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh have been revealed.With rail fares rising for many commuters, the property website Zoopla combined season ticket and mortgage costs to work out the best-value locations for those looking to live within an hour’s travel time of the five cities.Grays in Essex topped the list for London with a combined annual cost of £15,008 for a mortgage and season ticket, ahead of Leagrave in Bedfordshire (£15,399).Elsewhere, Wolverhampton (£7,483) was the most affordable option for Birmingham, with Cannock second (£7,933).

Around 2.5m were considered professional or senior jobs, and were mostly taken by older, more experienced workers, while about 500,000 were classified as low-skilled.“What we’re seeing now is particularly concerning as employers are normally over optimistic at this time of the year. As we move through the recruitment season they typically recruit less than they had anticipated.”Isherwood said: “Outside the public sector the market is not looking particularly healthy. Government needs to get the economy moving otherwise this year we’ll be in for a stagnant graduate labour market at best. If the government want to see further growth in the apprentice market, they need to address employer concerns about how the apprentice levy works.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfbdd988b599d9f52d14437cfe81ef89ecf7e111/0_0_5760_3840/master/5760.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3978e2a4fc9d410e5a3e64b9cc374d8 660w","title":"our readers reveal how theyll have their last fling with the eu","story":"As our rights in Europe are set to be curtailed, Britons tell of plans on the continent from Interrail trips to learning GermanBritish citizens will no longer be EU citizens from 31 January if the withdrawal agreement Boris Johnson sealed in October is ratified.But Brexit day will not be the full stop on almost three decades in which British people, like their counterparts across the EU, had the freedom to travel, work and retire in any other member states visa-free.Those rights are scheduled to end on 31 December, when the transition period expires, freedom of movement ends and Britain leaves the single market.We asked readers what they would like to do in the last 11 months in which these benefits of EU membership apply.Plan: Take as many trees as I can to the DordogneAfter Brexit, I’ll almost certainly need a phytosanitary certificate for each species of tree.

So I’ll take as many trees as I can, and from next year on I’ll have to change the way I work, to try to propagate my trees in France, which will be tricky, as I’m not there all the time.I might have to dig a large pond and grow my tree seedlings on rafts, hydroponically, so they’ll be protected from slugs, mice, deer, boar and rabbits.

Please note that research has shown there to be other options at much lower price points, but they have not been considered by the provider.I think I will also invest some of my time investigating the possibility of remaining an EU dual national by descent as my mum’s family are Irish immigrants, but it’s OK because she voted Tory as she says, “We have too many immigrants in this country.”I might also look for a new, less xenophobic family.I am living and still working with metastatic lung cancer. I cannot get affordable travel insurance. After we leave the UK I will be unable to visit Europe again, which is especially bad because I plan to retire next year.I am devastated that within a year’s time I’ll cease to be an EU citizen, but I intend to make the most of it. Once I graduate I plan to embark on a few weeks interrailing through most of northern and central Europe I’m going to visit cities across Germany, Austria, Hungary and Switzerland and develop my German language skills. Other than that, I’ll try to visit as many of my EU friends whom are dotted across Europe whilst it is still practical to do so.IT finance and riskPlan: Move to an EU state with accelerated route to citizenship for skilled workersI am going to move to one of the smaller EU27 countries that has an accelerated route to citizenship for highly qualified or skilled workers. Several of the eastern EU countries have this – Slovenia, Latvia, Estonia, for example.I have enough in the bank to afford to support myself in such a move, to set up a start-up or work for a firm over there.Whichever country I settle in, I intend to have a sideline recruiting highly skilled finance \u0026amp IT workers who are also looking for a quick route to EU citizenship.

I think it’s a great shame because I have lived, worked and studied in three other countries already at the age of 21, all without hassle due to freedom of movement. Boris’ intentions for Britain scare me and I feel no option but to leave the UK to secure a better future for myself.Plan: Get Irish citizenship (even though I have no Irish family connection)I shall be applying for Irish citizenship so I can retain all my rights as a European that have been taken away without so much as a please by the nut Brexiteers.Having lived here for nearly 20 years, it shouldn’t be a problem but, as someone with no familial Irish connection, it’s going to cost over €4,000 for the four of us in my family.However, it will be well worth it not to have to be part of the dysfunctional UK.

We live in a society whose dominant narratives, of human centrality on the Earth, social and technological progress, endless growth,the primacy of the inidual … these stories no longer have any basis in reality, and no longer equip us to deal with the political and ecological challenges of the new century.Thus, the next challenge, the most pertinent and urgent, must be to reinvent our cultural narratives to reflect our new situation. In the Netherlands we still have some hope that we can avoid our government being taken over by corporate-sponsored ethnic nationalists.To my fellow British-Europeans: I’m sorry for how things worked out for you. Don’t give up, but reevaluate, because a narrative which claims our current economic and political institutions can continue with minor progressive-oriented adjustments is no longer convincing, and will become less so as ecological and social disasters occur with ever greater frequency.Plan: get funding for an Erasmus period of study elsewhere in the EUI would like to pursue a postgraduate degree abroad, somewhere that is cheaper than in the UK.

I have carried out more reading on this one subject over the past four years than on any one single subject and therefore feel I take a balanced view.

At times watching him bat can be mind-numbingly dull. So imagine what it must have been like for South Africa’s bowlers as he ground his way to a maiden Test half-century in Cape Town.Sibley will not win many points for artistic merit. But if he can kick on from this breakthrough innings – which could yet become a century after he finished the day unbeaten on 85 – he might win plenty of Test matches for England.In 2004 his father, Mark, left the England \u0026amp Wales Cricket Board after a year as their commercial director. If this performance is a sign of things to come, Sibley junior will surely stay in the employ of the ECB for far longer than that.Whatever your stylistic critique on the 24-year-old, after years of top-order instability Sibley, who we should remember is playing only his fourth Test, is exactly what England need. Indeed, his innings on day three at Newlands went a long way to helping Joe Root’s team take complete control of this second Test.A first-innings lead of 46 was significant. But only if the batsmen could back up the hard work of the bowlers. Even though he was glacially slow, Sibley scoring just three off his first 30 deliveries and taking 50 overs to reach his half-century, he provided the platform for others to play around him. It is exactly the kind of approach that this team, who for so long have seemingly struggled to get out of white-ball mode in Test cricket, have been craving. Less style, more substance and an ability to do the dirty work that wins matches.By the close, with England 218 for four and leading by 264, only one result appears possible here – a first overseas Test victory in 11 months for Root’s team. That would not only be significant for England but also for Sibley, a player who has reinvented himself since moving from Surrey to Warwickshire late in the summer of 2017.His call-up for the tour of New Zealand earlier this winter followed a summer when he was the leading run-scorer in Division One of the County Championship, scoring five centuries along the way, including two doubles. Tellingly, it was not just the volume of runs Sibley amassed but the way he got them – facing 1,009 more balls than any other batsmen in the top tier of the Championship.A strike-rate of 41.6 in first-class cricket – by comparison, Alastair Cook’s is 50.7 – has raised concerns about whether Sibley has the game to truly prosper at Test level. Yet his second innings in this match has shown he certainly has the mental fortitude.Speaking before his Test debut against New Zealand at Mount Maunganui in November, Sibley spoke about his approach, saying: “Opening the batting is tough at the start so you’ve got to face balls for it to get easier. It’s something that I sort of try to build my game round – to play to my strengths, get through the new ball and cash in when it gets easier for that.”That’s something Sibley did here as he upped his scoring rate in the final session, with one shot – punching Kagiso Rabada through the covers for four to move on to 48 – particularly eye-catching.Such shots would not have been possible for Sibley during the end of his time at Surrey, when his form fell off a cliff. But work with the freelance batting coach Gary Palmer, who has also helped Cook and Ian Bell, led him to remodel his technique and the runs have since flowed.A more open stance, to prevent him from falling towards the off-side, and hitting straighter has helped unlock the potential that was evident in 2013 when Sibley, aged 18 and 21 days, become the second-youngest English player, behind only WG Grace, to hit a first-class double hundred.That high point against Yorkshire was followed by a trough, as so often happens with young players. Yet Sibley’s time at Surrey was hugely beneficial given that as a teenager he shared a dressing room with Ricky Ponting and Graeme Smith, now South Africa’s acting director of cricket.Both were generous with their time and knowledge to the young Sibley and allied to that reworking of his technique in recent years, he is reaping the benefits on the biggest stage of all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f372bf8b322fde7b53e7b6605eaf223ed81e9e7a/46_37_3421_2053/master/3421.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e809900bcc0f48a9c466a5340786ebe","title":"london irish exeter premiership match report rugby","story":"• London Irish 28-45 Exeter• Leaders make light of two yellow cardsEddie Jones was in the stands to watch this frequently manic contest as he ponders his England Six Nations squad to be named in a fortnight’s time. Quite how much it informs his thinking will soon become clear but for the most part it was an afternoon that underlined just how difficult it is for players and coaches to achieve real consistency in a domestic season with five and a half months still to run.A week ago Exeter came close to rendering a full-strength Saracens scoreless here they conceded 28 points, had two men sent to the sin-bin and were briefly in danger of wobbling. In the final analysis, though, they still scored six tries to four to kick off what they hope will be a momentous year with a thumping bonus-point victory that maintains their top spot on the Premiership ladder.On Saturday they are due in Glasgow for another must-win European pool game and will be tough to subdue at Scotstoun if they can reproduce their purple patch of form either side of half-time when they shattered Irish with four tries in the space of 10 minutes. The pick of the bunch was a spectacular 40-metre dash down the right touchline from the fit-again Ollie Devoto, potentially the kind of midfield wildcard who might just interest Jones in the absence of the recuperating Henry Slade, with his straight-running centre partner, Sam Hill, also collecting two tries.England’s head coach will also have noted the impressive energy of Sam Simmonds at No 8 and the continuing fine form of hooker Luke Cowan-Dickie, surely already certain of Six Nations selection. When the latter was replaced the Chiefs were 35-7 ahead and cruising even without the suspended Harry Williams, the rested Jonny Hill and the injured Tomas Francis, Jack Yeandle and Sam Skinner, Chiefs still have no shortage of forward muscle to spare.In the circumstances 10th-placed Irish will not be entirely displeased with a try bonus point, given their injury problems and the poverty of their previous home display against Bath. That said, the first-half departure of their giant Australian lock Adam Coleman was another untimely blow and it would be pushing it to say the home crowd are currently acting as an all-important 16th man as the club seek to avoid an immediate return to the Championship.At times in the first half it was almost eerily quiet, as if the Exiles’ supporters had already mentally decamped to next season’s new home in Brentford ahead of schedule. It was certainly a far cry from the highly charged atmosphere at Sandy Park a week ago and, initially at least, the quality of the opposition facing the league leaders was also a notch or two down, with the Ireland internationals Paddy Jackson and Sean O’Brien still sidelined by injury and Waisake Naholo on paternity leave.The only pre-interval joy for the Exiles was a try for their new Samoa wing Belgium Tuatagaloa but they could have fielded an entire team of European all-stars and still struggled to contain the remorseless Exeter machine once the visitors had located their bearings.Four first-half tries, with skipper Dave Dennis and Cowan-Dickie also on the scoresheet, summed up a largely one-sided half and a seriously messy scoreline looked possible when Hill carved straight through a large hole past Stephen Myler to extend Exeter’s lead to 28 points.The odds on the next two tries being scored by men in green jerseys felt remote, only for the powerful Albert Tuisue to barge over from close range and Ollie Hassell-Collins to score a brilliant weaving inidual try, leaving a string of would-be tacklers clutching the hyphen.Suddenly Irish were back within two scores, only for Stu Townsend, finally back from a serious knee injury, to finish off good approach work from the tireless Simmonds and Hill.It was just as well he did, with Olly Woodburn and Devoto despatched to the bin for deliberate knock-downs within two minutes of each other.Only when the 13-man Chiefs somehow won a penalty in front of Irish’s posts, allowing Gareth Steenson to add a relieving penalty to his perfect haul of six conversions, was order finally restored.

Tendulkar this week joined the chorus of calls against the move, which is set to be discussed by the ICC cricket committee this year for 2023 and beyond.Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting has also voiced his disapproval, echoing the sentiments of current players including Tim Paine, Josh Hazlewood, Nathan Lyon, India skipper Virat Kohli, and New Zealand quick Neil Wagner.Cricket officials from Australia and England are interested in investigating the idea - believing it can free up the calendar and create more positive play in red-ball matches. But Tendulkar told the Mumbai Mirror the loss of a day could adversely affect spinners.“Spinners look forward to bowling with the scruffed ball, taking advantage on day five of the roughs created on the wickets,” Tendulkar said. “All that is part of Test cricket. Is it fair to take that advantage away from spinners? There is T20, there is one-dayers and then there are T10 and 100-ball cricket. Test is the purest form of cricket. It should not be tinkered with.”Tendulkar also pleaded with his former teammate Anil Kumble to consider his own history as a spinner in his role as chairman of the ICC Cricket Committee. His comments came as Ponting also flatly rejected a reduction to four days, having been part of the MCC World Cricket Committee that voted against the proposal three years ago.“I’m against it but I’d like to hear from the people who are pushing it what the major reason is,” Ponting told cricket.au. “I know we’ve had a lot of four-day games the last couple of years but what I’ve noticed in the last decade is how many drawn Test matches there have been. I just wonder if they had have been all four-day Test matches through that period of time would we have had more drawn games?”Mark Taylor and Shane Warne are among former players who have supported the change. The ICC approved a trial of the concept in 2017, with South Africa, Zimbabwe, England and Ireland all taking part in four-day games since then. There is a possibility next summer’s Test between Australia and Afghanistan could be scheduled as a four-day match."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83fd147a5c7a5d76ba5896ee9146f0f09fade2bb/0_120_2793_1676/master/2793.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc74cbc7124e0235ab3dd61fd6301d50","title":"australia v new zealand third test day four live","story":"45th over: New Zealand 127-6 (Watling 17, Astle 17) Enough of Marnus Labuschagne’s legspin, time for Mitchell Starc to blow New Zealand’s tail away. Not this over. After Watling rotates strike Astle is equal to the paceman’s late reverse swing, drilling a couple of twos into the off-side for good measure. Both New Zealanders are now on the same score, Watling from 99 deliveries, Astle 15.Joe Harman has emailed a suggestion for what to do tomorrow. “Assuming that NZ are still batting at the close of play (a big and not necessarily valid assumption) perhaps they should declare and concede the inevitable defeat AND use tomorrow (the ground’s booked after all) for a bushfire fundraising one day game-grab something positive out of this debacle.” 44th over: New Zealand 122-6 (Watling 16, Astle 13) Astle, apparently oblivious to de Grandhomme’s dismissal, tries to loft Lyon over the infield and gets perilously close to gifting mid-on a catch. Astle, apparently oblivious to his near miss to ball three repeats the shot two deliveries later, this time skewing awkwardly towards midwicket. 43rd over: New Zealand 118-6 (Watling 16, Astle 9) Astle gets off the mark with a four swept out of the rough. Labuschagne almost exacts immediate revenge with a fizzing legspinner that whistles past the outside edge of the bat and the top of off stump. He follows that up with the full toss that Astle dispatches into the deep. The momentum is all with New Zealand at the moment. Australia are trying all sorts to force a breakthrough, Lyon bowling wide of off stump this over to induce a drive, but when he does CdG slaps him over extra cover for six!And then he’s out. It’s a fine line between counterattacking and reckless, and chipping Lyon to one of three men stationed around cow corner immediately after hitting a six is probably the latter. Maybe we’ll be all over today after all? 41st over: New Zealand 100-5 (Watling 13, de Grandhomme 46) Labuschagne is getting through the crease with plenty of energy and he’s tempting New Zealand into a mishit drive, but both Watling and CdG are secure in their strokeplay. 40th over: New Zealand 97-5 (Watling 11, de Grandhomme 45) Lyon tempts CdG into a loose drive but any frustration the New Zealander may have felt following his streaky inside edge is released with a misfield allowing him to jog to the non-striker’s end. Watling then drops anchor. 39th over: New Zealand 92-5 (Watling 10, de Grandhomme 44) The pattern is becoming predictable as we head towards the conclusion of play. CdG gets off strike early before Watling defends patiently. Labuschagne is unable to generate a false stroke from his latest over. 38th over: New Zealand 90-5 (Watling 9, de Grandhomme 43) New Zealand deal comfortably with Lyon’s latest over. CdG’s scoring rate is now a brisk 75, Watling’s a watchful 11. 37th over: New Zealand 89-5 (Watling 9, de Grandhomme 42) It is spin from both ends, and the strategy almost works when Labuschagne rips one past CdG’s wafty cover drive. Still no breakthrough though and this partnership passes 50. Just under an hour left in the day. 36th over: New Zealand 88-5 (Watling 9, de Grandhomme 41) Labuschagne’s spell lasts just one over as Lyon is recalled. CdG scuffs around for three deliveries before lofting a delivery that turns, on the up, over mid-on for four. You fancy appealing to de Grandhomme’s ego might be Australia’s best plan of attack right now, perhaps with spin from both ends?35th over: New Zealand 83-5 (Watling 9, de Grandhomme 36) Cummins is doing his best to force a breakthrough but there’s little happening for him out there now and he’s preying on a mistake from one of these two set batsmen. None is forthcoming this over. 34th over: New Zealand 80-5 (Watling 7, de Grandhomme 35) Tim Paine does go to Marnus Labuschagne - a change I like - and it almost pays idends when CdG tries to drive over the top but succeeds only in finding a leading edge that drops just short of the sweeper coming in from the point boundary. De Grandhomme is playing his shots now, whipping Labuschagne to the on-side despite the ball turning towards off and barely bouncing above ankle height. 33rd over: New Zealand 77-5 (Watling 6, de Grandhomme 33) CdG moves into the 30s with two swings of the bat in the general direction of the covers. The first almost results in a chance for a ing Matthew Wade, the second is a thumping boundary. He follows that by picking up Cummins’ length out of the bowler’s hand and whipping him dismissively to midwicket for two more. Zero footwork from de Grandhomme, but he has a great eye and fast powerful hands. 32nd over: New Zealand 68-5 (Watling 6, de Grandhomme 24) Now the ball has softened, the batsmen have their eyes in, and the pitch has settled down again following its early rollings, things have all become a touch attritional again. New Zealand keep Australia waiting through Pattinson’s latest over. Perhaps time for Labuschagne to mix things up. 31st over: New Zealand 65-5 (Watling 4, de Grandhomme 23) Cummins isn’t out of the attack for long and when he returns he almost has Watling playing on a short delivery outside his off stump. This partnership is starting to reach awkward territory for Australia now, it’s lasted 12 overs, and with just 21 overs left in the afternoon a fifth day is looming large. Last orders for Russell’s auction...30th over: New Zealand 63-5 (Watling 3, de Grandhomme 22) Nathan Lyon’s ten-over spell is ended by James Pattinson’s recall into the attack. He backs up Starc’s maiden with one of his own, and looks threatening with some late reverse swing tailing into the right-handed de Grandhomme.29th over: New Zealand 63-5 (Watling 3, de Grandhomme 22) Watling keeps out a full, swinging, probing maiden from Starc.“Good afternoon Jonathan,” good afternoon Lee Henderson. “Couldn’t help but notice S.MacGill’s name up there on the SCG Honours board in your Twitter link. We’re sitting here wondering just what his eventual tally might have been if he hadn’t clashed with the Warne era. He certainly didn’t have the chutzpah of Warnie but by crikey the boy could spin a ball couldn’t he.” A remarkable stroke of misfortune that the second best Australian leg-spinner of the modern era would arrive during the career of the very best. 44 Tests, 208 wickets at 29. In any other era he would have ended with eye-watering numbers. 28th over: New Zealand 63-5 (Watling 3, de Grandhomme 22) Lyon’s getting plenty of turn but there’s less variation for him than earlier, allowing New Zealand to formulate plans. CdG’s involves plodding his front leg down the pitch and hitting through the line over mid-off. He does so twice to good effect to leave Tim Paine scratching his chin. 27th over: New Zealand 54-5 (Watling 2, de Grandhomme 14) CdG has shown more than once this series he’s here for a good time, not a long time. He plays a few more loose strokes during the latest Starc over and it is a mystery how he is not dismissed. One in particular was too good, angling in from around the wicket then seaming away from the outside edge and the off stump. Mesmerising delivery. To compound Starc’s frustration CdG jams his bat on a yorker from the final ball of the over and collects four runs down to third-man. There is no justice. 26th over: New Zealand 50-5 (Watling 2, de Grandhomme 10) Ricky Ponting is ropable with CdG for playing a series of uppish strokes into the on-side. The batsman survives though, and advances his score with two twos and a single. There’s the suggestion a few spots of rain could be falling in the vicinity of the SCG and those clouds are not just grey with bushfire smoke. Could day five be required after all?25th over: New Zealand 45-5 (Watling 2, de Grandhomme 5) Time for another burst from Mitchell Starc, and he almost immediately does for CdG who leaves a delivery that misses his off stump by the width of a huntsman spider’s furry leg. He then induces an reflexive outside edge from Watling with a rare delivery that spat off this docile surface. It is a gloomy afternoon now in Sydney with ash-laden clouds turning the sky into a scene from a Harry Potter movie when the dementors begin to circle. The floodlights are now in full effect. 24th over: New Zealand 44-5 (Watling 2, de Grandhomme 5) A rapid maiden from Lyon to the obdurate Watling. 23rd over: New Zealand 44-5 (Watling 2, de Grandhomme 5) Excellent straight drive from CdG for three before Watling doubles his score.Apropos of nothing, here’s Bjork.22nd over: New Zealand 40-5 (Watling 1, de Grandhomme 2) CdG gets away from the danger end swiftly, inviting Watling to see off the bulk of another probing over from Nathan Lyon. Watling has been around for 34 balls for his one run. 21st over: New Zealand 39-5 (Watling 1, de Grandhomme 1) Cummins is bowling beautifully right now, teasing the inside and outside edges of the bats of both Watling and CdG. It is a joy to watch a fast bowler with this level of control. Eloise Wright gives some context to charges consecutive one-sided series have led to a boring summer. “Yes, I’m always kind of annoyed when every test (not to say series) in an Australian summer seems to be a foregone conclusion,” she emails. “You would think I’d be used to it, having grown up watching the late 90s-early 00s teams, but I still find it pretty boring. Having said that, I’m finding myself less irritated this year than in summers past. For one thing, the northern summer was so crammed full of excitement there was bound to be a comedown. For another, with everything else going on at the moment, a little light boredom seems like just the ticket. I was at the SCG on Saturday and there seemed to be quite a few fire-impacted people around the ground. Personally, I was glad to get my parents out of the Blue Mountains on a danger day. I also overheard one firey telling a mate about their experience on NYE - after that, I imagine excitement at the cricket not required!”20th over: New Zealand 38-5 (Watling 1, de Grandhomme 0) Watling repels an over of sharply spinning Lyon offies. 19th over: New Zealand 38-5 (Watling 1, de Grandhomme 0) Still time in the over for Cummins to whistle one beyond de Grandhomme’s outside edge. This is an impressive, hungry, remorseless, relentless, highly skilled bowling unit. Ah yes, how could we forget!Maybe he was still digesting his national record? Maybe he was dewy-eyed like Bradman at the Oval? Either way, Ross Taylor has just been cleaned up by a Pat Cummins beauty. Angled in from over the wicket Taylor played inside the line leaving his off stump swaying like a drunk at closing time. 18th over: New Zealand 38-4 (Taylor 22, Watling 1) A nice round of applause from the SCG, and Australian players, in honour of Taylor’s milestone. He and Watling both look to have their plans to Lyon, and they’re taking the game to the spinner, not just allowing him to dominate. A milestone for New Zealand in a wretched tour with Ross Taylor lofting Nathan Lyon for three over mid-on to overtake Stephen Fleming as his country’s most prolific batsman in Test cricket. 17th over: New Zealand 33-4 (Taylor 17, Watling 1) Cummins shares duties with Lyon after the resumption and he is predictably parsimonious. “My two young children are currently taking it in turns to be sick through the night thanks to the dreaded norovirus,” emails Martyn Beeston. “I’ve currently got as much chance of seeing out the rest of the night in peace as New Zealand have of making it to 120. Only saving grace is that I thought the next Ashes series was due this year (which started making me feel queasy). What chance do you think we (Eng) have in 2122?”Slim to none Martyn, slim to none. Australia’s young and complete bowling attack on home soil will simply be too good for England’s fragile batting - as things stand. Then you have Warner, Smith and Labuschagne, the three batsmen in Australian conditions in a composite XI. A lot can change in a couple of years though. Root and Stokes could blossom with the bat, Archer could change the dynamic with the ball. But I’d be expecting 5-0 or thereabouts.16th over: New Zealand 33-4 (Taylor 17, Watling 1) Taylor and Watling both work singles from Nathan Lyon’s first over after tea before the former accepts a long half-volley outside stump, thwacking four over mid-off. Taylor is now just three runs shy of becoming the all-time leading run-scorer for New Zealand in Tests. The players are back out after tea. Will this be the final session of the series? 37 overs on offer for Australia to get on the Sydney Monday night circuit.It’ll get better Stephen, I promise.In response to the query about the most changes between Tests, England’s atrocious 1989 Ashes has been recalled. It was where my mind first went also, but I can’t grab exactly what the numerical differences between line-ups were per Test. 29 players over six Tests is extraordinary though. Jack Faine has emailed in a question for the OBO hive mind. “I am just wondering if New Zealand’s mid-series change of five players is unprecedented in Test cricket? I can recall a number of occasions where three changes have been made to sides, but I cannot recall any time that even four, let alone five (!) changes have been made to a side between Test matches in the same series. Would be interesting to know.” Australia are steamrollering New Zealand now at the SCG. They could wrap up a series whitewash in the 37 overs remaining after tea. 15th over: New Zealand 27-4 (Taylor 12, Watling 0) Watling safely dead-bats a Pattinson maiden to see us through to the tea interval. 14th over: New Zealand 27-4 (Taylor 12, Watling 0) Taylor is a man with a plan, taking guard on off stump and sweeping as often as possible. It works well, earning a couple of twos, and also provides that heart-in-mouth appeal. Jake Santa Maria is happy with a summer free of jeopardy. “After the Ashes, especially Headingley,” he emails, “I don’t mind the chance to actually relax and watch the cricket rather than cowering in fear of it.” Pssst, look over there, it’s Ben Stokes!No, NZ are not five down (yet). Australia thought they had Taylor out sweeping onto his boot but the ball just hit the pitch before rolling up onto his boot. Are NZ five down? Ross Taylor may be out but we’re going upstairs for a catch, soft signal not out.13th over: New Zealand 23-4 (Taylor 8, Watling 0) Pattinson’s seam movement and the low bounce of this surface causes Taylor all sorts before he finally rotates the strike. Watling is more assured seeing off the last couple of deliveries with forward defences. We’ve gone from Headingley 19 to Cape Town 11. 12th over: New Zealand 22-4 (Taylor 7, Watling 0) The natural variation is doing the trick for Lyon. Phillips was undone by one that didn’t turn as much as he expected, so he ended up inside the line with a straight bat. Lyon himself barely appealed, and it took the enthusiasm of Paine and the close fielders to convince the rest a dismissal had taken place.“I was also confused by Ricky Ponting’s commentary,” emails Paul Morton. “The technology backs up the on-field umpire, but the umpire is still ‘wrong’.” Yeah, I don’t get it either. Luckily we’ve got more of this to come with Brendon McCullum (New Zealand’s Michael Vaughan?) lining up a dossier by the sounds of things for later in the broadcast. New Zealand use their two reviews on outside-edges in a matter of minutes. Sums up their miserable tour. Glenn Phillips is the latest culprit, going back to Lyon and feathering a catch behind the wicket. WICKET! Lyon has another, Phillips this time, but again it’s going to DRS. Stand by...11th over: New Zealand 22-3 (Taylor 7, Phillips 0) Pattinson bowls a maiden to Taylor. The Kiwi legend did his best to get the scoreboard moving but a lack of footwork and an absence of timing on this difficult surface meant all his strokes turned into ungainly swipes. 10th over: New Zealand 22-3 (Taylor 7, Phillips 0) Another example of a very tight decision going against New Zealand on-field that is subsequently confirmed by technology. This is not my take on the summer, but I’m sympathetic to people who hold it. Are there many others of you out there lamenting the lack of close finishes?First look at Nathan Lyon for the day, and he takes just four balls to strike. Beautiful teasing off-spinner from around the wicket into the left-hander drawing the batsman forward then spinning and bouncing away from the stroke, grazing the finest outside edge on the way through to Tim Paine’s gloves. The edge was so faint Raval did not feel it but snicko confirmed the deflection. New Zealand can start packing their suitcases.REVIEW! Raval does not think he’s caught behind off Nathan Lyon...9th over: New Zealand 22-2 (Raval 12, Taylor 7) Pattinson replaces Starc and he’s quickly into a more imposing rhythm than we’ve seen previously in this Test. Angling into Taylor he targets the stumps with pace and is unfortunate to concede four runs when a thick outside edge scoots through an unguarded portion of the cordon. The only shades of Headingley I can see are the slate grey ones overhead. If NZ are in this up to their necks it’s because they have sunk so far they’re drowning, not waving.

Suicide is an awkward subject, but director Milo Rau is not one to shy away from society’s ugly corners. Mesmerising and alarming, Familie completes a trilogy that began with Five Easy Pieces, in which children told the story of child molester Marc Dutroux, and La Reprise, which reconstructed the murder of Ihsane Jarfi in a random act of homophobic violence.This play also takes its template from real life. In 2007, the four members of the Demeester family were found hanged in their Calais home. They had a meal ready to eat and left no sign of struggle. The only clue to the joint suicide of this comfortably off family was a terse note: “We messed up. Sorry.”It’s not much to go on, but Rau turns the enigma into a strength. Working with a mix of professional and amateur actors in accordance with his 10-point Ghent Manifesto, he enlists a real family to imagine the fateful final night. Prominent Belgian actors An Miller and Filip Peeters are joined by their teenage daughters Leonce and Louisa Peeters, plus dogs Billy and Bobby, in an evening not of histrionics and grinding of teeth (for that, Rau would direct you to Romeo and Juliet), but of heartbreaking banality.The production it most closely resembles is Vanishing Point’s Interiors, a dark domestic comedy performed behind the windows of a single-storey house that turned the audience into unwitting voyeurs. Likewise, Anton Lukas’s realistic set for Familie allows dad to get on with the cooking, mum to call her parents and the kids to do their English homework as if, for the most part, we’re not there. Moritz von Dungern’s deftly integrated live video projections pull us closer to their everyday routines. One section is called “Killing Time”.By rights, a play shorn of everything we expect of a night out – drama, conflict, debate – should be excruciating, but such is the guilelessness of the four actors, the apparent spontaneity of their stage life and the excruciating tension of knowing their fate, that the mundane becomes riveting. In its opening and closing sequences, the cunningly crafted piece reels off lists of private pleasures: watching movies on a rainy day, doodling during a phone call, reading Harry Potter… On their own, they are whimsical and insignificant, but cumulatively, they are the reason we keep on keeping on, our way of defying existential despair.We love this family in the way we love the talking heads on Gogglebox, not for their exceptionalism but the very reverse: their ordinariness and lack of pretence. That we are seeing enactments of real family relationships in parallel to the true-life tragic tale adds to our distress.Rau does not concern himself with fathoming a meaning behind the suicides there is no “to be or not to be” dilemma. He accepts the Demeesters’ actions are unknowable. Even with more information, we would still find their deaths inexplicable. Where would guessing get us?Instead, he offers us a kind of dark, secular mass, at once a celebration of all life has to offer in its smallest, most trivial moments, and a painful recognition that sometimes it can be too much. Performed at the stately pace of a slow piece of Bach, Familie is assured, soulful and unnerving. • In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 and the domestic violence helpline is 0808 2000 247.

So why is he staging the great Aids epic Angels in America? Apparently, it’s all a misunderstandingArnaud Desplechin looks surprisingly calm as he excuses himself to listen to a voicemail from the Comédie-Française’s technical team. France is one week into a general strike over pension reform and the country’s premier theatre company has followed suit, resulting in cancelled performances and rehearsals. “We take it day by day,” says Desplechin, whose new production of Angels in America is due to open in mid-January. “It will start to get difficult if it continues.” We spoke in December and the strike is still going strong, but there is no plan to delay.It doesn’t help that Tony Kushner’s sprawling 1990s play about the Aids crisis is only Desplechin’s second theatre project, his first being a 2015 version of August Strindberg’s Father. The 59-year-old auteur is renowned for such character-driven screen dramas as Kings and Queen and My Golden Days, which often draw on his own life and background. Yet this month he will be in two Paris theatres at once, since an adaptation of his film A Christmas Tale is appearing at the Odéon-Théâtre de l’Europe.It’s an unlikely development for a film director who never pined for the stage. “I always told myself I would never do theatre,” he says. “For me, it was for bourgeois, adult people, while I was making cinema, the art of rascals.” Father, he says sheepishly, came out of a “misunderstanding”. Eric Ruf, the Comédie-Française’s director, had a small part in My Golden Days, and one morning asked Desplechin if he would direct a production for the company, 10 minutes before filming was due to start. “I said, ‘Yes, of course.’ But if he’d asked me to run around the block in my underwear, I would have done it – anything so the actor is good.”Ruf took him at his word and the result was Father. Angels in America is a more ambitious undertaking. Desplechin says the company was “terrified” when he proposed more than 40 set changes: the Comédie-Française is a repertoire theatre, so productions must rotate from one day to the next, and come with a strict three-hour time limit. To make it work, Ruf, an experienced set designer himself, provided support and extra rehearsal time on the stage of the Salle Richelieu, the company’s historical home, not far from the Louvre.Desplechin, who is focusing on the romantic relationships between the mostly gay characters, admits to some trepidation, not being a member of the LGBTQ+ community. “I felt it was missing from my work,” he says. “I think that some heterosexual love stories have the privilege of being universal, while there is something singular about a gay story. So how do you make sure everyone in the audience is moved? Am I capable of it?” Like fellow film-maker Christophe Honoré – who crafted an impressive play, Les Idoles, about the toll the Aids crisis took on the French intellectual scene – Desplechin lost some of his artistic heroes to the illness, and vividly remembers the pervading sense of “terror”.When discussing his theatre work, the soft-spoken French director seems in awe of his Comédie-Française cast. “There is a technical knowledge that I don’t have. I feel very lucky to be a student. If my actors are happy, if they think I haven’t said anything stupid, then it’s fine.”A different side of Desplechin comes out when the conversation turns to cinema, his childhood love. “On film sets, I like to be the king,” he says. “I’m a despot. When I need to go to the bathroom, everyone shouts, ‘The king is going to the bathroom’ – because it takes three minutes and everything is organised around me. I love it.”Not even, I ask, when he was sued, unsuccessfully, by his former partner Marianne Denicourt, who claimed in her 2005 book Evil Genius that Desplechin had lifted painful episodes from her personal life without permission to write Kings and Queen? Desplechin appears unconcerned: “Of my films, it’s the one that performed best at the box office, what can I tell you?”The rest of his family, he adds, has learned to live with it. “You know what they say: there is no worse curse than to have a child who is a writer. If you’re Kafka’s father, you’re not going to be very pleased.” Does Desplechin hope his own son won’t turn to writing? He laughs. “Look how much of a masochist I am. Of course I hope he’ll be Kafka! As long as I’m good material for him.”Desplechin seems genuinely happy to take a back seat for his Angels in America – “I’m here to serve Kushner, that’s it” – and to see A Christmas Tale reinvented for the stage. Don’t expect him to write a play any time soon, however. “I feel like you need a lifetime of theatre experience to do that. Films are much easier: anyone can do it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84d21180d991f1f7e8cd72beda5466453ced3f4b/0_79_960_576/master/960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95096e855b9e7ca57112e357fb13da1e","title":"20 new uk attractions visit 2020 adventure parks wellbeing theatres museums","story":"The coming year will see a bumper crop of openings and relaunches, including adventure parks, wellbeing centres, theatres and museumsThe 450-hectare Rye Harbour nature reserve, with its coastal habitats of grassland, saltmarsh, and sand and shingle shoreline, celebrates its 50th anniversary this year with a new visitor centre opening in association with Sussex Wildlife Trust.

Share your stories The American Embassy in Baghdad is calling for all US citizens in Iraq to leave the country as soon as possible.In the early hours of 3 January, Iran’s most powerful general Qassem Suleimani was killed outside Baghdad airport in an airstrike sanctioned by the US President, Donald Trump. Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, de-facto leader of the Iranian-backed Iraqi militia, the Popular Mobilisation Units (PMU), and close associate of Suleimani, also died in the attack.The killing represents a significant acceleration in the escalation of tensions between the US and Iran. It followed just hours after the conclusion of a two-day siege against the US embassy in Baghdad by PMU militants, which was prompted by a US airstrike camps belonging to a PMU-affiliated militia, itself a response to that group’s killing of a US contractor at an Iraqi army base.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has sworn revenge for Suleimani’s death.The embassy said in a statement that it “urges American Citizens to heed the January 2020 Travel Advisory and depart Iraq immediately. US citizens should depart via airline while possible, and failing that, to other countries by land.”“Due to Iranian-backed militia attacks at the US Embassy compound, all public consular operations are suspended until further notice”, the statement added.We would like to hear from you if you are a US citizen in Iraq, or if you know someone who has been affected by the order to evacuate.Though we’d like to hear from you, your security is most important.

At an improvised session in the headquarters of a local newspaper, pro-Guaidó lawmakers re-elected him as national assembly president, meaning that it – like Venezuela – now had two rival leaders.“Today, once again, we have defeated the dictatorship,” Guaidó told supporters. “We have resoundingly defeated the dictatorship’s intentions.”The United States criticised the Maduro regime’s move, saying it would not recognize what it called a desperate and phoney “farce” that went “completely against the will of the people”, adding: “Democracy cannot be intimidated.”The foreign minister of Brazil’s far-right government, Ernesto Araújo, accused Maduro of attempting to forcefully prevent Guaidó’s re-election, tweeting: “Brazil will not recognize any outcome of this violence and this affront to democracy.”But there was also criticism from Argentina’s new left-wing government. “Forcibly preventing the functioning of the national assembly means condemning oneself to international isolation,” tweeted its new foreign minister, Felipe Solá.The move appeared designed to further weaken Guaidó, who recently vowed 2020 would be Venezuela’s “year of freedom” despite the growing impression that his campaign against Maduro is faltering.More than 50 governments including the United States, the United Kingdom and Brazil recognized Guaidó as Venezuela’s president, based on his leadership of the assembly and suspicions Maduro had stolen the 2018 presidential election.Despite that backing, mass street protests, and at least two attempts to spark military uprisings against Maduro, Guaidó has failed to topple Hugo Chávez’s authoritarian heir, who still enjoys support from China and Russia.In a recent interview with El País, Guaidó denied his movement had failed and compared himself to a jogger entering “the final lap” of the quest for political change.In a televised speech on Sunday afternoon, Maduro recognized Parra’s leadership and attacked Guaidó as a “puppet of North American imperialism”.But Christopher Sabatini, a senior fellow for Latin America at the Chatham House thinktank, said Maduro’s “brutal and ham-fisted” move could backfire by “re-legitimizing” Guaidó as a “democratic martyr”.Guaidó’s international supporters would remain loyal, even if he did not retain his position at the head of the national assembly. “They won’t abandon him,” Sabatini predicted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3843d11f3b6db8a1773c12a2bcaef5bee881364/0_146_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e1504b1c808d4282005bf5f898dcefc","title":"croatia elects leftist zoran milanovic to be next president","story":"Croatia’s leftist former prime minister Zoran Milanović, who has pledged to make his nation a more tolerant place and turn the page on its wartime past, will be his country’s next president after defeating the incumbent conservative in a run-off vote.The second-round election was held just days after Croatia took over the European Union’s helm for a six-month period, which will be dominated by Brexit and the bloc’s enlargement.At the same time, the EU’s newest member is struggling with a mass exodus of its people, corruption and a lacklustre economy.Grabar-Kitarović campaigned on a slogan promoting the “real Croatia”, hinting that she believed the ruling conservative HDZ party that backed her was the only one that can truly represent the country.Milanović, a Social Democrat, called such statements “very dangerous” and advocated a vision of a “normal Croatia” as a liberal democracy that promoted equality for all citizens.“Four million of us ... are looking for our place in Europe which is, despite all the problems, the nicest place to live, the most peaceful project in which Croatia must find its place and interest,” Milanović told supporters in Zagreb after his victory.“Let’s be united in (our) differences,” the 53-year-old said.In the campaign Milanović stressed that the “wars are over”, referring to the 1990s independence war that remains an emotive issue.Grabar-Kitarović, 51, the country’s first female president, had tried but failed to lure back hardliners who had voted for a nationalist folk singer in the presidential election’s first round in December.She stressed unity, patriotism and references to the 1990s war in her re-election bid.Conceding defeat on Sunday evening, Grabar-Kitarović promised a “civilised transfer” of power to Milanović.She stressed that Croatia needed stability and unity as “we are the strongest when we are together”.Analysts say that Milanović, who dominated in the cities, also won thanks in part to the split among the rightwingers.The election was viewed as a key test for the ruling HDZ party of moderate prime minister Andrej Plenković, ahead of parliamentary elections later this year. Grabar-Kitarović’s loss was seen as a heavy blow.Political analyst Tihomir Cipek said the result would weaken the HDZ party and harm Plenković’s reputation, The prime minister is also facing the discontent of hardliners within the HDZ over his moderate policies.Grabar-Kitarović presented herself as a “woman of the people” with humble farming roots. She is well known for stunts such as singing in public, which her critics deride as embarrassing.She also came under fire for downplaying the crimes committed by Croatia’s second world war pro-Nazi regime.Milanović, who was prime minister from 2011 to 2016 and whose government failed to push through much-needed reforms, was seeking to make a political comeback and throw off a reputation as arrogant and elitist.He will now take office during a Croatian EU presidency in which four main issues are likely to dominate: the bloc’s relationship with the UK after Brexit the membership bids of Western Balkan states climate change and the bloc’s budget framework for the next decade.Croatia joined the EU in 2013, but its economy, strongly relying on tourism, remains one of the bloc’s weakest. The EU’s open borders have accelerated the exodus of its people, seeking better pay in wealthier member states.Many emigrants also cite corruption, nepotism and poor public services as reasons for leaving.“Politicians are wrangling about the past and insignificant issues while my generation is leaving,” said Maja Marić, a 20-year-old economics student. She said she voted for a “lesser evil”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4131164.1578250687!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"state criticised over 10m spent on chaplains for schools","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThere are 156 full-time chaplain posts – mostly Catholic – allocated to Education and Training Boards secondary schools and colleges. The annual cost is €9.8 million. Photograph: Cesar MansoAFPGetty Education authorities are spending almost €10 million of taxpayers’ money on hiring religious chaplains for State-run multidenominational secondary schools.The practice has drawn criticism from campaigners who say this funding is not being spent in a transparent manner and discriminates against secular and minority faith parents.The Department of Education has confirmed that it allocates Catholic or Church of Ireland chaplain posts to Education and Training Boards (ETB) secondary schools and colleges. In all there are 156 full-time chaplain posts – mostly Catholic – allocated to these schools. The annual cost is approximately €9.8 million.The appointment of chaplains to these schools flows from the original agreements concluded when the schools were first established. A spokesman for the department said chaplains perform pastoral and counselling roles and play an important role in supporting student wellbeing.However, Atheist Ireland said State-run secondary schools were meant to be an alternative to denominational schools, yet they are funding chaplains to help only Catholic and Church of Ireland parents with the religious education of their children. “The Department of Education has told them to consult parents about whether they want religious instruction in accordance with these or other denominations, and the ETB schools are refusing to even consult with parents about this,” said Jane Donnelly, human rights officer of Atheist Ireland.Religious education“If the schools do not know whether parents even want religious instruction and worship in accordance with the rites of these denominations, how can they justify paying chaplains to help these parents with the religious education of their children?”The Dáil’s Public Accounts Committee is currently investigating the public funding of chaplains in third-level institutions.It has asked the Higher Education Authority to show whether these posts are being openly advertised.Atheist Ireland has formally requested that the committee extend its investigation to include the appointment of chaplains to secondary schools.Education and Training Boards Ireland (ETBI), the representative body for ETBs, said it was not in a position to comment when contacted.Legal agreementsHowever, it has previously pointed out that the appointment of chaplains to some of its schools flows from legally binding agreements with the Catholic Church dating back to the 1970s.These agreements oblige about a quarter of the 270 ETB-run secondary schools to maintain a Catholic ethos and provide students with two hours of religious instruction. The spotlight on these arrangements come at a time when ETBI is finalising a “core values and characteristic spirit review” report, which highlights the challenge facing the sector in becoming more representative of the wider community.The report says that, overall, ETB schools are inclusive and open to all pupils regardless of their background. But it notes that the sector has yet to clearly articulate its core values and ethos and this has resulted in schools being left “to form their own schools-specific values and traditions”.It says that, in some cases, there is a confusion over whether ETB schools “are de jure multidenominational but de facto Catholic”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4131079.1578245355!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish oysters an annual 6m success story in china","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tKian Louët-Feisser of the Carlingford Oyster Company hard at work. Photograph: Carlingford Oyster Company Chinese diners are shelling out for Irish oysters like never before as oyster farmers enjoy an unprecedented demand for their product from Asia.The value of Irish oyster sales to China increased by 83 per cent between 2017 and 2018 and another boost in figures is expected when 2019 figures are totted up, according to Bord Bia. Irish seafood export values to China had increased by 33 per cent up to September 2019 compared to the same period in 2018, according to its seafood sector manager Karen Devereux. “So, the strong performance of Irish seafood in this market continues apace and oysters are a key part of that. Irish oysters are a real success story in China with annual sales of around €6 million.”She says they are now on sale in some of the most prestigious oyster bars, hotel chains, restaurants and premium supermarkets frequented by China’s growing middle class, in cities such as Beijing and Shanghai. “In fact, China is now Ireland’s second largest market for Irish oyster exports.”For many years, France was the only export market for Irish oysters which were sold in bulk to the wholesale market. But several years ago growers began installing facilities to allow them pack and brand their oysters. This opened up new of markets, with China the leading one.The Irish oyster is seen as a premium and pure product that comes from clean waters surrounding a green island. A few dozen Chinese buyers have travelled here to see how oyster farms operate. And they supped on seafood chowder when stopping off at Carlingford Oyster Company, recalls Kian Louët-Feisser who runs the family business.Asia accounts for almost one-third of his oyster sales today. “Four years ago, if you were at the China Fisheries Show talking to a Chinese person about Ireland, they would say, ‘what’s Ireland’? They didn’t even know it was a country. At the last show in October people were actively looking for Irish oysters that’s really cool.”Before Brexit reared its head, the Carlingford Oyster Company was selling 80 per cent of its product to Britain. Louët-Feisser quickly realised he should not put all his oysters in one basket. There wasn’t much difference in the air freight costs to Europe and China, but the latter offered a premium price for the product.“But you must have very good quality. Every oyster has to be absolutely perfect.” What about reputation?China grows one million tonnes of oysters a year – 10 times more than the whole of Europe produces – so it knows its oysters. In fact, Irish oysters have built up such a reputation that the growers have to be careful to protect their product from counterfeiters who are looking for a premium price for an inferior product. Louët-Feisser says the past 12 months has been a rollercoaster, because of Brexit and the drive to find new customers. “After the experience of Brexit, we would be very wary. We wouldn’t want to have one market accounting for more than one-third of sales because if something happens to that market, where does it leave you?”Now that Carlingford Oyster Company has found its feet in China, it is looking to other Asian markets and sent their first shipment to Taiwan recently.“There are great opportunities out there,” says Louët-Feisser. “When my father started this company in 1974, you couldn’t give away oysters. Today it’s a premium product.

Photograph: AFPGetty ImagesLawyers in Malaysia representing the parents of Franco-Irish teenager Nóra Quoirin have filed a civil suit against the operator of the Dusun holiday resort where Nóra was staying when she disappeared last August.The Quoirins are claiming at least €40,000 in damages and claim the resort failed to keep the premises in which they were staying safe and secure.The defendant in the suit is Helen Marion Todd, who operates the resort.The statement of claim was filed on December 24th in the Seremban Sessions Court, Negeri Sembilan, by Sankara N Nair and partners on behalf of Nóra’s mother and father, Meabh Josephine Quoirin and Sebastien Marie Philippe Quoirin. The date for the first case management hearing has been set for January 21st at Seremban Sessions Court.The statement of claim states that Nóra Quoirin went through pain and suffering from August 4th until August 13th, 2019. The 15-year-old’s body was found in the jungle about two kilometres from the Dusun resort by a group of hikers who had volunteered their help in the massive 10-day search. The Quoirins plead that their daughter’s disappearance and death “were caused directly by the defendant’s negligence andor recklessness, both by way of act or conduct and omission”.A spokeswoman for the Dusun resort said that a statement would not at the moment be issued in response to the allegations. Nóra’s parents are making a claim against Ms Todd for special damages in the sum of 152,707.90 ringgit (about €33,372), general damages as assessed by the sessions court, damages for bereavement of 30,000 ringgit (about €6,555), and “damages for pain and sufferings”.On October 8th last year, through their lawyers in Malaysia, the Quorins demanded that the defendant pay them damages, but, the statement of claim alleges Ms Todd had so far “failed, neglected andor refused to pay any damages”. Window latch brokenThe statement of claim states that, on or about March 18th, 2019, the plaintiffs booked and paid for a three-night stay at the Dusun resort from August 3rd until August 6th, 2019.The family had intended to spend three days at the resort before travelling around Malaysia.After travelling from overseas, Meabh and Sebastien Quoirin checked into the resort with Nóra and their two other younger children on August 3rd. After the journey “they were exhausted and went to bed”, their claim states.The next morning, at or about 8 am, Nóra’s parents discovered she was missing and noticed that the window in the living area of the bungalow in which they were staying was ajar.Their statement of claim alleges that the latch on the window was broken and the window could easily be opened by anyone from outside.It is also alleged that the perimeter fencing was not secured and the entrance gate of the Dusun was kept open at all times and no security personnel were in place to guard the property.Furthermore, it alleges that there was no closed-circuit television and no other safety facilities were installed at the resort.It notes that Nóra was born with a medical condition known as holoprosencephaly which left her with balancing and coordination difficulties. “In addition her motor skills and core strength were very poor, and the deceased was unable to walk without the help of an adult. The mental age of the deceased at the time of death was about five or six years old only.”PostmortemsAfter the postmortem on Nóra’s body, Malaysian police said on August 15th that there was no evidence of foul play. The police said the cause of death was upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to a duodenal ulcer complicated with perforation. The bleeding in Nóra’s intestine was most likely caused by prolonged hunger and stress, Negeri Sembilan police chief Mohamad Mat Yusof said. The final results of the postmortem carried out in Malaysia, including the toxicology reports, have not yet been released.The Quoirins are also still awaiting the results of a second postmortem, carried out in London.Nóra’s parents have said they believe there was a criminal element in the disappearance and death of their daughter and have called on the Malaysian authorities to open an inquest.Mr Nair says he suspects that Nóra was abducted."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4131092.1578246879!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"people in border areas are asked to help shape new eu programme","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA view of the Hands Across The Divide sculpture in Derry, Northern Ireland. File photograph: Mary TurnerBloombergPeople in Border areas are being asked to help shape a future EU programme expected to be worth more than €600 million. The EU’s Peace Plus programme, which will run from 2021-2027, will fund activities related to peace and reconciliation and to economic and social development in Northern Ireland and in the Border counties of the Republic. A series of stakeholder information events will be held on the programme in each of Northern Ireland’s six counties, as well as in counties Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Sligo, in January and February. The aim of the programme is to improve the lives of people on both sides of the Border. Objectives could include boosting innovation capacity promoting a greener, lower-carbon Europe enhancing mobile and IT connectivity fostering sustainable and integrated development improving employment opportunities increasing access to quality healthcare and education, and reducing marginalisation through improved housing and services. According to the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB), which will be responsible for delivering the new programme, the information events will explain these different policy objectives and provide an overview of the programme implementation process. Formal responses can be given via a survey, which is available until February 25th. Peace Plus will replace the work of the Peace and Interreg schemes, which over 20 years have provided approximately € 3.4 billion in EU funding to tens of thousands of projects on both sides of the Border.Its value is likely to be in excess of €600 million. Government supportThe new programme has been written into the post-2020 EU regulations for the next programming period, and is supported by both the British and Irish governments. It will cover Northern Ireland and the Republic’s six Border counties and can include organisations based outside this area as long as they make a contribution to the objectives of the programme and benefit the citizens living within the eligible region. The chief executive of SEUPB, Gina McIntyre, said: “Peace Plus is a new EU cross-Border programme that will contribute to a more prosperous and stable society in Northern Ireland and the Border region of Ireland. “It reflects the European Union’s, along with Ireland and the UK government’s, continued commitment to support ongoing peace and reconciliation activities and the future socio-economic and environmental development of the region.”“We are delighted to be able to start the design of the new programme and would encourage everyone who has been previously involved, or not, to come to our events and share their views,” she added.

While the state will continue to cooperate with the International Atomic Agency, its refusal to comply with uranium enrichment levels may bring it closer to producing a nuclear bomb.Earlier in the day, the Iraqi parliament voted to expel US troops from the country.Growing backlashIraqi prime minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi proposed a resolution to end all foreign troop presence in the country – signalling a growing backlash in Iraq against Friday’s drone strike at Baghdad Airport which killed Suleimani as well as a top commander of an Iranian-allied militia group.However, the bill – which is opposed by dozens of Kurdish and Sunni representatives in parliament – has not yet been signed into law.As tensions remained high, one US serviceman and two Department of Defense contractors were killed in an attack on a US base in Kenya. Rockets were also fired in the Green Zone area of Baghdad near the US embassy, though no casualties were reported.Mr Trump escalated his rhetoric over the weekend warning that the US could strike 52 Iranian sites “very fast and very hard” if provoked.“Let this serve as a WARNING that if Iran strikes any Americans, or American assets, we have targeted 52 Iranian sites (representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago), some at a very high level \u0026amp important to Iran \u0026amp the Iranian culture, and those targets, and Iran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD,” he tweeted from his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. “The USA wants no more threats.”US secretary of state Mike Pompeo defended the president’s comments, stating that America will behave “lawfully”.“We always have, and we always will,” he said. “We’ve told the Iranian regime, enough.

Photograph: Mohammad Hossein TaghiOne day they may name a street after President Donald Trump in Tehran. Why? Because Trump just ordered the assassination of possibly the dumbest man in Iran and the most overrated strategist in the Middle East: Maj Gen Qassem Suleimani.Think of the miscalculations this guy made. In 2015, the US and the major European powers agreed to lift virtually all their sanctions on Iran, many dating back to 1979, in return for Iran halting its nuclear weapons programme for a mere 15 years but still maintaining the right to have a peaceful nuclear programme. It was a great deal for Iran. It’s economy grew by over 12 per cent the next year. And what did Suleimani do with that windfall?He and Iran’s supreme leader launched an aggressive regional imperial project that made Iran and its proxies the de facto controlling power in Beirut, Damascus, Baghdad and Sanaa. This freaked out US allies in the Sunni Arab world and Israel, and they prevailed on the Trump administration to respond by tearing up the nuclear deal and imposing oil sanctions on Iran that have now shrunk the Iranian economy by almost 10 per cent and sent unemployment to more that 16 per cent.All that for the pleasure of saying that Tehran can call the shots in Beirut, Damascus, Baghdad and Sanaa. What exactly was second prize?By severely depriving the Tehran regime of funds, the ayatollahs had to raise gasoline prices at home, triggering massive domestic protests. That required a harsh crackdown by Iran’s clerics against their own people that left thousands jailed and killed, further weakening the legitimacy of the regime.Israeli intelligenceThen Mr “Military Genius” Suleimani decided that, having propped up the regime of President Bashar Assad in Syria and helping to kill 500,000 Syrians in the process, he would overreach again and try to put direct pressure on Israel. He would do this by trying to transfer precision-guided rockets from Iran to Iranian proxy forces in Lebanon and Syria.Alas, Suleimani discovered that fighting Israel – specifically, its combined air force, special forces, intelligence and cyber – is not like fighting the Nusra front or the Islamic State group. The Israelis hit back hard, sending a whole bunch of Iranians home from Syria in caskets and hammering their proxies as far away as western Iraq.Indeed, Israeli intelligence had so penetrated Suleimani’s Quds Force and its proxies that Suleimani would land a plane with precision munitions in Syria at 5pm and the Israeli air force would blow it up by 5.30pm. Suleimani’s men were like fish in a barrel. If Iran had a free press and a real parliament, he would have been fired for colossal mismanagement.But it gets better, or actually worse, for Suleimani. Many of his obituaries say that he led the fight against the Islamic State group in Iraq, in tacit alliance with America. Well, that’s true. But what they omit is that Suleimani’s, and Iran’s, overreaching in Iraq helped to produce the Islamic State group in the first place.It was Suleimani and his Quds Force pals who pushed Iraq’s Shia prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, to push Sunnis out of the Iraqi government and army, stop paying salaries to Sunni soldiers, kill and arrest large numbers of peaceful Sunni protesters and generally turn Iraq into a Shia-dominated sectarian state. The Islamic State group was the counterreaction.Finally, it was Suleimani’s project of making Iran the imperial power in the Middle East that turned Iran into the most hated power in the Middle East for many of the young, rising pro-democracy forces – both Sunnis and Shias – in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq.As Iranian-American scholar Ray Takeyh pointed out in a wise essay in Politico, in recent years, “Suleimani began expanding Iran’s imperial frontiers. For the first time in its history, Iran became a true regional power, stretching its influence from the banks of the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf. Suleimani understood that Persians would not be willing to die in distant battlefields for the sake of Arabs, so he focused on recruiting Arabs and Afghans as an auxiliary force. He often boasted that he could create a militia in little time and deploy it against Iran’s various enemies.”Massive corruptionIt was precisely those Suleimani proxies – Hizbullah in Lebanon and Syria, the Popular Mobilisation Forces in Iraq and the Houthis in Yemen – that created pro-Iranian Shia states-within-states in all of these countries. And it was precisely these states-within-states that helped to prevent any of these countries from cohering, fostered massive corruption and kept these countries from developing infrastructure such as schools, roads, electricity.And therefore it was Suleimani and his proxies – his “kingmakers” in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq – who increasingly came to be seen, and hated, as imperial powers in the region, even more so than Trump’s America. This triggered popular, authentic, bottom-up democracy movements in Lebanon and Iraq that involved Sunnis and Shias locking arms together to demand non-corrupt, non-sectarian democratic governance.On November 27th, Iraqi Shias – yes, Iraqi Shias – burned down the Iranian consulate in Najaf, Iraq, removing the Iranian flag from the building and putting an Iraqi flag in its place. That was after Iraqi Shias, in September 2018, set the Iranian consulate in Basra ablaze, shouting condemnations of Iran’s interference in Iraqi politics.The whole “protest” against the US embassy compound in Baghdad last week was almost certainly a Suleimani-staged operation to make it look as if Iraqis wanted America out when in fact it was the other way around. The protesters were paid pro-Iranian militiamen. No one in Baghdad was fooled by this.In a way, it’s what got Suleimani killed. He so wanted to cover his failures in Iraq he decided to start provoking the Americans there by shelling their forces, hoping they would overreact, kill Iraqis and turn them against the US. Trump, rather than taking the bait, killed Suleimani instead.I have no idea whether this was wise or what will be the long-term implications. But here are two things I do know about the Middle East.First, often in the Middle East the opposite of “bad” is not “good”. The opposite of bad often turns out to be “disorder”. Just because you take out a really bad actor like Suleimani doesn’t mean a good actor, or a good change in policy, comes in his wake. Suleimani is part of a system called the Islamic Revolution in Iran. That revolution has managed to use oil money and violence to stay in power since 1979 – and that is Iran’s tragedy, a tragedy that the death of one Iranian general will not change.Emptiness of regimeToday’s Iran is the heir to a great civilisation and the home of an enormously talented people and significant culture. Wherever Iranians go in the world today, they thrive as scientists, doctors, artists, writers and filmmakers – except in the Islamic Republic of Iran, whose most famous exports are suicide bombing, cyberterrorism and proxy militia leaders. The very fact that Suleimani was probably the most famous Iranian in the region speaks to the utter emptiness of this regime and how it has wasted the lives of two generations of Iranians by looking for dignity in all the wrong places and in all the wrong ways.The other thing I know is that in the Middle East all important politics happens the morning after the morning after.Yes, in the coming days there will be noisy protests in Iran, the burning of American flags and much crying for the “martyr”. The morning after the morning after? There will be a thousand quiet conversations inside Iran that won’t get reported. They will be about the travesty that is their own government and how it has squandered so much of Iran’s wealth and talent on an imperial project that has made Iran hated in the Middle East.And yes, the morning after, America’s Sunni Arab allies will quietly celebrate Suleimani’s death, but we must never forget that it is the dysfunction of many of the Sunni Arab regimes – their lack of freedom, modern education and women’s empowerment – that made them so weak that Iran was able to take them over from the inside with its proxies.I write these lines while flying over New Zealand, where the smoke from forest fires 2,500 miles away over eastern Australia can be seen and felt. Mother Nature doesn’t know Suleimani’s name, but everyone in the Arab world is going to know her name. Because the Middle East, particularly Iran, is becoming an environmental disaster area – running out of water, with rising desertification and overpopulation. If governments there don’t stop fighting and come together to build resilience against climate change – rather than celebrating self-promoting military frauds who conquer failed states and make them fail even more – they’re all doomed. – New York Times"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Binge watching TV addicts treated by Harley Street therapists in first cases of their kind in UKComment: Why living with your mum might not be such a bad ideaNext Labour leader: who are the candidates vying to replace Jeremy Corbyn?Boris Johnson calls for de-escalation from both sides as Trump warns Iran of \u0026#39major retaliation\u0026#39Top bosses earn annual wage of average worker by end of todayWorking in an office costs you almost £2k a year, survey finds  Extinction Rebellion activists embroiled in row over whether flying is ever acceptableViolent crime rampage leaves five people in hospital after seven robberies in two hoursCave ing pensioner found dead in one of England’s largest underground networksTrawlers should be banned from fishing within three miles of Scotland to boost fish stocks, campaigners say  Thousands of koalas burn to death as Australia fears native wildlife may never recover from bush fire disasterComment: The Labour candidates\u0026#39 problems are their values, not their accentsSkiing chair for disabled people among 101 examples of French innovation at Macron exhibitStrip Club under investigation after drunk customers charged tens of thousands of pounds ‘without consent’, report claims  Germans who live near wind turbines should be paid compensation, says government ministerRussian government to \u0026#39use the advantages\u0026#39 of climate changeBoris Johnson must make a decision on HS2 \u0026#39as soon as possible\u0026#39, says former ministerBritain is \u0026#39soft target\u0026#39 for Iranian revenge attacksGerman grandmothers protest broadcast of song calling elderly \u0026#39environmental pigs\u0026#39Dozens brutally attacked at Delhi university after opposing \u0026#39anti-Muslim\u0026#39 citizenship lawWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/12/20/TELEMMGLPICT000217980236_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqMB5T8-A3xmk6BYQ8A56navYRi2AJs9csjE2kaVavFQM.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"touch colour casts new light dickensian lives ordinary victorians","story":"Italian street musicians entertaining passers-by in Victorian LondonThey look for all the world like stills from the latest film version of a classic Dickens novel. But these remarkable pictures were taken not on a Hollywood set, but 140 years ago on the streets of London, among the Victorian capital’s itinerant workers.Only now has colour been added to them by a specialist craftsman, with the intention of bringing the images to life for a modern audience.The photographs of Victorian street life among the poor and low paid were taken during the mid-1870s by the Edinburgh born photographer John Thomson, whose work chronicling ordinary life around him is now regarded as having paved the way for modern photo-journalism.Thomson teamed up with the radical journalist Adolphe Smith and together they produced a monthly magazine called Street Life In London in which they explored the lives, language and daily habits of London’s street vendors, canal workers, buskers and labourers.In a sign of how the capital has long been a magnet for migrant workers and their families, one of the most vivid photographs taken by Thomson shows a group of Italian street musicians, who Smith described as “sons of peasants, agricultural labourers, and others who might lead respectable lives in their own country”.He explained why such people might be drawn to our shores - in language that might be applicable to today’s migrants.A mother with a babe in arms and an older child survey the goods being sold by a ‘swag’ man or barrow boy“They find that a beggar in England is richer than a labourer in Italy,” wrote Smith in his accompaniment to Thomson’s photographs. “The Italian therefore migrates with the knowledge that he may rely on the generosity of the English, and if he only receives as much as many of the English poor, he may hope to save enough to buy himself a farm in his own country.”Among Thomson and Smith’s subjects was even a street doctor, who dispensed cough lozenges and healing ointments to those who could not afford the services of a qualified medic.One of the most striking photographs is that of a woman with a babe in arms and an older child surveying the goods being sold by a ‘swag’ man or barrow boy.The bearded street vendor bemoans the decline in his trade, telling Smith: “There are now too many ‘swags’ and most of them ain’t the gentleman they used to be. I should say there are 1,500 ‘swag’ dealers about London, counting women, boys and girls.”But the stall’s owner comforts himself with the thought he’ll always find customers among the capital’s women, ever mindful of their appearance, no matter how poor.“The profits are much lower at present. But bad as times be, it’s wonderful how women will have ornaments. I have had them come with their youngsters without shoes or stockings, and spend money on ear-drops, or a fancy comb for the hair.”Like Dickens, Thomson and Smith were keenly aware of the dire social conditions in which London’s street workers lived. Smith wrote of the capital’s watermen - who he called “workers on the silent highway - that “it is difficult for them to secure education for their children, and regular attendance at school would be impossible unless the child left its parents altogether.”The photographs have been colourised for the modern eye by Tom Marshall, who has also applied a similar treatment to photographs of soldiers in the trenches during the First World War.Marshall, who spent weeks colourising Thompson’s original black and white photographs, told The : “I believe that colourising images can allow a modern audience to engage better with the subject, especially in an age where we see thousands of images on a news feed every day.“Colour brings out hidden details which are often lost in black and white, and it causes the viewer to pause and look. That’s not to say that the original images are not fascinating in their own right, but I believe that the addition of colour helps to enhance the scene and forces the viewer to spend more time looking into it, and reading the accompanying caption.”Furniture sellers in Victorian LondonThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

No doubt your imagination is filled with a fantasy out of Kevin McCloud\u0027s Grand Designs: all efficient insulation and recycled materials, wooden walls and a green roof.That vision in your mind is the opposite of our house. For one, it is not green but literally yellow: a bizarre choice made by a previous owner whose unusual decisions extend through the rest of the house too, but one fitting for a place that is far from the fresh, clean image that comes with sustainable housing.We hope to repaint the house this year. And we hope to make it a little more green throughout, too: my\u0026nbsppledge for 2020 is to find the ways that our somewhat behind-the-times building can be pulled into the 21st century\u0026nbspand do its bit to avoid any further damage to the environment.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMy partner and I lack both the means and the ability to undertake any grand plans like the installation of solar panels on the roof or gutting the walls. Instead, I will be looking for the easy wins that we can do ourselves or with minimal cost and input from the outside.We already try to achieve little gains in this respect – for example, I am a dogmatic avoider of leaving the big light on. But there is undoubtedly\u0026nbspmore we can do, both in terms of the house itself and the way we live in it.I\u0027m looking forward to exploring more environmentally friendly ways of dealing with waste, of considering the appliances in our house and the way we use them, of looking into the energy our house uses and how it can be minimised. I\u0027m hopeful too that we can do that without taking ourselves off the grid or avoiding the 21st century, not least because my job as technology editor means using the latest kit.Hopefully, what we will learn will not only help educate us and you the reader about how we can all make improvements, but also help show companies how they can better enable their customers to do so.There are plenty of people, like me, living in old and often rented accommodation where they have limited scope to make improvements. Those people are of course concerned about living without damaging the Earth, too, and so I hope to find ways we can all make our homes a little more sustainable together.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s time to start asking what the sporting world can do to prevent global warmingIn 2020 The Independent will be doing more than ever before to try and make the world a better place. When it comes to sport, that’s easier said than done.Sport is our escape, a way to block out the realities of everyday life for 90 minutes, or a few hours, maybe even an entire day. It is supposed to be enjoyed even in defeat, and yet not even sport is exempt from the greatest threat to humankind today: global warming and the negative impact of climate change.But not even sport can continue to ignore the perils that will come to threaten its very existence unless something is done to change the path it is on. After all, how will our children and grandchildren play football, rugby or cricket if there are no parks left, or will the next Lewis Hamilton be uncovered if we can’t find a sustainable way to maintain motorsport without the use of oil, petrol and even electricity?Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis year we will be delving into how sport affects the surrounding environment, exposing the shocking truths of how it is damaging the world as we know it and highlighting the ways people are trying to bring change for the better.Why will we be doing this? Whether your outlook on global warming is akin to Greta Thunberg or Donald Trump, the truth is that sport has one of the biggest impacts on climate change. Whether it’s the Arsenal squad using a private jet to fly to Norwich, or single-use plastic being used at just about every stadium across the globe, there are endless examples of ignorance when it comes to helping the environment.There will be positives, too. What is Formula E doing to inspire change not just in motorsport but in our everyday commute? What inspired Forest Green Rovers to become the world’s first 100 per cent vegan football club? And are extreme adrenaline sports the answer – they tend to go hand in hand with being at one with the world around us in an effort not to damage it.And if we are to cover all areas of this subject, we will have to take a close look at ourselves too: the media. Is it right that journalists travel all year round aboard the most environmentally damaging transport available in automotive vehicles and aeroplanes, throwing away countless notebooks instead of recycling? If we are to ask the difficult questions, we have to be prepared to answer them too.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.He said continued deglobalisation was one of what he called the “three Ds” — the others being debt and demographics. The demographic\u0026nbsptimebomb is well known — even if no one has adequately dealt with it — and the vast global debt burden of $188 trillion (£143 trillion) is unlikely to be an issue this year as low as interest rates remain low, as most forecasters expect.But deglobalisation is proving to be a major threat to the global economy. Societe\u0026nbspGenerale\u0026nbsp(Soc Gen) has warned that financial globalisation is at a “tipping point”, highlighting the possibility of stagnation and even a slow decline in production links between economies.‘Alarm bells ring’ as factory output falls at fastest rate in 7 yearsSoc Gen, which forecasts global growth slowing from 3.2 per cent to 3.1 per cent between 2020 and 2021, says financial globalisation has slowed significantly. Annual cross-border capital flows have decreased by more than 60 per cent compared to the peak in 2007.There is a similar problem with the trade in goods.

All eyes will be on its update later this month to whether it has an even more downbeat new year message for policymakers.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Searches for a number of other related terms threw up similar results.Carolyn Harris, a Labour MP and chair of a cross-party group on gambling-related harm, said the adverts were immoral.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Gambling companies pay referral fees to intermediaries who can find new customers that may turn into lucrative regular players.Online gambling group 888 takes £15m punt on BetBrightTom Watson labels problem gambling as a ‘public health emergency’Will bookies millions to address problem gambling buy off critics?This week, the extent to which gambling companies’ multibillion-pound profits rely on problem gamblers was revealed in a report obtained , which showed that one firm collected 83 per cent of its deposits from just 2 per cent of its customers.A Google spokesperson said: “We support responsible gambling advertising and it’s important to us that people see useful and relevant ads in this area.\u0026nbsp“As such, we have strict policies around gambling ads, which we enforce rigorously. We have suspended the accounts in question.”The company says it uses a combination of humans and algorithms to vet adverts and enforce its rules.But on Friday, after Google provided a statement, at least one gambling advert was still showing close to the top of search results for Gamstop“Don’t miss the chance to have fun again,” the advert read.\u0026nbsp”Find the best sites not on Gamstop\u0026nbsphere.”Gambling adverts have been inappropriately placed on Google searches before. In October, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned an ad for a casino app which targeted customers who googled “How to unsubscribe from all gambling”.Trade body the Betting and Gaming Council called on Google and other search engines to update their gambling blacklists to prevent similar problems emerging again in future.Anyone who sees gambling adverts targeting search results for help with addiction is advised to contact industry regulator the Gambling Commission.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Undergraduates aged between 18 and 19 are 25 per cent less likely to be in work than they were in the early 2000s.\u0026nbspMs Gardiner added: “With young people today expected to end their working lives at a later age than previous generations, it\u0027s understandable that they want to start their working lives at a later age too.“But this lack of work experience can create longer-term problems, particularly if they hit other life milestones like motherhood or ill-health before their careers have got off the ground.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Searches for a number of other related terms threw up similar results.Carolyn Harris, a Labour MP and chair of a cross-party group on gambling-related harm, said the adverts were immoral.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We have suspended the accounts in question.”The company says it uses a combination of humans and algorithms to vet adverts and enforce its rules.But on Friday, after Google provided a statement, at least one gambling advert was still showing close to the top of search results for Gamstop“Don’t miss the chance to have fun again,” the advert read.\u0026nbsp”Find the best sites not on Gamstop\u0026nbsphere.”Gambling adverts have been inappropriately placed on Google searches before. In October, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned an ad for a casino app which targeted customers who googled “How to unsubscribe from all gambling”.Trade body the Betting and Gaming Council called on Google and other search engines to update their gambling blacklists to prevent similar problems emerging again in future.Anyone who sees gambling adverts targeting search results for help with addiction is advised to contact industry regulator the Gambling Commission.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In doing so, they claim to have created the world\u0027s most efficient lithium-sulfur battery.“The world needs radical new\u0026nbspenergy storage technologies to fight climate change,” Dr Mahdokht\u0026nbspShaibani\u0026nbspfrom Monash University’s Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, who led the research, told\u0026nbspThe Independent. “Lithium-sulfur batteries, which use extremely high-capacity sulfur, can store five-times as much capacity as traditional lithium-ion batteries, and are made from cheap materials that are available worldwide.”Associate Professor Matthew Hill added: “This approach not only favours high performance metrics and long life cycle... it is also can lead to significant reductions in environmentally hazardous waste.”Battery breakthrough revolutionises recharge times for electric carsThe research, which is published in\u0026nbspScience Advances, could be a major milestone for the battery industry and could impact everything from consumer electronics to solar grids.Dr Shaibani\u0026nbspsaid the commercialisation of the batteries may be between two to four years away, and a\u0026nbsppatent for the manufacturing process has already been approved.Prototype cells have been developed in Germany and further testing in cars and solar grids is set to take place in Australia this year.“Cost projections and performance metrics of our technology predicts for outperforming today’s lithium-ion batteries at high competitive price points,” said Dr Shaibani.\u0026nbsp“Altogether, this means that solar power could be much more easily stored, or an electric vehicle go a lot further, but more importantly, the battery is safe, simple and ethical.”​Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It has a second season though, so he obviously doesn’t kill himself in the end – just like Jeffrey Epstein.“I know he’s your friend,” he added. “But I don’t care.”Taking aim at the lengths of The Irishman and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Gervais joked of the latter: “Nearly three hours long.

I saw one that said it was one of the worst things to happen to cats since dogs. But Dame Judi Dench defended the film. She said it was the role she was born to play. Because she loves nothing better than getting down on the carpet, lifting up her leg and licking her own m----.”The final word of Gervais’ Dench joke was bleeped during the show’s live broadcast on NBC, with cameras cutting to the shocked expression of Gwyneth Paltrow.Finally, Gervais talked about Apple, which has launched into the original programming business with The Morning Show. Gervais then delivered a withering put-down of Hollywood before exiting the stage.How the Golden Globes became one of the most prestigious award shows“Apple roared into the TV game with The Morning Show, a superb drama about the importance of dignity and doing the right thing,” he said. “Made by a company whose products are made by sweatshops in China.“Apple, Amazon, Disney. If ISIS started a streaming service, you’d all call your agents! So if you do win an award tonight, don’t use it as a platform to make a political speech, right? You’re in no position to lecture the public about anything. You know nothing about the real world. Most of you spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg. If you win, come up, accept your little award, thank your agent and your god, and f*** off.”The ceremony\u0027s top prizes went to First World War drama 1917 and Quentin Tarantino\u0027s\u0026nbspOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood, which won Best Film in their respective Drama and Comedy categories.Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u0026nbsptook home two prizes\u0026nbspfor her work on\u0026nbspFleabag\u0026nbspand, while accepting the trophy for Best TV Series – Comedy or Musical, cracked a\u0026nbspraunchy joke about Barack Obama.Find a full list of the evening\u0027s winners here.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He designed it, built it then realised it was far too savage and bitey to live in, say, Milton Keynes.Or the poisonous redback spider which likes to hide under lavatory seats so it can bite a man’s penis when he sits down to do his number twos. No way could God have that living in Europe or the US.He also made a lot of snakes. Some are very pretty and some are very impressive.But occasionally it all went wrong and he ended up with something that could kill a fully-grown man with one small bite. And again, these could not live in populated areas.He needed a home for all these things, so he made Australia.And to make sure people didn’t go there, he put a huge coral reef on the approaches and filled the interior with a sea of sand that goes on for ever.He even used this remote outpost to house some of his more ridiculous ideas. Stuff he came up with when he was drunk.Like those birds that can’t fly and that otter with a beak.Then you have the kangaroo, which gets about by bouncing, and the koala, which is permanently stoned and catches chlamydiaanyone ever picks it up.For millions of years, this big, sandy cupboard under the stairs went unnoticed.But then along came Captain Cook and now the world knows all about Oz and its stupid, dangerous creatures.Plainly, God is embarrassed. Because he’s decided to set fire to it.It’s been argued the fires raging across the country were caused by global warming or out-of-control barbies.But when you look at the footage, you know something biblical is going on.Those things are huge.Skies have been turned red by the flames. Choking smoke is blanketing millions of acres.Thousands of homes have been obliterated. And people are dying.This has happened before in recent years and there’s no doubt it will happen again.Which means people must accept that Australia isn’t meant for human habitation.Soyou’re reading this down there, please come home.You’ll like it. It never stops raining. And we are better at sport.DURING World War Two, General de Gaulle used London as a base and to say a belated thank you, current president Emmanuel Macron is thinking of giving the city France’s highest award for honour.Needless to say, lots of people are now jumping up and down in Paris saying the Legion d’Honneur cannot possibly be given to London as England and France are “hereditary enemies”.No we aren’t. Germany is our hereditary enemy and not just on the football pitch.France, meanwhile, is just some place we visit to buy cheese and wine.We have no idea what it’s like to fight France because it always surrenders before the battle’s got going.ALL of us begin a new decade with hope in our hearts that it’ll be better than the past one.Not me. This is thanks to two things.Firstly, there’s Libya. Since they shoved a scaffolding pole up Colonel Gaddafi’s bottom, it has been a lawless haven for terrorists and lunatics.Today it’s run by factions of the Judean People’s Front and the Popular Front For Judea, with one backed by Turkey and Qatar and the other backed by the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.There’s going to be a bloodbath. And this is a country less than  miles from mainland Europe.Which means we are going to have to get involved. Becausewe don’t, Russia will.That’s one reason, then, that I fear for the coming decade.The other is that at some point in the next ten years, statistically speaking, I am likely to die.TWENTY years ago, Britain created the perfect argument for not allowing anything to be nationalised or run by the Government.It was called The Dome.Created to mark the end of a millennium, it cost £million and was filled by right-on frizzy haired vegans with things no one wanted to see.There was a plastic human you could walk through, a multi-faith zone and lots of global warming malarkey.Unsurprisingly, it was a spectacular flop.So after a year, it was given away to a property company which turned it into the O, a music venue that now rakes in £million a year. Led Zeppelin had their reunion there.As I’ve always said, governments should put up park benches and run the nuclear submarines.And that’s it. Everything  should be run by the private sector.AS we all trudge back to work, with the fog making our hair frizzy and the puddles reminding us we need some new shoes, we will develop a teeth-rattling hatred for all those celebrities on Instagram who are frolicking in the Caribbean or sipping green juices on a beach in the Males.Amanda Holden. Pippa Middleton. Myleene Klass. Grrrr.Except,you think about it, you and I don’t have to find someone to put sun cream on our back five times a day.We aren’t being eaten alive by mosquitoes. And while a wet pavement isn’t very romantic, it’s better than hopping about, yelping, on a superheated white beach.Also, we will not have dicky tummies from the weird food, bad heads from the cocktails, puffy eyes from the jet lag and the constant worry we’ve been papped while bending over.And what’s more, we didn’t have to spend half an hour at an airport waiting for someone in a high-visibility jacket to take an X-ray photograph of our genitals.TECHNICALLY speaking, the fabulous goal scored by Wolves against Liverpool last weekend was not a goal at all.Because careful examination of the footage showed one of the players involved in the build-up was offside by .mm.It may have been three in the morning. The road may have been empty and the skies clear.

But it had to act rapidly.Iranian reprisals may be inevitable.But standing back hasn’t done the West much good.The mullahs at least now need to factor in a US President who’s more ruthless than the last.Three days ago Ayatollah Khamenei taunted him over the storming of the US embassy in Baghdad. “You can’t do anything,” he sneered.Trump’s put him straight there.  WHAT is this spell Labour’s Jess Phillips casts over Blairites and media pundits  We don’t get it.We do not doubt her hard work, nor that her heart is in the right place.Many naively believe her Brummie accent makes her the true voice of the working-class — this middle-class, grammar-schooled daughter of an NHS executive and a teacher.But that’s not our real beef.

If she’s really troubled about racism in the Labour Party, why did she spend the past three years campaigning to get anti-Semitic Jeremy Corbyn into Number  Andshe’s a serious contender for the leadership, why does she spend half her time doing interviews about herself for glossy magazines Yes, personal brand is important. Butthe country is really in the state Jess claims, shouldn’t she be busy fixing it The Labour leadership contender is determined to paint herself as “likeable” and “relatable” but, right now, she’s coming across as a vacuous narcissist. And a slippery one at that.The race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn has so far involved the candidates hamming up their northern accents, trying to out-working class each other, or desperately bigging up their woke credentials to the Press.No one has yet adopted a whippet or done a Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat MP and potential leadership hopeful who this week described herself out as “pansexual” — attracted to people regardless of sex — but it won’t be long now.For the casual bystander, it all makes for a good laugh. Emily Thornberry’s hysterical claim that her family was once so poor they had to put down a cat sounded so ridiculous in her cut-glass accent, it distracted commentators fromAngela Rayner’s far more legitimate tales of hardship — much to the comical irritation of the latter.For anyone serious about rebuilding the opposition, though, this farcical leadership race is no joke.While Labour contorts itself into a web of wokeness, the Conservatives are quietly cementing their new blue wall in the North.Why  Because outside leftie London and a few university towns, no one cares about tick-box ersity or even the le stories of politicians.Yes, having a “powerful backstory” is usefulyou want to make self-indulgent MPs weepy in the Commons, but it won’t persuade voters that you’re capable of getting things done.And as Boris Johnson proved so decisively last month, getting things done is what counts.The Eton and Oxford-educated Prime Minister looks and sounds nothing like most of the voters in Bishop Auckland or Redcar, but he persuaded them that he was serious about pulling Britain out of a rut.That, it turned out, was enough for an -seat majority.DOMINIC CUMMINGS is spot on: What this country needs is some more nerds.Stuffing the Civil Service full of people who meet gender and ersity quotas is all very well, butyou want employees who bring a fresh perspective, you need recruits who actually think dferently.A tech-obsessed -year-old who skipped university to pursue a career in coding could teach Whitehall’s swarms of humanities graduates a thing or two. And anyone prepared to give up a social le to work for the Government would likely do a far better job than the current civil servants who knock off at pm on a Friday.Bring on the geeks.The Opposition should now take a leaf out of his book.The last election was calamitous, yes, but with  per cent of the vote, Labour is still the second-largest party in British politics.That’s a powerful base for a recoveryit picks the right leader.The challenge is finding that person. As things stand, the field isn’t inspiring.Rebecca Long-Bailey — though a box-ticking superstar — doesn’t have the demonstrable competence that voters are yearning for from Labour.And poisonous Thornberry, who once tweeted a sneering comment about a Rochester home decorated with English flags, will repel patriotic voters.Butthe party is prepared to ditch the ersity nonsense and ignore pious pundits shrieking that the new leader “must be a woman”, the picture is rosier.The unbearably smug Keir Starmer — key player in the doomed People’s Vote campaign — would go down like a ton of bricks in Leave-voting areas.But someone like Dan Jarvis, who has called for Labour to make a “clean break” with the Corbyn era, may just have what it takes.Under Corbyn, Labour proved once and for all that wokeness doesn’t win elections.With the exception of naive students and hipster Londoners, voters don’t much care whether their politicians wear flat caps, headscarves or top hats. They just want politicians who are unafraid to act.So now MPs have a choice.Either they nominate duds with tear-jerking back- stories and shore up their majority in Putney — the right-on London seat which provided the only cause for celebration last time.Or they change tack, abandon wokery, and unearth a strong, competent leader, who might be up to the mammoth task of rebuilding the broken party.It really couldn’t be simpler.PO-FACED leftie commentators must stop laying in to journalists who call Boris “Boris” .They’ve been fighting a losing battle for years. And rightly so.Given Johnson is the third most common surname in the UK, it’s practical – not chummy – to call the Prime Minister by his much rarer Christian name.But, more importantly, the fact our PM is known by his first name on the world stage should be a source of pride to Brits.After three dreary years of Theresa May, Boris’s gravitas and quirky iniduality could hardly be more refreshing.It’s time to embrace it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So its announcement tonight that it will no longer keep up it end of the bargain comes as no surprise.Abutorabi said: “We can attack the White House itself, we can respond to them on the American soil. We have the power, and God willing we will respond in an appropriate time.“When someone declares war do you want to respond to the bullets with flowers  They will shoot you in the head.”The comments came after Trump issued a stark warning to Iran threatening to hit dozens of targets in the Islamic Republic “very fast and very hard”it retaliates for the targeted killing of Soleimani.And Iranian state TV also announced there has been an million bounty put on Trumps head.Trump tweeted that his administration had already targeted  Iranian sites, “some at a very high level  important to Iran  the Iranian culture.”Trump later blasted: The United States just spent Two Trillion Dollars on Military Equipment.  We are the biggest and by far the BEST in the World!If Iran attacks an American Base, or any American, we will be sending some of that brand new beautul equipment their way...and without hesitation!However, Irans army chief said Washington lacked the guts to go to war with his forces.I doubt they have the courage to initiate, said Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A study of , UK adults, whoaposve holidayed in the last year, found they spend  hours over a seven-day holiday - the equivalent of am until :pm - wasting time. The average holiday-goer spends nearly an hour a day venturing between their accommodation and sights,  minutes choosing what to do and researching places to eat, and nearly a quarter of an hour worrying about work. However, they still manage to squeeze in a -minute nap, nearly an hour and  minutes is dedicated to activities and sightseeing, and just over an hour a day is spent properly relaxing.  you donapost plan ahead, you might find yourself wasting your time away and not truly enjoying your break  Graham Donoghue, chief executive of Sykes Holiday Cottages, which commissioned the study, said: Thereaposs now so much choice when it comes to accommodation and activities that,you donapost plan ahead, you might find yourself wasting your time away and not truly enjoying your break. A little time spent researching restaurants in advance and deciding what to do can make a big dference to your holiday. Itaposs really worth it when you think about how easy it is to find recommendations and make bookings online. The study also found that, despite spending more than an hour a day going for walks,  per cent of travellers would like to enjoy more of this during a break away. And regardless of a similar amount of time spent eating out, two-fths would like to devote more of their vacation hours indulging in delicious restaurant dishes.  A quarter of holidaymakers think they squander too much time deciding what to do, and the same amount reckon they spend more time doing what others want - than what theyaposd prefer themselves. As a result,  per cent have argued with people theyaposve holidayed with over plans for the trip ahead. In fact, before the break has even begun, adults say they spend two and half hours planning their break, with a third thinking planning is key to having a successful holiday. However, working long hours, looking after children and getting chores done at home are among the barriers to holiday-goers being able to plan in advance. More than one in  will even expect someone  to take the reins, while nearly a fth leave things to the last minute when itaposs often too late to make any advance plans.

Toni Vernelli, international head of communications and marketing at Veganuary, said: For all of the important issues that Veganuary - and most vegans - are trying to address through their food choices it makes absolutely no dference whether the plant-based patty is cooked separately or on the same grill as the meat. What does make a big dference to animals and the planet is when non-vegans choose a plant-based menu option, enjoy it and then order it again.

Because the couple’s first wedding took place in  and ended in a painful orce back in . And for nearly  years the pair, who had three children together, never spoke. They even stood at opposite sides of the football pitch whenever they watched youngest son Adam play. They also managed to get through two of their boys’ weddings without saying a word to each other. But it was tragedy that brought them back together, with Jan consoling Rob over the loss of his second we.  It made the pair, now , realise le was too short for their rt to go on – and that the love sparked when they met at a Woolworths store as teenagers was still burning. Rob says: “Jan was my first love and we will be growing old together as I definitely can’t afford another wedding – or a orce.” And Jan, who had the ceremony she dreamed of second time around in , says: “We married in a registry office first time. This time I wore a big white dress and we got married in a church. “Our children,  grandchildren and one great-grandchild were with us. It was perfect and I’m back with my best friend.” The lovebirds first met in  in the days of flares and s at a Woollies store in Erdington, Birmingham. Jan worked in the office and Rob in the stockroom. Within a year they were dating. Jan recalls: “Rob and I were just . I was a cashier and he was pretty much my bodyguard, going round the tills with me collecting money twice a day. “He asked me out at a works Christmas dance. Our first date was watching a film we hadn’t realised was X-rated and there were quite a few men wearing flasher macs in the cinema. “We had to leave but we didn’t stop laughing.” The couple moved in together at . “I fell pregnant and our parents weren’t happy but it was planned,” Jan said. “We were excited about the future. “We got married soon after I turned  in September . “I had a white dress, but not a proper wedding one, and I was five- and-a-half months pregnant.”  Daughter Cara was born on Christmas Day and the couple went on to have Lee, now , and Adam, now . But  years into their marriage, cracks started to show. Jan was made redundant from her job in Boots and started working shts at another company. She and Rob barely saw each other. She says: “I absolutely loved working at Boots and I think I had a bit of a breakdown after being made redundant. “Rob was always saying he didn’t see enough of me in my new job. I was working until  at night. We started arguing about that a lot and I just got fed up. I left and we didn’t speak properly again for years.” The couple separated in  and Rob filed for a orce, which came through in . Both met new partners and Rob remarried two-and-a-half years after their split. Rob says: “I never thought I’d find love again, but I did. My second we was an absolutely wonderful woman.” Although Rob and Jan’s paths crossed occasionally, they didn’t speak for years.  Jan says: “Adam played football and we’d both go and watch him, standing at opposite sides of the pitch. It was strange. We even made it through two of our sons’ weddings without talking. “Lee was married first. Rob and I were both with dferent people and just sat in dferent places. “When our son Adam had a wedding reception, again we didn’t talk to each other.“The only time we ever did wasafter we lost a grandchild. I was in hospital, crying.“Rob put his arm around me and said, ‘It’ll be OK, sweetheart’. I don’t know why we never talked.” That all changed in  when their daughter Cara told her mum that Rob’s we had died of oian cancer. The tragedy broke the ice.  “I gave him a call and offered my condolences and said I was there for himhe needed me,” says Jan. “A couple of weeks later, he gave me a call and we chatted for  minutes and arranged to see each other for a coffee. “I found it was like being back with my best friend. It was so bizarre – we picked up where we had left off  years earlier.” Rob says: “It was wonderful. We just started to get along like we always had done.” The couple decided to start seeing each other again – but kept it from their children until Jan ended the relationship she was in.

Dave Clarke, , was found collapsed in his living room by we Rachel after she rushed to see what when she heard him say oh okay. Paramedics tried to save him but he was pronounced dead at hospital. The cause of his death is unknown and Rachel and the coupleaposs two sons Daniel,  and Joseph, , are waiting for post-mortem results, the Liverpool Echo reported.  Rachel, of Garston, Merseyside, who works as a mental health nurse, said in a touching tribute to her husband, that Dave was a a man who tackled everything with a smile. She said: He was loving, kind and funny. There wasnapost a day that went by when he didnapost laugh, even with everything that was going on. We were like a tag team. I can count on one hand how many times we argued. We never fell out, it was a textbook marriage. It was everybodyaposs dream marriage. On the day she found that Dave had collapsed at home, Rachel said she went into nurse mode, having only completed a refresher course in immediate le support the week before. She said: When I came into the living room I thought he was having a fit, heaposd collapsed on the sofa. I picked up the phone and rang  and then I opened the front door so they could get in when they arrived. I started doing CPR on him and then when the paramedics came they took over. They worked on him for about  minutes, they were just amazing. By the time we got to hospital I knew he wasnapost going to come back because I work in brain injury rehabilitation. Back in , Dave was diagnosed with a rare form of muscular dystrophy which affected his ability to walk and resulted in him having to wear ankle supports to keep his limbs in the right position.  The -year-old, who worked as a light and sound engineer at the Philharmonic Hall, eventually had to leave his job as a result of the condition. Since Daveaposs death, a Go Fund Me page has been set up by Rachelaposs cousin Rebecca to help ease financial pressures for the bereaved family. Rachel said: He was such a calm person who tackled everything with a smile even though he was in so much pain constantly. He was always there to help me up when I was having a bad day and help me to put one foot in front of the other. His job got too physical for him eventually and we needed someone to be at home to be there for our eldest son who has autism, so it made sense for him to come out of work. After leaving his job at the Philharmonic, Dave began training to be a teacher through an Open University course and later at Edge Hill University.  Rachel said: He really wanted to be a physics teacher at secondary school, he had the patience of a saint. Rachel said her sons are utterly devastated and are both grieving for their dad in their own way, adding they have both been amazing. I couldnapost have wished for a better daddy for the boys. We did all kinds with them, we went to Lego Land, Alton Towers and Majorca, wherever we went we would try to make a holiday out of it.

It was the happiest day of the -year-oldaposs le and came  years after he began to dream of becoming a boy as a four-year-old girl called Connie. Billy-Joe, originally from Cardf, had lived a le filled with confusion and unhappiness, one attempted suicide, numerous surgeries, two engagements and a move to another continent, Wales Online reports. But everything changed when Kristen, , who lived in Kentucky, contacted him on Facebook after watching his YouTube channel.He said: “I friend zoned her for fear of not changing my le and she was living in the US, but she said she wanted to fly over to the UK to meet me. In November , she booked her flights and the pair spent five days exploring Cardf together. “I knew I liked her but I didn’t know how or what to do with those feelings,” said Billy-Joe. “The day after she left, I called her and told her how I felt and within six weeks she had quit her job, sold her house and came over to the UK to be with me. Billy-Joe started taking male hormones when he was  and had a double mastectomy in . He is now in the final stages of his transition.But his final operation is on hold to recover his mental health after a traumatic round of surgeries. Speaking about his plan to have a fully-ing penis, Billy-Joe, added: “I couldnapost carry on living with a vagina basically. I knew I wanted to have a penis created and my vagina taken away because I felt it would complete me. I never had real doubts or worries about it, even before I knew what it involved, I just knew I needed it and had to have it. The phalloplasty - a series of four operations - was supposed to be the final step for Billy-Joe. When Billy-Joe signed up for the surgery in late  that should have been the final step in his transition, but he contracted an infection that halted it. For the first round, the skin from under his bellybutton was rolled together - like a Swiss roll - and stitched up again to make the main part of the penis. Then surgeons cut skin from the sides of his stomach to cover the exposed flesh. The following days were agony for Billy-Joe. He remembered: It took six to seven weeks for me to stand up straight.  Most of all, he was looking forward to peeing standing up. He said: Stuff naturally born males take for granted. Since I was a kid I thought why canapost I stand up to pee  Itaposs something that affects my dysphoria quite a lot. For me personally itaposs a massive deal.  During the next phase of operations Billy-Joe was to have a system of pumps and tubes inserted in order to have an erection. After the operation he was instructed to keep his new penis erect for six weeks, to stop any scar tissue forming. However, in the days following the operation he suffered an intense pain caused by an infection.  The only option was to remove the pump. He added: “I got to the final hurdle and then it failed. I had let go of all my strength. I didn’t realise how much of an impact it was having mentally until they said they were taking it out. “They were like no worries, we’ll just do it again but I had given up. I mentally couldn’t take any more surgery. I decided to delay the final op. Then I moved to America. I don’t know when I will be back.” In the meantime, Billy-Joe has been focusing on setting up his new le after marrying Kristen July  in the USA in a low key ceremony.

He smiled as the couple exchanged words on their way to the service. The mother-of-threeaposs outfit resembled that of the Queen, , who wore a tasteful plum skirt and jacket ensemble, along with a matching hat. Their appearance at church today is unusual as they do not often join the Queen, apart from on the first service of the year. Onlookers stood on the grass as the royal couple arrived to attend the church service. Also there was the Cambridgeaposs friend Rose Hanbury, who could be seen dressed in a navy coat and brown faux fur hat.

Celebrity and portrait photographer Rachell Smith said the Duchess of Cambridge has adopted a similar style to the Queen by perfecting her royal wave, as well as her walk, to be photographed.

Rilba Jones, , and Mary Brand, , met up after they uploaded their DNA to a genealogy website and discovered each other, despite living , miles apart. Rilba had always questioned the truth about who her dad was, after being told by her mother that he was a Flight Lieutenant killed during WWII when she was just two. Her suspicions proved to be correct, when it was revealed that her real dad - John Norman Harris - was a war-time hero who played a part in the famous “Wooden Horse” escape from German prisoner-of-war camp Stalag Luft III. Rilba’s attempts to investigate the matter were always rebuffed by her mum. But her daughters, Charlotte and Harriet, bought her an  ancestry  membership for Christmas in  and she made the “le-changing” discovery. In a twist of fate, Mary Brand, from Ontario, Canada, had also been searching for long-lost family when she found her English half-sister. Mrs Brand made multiple attempts to get in contact after Rilba was flagged up as a potential first cousin - but Mrs Jones ignored them believing they were a scam.  Desperate for a response, Mrs Brand asked her daughter to send a last ditch message to seeshe’d get a response which prompted Mrs Jones to put her own daughter on the case. Just a few days later Mrs Jones received a phone call from her daughter Harriet who revealed that “I found your dad”. Mrs Jones, a retired nurse, from Hull, east Yorkshire, said: “I’ve wondered all my le about my identity and this has been le changing.  “All of sudden Mary’s at my doorstep and I couldn’t have felt more at home. “It’s better late than never. I couldn’t believe it, I’d been waiting for this moment for over  years. “I was so pleased to learn who my father was - he led such an interesting le and was a war hero.”  Daughters Harriet, , and Charlotte, , thought the gt could help their mum find answers she’d sought after he whole le. Harriet said: “When we bought my mum the DNA test I secretly longed for answers about her identity. “I wanted them for her, because I knew she was troubled by not knowing. Six months after giving the test to her the answers came.” Rilba was told her father was Flight Lieutenant Blair White, who was shot down and killed in the invasion of Sicily in , when she was just two.  But when she was  she was sent into a back bedroom as a punishment where she discovered an account which had been locked away which revealed her mother’s secret pregnancy and subsequent efforts by relatives to find a “suitable” husband. When she confronted her mum with her new information, she was immediately shut down and they never spoke about it again. Her real father was Flight Lieutenant Harris, who left Canada to join the RAF in  - and probably met Mrs Jones’ mother when he was being treated for injuries at Torbay Hospital in Torquay in .

MasterChef host Marcus Wareing, who runs Michelin-starred restaurant Marcus, has shared his mash method in his new book Marcus Everyday. Mashed potato, a British dinner staple, are usually served as a side dish to meat or vegetables and can be made using peeled or unpeeled potatoes. Milk, butter, salt and pepper are frequently used in preparation to add flavour to the mash. But itaposs not easy to perfect. In his recipe compilation, the cook urges readers to follow three steps. “Cut evenly, cook evenly and don’t rush”, he advises. The TV chef adds that many make the mistake of cutting their potatoes to dferent sizes, the Daily Star reports. Other common errors people make are boiling them too quickly and failing to leave them to rest. Here are some of the cookaposs tips for a perfect mash... . Cut the potatoes evenly  Marcus Wareing says it is important to peel the potatoes cleanly, then wash them and make sure they are cut into evenly sized piece. This is because,they are dferent sizes, the smaller pieces will overcook and they will absorb water, which can make your mash tasteless. . Boil them slowly The potatoes need to be cooked in salted water at a slow boil. If boiled fast, the outside will be overcooked before the middle of the potato chunks is cooked through. This will create dferent consistency in your mash and make it unpleasant. . Leave them to rest  Once the potatoes are cooked, you should drain and leave them for a good five minutes. After shaking them around, you can put them back in the pan, off the heat. Once they have rested, the potatoes are ready to be mashed to your liking, adding butter, cheese or herbs. A potato ricer helps in the process of making mashed potato. Most people use Russets for mashed potatoes because of their high starch and low water content, according to Simply Recipes . Yukon Golds, which are a little more expensive than Russets, are another popular alternative as they are naturally creamy when mashed and have a slightly buttery flavour of their own. Marcus explains: “First, peel the potatoes cleanly, then wash them and cut them all into evenly sized pieces, otherwise the smaller potato pieces will overcook, and before they break they will absorb water, which will make your mash watery and tasteless.  “Boil them in salted water at a slow boil – a fast boil will overcook the outside before the middle of the potato chunks are cooked through you don’t want lumps of overcooked potato in your mash. “Once the potatoes are cooked all the way through, but not quite falling apart, drain and leave them for a good five minutes, then shake them around and put them back in the pan, off the heat. “The potatoes should then be hot enough to take the butter on board.

Maxine Laceby worked in sales until she was  and then became a full-time mum to her two daugters. After Darcy, , and Margot,  left home to go to university, Maxine decided to do a university fine art degree. Her degree made her think about her lestyle and she started brewing broth to improve her hair and skin, Birmingham Live reports. To make the broth, Maxine simmered chicken feet and pigs trotters in pans at home for hours to make a gelatinous stock which she drank. Her friends noticed the broth was making her hair and skin glow, and they soon started asking for her secret remedy. Maxine then knew the product had potential so she bottled it and launched her company Absolute Collagen. Now, with the help of her daughters Darcy, , and Margot, , her company Absolute Collagen is set to turnover £ million in just three years. “My second project at uni was all about being the person I am and so I stripped back, let my hair go grey, wore no make-up and dowdy clothes,” said Maxine, now  and from Wolverhampton, West Midlands. “It made me realise how desperately insecure I felt about how I looked and it made me rethink everything about myself. I went through an emotional and spiritual period of putting myself together and that included looking at what I was putting into my body.” Maxineaposs broth dramatically changed her hair and skin - and her friends were soon knocking on her door asking her to make them soon. “People said you look sparkling, what are you doing ” said Maxine, “my skin was glowing, my hair was shiny. The only thing I could attribute it to was the broth. “I looked into it and realised it was the collagen in the bone broth that was having an effect so I began making massive vats of it at home, like some kind of white witch, and I’d have friends banging on my door for my booty! she laughed.  Realising she was onto something, Maxine researched the collagen supplement market and found that many products available contained small amounts of collagen and that she wanted to create a product that would contain the maximum amount of marine collagen that could be absorbed into the bloodstream - for the minimum price. “When I was a  child , we were always on the breadline, she said, my mum earned a minimum wage her whole le. As a six-year-old I remember walking round department stores wondering why my mum couldn’t afford the same products as other mums.” Maxine telephoned the Food Standards Agency and told it she was onto a great product but didn’t know where to start. The person she spoke to was both helpful and excited about her product and advised her on the governing bodies she needed to talk to. Maxine found a ‘blender’ to help her to make sachets she could distribute that were palatable and not too gloopy to drink.  “He told me I could add less collagen and make more money but it was never about money, I wanted results. It was about finding a product that I knew worked and to bring it to as many people as possible. “People told me I was selling it too cheap but I don’t think beauty should be pocket deep. So I knew I couldn’t afford a retail store or a distributor and that I’d have to do it myself from home. I spoke to competitors and they told me I was a little fish in a big lake and that I’d get eaten alive. “But I could see there were faults in all of the products out there. I think mums are very solution-focused, we will always find a way.”  In May , Maxine launched her website Absolute Collagen so that people could buy her supplements from her directly and she began to market it via social media. At the end of her first financial year, she had turned over an amazing half a million pounds. In the second year that rose to two and a half million and now she’s on track to turnover £ million by the end of her third financial year, having just successfully launched in the USA. It’s all from one product that’s  per cent natural and sold in recyclable sachets, she said. “It just grew and grew. I used an app whereby every time a sale came though, you’d hear a ping and, when it got to the stage where it was pinging all the time, my daughter said I reckon you’re onto something here. She went onto do her university dissertation on our product.”  Darcy and Margot now work with their mum, helping her with marketing and shipping some , products a year from their home in Wolverhampton. They have now bought a premises in Telford as they were getting swamped by their stock and are planning to move into there in March. “We don’t out source the distribution because that would put a barrier between us and the customer, she said. Doing it this way means we can add in hand written notes and little gts like home fragrance. We also make sure we reply to every single message we receive, I think that’s really important.” Maxine’s Absolute Collagen costs £. for a box of  daily sachets when bought as a subscription, or £. for non-subscribers. She has dyslexia  and ADHD, which she sees as a positive as it means she sees things dferently to others. “I have to read things over and over and I know I couldn’t just write a blog without getting someone to go through it, which is annoying as I love writing, she explained. “My mum was illiterate so I always assumed I had poor reading and writing because of that. It wasn’t until I went to university aged  that I was diagnosed but looking back it was obvious. Both my children are dyslexic too.  “I see it as a gt because it means I have the confidence to ask for help. I’ve always had to and I’ve always had to say when I don’t understand something. “I adored every moment of being a stay at home mum but I always knew I would do something, evenI didn’t know what that would be. She added: So many people feel they have nowhere to go once their children have flown the nest but  is young nowadays. Going to uni and starting a business at  excited me so much. And now my kids work with me too.

Soleimani, commonly thought of as the second most powerful man in Iran, was killed in Iraq in a US drone strike at a convoy at Baghdad airport on Friday. The military commander was killed alongside Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy commander of Iran-backed militias in Iraq known as the PMF. Now a video has been shared on Twitter by Babak Taghvae, who describes himself as defence analyst, showing five coffins placed on seats of a plane - allegedly including the bodies of Soleimaniaposs and al-Muhandis.

Commonly bodies are shipped via cargo  planes but it appears Iranian authorities may have decided to put the men on seats as a mark of respect. It comes after Soleimaniaposs body was transported through the Iranian city of Mashhad earlier today as part of a grand funeral procession across the Islamic Republic.  Mourners crowded around military personnel in Mashad unloading Soleimaniaposs casket covered with an Iranian flag from a plane at Ahvaz International Airport in Tehran. A tide of mourners chanted furiously as his coffin was driven through tens of thousands in the streets of the southwestern city Ahvaz where funeral processions began. Live footage aired on state TV showed mourners wearing black and beating their chests as they walked through the streets. Crowds furiously chanted aposDeath to Americaapos as they paraded the slain military commander.  Iranian leaders have vowed to avenge the death of the -year-old, who was esteemed as the countryaposs second most powerful figure after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Christopher Pickering, , and girlfriend Rebecca Cross, , pleaded guilty to being drunk on a British Airways plane to Marseille, France last year. The passengers had booked seats on the emergency exit row near the wings, but cabin crew at Heathrow decided they were too intoxicated to sit there for safety reasons and were moved to the back row. Prosecutor Ravinder Johal told a court as the plane taxied down near the runway at around .pm on September , a cabin crew member saw Cross with her stockings off and her legs high in the air. Pickering was viewed as having his hand in her crotch area, but as authorities could not decide what the randy pair were up to, they were only charged with entering an aircraft when drunk. Mr Johal said: The defendants were due to take the British Airways flight to Marseille in France departing at .pm. Valerie Hughes, an experienced cabin crew member, gave instructions that Mr Pickering and Miss Cross was not to be sat in the emergency exit seats due to their state of intoxication. They were assigned seats in the back and she observed they were stumbling and drunk. Mr Pickering had dficulty loading their luggage in the baggage compartment. She did hear that they said aposf***ersapos every other word. She felt that they shouldnapost be allowed to remain on the flight, but were in fact seated in the th row.  A member of the public was moved from their seat to not cause offence. Ms Hughes noticed Miss Cross had her legs hanging, they were open wide and raised in the air. The court heard how the couple were confronted and then  taken to the London Heathrow police station and admitted to the charge. Pickering, of Dunstable in Bedfordshire, and Cross, of Abingdon, Oxfordshire, said they had five or six drinks in the lounge in two hours while they waited for the delayed flight. A consideration for an adjournment was made at Uxbridge Magistrates Court on December  to file for the separate charge of indecent exposure, but this was discarded following the coupleaposs guilty pleas. Carl Woolf, defending both Cross and Pickering, said: There is a sexual aspect of the matter. There was no formal review in the magistrates court. I have been in contact with the Crown Prosecution Service and confirmed that there is to be no additional charge with outraging public decency.  Itaposs very clear from the air stewardess there was some amorous behaviour, but she didnapost directly see any masturbation or penetration. Mr Woolf noted that Cross had previously pleaded guilty for a drink driving charge in July . She was disqualied from driving for  months and had completed  hours of unpaid service in October last year. Mr Woolf, in mitigation, said: Itaposs right to say that following both of their interviews they both ed to the airport the next day. Mr Pickering purchased flights at cost of £ onto Marseille as he was meeting a client there and Miss Cross and he were allowed to fly. Subsequently theyaposve had the banning order from British Airways for  months. There has been no issues whatsoever since that time, and both of them regularly travel for work. He added: This was a flight that was delayed by two to three hours. That was the reason why both these defendants sat in the lounge and consumed alcohol to excess. Mr Pickering flies many flights a year which does not suggest this was a problem in the past.  They were travelling together and once they had been seated at the rear of the plane, in effect privacy, they were amorous. I make it clear there was no suggestion of any nudity and there is no suggestion she was not wearing underwear. It was not appropriate behaviour on a plane, but as they say in their letter they are thoroughly ashamed and thoroughly apologetic. Pickering, who is listed as being the director of a consultancy firm on Companies House, was said to have a substantial income, paying large school fees for his children and financially supporting his ex-we. Cross, who wore a white blouse, black coat and red trousers, broke down in sobs after Judge Nicholas Wood, at Isleworth Crown Court, after she was told she would not face a custodial sentence for breaching the community order. Judge Wood said: Iaposm not considering a custodial sentence, either immediate or suspended. I am considering either a community order or a fine. I consider the previous order expired.

The festive blackout was a total disaster for parents-of-three Andrew and Rhonda Robinson who were left very very angry and having to find old-fashioned means of entertaining their restless kids. The couple, from Dunston, Gateshead, near Newcastle upon Tyne, were forced to buy a disposable mobile phone to use in the house. The familyaposs three mobile phones are all on Sky packages and use the Wi to boost their signal but with the internet connection cut off none of them could use their mobiles at home, reports the Newcastle Chronicle.Andrew and Rhonda said they even resorted to emailing the companyaposs chief executive after repeatedly getting told dferent things. Nine-year-old son Thomas has severe learning dficulties and relies on access to the internet, with his parents having bought him a new tablet for Christmas which he couldnapost use for more than a week until the issue was resolved. The couple claim theyaposd initially been told their service was due for a routine update at the end of November, but the changes were beset with faults. Eventually, they say, the entire package was cut off meaning they lost access to their landline phone, internet and Sky television channels. And despite apologies from Sky and automatic compensation due to the family, as well as cash to cover extra expenditure, they remain unimpressed.  The provider said the problem was down to an issue with systems at Openreach, which maintains phone cables and infrastructure. Andrew, who pays roughly £ a month for Sky Q, broadband, and three Sky mobile phones, attempted to cancel the service and sign up with a new provider but this was left in limbo behind all the requests to fix the initial problems. A BT Openreach engineer was finally sent out on January  to fix the problem, with the family also offered £ in a aposgoodwill gestureapos as well as a WiFi hotspot and an offer to refund their mobile packages. The -year-old dad said: We kept getting told, aposyouaposll get an update in a week, youaposll get it in two weeksapos. We kept getting told dferent things. We had got to the stage of emailing the chief executive of Skyaposs office directly, just to get someone from the customer service team to deal with us. It got to the point where we had no internet, no phone - it ruined the bairnaposs Christmas. He got a tablet for Christmas and he couldnapost use it, and we couldnapost explain that to him in a way he could understand. We are very, very angry.

Sugar Hut in Brentwood, Essex, which is famous for being a favourite haunt for start of  The Only Way Is Essex, was packed with people celebrating . But dozens of clubbers have become violently sick in the days since and have accused the venue on social media of having poor hygiene standards, with some calling for it to be shut down, Essex Live reports. Party goers complained of vomiting and diarrhea, as well as painful stomach cramps, and some have claimed they were sent home from work. The cause of the sickness remains unknown, but both those who drank at the venue and those who didnapost have claimed to have fallen ill. But Dan Perrin, group music and events director at the club, said the club has good hygiene standards and pointed out the bug is contagious andspreads from person to person, not from ice machines or things like poisoned drinks. Dan said in a tweet: Ok guys so this is the full statement. This isn’t just us saying it, it’s also the informed opinion of the authorities which is why it took a while to release. Obviously we won’t ever say something that’s not true and checked This will be our last public comment on it. From the NHS website: How norovirus can spread Norovirus can spread very easily. You can catch norovirus from:close contact with someone with norovirus touching surfaces or objects that have the virus on them, then touching your mouth eating food thataposs been prepared or handled by someone with norovirusIn other words this is a contagious virus much like a common cold in that is spreads from person to person not from ice machines, air conditioning units, faulty dishwasher machines or poisoned drinks .  We donapost serve food so that leaves either person-to-person or from surfaces. You will, Iaposm sure, have seen that we have cleaners through the night but obviously we canapost clean every surface every time someone touches it anywhere in the venues. Basically it is very annoying and lame but itaposs just bad luck and aposone of those thingsapos. Now, I totally understand it is a nightmare to be ill at the start of the yearand can also see why you would assume it is something wrong at the venue. I would probably have jumped to the same conclusion so thataposs no problem.  Most of you were very cool and reasonable in the circumstances. Obvs [sic] youaposre going to be a bit annoyed and I also get that when something like this happens youaposre going to make memes . However, there is a small percentage who got very nasty. Calling for the venue to be shut down on total assumptions is pretty wrong. That is peopleaposs jobs and livelihoods at stake not to mention your local club.  It is easy to get away with mob or bullying mentality on social media but try to remember there are real people on the other end of your comments and real consequences. As it turned out, this could have happened anywhere - in your house, at work, wherever. Dan said his statement was from him personally and not on behalf of the club, becauseit was a Sugar Hut statement he would probably have to sugar coat it a bit.

Louise Jordan, , said that something inside told her that she should pay a visit to the optician - an instinct that led to the medical procedure which hurt like hell. The mum-of-two, from Bloxwich, West Midlands, thought that her eyes were completely fine, but when she spotted a letter from the optician, she booked in for a check up just to be on the safe side. After doing a full eye scan in June last year, optometrist Taj Showker quickly realised things werenapost as they should be. There was a suspicious lesion on the back of Louiseaposs right eye and she was referred straight to the doctor at the Nuffield Hospital in Wolverhampton for further tests. Louise was diagnosed with a choroidal melanoma - a cancer affecting part of the eye. Medics discovered a tumour at the back of her right eye. She was warned they needed to operate to attach a radiotherapy plaque, emitting eye- sparing low energy radiation therapy for  hours.  The procedure involved Louise being placed under general anaesthetic and having her eye clamped open, before surgeons used a scalpel to split open her eye, go underneath her eyelid and slide a plaque with radioactive seeds on one side of it behind her eye and sewing it there - aiming the seeds at the tumour. She said: I couldnapost see what they were doing, but it hurt like hell. Louiseaposs husband could only visit her in hospital for a couple of hours at a time, meaning she spent a lonely four days in bed following her procedure. She will not know until her next appointment in Novemberthe treatment was a success. If the radiotherapy hasnapost worked she could lose her eye.  She will have her final check up to make sure she is clear of the cancer later this year. Louise said: It was such a shock. Having no symptoms at all, you never anticipate something like this. Iaposm glad I caught it in time becausenot I could have gone blind.

The billionaire paedophileaposs death was officially ruled as suicide by hanging at Manhattan politan Correctional Center, despite speculation and conspiracy theories he was murdered. The graphic photos show the deep bloodied cut to the -year-oldaposs neck and the severed neck bone, as well as strips of orange sheet fashioned into nooses, with one looped through a bed post inside his cell. Obtained by  Minutes and broadcast for the first time in America on Sunday, the images were captured last August with Epstein having taken his own le while awaiting trial on child sex trafficking charges. They also show other bed sheets strewn across the floor, fragments of material dangling from a window, his body on a trolley and a handwritten note complaining about conditions.  Almost three months on from the disgraced financieraposs death, Dr Michael Baden, who was hired by the paedophileaposs brother, Mark, to observe the post-mortem, suggested Epstein could have been strangled by someone in his cell.  In an interview with Fox News, Dr Baden - a former coroner in New York - rejected the official findings and claimed Epsteinaposs body bore telltale signs of homicide. The -year-old said Epstein had two fractures on the left and right sides of his larynx, specically the Adam’s apple, and a broken left hyoid bone above the Adam’s apple. Dr Baden, who has probed cases involving OJ Simpson, President John F Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jnr, said: “I think that the evidence points toward homicide rather than suicide.  “Those three fractures are extremely unusual in suicidal hangings and could occur much more commonly in homicidal strangulation. In his -year career he has not seen a suicidal hanging case where those injuries have occurred, he said, adding: “Hanging does not cause these broken bones. Homicide does.” There were also haemorrhages in Epstein’s eyes that were common in homicidal strangulation and uncommon in suicidal hangings, he added.  Dr Baden, a Fox News contributor, claimed there were signs of “unusual” activity “from day one” of the autopsy. New Yorkaposs medical examiner has not yet responded to his claims. He called for a fresh investigation into Epsteinaposs death, saying a number of people would have to be involvedit was a homicide. Evidence on the ligature could help to prove whether someone was involved in Epsteinaposs death.  The expert also cited a “total breakdown in security” around Epsteinaposs cell and rejected claims that the guards had fallen asleep as two CCTV cameras maled. Dr Baden said his own investigation is not complete. He has examined more than , bodies during his career and hosted the HBO programme Autopsy.  Just weeks before his death, Epstein was found on the floor of his cell with marks around his neck in what was thought to be a possible suicide attempt at the time. He was put on suicide watch but removed a week later. He was not sharing a cell with another prisoner at the time of his death. The guards responsible for keeping an eye on Epstein the night he killed himself have been charged with falsying records and conspiracy.

They have these massive eyes, bunched up noses - the condition is called brachycephalism.

On Sunday officials in Tehran announced the country would no longer comply with limits agreed to in the  nuclear deal, two days after General Qassem Soleimani was killed in a US drone strike. While the country looks to start the fuel enrichment essential for nuclear weapon development, the battle against ISIS is set to stall - and the radical fundamentalists could regroup. Iraqaposs parliament has backed a bill calling for the expulsion of all US troops from Iraqi soil, meaning the effort to keep the remaining ISIS forces at bay could be seriously hindered. Today the US announced that it had paused its anti-ISIS efforts, “subject to continuous review.” In the wake of the announcement the UK Government has urged Iraq to allow UK soldiers to continue the fight there against the terrorist group. The resolution, which was not legally binding but will likely be heeded by Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdihad, was passed on Sunday. Some  UK troops are stationed in Iraq in the fight against IS, while the US has ,, prompting fears of a withdrawal that could cripple the battle against the terror group.  A UK Government spokesman said: The coalition is in Iraq to help protect Iraqis and others from the threat from Daesh , at the request of the Iraqi government. We urge the Iraqi government to ensure the coalition is able to continue our vital work countering this shared threat. As much as the expulsion of US troops is the more pressing matter, the ripping up of the  nuclear deal could lead to far more devastating consequences.  Following y negotiations with President Barrack Obamaaposs administration, Iran agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors infor the lting of crippling economic sanctions.

General Soleimani, head of Iranaposs elite Quds Force, was seen smiling as he embraced Hezbollahaposs Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah during a meeting in Beirut. The military chief is also seen praying in the images - understood to have been taken last week - which were released by Iranian media on Sunday. Secretary-General Nasrallah has vowed to avenge his friendaposs death, saying US forces would pay the price for the drone strike that killed General Soleimani near Baghdadaposs airport last Friday. He said in a televised speech: The American army killed them and it will pay the price. The only just punishment isAmerican military presence in the region: US military bases, US warships, each and every officer and soldier in the region. He said US civilians, including businessmen, engineers, journalists and doctors, should be spared.  He added: When the coffins of American soldiers and officers... start toto the United States,Trump and his administration will realise they have lost the region. The Hezbollah leader also called on Iraq to free itself of the American occupation. Hezbollah has been deemed a terrorist organisation by the US, UK and the Arab League.  General Soleimani was killed in a strike on his convoy after landing at Baghdadaposs airport, sending the Iran-US conflict into unprecedented territory amid a spiralling crisis. Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis was also killed. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, meanwhile, has finally broken his silence on the strike and the growing crisis in the Middle East following his Caribbean holiday.  The PM had faced criticism over his silence and his refusal to cut short his trip to Mustique. In a statement released on Sunday evening, Mr Johnson did not condemn Mr Trumpaposs actions, saying: Today I have spoken with President Macron, President Trump and Chancellor Merkel, and will be speaking with other leaders in the coming days. General Qassem Soleimani posed a threat to all our interests and was responsible for a pattern of disruptive, destabilising behaviour in the region. Given the leading role he has played in actions that have led to the deaths of thousands of innocent civilians and western personnel, we will not lament his death.

That was a dficult time.“We’ve had loads of ups and downs but the past year is certainly one, for the first half of it anyway, we want to put behind us as quickly as possible.“With the recent bit of form and positivity, we take that into  and kick on.”Dundee start the year with three home matches on the bounce, firstly against potential play-off rivals Caley Thistle and Ayr United before they welcome high-flying Premiership side Motherwell to Dens Park for a Scottish Cup tie.“We have dficult games coming up. We have three games at home now and we need to get back to making this place a fortress,” Kerr added.“I said it at the start of the season that,we wanted to do anything in this league, we’ve got to make our home form much better than it has been.“It is better than it has been over the past year but it’s still not where we want it to be.“That’s something we are working so hard every day to put right.“Every game we go into, we expect ourselves to win. That’s not being arrogant or cocky but what Dundee should be aiming for.“There needs to be a realisation of how good this squad can be.”And Kerr says the second half against league leaders United last Friday gives everyone associated with the club belief they can start looking upwards.“There was a wee realisation after the game we could have taken three points.“The boys have spoken since and we’re starting to realise how well we can do as a team.“After we got the goal at Tannadice, there was a belief on the pitch and I think the fans felt that.“Even when the board went up for how long was left, the fans still thought we could win it.“Hopefully, that is a wee turning point for us – it needs to be going forward.“There has been a lot of disappointment, a lot of games where we have huffed and puffed throughout the season.“Last Friday, the fans came again in their numbers and I didn’t expect there to be so many, to be honest.“United had three of the stands but our fans were so loud again and when we scored it was great to go and celebrate with them.“Our fans have had to endure a dficult year, especially with United being on top since day one.“We are happy with how it went but, at the same time, we need to make sure we don’t rest on a draw – we need to remember we didn’t win – but use it to kick us on.”Dundee have faced the Caley Jags three times this season, winning -, drawing - and losing - last time in Inverness.Dundee United - Dundee: Dorrans# first goal earns Dee derby point\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-united---dundee-dorrans-first-goal-earns-dee-derby-point embed # secretynOUlpvmC\" data-secret\"ynOUlpvmC\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Kerr added: “We are under no illusions how tough it will be tomorrow.

We’ve got archives, a Poisoned Afternoon Tea and escape rooms.”Organisers are also trying to make sure the wider city centre feels involved in the festival.Ms Boulton said: “One of the things I’m very keen on is that it’s not just about APA doing a festival, it’s about the city doing a festival.“I’ll certainly work closely with Aberdeen Inspired and try to get them to get their restaurants involved.“Mackies is doing a Granite Noir ice cream and BrewDog have done Granite Noir beers.“We’re trying to make sure there’s a win for everyone but that will only workpeople engage.“We’re really trying to make it a city festival.”As revealed earlier this week, Ms Boulton hopes the Union Terrace Gardens revamp will have space for the cultural community.Other priorities include encouraging city centre living, looking at how people move around the city and looking at options for the potential, or partial, pedestrianisation of Union Street.In September , the council agreed to waive the affordable housing contribution in the city centre for the next two years to help offset the financial risk associated with city centre development and to encourage more residential living.Ms Boulton said: “We took out affordable housing purely because it’s very expensive to develop these upper floors but also we want people in the city who have disposable income so they will sustain the retail element.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/01/Lynnette-112x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"legend clark says time onside of dons as stars are lured south","story":"Pittodrie legend Bobby Clark insists Aberdeen face a challenge to hold onto their starsEnglish clubs come calling.The January transfer window has now opened and English clubs are expected to step up their interest in leading scorer Sam Cosgrove and Scotland international defender Scott McKenna.Former Dons and Scotland keeper Clark insists the cash power of clubs south of the border due to television finance makes it an uphill task for Scottish clubs like Aberdeen to retain their top talent.However, Clark insists eventhe Reds cannot retain their star players long term, the club is still set up to deliver success due to the management team in place.The -year-old said: “If you bring players through and make them into top players it is much harder to hold onto them now than before the Bosman rule.“It is hard for Scottish teams to compete with the English Premier League because of the television money.“That is a challenge for Aberdeen. However, Aberdeen have the right people in charge and are built to deliver success.“The facilities at Cormack Park are great, but ultimately it is the people that matter.“I am a great believer in people. Aberdeen have the right people with Derek McInnes, Tony Dochertyand Gordon Marshall .“They have a really good first team squad and then there is Neil Simpson .”The Bosman ruling was passed by the European Court of Justice in  and ruled that clubs no longer had to pay transfer fees after the expiration of a player’s contract.The rule was the result of Belgian midfielder Jean-Marc Bosman’s fight against his then-employer RFC Liege.Before the Bosman ruling, a player could not leave at the end of their deal unless that club agreed to let him go on a free, or that club received an agreed fee from a buying club. The Bosman ruling allowed a player to leave a club on a free transfer as soon as their contract expired.That flipped the balance of power as players now had leverage to demand signing-on fees and salaries from new clubs to make up for absent transfer fee.Players coming to the end of their contract could also ask for more money from their current club, who would fear losing that player on a free.Aberdeen are in the driving seat with Cosgrove and McKenna as both are secured on long-term contracts.Middlesbrough, Derby County and Stoke City are tracking prolic scorer Cosgrove, who became the first Aberdeen player to net  goals before Christmas since Duncan Shearer in .Cosgrove is contracted until the summer of , having signed an extension last January.QPR are also reportedly set to step up their interest in centre-back McKenna after having a bid rejected towards the English summer transfer deadline.Aberdeen had rejected a £.m bid from Aston Villa for McKenna the previous summer window.McKenna is contracted to Aberdeen until summer .Capped  times for Scotland, McKenna is a product of the Pittodrie youth system and recently made his th appearance for the Reds. Clark is confident Aberdeen’s youth system will continue to produce first-team talent.He believes the £m Cormack Park, which is home to the Bobby Clark Football Academy, will be fundamental to that.He said: “Cormack Park can help bring through young players and it is great that Neil Simpson is now the director of coaching.“When I think back to Simmy, he was the first boy that progressed from the schoolboy coaching into Aberdeen’s ranks.“For him to have made that jump and then to have played as well as he did, to now be running it, is absolutely fantastic.”Signed in , Clark won all three domestic trophies with Aberdeen.Capped  times for Scotland, he was part of the  World Cup squad in Argentina."},{"url":null,"title":"meet rg mowat owner of the fulmar","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAt the end of November we asked readers for help to unravel the mystery of a yacht log book which was posted to the paper with no clues as to its origin.And, not for the first time, Argyllshire Advertiser readers have come up trumps and we now know a little more about the boat#s owner, named only as RG Mowat in the log book.The  log book gives an account of the voyages of the -foot gaff cutter #Fulmar# and the adventures of her colourful crew. Its dog-eared pages contain neatly-typed records, precise drawings and fascinating photographs.The log#s mystery is deepened by the fact no names are given other than the nicknames #Tanky#, #Bosun#, #Skipper# and #Pilot#. The only crew member named is pet dachshund #Major#.The log does record the Fulmar#s home port was Tighnabruaich and the owner was RG Mowat, but few details on Mr Mowat could be found.Lord Weir of Lochhead, Achahoish, contacted the newspaper to pass on information on Commander Ralph G Mowat.During the Second World War, Commander Mowat was a Royal Navy Captain, latterly in command of a cruiser. At the end of the war, he and his ship entered Copenhagen, where he took the surrender of the German troops.Clive Brown from Ardfern added some post-war detail. He revealed: #Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , was a distinguished member of Clyde Cruising Clubbest known as being, for  years, the honorary editor of the CCC Sailing Directions . These were # and indeed remain # a #must have# for everyone who navigates their way among the many lochs and islands of Scotland#s west coast. They were colloquially known as the #Blue Book# and published at that time as a hardback. He also served as CCC Rear Commodore -.#Mr Brown also provided an extract from the book #Clyde Cruising Club, The First One Hundred Years -# which states Ralph Mowat received an RYA Award for services to yachting in  but refused to accept honorary membership of the club. In recompense, his widow Mary was elected an honorary member in , after his death.Tighnabruaich man Alan Wilson contacted Clyde sailing legend Ian Nicolson, who was fairly sure he recalled racing against the #Fulmar# in the s.Mr Nicolson said:#Old Man Mowat, as I remember him, was a typical ex Royal Navy officer. He treated me as a young upstart, which I was, but we got on well because I wrote a bit for Clyde Cruising Club publications. He lived in Clarkston on the edge of Glasgow.#Clyde Cruising Club itself cannot help with information on the Fulmar. Club secretary Jenner Rollands contacted the Advertiser and confirmed CCC sadly lost all its records when the Carrick, moored on the River Clyde, sank in .

food can make you strong and healthy.\"Each pack of food contains three pieces of popcorn, as popcorn is the fuel that makes reindeer fly, although too much and the reindeer might never land

just two years.Persecution of the iconic birds as well as changes in land use had led to numbers dropping across the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway in recent decades.Ahead of the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project being launched almost two years ago it was believed that there were only two-to-four breeding pairs left across the whole area.Conservationists had identied enough habitat spread across the two rural local authority regions to comfortably cater for as many as  birds.Eaglets were taken from nests in the north of Scotland by ornithologists to prepare for release in the south.In early  five custom built aviaries were constructed in the Southern Upland hills to allow the first of the eaglets to become accustomed to the new territory.While the work of bringing a new generation of golden eagles to the Borders continued, outreach officers staged school and community visits to provide education on the endangered species.This month, with four eagles now successfully introduced to the south of Scotland, bosses at the project revealed that , people have now supported their work by either volunteering or taking part in the outreach sessions.Philip Munro, community outreach officer for the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project, told us: ldquoIt is fantastic to see so many people are so passionate about protecting this iconic species in the south of Scotland.\"We are absolutely delighted with the support, which plays an absolutely vital role in protecting golden eagles.\"We need to keep building on this so that we can ensure that we can see even more of these magnicent birds across the south of Scotlandrsquos skies for generations to come.Funded by Heritage Lottery and LEADER Scottish Borders and DG, the project aims to bring together all countryside users to ensure the wellbeing and successful future of the eagles in the south of Scotland and to secure its place for the future.Those who have participated in the initiative, ranging from four-years-old up to , come from a range of backgrounds and organisations, including the UKrsquos first ever Golden Eagle Scout Champions at the Scottish Borders Scouts, over  pupils from primary schools across the south of Scotland and one in the Scottish Highlands, Borders College, the Scottish Raptor Study Group, Kielder Bird of Prey Centre, HMP Dumfries, and local businesses like Wild Tree Adventures.Earlier this year, the Philiphaugh Estate near Selkirk also announced that it plans to open a Golden Eagle Centre which will support the projectrsquos conservation and community engagement work.Francesca Osowska, Scottish Natural Heritagersquos chief executive, said: ldquoThis is a fantastic milestone.\"Golden eagles are such an amazing part of Scotlandrsquos bioersity, and an integral part of building a nature-rich country for us all.\"Wersquore passionate about ing golden eagles to places where they used to be plentul ndash and it looks like we have thousands of people on our side!\"A huge thank you to all the wonderful volunteers and project participants.The first four birds which were moved to the area have settled into their new habitats and are now fending for themselves.Support from volunteers and participants plays a pivotal role in helping the iconic species continue to grow and thrive in the area.One volunteer was shortlisted as Student of the Year by the Scottish Rural College, largely for her work on the project.Charlotte Martin, a Countryside Management student at SRUC, first heard about the Project when Philip Munro delivered a talk at the college.She said: ldquoHaving previously worked in areas where golden eagles were part of the fabric of the area and very much accepted and admired, alongside my career in farming with employers who farmed commercially yet with great respect for wildle, I was very excited by the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Projectrsquos aims.\"I badgered the project team to let me volunteer and have since been helping at public engagement events, which I thoroughly enjoy.As well as colleges, the outreach team have also visited many schools across the Borders.Michelle Hoppeacute, principal teacher for Yarrow  Kirkhope Primary Schools, said: ldquoWe were really excited to be one of the first schools to take part in the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Projectrsquos Eagle Schools initiative.\"It really brought our community together and I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone.\"The children have had the most amazing experience.\"We are incredibly proud of the interest our pupils have shown in protecting this majestic and important bird. We look forward to supporting the project to make sure that Golden Eagles flourish in the south of Scotland.Project partners include RSPB Scotland, Scottish Land  Estates, Scottish Forestry, Scottish Natural Heritage, and the Southern Uplands Partnership.Funded by The National Lottery Heritage Fund, project partners, Scottish Power Renewables, the Scottish Government and local LEADER Programmes, the initiative is a key project under the Scottish Governmentrsquos  Challenge for Scottish Bioersity."},{"url":null,"title":"melrose-sevens-bosses-make-u-turn-road-closure","story":"BOSSES at Melrose Rugby have made a U-turn on their plans to close off St Marys Road during next years sevens.As previously reported, the stretch was due to be shut for two weeks ndash to allow for a temporary stand to be erected.But following discussions with the towns community council, chiefs running the four-day tournament have changed their minds.Now St Marys road will only be partially closed on game days, with a traffic light system in place.Philip Morris, sevens tournament director at Melrose Rugby, said: ldquoAn event like this one will of course come with an element of disruption to the usual routine.\"The Melrose community has embraced the sevens every year, however, concerns around an expanded event are of course completely understandable.\"For the avoidance of doubt, wersquore working really hard to support local businesses as suppliers to the event.\"And wersquoll also be consulting with local residents to address any specic concerns they have too.\"We are confident the economic boost to Melrose and the surrounding Borders towns during the expanded sevens event will be huge.\"News of the U-turn has been welcomed by members of Melrose Community Council.Chairman William Windram said: \"I still think the plans are a bit fluid at the moment, and I think there is still a lot of work going on behind the scenes.\"There are, however, still some issues like late night noise that have not been considered yet, but we have asked them [the club] to come back to our meeting in February to give us an update.\"Some amelioration has certainly taken place and we should be pleased.\"One of the concerns raised by Melrose Community Council at its November meeting was the impact the tournament would have on churchgoers ndash with the event taking place over the Easter weekend.In response, Mr Morris said: \"We are working hard to ensure the important Easter Sunday church service is not impacted and people will be able to get to and from the church without signicant disruption.\"Now the traffic situation on St Marys Road is becoming clearer, we have a plan that we feel will satisfy our local residents.

infections in  minutes.The technology, by biological engineers at the University of Bath, identies the presence of harmful E.coli bacteria.E.coli is present in around % of bacterial UTIs, with antibiotic treatments used on patients when it is detected.Scientists say the new test is faster and cheaper than existing lab-based options.Dr Nuno Reis, from the University of Bathrsquos Department of Chemical Engineering, led the development of the test.ldquoThe test is small and portable ndash so it has major potential for use in primary care settings and in developing countries, Dr Reis said.ldquoCurrently, bacterial infections in UTIs are confirmed via microbiological testing of a urine sample.ldquoThat is accurate, but time-consuming, taking several days.ldquoWe hope that giving medical professionals the ability to quickly rule in or rule out certain conditions will allow them to treat patients more quickly and help them make better decisions about the prescription of antibiotics.The test is featured in the journal Biosensors And Bioelectronics.A urine sample is passed over a ridged plastic micro-capillary strip containing an antibody that can recognise E.coli bacterial cells.If E.coli is present, the antibodies will bind with it and stop it from passing through the section of the plastic strip.An enzyme is then added to cause a change in colour that can be picked up by a smartphone camera.The concentration of E.coli in the sample is measured by analysing an image taken by the camera.Scientists say the procedure is simple and does not need a mains power supply.Dr Reis added that it could be used to diagnose UTIs within primary care facilities such as GP surgeries, reducing the need to send samples to central labs for testing.ldquoThe UK and wealthy countries have seen a big sht to decentralised diagnostics to reduce the load on national or regional labs and provide doctors with important tools to make informed diagnoses, he said.ldquoDriving more of this will bring better outcomes to patients in terms of speeding up the process, but will also lower the cost to healthcare providers.ldquoWe are not talking about replacing centralised diagnostics services but providing the first point of contact with affordable and rapid tools to support prescription of antibiotics and avoid their overuse.The next step for the test is clinical trials, which require collaboration with clinical and commercial partners.The team will also begin working on refining the test to allow for the detection of other bacteria and their

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road. Hopefully the improvements will manage that well.ldquoI continue to have concerns about developments being put in place with inadequate attention to overall infrastructure needs and the impact on surrounding residents.Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, added: ldquoThough we do not want this amount of housing in this location, we hope that the improved junction will channel much of the traffic generated onto the A and away from Musselburgh.ldquoThere are already serious traffic problems at the bottom end of Monktonhall Road and at the Tesco roundabout. Evenjust some of the traffic from the development around QMU comes this way to access facilities in Musselburgh, we fear the road system will clog up totally.ldquoWe have no problem with the junction improvements. Our issue is with the amount of housing proposed, which is totally inappropriate.Councillor John Williamson added: ldquoThe planned developments will technically be part of Musselburgh, although the vast majority of the new housing will be on the western side of the A with the only direct access to Musselburgh itself, as far as Irsquom aware, restricted to public transport and cycle pedestrian access.ldquoThe only full vehicle access will be via Newcraighall or Old Craighall Roundabout, which means that it will be dficult for the new communities to feel an integral part of Musselburgh.A spokesperson for QMU said: ldquoWe welcome news of the approval of planning permission for the A QMU road junction which will help unlock the full potential of the site for the development of the

had caused a ision between neighbouring community councils and saw nearly  objections lodged with East Lothian Council.And at a meeting of the local authorityrsquos planning committee last Wednesday, the proposal was rejected against the advice of council officials after planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire branded the development a ldquobad neighbour.Mr Hampshire told fellow committee members that he was concerned that allowing Skyrora to test rocket engines on the land, which is central to the councilrsquos future economic plans, could put other investors off.He said: ldquoThis is not a good neighbour ndash it is a bad neighbour development and my concern is this may deter potential investors from taking on development at the Cockenzie site.Skyrora had lodged an application to create a rocket engine testing site on the land, which is owned by the local authority, with plans to carry out five -second tests each month.But while it applied for temporary use of the site for five years, Skyrora told the planning committee that it envisaged the possibility of not just expanding its presence in the community but potentially bringing a manufacturing facility, described as the size of an Ikea store, to the area.And while Prestonpans Community Council supported the move as offering potential for jobs and the economy, neighbouring Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council objected.At the planning committee meeting last week, Bryan Hickman, chairman of Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council, recalled a public meeting in the summer which attracted several hundred people.He said: ldquoVirtually everyone who was there was against it ndash ranging from our youngest residents to pensioners.ldquoThe feeling, rightly or wrongly, in the community is that they do not want it.During the council meeting, residents raised concerns about the storage of key elements of fuel on the site for days prior to testing, as well as the impact of burning kerosene into the atmosphere.While Skyrora insisted that the engine tests would be a ldquoclean burn producing mainly water, resident and biochemist Dr Brian Hall told the committee that he estimated about , litres of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide could be released during each -second test.Calum Miller, on behalf of Prestonpans Community Council, urged councillors to approve the plans, pointing out that the power station site had lain empty now for six years.He told them: ldquoThe council has the opportunity with this Skyrora application to dispel the myth that we are too remote from Edinburgh to attract business.Ward councillors Fiona OrsquoDonnell, Lachlan Bruce and Neil Gilbert did not support the application.Ms OrsquoDonnell said that the impact on local amenity would be unacceptable and spoke of the ldquohigh level of public concern from constituents about the proximity of the test site to housing ndash the nearest of which was estimated at  metres away.Councillors rejected the planning application by six votes to two.The decision was welcomed by Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council chairman Mr Hickman, who said: ldquoThe community is very pleased about the decision as expressed on social media and meeting residents as I go about.ldquoI felt that we presented a strong case against the application.ldquoThe councillors present gave a fair and balanced summary before coming to their decision. The community thanks the ward councillors who called in the application.ldquoIf this did not go before the committee, it would have been approved by East Lothian Council planning department.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said that he hoped the council would now turn attention to calls for a cruise port at the former power station site, which has been supported by his members. He said: ldquoI am disappointed that local ward councillors went against the advice of their council officers on this planning application.ldquoHopefully this will focus East Lothian Council councillors and officials on pushing forward the cruise port initiative to secure much-needed jobs in East Lothian.And his community council colleague Mr Miller criticised councillors for failing to listen to their officials.He said: ldquoIt was patently obvious that councillors on the planning committee couldnrsquot get their heads around the nuances of decibels and emissions.ldquoThey should have fallen back on advice from their own experienced officials. Instead, they repeated the junk science coming from cranks in Cockenzie.ldquoEach test would have generated the same emissions as a family car running for a year. The councillors who referenced a climate emergency in defence of their decision were only too happy to drive home from Haddington.ldquoAn ecosystem of space technology companies could have emerged in East Lothian based around the testbed.ldquoThe wilful ignorance of a few has pulled opportunity for the hands of young people in East Lothian.Derek Harris, from Skyrora, said he was disappointed by the decision of the planning committee.It is understood the company will take time to consider whether to appeal the decision.Mr Harris said: ldquoI would like to thank all the staff at East Lothian Council who helped with our application.

My we and kids were with me carrying the crisps and goodies when the absence of sound coming from my friendrsquos flat made me suddenly realise Irsquod mucked up.Turning up on a doorstep with drinks and snacks for a party that had already taken place was a potentially awkward moment.ldquoI wondered where you were yesterday, my friend said, ldquoas you were so sure you were all coming.Kate, my we, who normally keeps me organised, looked at me in a way that expressed horried disbelief and lack of surprise at the same time. But what could have been an embarrassing and disappointing evening became a wonderful and quite moving experience.My friend is Jewish. She is not religious but she observes Jewish festivals and traditions as part of her inheritance and identity. And the day we arrived was December , which in  was the first day of Hanukkah, also called the lsquofestival of lightsrsquo. There is not a fixed date for this celebration as the time is based on the cycle of the moon, as many celebrations from other religious traditions are.We were askedwe would like to take part and we were honoured to do so. By tradition, the youngest in the room lights the candle, so my four-year-old son, with help, did so.The evening was full of meaning and unexpected closeness with an old friend. There was a feeling of shared sacredness in the antiquity of the ceremony, and the meaning of the story behind Hanukkah, like many religious stories, can be interpreted in dferent ways by the people who hold that faith.But at its core is the story of the miracle of the lamp that, despite only having oil enough for one night, burned for eight days and eight nights. The lamp was lit as a dedication to a desecrated temple, thereby signalling the restoration of religious freedom, and hence the name festival of lights.As we left our friendrsquos house into a cold and calm night, Kate told me she had forgiven me, as otherwise we would not have had such a meaningful and memorable evening.It happened to be also the Winter Solstice and this is a turning point in the year. Hanukkah isnrsquot specically about seasonal change but the idea of sharing the light in this dark time is a common theme.I imagined our ancestors huddling together in their ancient dwellings during the shortest day, knowing the dark was now at its worst, and soon the light would begin to . Le would come back to the land and the days become longer. But in the meantime, ways were needed to keep the dark at bay.Today we challenge the darkness with decorative seasonal lights. But we also have super-lit shopping centres, bright street lights and, hopefully, warm and lit homes.But in celebrating this time, it seems the seasonal bling of the corporate money-makers is becoming the new ritual. They promote the idea that celebrating together should be bigger and better every year that those who want to feel included need to buy the ticket for the big event.And indeed, much fun can be had at such events. But have we reached a point where traditions have become marketing labels rather than authentic shared experiences  Some people now have to acquire tickets from a company to celebrate in their own street, although thankfully not yet in East Lothian.The idea of being bigger and better means bigger crowds, which means more profit but not necessarily a better experience. Big crowds need to be restricted and controlled, meaning others are excluded. Have we reached the point whereyou donrsquot have a ticket then you canrsquot be part of the tradition We can enjoy big events while still having our own traditions, of course, but my feeling is that the idea of tradition is being hijacked by a commercial juggernaut with little authenticity or meaning other than making money.And so I think the unexpected evening with my friend taught me a lesson I hope I already knew: that the traditions we really value, and the memories we truly treasure, are the simple ones of shared meaningful connection. And perhaps the biggest treasure is sharing with those who would otherwise be excluded.And so wherever you are, whatever you do, I hope you find time to share these moments at this time of seasonal celebration. Whatever your faith or spirituality, whatever your family or cultural traditions, I wish you a Happy New Year and I look forward to theof the sun, and sharing with you new adventures of discovery in our beautul county."},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-youngsters-thank-lifeboat-crew-saving-lives","story":"Rachel Pirie and Luke Foster, both , were exploring the townrsquos clfs with Chloe McCaw, , at about noon on November  last year when the incident happened.The rising water levels left the youngsters, who all live in Dunbar and attend Dunbar Grammar School, cut off with no food, no water and one working mobile phone that did not have any credit.Police and Coastguard crews struggled to locate them.Talking about their ordeal, Rachel said: ldquoWe know the area well and the tide was well out so we thought we were safe.

I was alone and deep in thought. I cannot remember now exactly what the issue was, but something had happened that seemed to be unfair, and it had made me angry.It was a windy and cold day. The tide was in and the waves rolling and crashing created a kind of meditative sound. I donrsquot know how long I sat there, as time seemed to dissolve as I listened to the sea, and smelt the salt air.Later I walked by the shore, again alone, and I remember how my mood had changed.My memory of that day fades at this point: I cannot recall what happened as I ed home. But clearly the sea had done its job in calming my emotional state.Memories are not like books on a shelf which we can take out and look at, and then . Our memories are really about emotions rather than happenings. We connect to the emotions first, our brain then does a search for the events associated with the emotion. Songs, smell, sounds and places can trigger emotion which then leads to associations with actual events.So itrsquos the emotion attached to events which will mark it as signicant. Thatrsquos why we remember the unusual moments more than the everyday ones. We remember the events when our emotions were aroused, either positively or negatively.That day I was angry. The sea was pretty much on our doorstep, so it was probably an obvious place to go to be alone, away from my siblings, to rage at the injustice I felt. But it was a good choice, because the sea has a powerful ability to heal.There seems to be a sense by some that the sea is a place to go only when itrsquos sunny and warm. In fact, the gts of the sea are given all year round, and it is winter time, or a time of storm and wind, that the sea becomes a powerful place to find naturersquos healing.How lucky we are to live in a county where we have  miles of coastline, much of it close to communities and accessible. Those with a sense of adventure and physical ability to do so can find parts of the coast to themselves, even in busy times.But as I learnt all those years ago, the sea can speak to us directly. Simply sitting by it, or walking along the shore while sharing our thoughts, can be a powerful form of mental as well as physical healing.Some take this a step further by bathing in the sea on a regular basis ndash yes, even in the winter. There are real benefits to swimming in a cold sea, both in terms of mental and physical health. But I think it helpsothers do it with you, as an encouragement! The Loony Dooks which take place at North Berwick, Dunbar and where around the coast should be a weekly event, not a yearly one!But we donrsquot need to be in the sea to feel its benefits, just by it and connected to it mentally, and yes, spiritually. This is a serious point. We have an epidemic of mental health issues, and while there is no one simple explanation or solution, we need to understand the signicance of our disconnection from nature and its impact on our mental health. Spending time by the sea is a tonic for body and mind.I think we felt this last week when we headed for the rocks at North Berwick on Boxing Day. It was here that Robert Louis Stevenson played as a boy and discovered a small cave in which he imagined tales of pirates and smugglers. The island of Fidra, said to be his inspiration for Treasure Island, can be seen further along the coast.The tide was in, so it wasnrsquot possible to see the cave. But in scrambling over the rocks, discovering other things and sitting by the waves, the sea did its magic for our family and myself. The waves were crashing andyou studied how they hit the rocks you could see how the hand of the sea had carved them in certain ways.We sat and explored there ndash not noticing the nippy wind ndash for a good hour. It was an overcast afternoon and darkness fell soon. But the walk along the beach to the town for a hot chocolate was the final part of the therapy!Our coastline is a gt for us and we need to use it, and respect it, more. The beaches, coves and clfs of our county are a true treasure. Try spending more time with them, listening and experiencing the sea, walking or sitting with it.I promise you, you will feel better, and have a story to tell.Happy New Year."},{"url":null,"title":"new-mcbrave-games-event-held-musselburgh","story":"The action-packed event, called McBrave Games, promises participants a uniquely Scottish experience with events such as tug orsquo war, tossing the caber, putting the shot, the hill race, weechinrsquo the welly and a Highland fling.There will also be a Scottish twist on challenges along the km obstacle course to test participants.The event takes place on Saturday, May , at Newhailes House.Participants can take on the challenge as a solo entrant or enter as a clan of four with colleagues or friends to battle it out to become the laddie or lassie of McBrave Games.Co-founders Jo Dytch and Andrew Hastings are confident the creativity and innovation behind the event will encourage entrants to try something new in .Jo and Andrew bring with them more than  yearsrsquo combined experience in the mass participation space on large-scale events such as Race for Le, Tough Mudder and the -mile Cateran Yomp.Commenting on the inspiration behind the event, Jo said: ldquoScotland is an inspiring and magical place.

The desire for a county, island or regional flag is part of this,\" he said.\"As to why this is taking off now I think it is due to communities seeing the popular success of other such flags. This explains why after Shetland became the first [regional flag in ] the momentum has been building. First with neighbouring Orkney and Caithness, then for communities across Scotland.\"Shetlands was designed in  to commemorate the th anniversary of the transfer of Shetland from Norway to Scotland. The colours were inspired by Scotlands national flag, and the cross shape is from Scandinavian tradition.According to the registry the first town or city flag arrived in Edinburgh. Auld Reekies city flag with its castle and colours of white, black, red dates back to .A competition to design a flag for Skye has attracted  entries, with shortlisting due to take place in January ahead of a public vote. The final design will be revealed in March.Highland councillor John Finlayson from Skye said the attraction of having its own flag, was not just about identity. \"Skye as you know has a unique history, culture and heritage which is becoming increasingly well known because of the huge rise in tourism,\" he said.\"I am often asked by visitors from overseasSkye has a flag and I have often thought that it would be a good idea to have one to further consolidate our identity and our distinctive place in Scottish history as well as our growing popularity as an international tourist destination.\"This is why I have been actively involved in the process to host a competition to create a Skye Flag. I also think it would add to the Skye brand and further develop our sense of identity. \"Ultimate approval of any flag design lies with the Lyon Court, which exists to grand and record arms for those that want them. The Right Honourable the Lord Lyon King of Arms, the head of Lyon Court, is the Scottish official with responsibility for regulating heraldry in the country, issuing new grants of arms, and serving as the judge of the Court of the Lord Lyon, the oldest heraldic court in the world that is still in daily operation.\"The general principle would be that Scots can have arms  banners in principle,\"said Mr Tibbetts. \"This is borne out historically as former Lord Lyon Sir Thomas Innes [who served from  to ] noted, that the general uptake of heraldry in Scotland is historically far higher per capita than in England.\"Orkney became the third Scottish community to have its own flag, receiving official recognition in April, .It was designed by postman Duncan Tullock, who sketched out his initial idea using his young grandchildrens crayons.Mr Tullocks blue, yellow and red design was voted the best of  designs submitted to the islands council.It replaced an older flag, the red and yellow cross of St Magnus which was considered to be too similar to other national banners.It would take another nine years before a fourth Scottish community flag was approved, leading to a new wave of interest in having a recognised emblem.Mr Tibbetts said: \"For a community a flag firstly provides a simple symbol that locals can connect with together. Secondly it can then be used to raise the visibility of that community externally.\"It is also important nationally as this reinforces the Scottish tradition of having a rich array of symbolism across the nation as seen in tartans and heraldry.\"Caithness kickstarted the latest appetite for new Scottish heraldry, unfurling their flag in January, .It features a Nordic cross and galley symbolising Caithness ancient ties to the Vikings.The Caithness flag flies next to the Saltire in Wick MarinaThe design was picked from suggestions sent to Highland Council from all over the world.Six months later there was one in Kirkcudbrightshire and then a flag in Denny and Dunipace in Stirlingshire.The Kirkcudbrightshire flag was organised to mark the Queens th birthday.The green and white quarters reference the checks that appeared on a former local authoritys coat of arms, and also the checked cloth used historically to count taxes by the Stewards of the Lords of Galloway.It also features a St Cuthberts cross to reference the origin of the name Kirkcudbrightshire as the \"shire of the church of Cuthbert\".Denny and Dunipaces town flag is a green, white and blue design showing the River Carron separating Dunipace and its -pointed star to the north and Dennyrsquos two-towered castle symbolising the River of Forts to the south.Raising the South Uist flagIn the Western Isles, South Uists Nordic cross in the pattern of Norways flag secured official recognition for its banner in May, .Donnie Steele, a former councillor, championed South Uists flag, organising a petition to gather support for official recognition.:Barra flag officially recognised six months after terror victimrsquos deathAnd by the end of that year Barras green and white Nordic cross, used by residents of the Hebridean island for decades secured official recognition.In June, that year, the flag was draped over the coffin of Barras Eilidh MacLeod, , who was among the victims of the Manchester Arena attack.Tiree unfurled its new official flag in September, last year. Donald Camerons green and gold \"Land of Barley\" design was chosen after a competition launched earlier that year.\"A competition allows for hundreds of designs to be in with a shout. By engaging with the community, such as with the school talks on Skye, and including information with the competition pack explaining what makes an effective flag then as many people as possible can be given as good a chance as possible at creating eligible designs and ultimately winning the final public vote,\" said Mr Tibbetts.Another public vote led to Sutherland beingamong the latest to get official recognition in December, Source: Philip TibbettsThe winning design featuresa Saltire and a Nordic cross.

Whether this includes Scotland is a moot point. Our confused constitutional position is mirrored in the Civil Service here, which is ided into a London-answerable Scotland Office staffed by unionist spies and an Edinburgh-answerable Scottish Government bureaucracy staffed by politically correct, psychometrically tested nutters.Back in Downing Street, meanwhile, Mr Cummings has advertised for ldquoweirdos and ldquomisfits to work for him.

Readers experienced in these will have learned quickly that honesty is not the best policy. Alas, a slow learner, it took me ages to realise that I was doing myself no favours in telling potential employers truthfully that I was unreliable, didnrsquot respect authority, and detested working as part of a team almost as much as I hated using my inidual initiative.So, what do you doyou roll up at Number Ten with your Scotvec certicate in Hospitality and Hairdressing under your arm, and Dominic asks: ldquoSo, are you a weirdo  Well, perhaps you could adapt the words of Sir Humphrey Appleby from televisionrsquos Yes, Minister: ldquoAs far as I can see, looking at it by and large, taking one thing with another, in the final analysis it is probably true to say, that at the end of the day, in general terms, you would probably find that, not to put too fine a point on it, I cannot confirm one way or another at this present juncture that I am, or indeed am not, a nutter.On second thoughts, it might be best just to say ldquoYes, Prime Ministerrsquos senior adviser, and leave it at that.++++STICK your heid in a spool for a minute and Irsquoll rewind you back to the s. Mind you, the winding and rewinding of cassettes was never an exact science so we may have to make a few stops along the way. That was one of the maddening things about cassettes which made us all convert to CDs in the s.But, in , the blasted tapes were back, fuelled by our insatiable quest for nostalgia. Indeed, last week, it was reported that auction sales of punk memorabilia were also going through the roof.Itrsquos not clear whether people are buying cassettes to listen to them or just to look at them while holding a glass of wine and a cigar. And the sales neednrsquot be over-hyped. According to the British Phonographic Industry , , cassettes were purchased last year. That compares to  million in .But, still, therersquos something comforting in keeping old technology alive. Itrsquos kinda steam-punk, I guess, and maybe also two fingers to the clinical, squeaky-clean stuff that streams onto our computers today.I remain a CD man myself, distrusting the virtual world of the ether, where everything is nothing.++++DISAPPOINTING figures about drinking at both the BBC and the House of Commons emerged this week, with observers suggesting the inmates of both institutions werenrsquot imbibing enough.In the Commons, a total of pound. million was spent on booze between  and , down from pound. million in -. Not only that but more was spent on beer and lager than on wine and champagne, reflecting the trend whereby politicians of all parties are now trying to pretend theyrsquore working class.No such problem at the bourgeois BBC, HQ of the trendy metropolitan elite, where spending on prosecco and other sparkling wine doubled in the year to March , a trend confirming that the controversial institution is now completely dominated by women.That said, the total bill for alcohol was only pound,, which is less than most of us spend on a typical Saturday night out in Glasgow.Itrsquos frankly disturbing to learn that our annual pound. licence fee is not being put to good use by our broadcasters, particularly when it is being squandered on prosecco which, in my experience, has to be drunk by the crate before you even start to cheer up and look for a fight.++++THE headline in The Daily Star said it all: ldquo, idiots in London! You say: ldquoThat sounds like a right under-estimate, ken Well, maybe. But it is the number that made stupid, time-wasting  calls last year. One woman rang up to complain that her chippie had sent her three saveloy and chips, when she had only ordered one.Then there was the man who rang up to ask what the time was, and another fellow who complained that the biscuits hersquod just bought were past their sell-by date.Thus our fellow man. According to the politan Police, many of the , calls were pranks, which is deplorable when it means serious calls canrsquot be taken.I was going to suggest establishing separate dedicated numbers for saveloyand biscuit emergencies, but we already have one for the time and that didnrsquot stop one clot ringing .The number for the time, by the way, remains .

He was said to have followed in Crowleyrsquos footsteps by practicing black magic on the estate.Crowley bought the B-listed Georgian building when he was just  and lived there until . He boasted to have turned the property into ldquoa centre of black magic, evil and sorcery.He conducted black magic rituals and offered animal sacrices to satan and was said to have taken pleasure in the suffering of local people. One episode involved an employee of the estate getting drunk, after  yearsrsquo abstinence, and attempting to kill his we and children. His lodge keeper suffered the loss of a -year-old daughter, while a year later his -month-old son died.Ill-fortune seemed to continue to haunt Boleskine even after Crowleyrsquos departure. It was reported in  the then owner, Major Edward Grant, shot himself in the room Crowley once used for his satanic rituals.However, Page, who bought the property in , said in a  interview: ldquoStrange things have happened in that house which have nothing to do with Crowley. The bad vibes were already there.The rock legend claimed that the head of an executed man, thought to be Lord Lovat who fought with the English during the  uprising, could be heard rolling around the floor. The house also featured in the Led Zeppelin documentary, The Song Remains The Same.Pagersquos childhood friend, Malcolm Dent, worked as the caretaker for Boleskine before the musician sold up in the s after rarely staying there.He once claimed that ldquocurious events occurred at the house, saying: ldquoDoors would be slamming all night. Yoursquod go into a room and carpets and rugs would be piled up.The property was sold to Annette MacGillivray and her husband who lived there happily for  years before it was acquired in  by Dutch owners.Mrs Readdy told reporters in July that people were calling for the house to be razed, saying it was ldquoa den of iniquity.ldquoWe have read so many lurid details, she said. ldquoIt is an architecturally signicant building no matter who has owned it. Boleskine has such a big draw, whether people are fans of Crowley or rock rsquonrsquo roll.ldquoThe Boleskine estate is a treasure of heritage and history that must be secured for future generations.

I hope this restaurant isnrsquot a parable for where current restaurant trends might eventually take us.At first we wonderthey have forgotten to put any tea in our teapot. It tastes like tepid water, but we can see green leaves in there, and yet even brewing time doesnrsquot make them taste like tea.

Seeing the description lsquopan-fried Scottish grey sole with salt and chillirsquo I wasnrsquot prepared for a plate of what seemed to be already filleted fish carcass, head and all, deep fried in batter. The frustrating thing here is that the odd flakes of fish still adhering to bone and cartilage under the batter do taste quite good. But for pound. this plateful represents rotten value for money.A glance round the corner reveals that Fusion Gourmet has the equivalent of a private dining area, dark and relatively intimate, with a round dining table around which a group of Chinese men with the air of business people are sat.

He must be the most patient man alive, almost a social media saint. Watch him calmly respond to vilication and abuse every time he points out that taxes raised in Scotland could not sustain public spending, were Scotland to become independent tomorrow.Scotland has a nominal deficit of several billions of pounds which could cause immediate fiscal belt-tighteningthe Barnett taps were turned off. I say nominal because there is much controversy over Haguersquos figures.However, he won a signicant victory last year when the Scottish Government largely accepted, in the Sustainable Growth Commission, his arguments about Scotlandrsquos fiscal position, based as they are on the GERS calculations of Government spending and revenues.Nicola Sturgeon now accepts that independence will involve short-term spending restraint. Thatrsquos better than long-term decline under Westminster rule, she says. Yoursquod think that this admission would have damaged the SNPrsquos electoral standing, but the reverse is true. Last month they enjoyed another landslide victory.So herersquos the puzzle: why have Scottish voters not punished the SNP for agreeing that independence could mean, at the very least, a period of economic dislocation and public spending cuts  The Growth Commission numbers suggest that SNP promises of more cash for the NHS and social care, a costly new benefits system, compensation for Waspi women, electrication of transport and many other spending commitments would be hard to achieve.At the very least taxes would have to rise. But Scottish voters donrsquot seem particularly worried. This is because they are bothered about something more important than deficits. Brexit shows that when it comes to issues of sovereignty and identity, it isnrsquot ldquothe economy, stupid. Rarely has a political axiom been so comprehensively disproved. It clearly isnrsquot the economy that has been driving events in the UK.Looking back over the past three turbulent years, itrsquos obvious that Remainers had the best arguments. If you regard Brexit, as Hague would, as a purely economic exercise in cost-benefit analysis, it stinks. Leaving the largest and wealthiest free trade area on the planet is almost impossible to justy on narrow economic terms.There will almost certainly be a quick and dirty free trade deal negotiated in  that will remove tarfs on goods. But % of UK trade is in non-physical services. There is bound to be an increase in non-tarf barriers to British trade with the single market which will affect UK businesses. That is why so many financial companies have already been setting up shop in Dublin to operate within the rules of the EU single market.Supply chains will be disrupted, which is why car manufacturers were so opposed to Brexit. There have been problems on the high street this Christmas with the shortage of casual labour. The departure of EU citizens is likely to damage education, agriculture manufacturing and services, especially care services.Left-wing Remainers tried to claim that in some way it was billionaires who were behind Brexit, but this was never the case. Remain was, is, a thoroughly pro-capitalist, pro-business case, vigorously pursued and financed by the largest corporate interests, from car manufacturers to banks.Gina Miller is no socialist. Nor is the governor of the Bank of England, the head of Goldman Sachs, or the bosses of Jaguar Land Rover and Honda. It was a handful of pub-chain capitalists, such as Tim Martin of Wetherspoon, who backed Brexit. They are essentially English nationalists who think that Brexit is in some way a declaration of independence.Brexit, as they saw it, was about winning freedom from unelected Brussels bureaucrats and letting Britain stand strong in the world. Irsquod say thatrsquos nonsense, of course. It was never clear that membership of the single market involved a diminution of British sovereignty, even though much trade legislation had been ceded to Brussels. But economic rationality is really not the point.Brexit was essentially an argument about democracy and nationalism. As the General Election has shown, for millions of voters the economy, finance and fiscal policy had very little to do with their political priorities. Remainers were comprehensively defeated because they appeared to do down Britain and ignored the will of the people. Brexit had won the referendum, and no amount of economic reality was going to change votersrsquo minds.The Scottish Government loathes Brexit, and for very good reasons. Scots did not vote to leave the European Union for a start. But in the longer term, Brexit is very good news for the SNP. No matter what arguments unionists such as Hague deploy in future about Scotlandrsquos deficit, it will surely not determine whether or not Scotland leaves the UK.There are three immediate reasons why the Scottish deficit does not, at present, deter people from voting SNP. The Scottish Government has managed the finances of Holyrood reasonably competently over the past decade. There is great scepticism about spending arguments, which voters tend to dismiss as Project Fear.Thirdly, departure from the UK would not happen overnight, and there would be complex financial and trading negotiations before the Union was dissolved.But forget all that, because the urge for freedom trumps any argument over a few billions in tax revenues. Scottish voters know, intuitively, that Scotland is a relatively wealthy country, better off than most regions of England. Labour productivity is comparable to the UK average. Scotland has prodigious natural resources and a highly educated workforce. Scotland has the national income of Portugal and the population of Slovakia.Thatrsquos all they need to know. Indeed, were I advising the SNP, Irsquod say they should stop agonising about currency, fiscal transfers and deficits. What will defeat those arguments is not more numbers, but the emotional appeal to national identity that won Boris Johnson his election victory.Scots did not vote to leave the European Union. They did not vote to lose their EU citizenship, with all the protections that brings. They did not vote to cut EU immigration did not vote to accept trade deals with the United States did not agree to the diminution of environmental standards and did not vote to be subjected to untrammelled Tory rule from Westminster.Thatrsquos really all the SNP need to say. Voters will do the rest."},{"url":null,"title":"iain-macwhirter-scottish-independence-wont-won-lost-finance---brexit-showed-not-economy","story":"Since itrsquos a new year, let me pay due respect to the prolic statistically-literate Unionist businessman, Kevin Hague.

Last month they enjoyed another landslide victory.So herersquos the puzzle: why have Scottish voters not punished the SNP for agreeing that independence could mean, at the very least, a period of economic dislocation and public spending cuts  The Growth Commission numbers suggest that SNP promises of more cash for the NHS and social care, a costly new benefits system, compensation for Waspi women, electrication of transport and many other spending commitments would be hard to achieve.At the very least taxes would have to rise. But Scottish voters donrsquot seem particularly worried. This is because they are bothered about something more important than deficits. Brexit shows that when it comes to issues of sovereignty and identity, it isnrsquot ldquothe economy, stupid. Rarely has a political axiom been so comprehensively disproved. It clearly isnrsquot the economy that has been driving events in the UK.Looking back over the past three turbulent years, itrsquos obvious that Remainers had the best arguments. If you regard Brexit, as Hague would, as a purely economic exercise in cost-benefit analysis, it stinks. Leaving the largest and wealthiest free trade area on the planet is almost impossible to justy on narrow economic terms.There will almost certainly be a quick and dirty free trade deal negotiated in  that will remove tarfs on goods. But % of UK trade is in non-physical services. There is bound to be an increase in non-tarf barriers to British trade with the single market which will affect UK businesses. That is why so many financial companies have already been setting up shop in Dublin to operate within the rules of the EU single market.Supply chains will be disrupted, which is why car manufacturers were so opposed to Brexit. There have been problems on the high street this Christmas with the shortage of casual labour. The departure of EU citizens is likely to damage education, agriculture manufacturing and services, especially care services.Left-wing Remainers tried to claim that in some way it was billionaires who were behind Brexit, but this was never the case. Remain was, is, a thoroughly pro-capitalist, pro-business case, vigorously pursued and financed by the largest corporate interests, from car manufacturers to banks.Gina Miller is no socialist. Nor is the governor of the Bank of England, the head of Goldman Sachs, or the bosses of Jaguar Land Rover and Honda. It was a handful of pub-chain capitalists, such as Tim Martin of Wetherspoon, who backed Brexit. They are essentially English nationalists who think that Brexit is in some way a declaration of independence.Brexit, as they saw it, was about winning freedom from unelected Brussels bureaucrats and letting Britain stand strong in the world. Irsquod say thatrsquos nonsense, of course. It was never clear that membership of the single market involved a diminution of British sovereignty, even though much trade legislation had been ceded to Brussels. But economic rationality is really not the point.Brexit was essentially an argument about democracy and nationalism. As the General Election has shown, for millions of voters the economy, finance and fiscal policy had very little to do with their political priorities. Remainers were comprehensively defeated because they appeared to do down Britain and ignored the will of the people. Brexit had won the referendum, and no amount of economic reality was going to change votersrsquo minds.The Scottish Government loathes Brexit, and for very good reasons. Scots did not vote to leave the European Union for a start. But in the longer term, Brexit is very good news for the SNP. No matter what arguments unionists such as Hague deploy in future about Scotlandrsquos deficit, it will surely not determine whether or not Scotland leaves the UK.There are three immediate reasons why the Scottish deficit does not, at present, deter people from voting SNP. The Scottish Government has managed the finances of Holyrood reasonably competently over the past decade. There is great scepticism about spending arguments, which voters tend to dismiss as Project Fear.Thirdly, departure from the UK would not happen overnight, and there would be complex financial and trading negotiations before the Union was dissolved.But forget all that, because the urge for freedom trumps any argument over a few billions in tax revenues. Scottish voters know, intuitively, that Scotland is a relatively wealthy country, better off than most regions of England. Labour productivity is comparable to the UK average. Scotland has prodigious natural resources and a highly educated workforce. Scotland has the national income of Portugal and the population of Slovakia.Thatrsquos all they need to know. Indeed, were I advising the SNP, Irsquod say they should stop agonising about currency, fiscal transfers and deficits. What will defeat those arguments is not more numbers, but the emotional appeal to national identity that won Boris Johnson his election victory.Scots did not vote to leave the European Union. They did not vote to lose their EU citizenship, with all the protections that brings. They did not vote to cut EU immigration did not vote to accept trade deals with the United States did not agree to the diminution of environmental standards and did not vote to be subjected to untrammelled Tory rule from Westminster.Thatrsquos really all the SNP need to say. Voters will do the rest."},{"url":null,"title":"hollywood-actor-brian-cox-calls-second-scottish-independence-referendum","story":"The Dundee-born star, currently being lauded for his portrayal of an ageing media magnate in acclaimed TV drama Succession, said his native country has been ldquoignored andldquoenough is enough.During last monthrsquos General Election, the SNP won  of Scotlandrsquos  constituencies.The result led party leaderNicola Sturgeon to call for a second referendum, following rsquos decision for Scotland to remain in the UK.And -year-old Cox, a multi-award winning actor whose film roles include Manhunter, The Bourne Identity and Troy, has now backed those calls.Speaking at the Bafta Tea Party event in Los Angeles, he told the PA news agency: ldquoI would think we need to look at it, I think we need a referendum and see what we think.

But the MP for Birmingham Yardley suggested there was an over-arching reason. ldquoThe fundamental thing is that the country didnrsquot trust us to govern. It didnrsquot trust us to deliver on what we were saying and we have got to listen to that, she told the Marr Show.ldquoPolitics has changed and we have got to show that we can change with it.

The first was between Iran and the US: a genuinely le and death affair. The second, trivial in comparison, was the fight to lead Labour.Ridge, starting at .am, interviewed Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, while he was en route to Marr. Smart idea they should try it with more Marr guests. The central London location just off Whitehall would have been impossible any other time than a Sunday morning. As it was, there was hardly any traffic. London looked asit was still on holiday.Speaking of putting off theto work, Ridge mentioned that Prime Minister Boris Johnson was travelling back from holiday in Mustique. The assassination of Iranrsquos military leader Qasem Soleimani on the orders of President Trump had brought about the biggest crisis in the Middle East since Iraq, said Ridge, yet nothing had been heard from Mr Johnson. Did he think the hard work had been done in winning a majority and he could now put his feet up : Johnson criticised over holidayThe PM was ldquoin charge said Mr Raab, adding that he had spoken to him several times over the festive break. Marr also wanted to know how Boris Johnsonrsquos new government was going to measure up to the moment. Contrary to reports in some of the papers, there had not been a vacuum at the heart of government, insisted the Foreign Secretary.Mr Raabrsquos word of the morning, and one suspects the week, was ldquode-escalation. With so much at stake, including the possible impact on the case of the jailed British-Iranian mother Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe, plus British civilian contractors and soldiers in Iraq, Mr Raab had to tread a line between the Trump position and growing unease in Europe, a path he will continue to take next week when he visits the continent before going on to Washington DC.This role ofldquogo-between could be the shape of things to come for any British Foreign Secretary in the post-Brexit political landscape.Both presenters brought up the other item in Mr Raabrsquos increasingly full in-tray: the -year-old British woman convicted of lying about being the victim of a gang rape in Cyprus. Again, a delicate approach was required ahead of sentencing tomorrow, one which expressed concern while not questioning the Cypriot judicial system too much. Mr Raab, a lawyer by trade, found the middle ground.The battle to be Labour leader got off to a snoozy start after the General Election, but the pace is picking up now with more candidates declaring. The most recent to do so, Sir Keir Starmer and Jess Phillips, were on Marr. The intro to the show had them sitting together, which would have made a lively interview, but instead Marr spoke to them separately.: Cox calls for indyrefOver on Ridge, Emily Thornberry was trying to handle the problem faced by every contender: how to court a membership that is heavily in favour of Jeremy Corbyn, and thinks he did nothing wrong, while arguing that radical change is needed. Thornberryrsquos response when askedMr Corbyn was a good leader was to start talking about Iran again, saying that had been taking up her time. Ridge persisted. ldquoJeremy had many, many talents, said the Shadow Foreign Secretary eventually. The reason he was popular with the party was that he spoke from the heart, she added.If that was the main quality of a successful candidate then Jess Phillips would be a shoo-in. The MP for Birmingham Yardley, whether on Twitter, in the Commons, or in one of her many television appearances, is passionate, plain-speaking, and funny. Unfortunately, as far as the task at hand goes, she has used those skills to become one of Corbynrsquos sharpest critics and is not without enemies.Despite a YouGov poll giving her % support among the membership, putting her in third position behind Starmer and Rebecca Long-Bailey, Ms Phillips reckons the party, and the electorate, is in the mood for some straight talking. Labourrsquos key problem was that voters did not trust them to govern, she said.Mr Starmer said Labour had lost due to concerns about the leadership, the partyrsquos woolly position on Brexit, anti-Semitism, and a manesto that was overloaded. On Brexit, he said: ldquoWe should have taken a stronger position one way or the other.: Independence wont be won or lost on financeOtherwise, he was keen to get off the subject as quickly as possible.

Researchers at the University of Edinburgh’s world-renowned Roslin Institute say it is possible to cull numbers of the mammals by editing their DNA to ensure that all future females are born infertile. The institute, famous for creating Dolly the Sheep, the world’s first mammal cloned from an adult cell, hoped to create gene-edited male squirrels that can be released into the wild. The mammals would be altered to contain a so-called ‘gene drive’ designed to spread throughout the population, and render all females to inherit it sterile. Males, however, would be unaffected, so as to allow them to keep spreading the new genetic code, and ultimately hastening the grey’s demise. The initiative is supported by some as a humane means of stopping the spread of the invasive species and protected the red squirrel, which is native to the UK, but survives only in isolated strongholds, with the vast majority found in parts of Scotland. However,animal rights campaigners dismissed the idea as “reprehensible,” and warned it would not solve long standing ecological problems. The project, which is part-funded by the European Squirrel Initiative, a charity that promotes research into the conservation of red squirrels, would also have implications for efforts to rid Britain of other invasive species, such as mink, muntjac deer, and ring-necked parakeets. The team at the Roslin Institute point to the fact that the grey squirrel is a carrier of squirrel pox, which is lethal to the red squirrel. Without conservation efforts, it is predicted that reds could be lost from the UK altogether by . Professor Bruce Whitelaw, the institute’s genus personal chair of animal biotechnology, is spearheading the squirrel project. “A potential application of gene drives is to control invasive vertebrate pests, such as cane toads and rabbits in Australia, grey squirrels in the UK, possums in New Zealand and rodents around the globe,” he explained in a journal article co-authored with Gus McFarlane, a fellow researcher.They have asked a team of genome engineers, population modellers, ecologists, ethicists and conservation experts to design gene drives as a “potential tool” to eradicate grey squirrels.“We are investigating strategies that could humanely control the UK grey squirrel population,” Mr McFarlane said. “One is spreading female infertility.” Another possible drive changes the sex ratio, favouring the birth of males over females until the population becomes mostly male.Andrew Kendalll, a spokesman for the European Squirrel Initiative, said: “ “The aim would be to create a few thousand gene-edited greys and then release them so the gene spreads, slowly wiping the species out in the UK. We want to reverse the invasion.“It is very humane - there is no need for trapping or shooting - they just stop reproducing.”However, Jenner White, a spokeswoman for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said: “People accept that genetically engineering humans is morally unconscionable and doing the same to squirrels using gene-drive technology is just as reprehensible. “It won’t solve our ecological problems but will lead to misery for intelligent, sensitive beings.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"dani garavelli oscar should find a fitting ending for little women","story":"Ask any ex-tomboy wannabe writer of a certain vintage about Louisa May Alcott#s Little Women and watch her eyes fire up with excitement. The Victorian classic, about a family of spirited sisters growing up during the American Civil War, will be woven into the fabric of her early teens the way Judy Blume is woven into her later ones. Mention the book#s heroine, the impatient, impetuous Jo March, and she will likely regale you with her favourite moments: Jo lashing out at Amy for burning her manuscript perhaps. Or Jo cutting off her lovely, long hair, then sobbing over its loss.To the bookish, yet rebellious girl, Little Women is a source of comfort, providing a role model who cannot sit still. It is formative, shaping her understanding of womanhood and encouraging her to kick back against social expectations. And yet, it can also be disheartening. Though Jo turns the boyish Laurie down, and finishes her book, her fate is not the one many readers hope for. Bowing to convention, Alcott denies her heroine the liberated future she secures for herself. And so Jo marries boring old Professor Bhaer and has two sons of her own.One might have thought five previous Little Women films and a recent TV mini-series would have curbed the public appetite for Greta Gerwig’s adaptation. Yet fans have been turning out in their droves, inspired by an enduring love for Jo and the story’s contemporary relevance. Just as A Christmas Carol resonates with a Britain once again experiencing Dickensian levels of poverty, so Little Women speaks to a generation of female writers still battling for recognition. Gerwig’s version has much to commend it [spoilers from here on in, folks]. The way she has played with the book’s structure, moving back and forth through time, allows the viewer to witness childhood events with the benefit of hindsight.Then there are the tableaux as vivid as Old Masters: the sisters draped round each other and Marmee or dressed as boys, with braces and bow ties, and Jo sucking on a pipe. The kite-flying scene on the beach is so achingly beautul you want to climb out of your seat and into the screen, and never .But what makes Gerwig’s film extraordinary is the way she taps into the feminist heart of the novel and reframes it for a modern audience. Look at her portrayal of the girls’ mother Marmee . Marmee can come across as saccharine, saintly, too good to be true. And always with the showy gesture, like trekking through the snow to give the family’s Christmas breakfast to the starving Hummels.Yet Gerwig shows how much it costs to be that person. After Jo’s tantrum almost leads to Amy drowning, Marmee confesses: “I am angry nearly every day.” The line is in the book. But Gerwig really makes you feel it: the relentless effort it takes to keep her emotions in check. There is a lot in Little Women about marriage, none of it in soft focus. Marmee is bringing up four girls more or less alone Meg and John struggle to get by. And as for Amy  Amy has to settle for second dibs on Laurie, evenit all works in the end. In the novel, Amy is the hardest of the sisters to like, but Gerwig throws fresh light on her materialism. When Laurie objects to her plans to wed the wealthy Fred Vaughn, she points out she has no real way of earning money of her own. “So don’t sit there and tell me that marriage isn’t an economic proposition,” she says.Gerwig also plays a blinder over Jo’s much-lamented union with Bhaer. For a start she makes him younger and altogether more desirable than his literary counterpart. But also she blurs fantasy and reality. In her version, the book Jo is writing is Little Women. Though she protests, her publisher is adamant her main character – Jo – must wed. Jo follows her publisher’s advice and writes that endingand so – like Schrödinger’s cat – the eventual kiss beneath the umbrella both does and doesn’t exist.Gerwig frees her heroine from strictures of marriage which no longer apply. When it comes to Jo’s struggle to make it as a writer, however, nothing much has changed. Jo’s publisher likes her schlocky short stories, but fails to see the merit in a book about the lives of girls. Only when his daughters read and love the manuscript does he realise its commercial potential. Plus ça change.Later, Jo and Amy askwomen’s lives are too unimportant to be the subject of great art orthe failure to make great art about women’s lives is what leads them to be seen as unimportant. It’s a question to which Gerwig already knows the answer.Gerwig knows the answer because she works in a world where female artists are still belittled. Many men are reluctant to read books written by and or about women. Books by and or about women are less likely to be reviewed or to win literary prizes. The same applies to female directors. It is more dficult for women to break into film directing and when they do they are less likely to direct big budget movies. They are rarely nominated for Best Director Awards . The only woman to have won a Best Director Oscar is Kathryn Bigelow for The Hurt Locker, a low-budget movie about the Iraq War. Gerwig’s solo directorial debut, Lady Bird, received five Oscar nominations , but won none. She was not nominated for a Best Director Golden Globe. Little Women has already garnered many outstanding reviews. Since it opened on Christmas Day, it has beaten box office projections and been greeted enthusiastically both by long-term fans and those for whom the story is new.And yet the awards bodies appear unimpressed. Little Women received no Screen Actors Guild nominations and just two Golden Globe nominations . The Best Director category was once again an all-male affair, Nominees included Martin Scorsese for The Irishman, Todd Phillips for Joker and Quentin Tarantino for Once Upon A Time In Hollywood. These are all talented men, making wonderful films, but would any of them pass the Bechdel test Nor was Gerwig the only female director snubbed by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. Others who ought to have been in with a chance include Marielle Heller A Beautul Day In The Neighbourhood, Lulu Wang The Farewell and Lorene Scafaria Hustlers. The SAG awards are regarded as a bellwether for the Oscars. Yet just maybe, like Jo’s dismissive publisher, the Academy members will have their eyes opened, and the film will come away with a clutch of nominations, including Best Director, when the announcements are made next week.At the moment, it seems improbable but it would be narratively satisfyinga film that speaks so eloquently about the female experience should give the men a run for their money.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

But away from Stormont it’s clear that the PSNI and its still relatively new Chief Constable have a lot of work to do in order to undo the damage done in what’s been a year of reversals and missteps for an organisation that appears to have lost its direction and purpose. Not to put too fine a point on it, it’s been a disaster for the PSNI vis a vis its relationship with the nationalist community. The support the new policing arrangements were given to allow devolution to forge ahead was contingent on a number of factors, most of which have either fallen by the wayside or are being flagrantly disregarded. At the most basic level, the urgent requirement for the policing service to reflect the community it serves has never been met –on the contrary, it now appears to be in reverse with calls growing for ato - recruitment. Coming two decades after the formation of the PSNI, this is desperately disappointing and places a question mark over the very concept of fair and balanced policing. But to make things immeasurably worse, the performance of Simon Byrne in the top job has led many to question the wisdom of his appointment. Any casual observation of recent history will reveal that there is no appetite within the nationalist political family for knee-jerk targeting of new PSNI Chief Constables. But when the PSNI needs to be held to account it is held to account in a robust and positive manner – the legacy issue being a recurring source of contention. But in the seven months since Mr Byrne took on the role, we’ve seen an extraordinary series of what we might charitably call unfortunate events – some cynical and deliberate acts, some common or garden incompetence – which have been incredibly debilitating to law and order in the north and which mean that the coming year is one in which his ability to see out his contract is going to be put under very serious scrutiny. First and most worrying is Mr Byrne’s increasing determination to use the PSNI as a bulwark against progress on the aforementioned legacy issue. His decision to go the Supreme Court to appeal adverse rulings on legacy investigations has seen him park the PSNI tank on the lawn of victims and survivors. His extraordinarily brutish threat to take children away from their parents quite frankly left some experienced observers here open-mouthed in astonishment. And his handling of summer bonfire issues – in particular the Avoniel and New Lodge stand-offs – underlined concerns around whether he’s possessed of the necessary insight and tactical nous to lead the PSNI forward. And to put the tin hat on an annus horribilis for policing here, Mr Byrne decided to pose for a Christmas pic with heavily armed officers at Crossmaglen barracks, to the consternation of nationalist politicians. Entirely unsurprising entirely unacceptable. Possibly fixable possibly terminal."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"danny baker to takes over as lord mayor of belfast","story":"SINN Féin Councillor Danny Baker has officially been installed as Mayor of Belfast. The Colin area representative has replaced newly elected MP for North Belfast John Finucane.Co-opted to Belfast City Council in Janaury , the -year-old told the Andersonstown News that it will be a “huge honour” to represent the people of Belfast.“What can I say, it’s amazing,” he said. “I’m honoured to have been asked by Sinn Féin to be the next Ard Mhéara of Belfast. “I have been an activist in the Colin area since I was . I’m very much about grassroots politics and that theme is something I want to continue. “I want to use the office of Mayor to bring politics from the ground up.” Having topped the council election poll in May, Danny spoke of how he will be continuing the civic work of party colleague John Finucane. “The role of Mayor is city-wide, I want to be a Mayor for all communities and to represent everybody. I want to champion the need for improvements to our mental health services. It’s something that has really impacted the Colin area. I want to use the office of Mayor to help in whatever way I can. I will work with our young people to ensure that they are included in decision-making that they have a brighter future and better quality of le.”The Lagmore father-of-three said he will be straight into Mayor business when he takes over the ‘chain’ today.“I want to do this for my family.  has been a dficult year for our family with the loss of our mother Edna. Mum was probably my biggest supporter and I want to do her, my we and children proud.

I want to pay tribute to outgoing Ard Mhéara John Finucane.

No worries. I can’t even think of how I’ll start pronouncing your very dficult Irish first name. Foreigners will take time to digest the following Gaelic names: Caoimhe, Oisín, Siobhán, Niamh and a host of others. There is a historical context to this and this could just be the colonial remnants that were left in Africa as official languages! But that’s not an excuse, we must spell your names correctly and we hope you compliment migrants likewise. Udhi nade jo Belfast  . Its dholuo language spoken by people of the Luo community. The Luos were split around the East African borders of Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda South Sudan by migration southwards and during the remapping of Africa in . That’s a story for another day. Luo is among hundreds of dferent African languages and dialects spoken in Belfast. Most Africans are in many cases authoritatively bilingual, spoken and written, no supernatural powers there, just a fact of le and that’s before you include the colonial language English, French etc, so effectively trilingual. In many encounters Africans residing in Ireland are often politely teased with the query, can you speak African please  Honestly, we don’t get offended by that question, generally the interlocutor would probably have assumed that “Africa” is a Pan-African language. I wish! The continent has over , languages, dialects and subcultures. Notwithstanding, the four countries listed above are just a small fraction of African nationalities in Belfast. There are many. The population of perhaps the total sum of  African countries as represented in Belfast could be in the thousands – although being hypothetical is not my cup of tea. West and North Belfast are probably the more African by headcount, followed by South and then East of the city. Some African countries are more visible than others here and we shall come to that in one of my future writings here at Andersonstown News. I just can’t wait. There is so much to explore in the lives of Africans in West and the rest of Belfast when you are inside the broth, it is the freshness you will get in this column moving forward, the smell, beauty and finesse of Africa. Having authored articles on migration in this past decade, it will certainly be a new environment to revisit, new faces, adults and also growing youthful population of first, second and third generation people who were either born in Africa or strongly identy with the continent because of family ties, social or legal reasons. n Elly Omondi Odhiambo is a freelance writer based in Belfast."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"health workers begin 12 hour","story":"THOUSANDS of health workers across the north have begun -hour strike action in a dispute over pay and patient safety.The Royal College of Nursing, who represent around , nurses, are taking strike action for the first time in its -year history.About , other nurses, who are members of Unison have also walked out.On Tuesday night, leaders of the five main parties met the head of the NI Civil Service, David Sterling, and Health Department Permanent Secretary, Richard Pengelly, in a th-hour bid to avert the strike action and state their “collective support for the restoration of pay parity”.The Northern Ireland Office later said that Health was a devolved matter and Mr Sterling rejected the idea of restoring pay parity on the grounds of public interest.UNISON Regional Secretary Patricia McKeown said: “Everyone with power and authority in this society has conceded that our cause is just.

Mr Caraher had been the victim of systemic harassment by the RUC in the lead-in to the Royal Marines shooting him dead. The harassing RUC were based at Crossmaglen Barracks. Sited beside Crossmaglen Rangers GAA club, RUC officers and British army soldiers had to be flown in via helicopter in military operations. All while the people who actually lived in the place trained, played and socialised in the GAA grounds on its doorstep. It was a physical epitome of occupation. Social media at Christmas is usually the pretty standard fare of hope and goodwill to all. Sadly, the PSNI’s Chief Constable social media was a wholly dferent offering, echoing Christmases Past in South Armagh. His pictures came from Crossmaglen , a strange choice of venue given the PSNI barracks in Crossmaglen has transformed from the days of conflict and is only open a few hours a week. Tuesday and Thursday from am-pm and on a Saturday from pm-pm. Not Wednesdays, not Christmas Day . But it was not the out-of-hours visit that caused people to stop in their tracks. It was the picture of Mr Byrne with four of his colleagues, two of them posing with heavy-duty rles. It was reminiscent of the heavy, dark days of conflict when the RUC would stand posing in their militarised version of disgraced policing. And all of the resulting echoes of the RUC, militarisation, shoot-to-kill and disgrace evoked by those photographs were heard loud and clear on Christmas Day as we read the tweet in disbelief. The response was unanimous from the population of Crossmaglen and the politicians that represent it: that it was ill-judged at best, and in no way reflected the contextual reality for modern policing. The wider response from commentators, journalists and others on social media was equally swt. This was an unwarranted, unhelpful and bizarre tweet and another misstep from a tone-deaf Chief Constable. This was in further evidence on St Stephen’s Day when he refused to withdraw the tweet and issued a statement justying the display of heavy weaponry as reflecting the terrorist threat his officers operate with. Presumably on Tuesday and Thursday mornings and Saturday evenings. It insulted the intelligence of anyone with half a genuine concern. His response displays the signs of a a weak man trying to act hard and when called out refuses to accept responsibility and blames the “bad boys”. The six counties have never had acceptable policing. Policing has always operated at dferent stages of history to reinforce British occupation: the Protestant State for a Protestant People since partition British military policy during the conflict and extremely sinister policies of shoot to kill and collusion. The PSNI is meant to be the new beginning we deserve and need. Human rights-compliant, accountable, community-based, responsive and supported policing that meets our needs as a community in its entirety. Many of us have tried to make that potential a reality. This Chief Constable doesn’t get it and, most worryingly of all, he appears to be too arrogant in his approach to learn. If policing was in crisis under George Hamilton for its defence of the RUC, which it was, then things have worsened under the clueless Mr Byrne."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"welcome organisation be kind to those living on the street","story":"I meet with Welcome Organisation CEO Sandra Moore in a room stacked from floor to almost ceiling of sleeping bags, which I’m told, have been donated by the Marine Society and Sea Cadets. Most,not all, of these will be gone over the coming nights to those sleeping rough in the city centre. Offering tea and coffee on tap from am until pm at their Townsend Street HQ, Sandra told the Andersonstown News that the need for their service is very much “ days a year”. “We have service users coming to us with ious needs, whether it’s clothes, a cup of tea or somewhere to have a bit of refuge. We do make targeted appeals throughout the year via our Facebook page and we do have people ringing to ask is there anything in particular we need. We always need decent trainers, sturdy, durable. We can’t hold out to jeans, in smaller sizes of waist, new underwear on which there is a massive demand all year round, socks and toiletries. “We can’t hold out to coffee, tea, sugar, washing powder, toilet roll, those things make a big dference to us,” she said.“We would ask for those who are donating that there is a reasonable le left in the items they want to give. We always have a need for sleeping bags and we don’t distribute tents on the streets as they would pose a danger.”Established  years ago, the Welcome Organisation has provided a vital shelter for those sleeping rough and who are experiencing homelessness. Sandra spoke of how the need for the service has “changed dramatically” in that time.“We are dealing with a greater number of people, people with more signicant issues, drug, alcohol, mental health, not all the people we work with do, its some, not all. What we are finding is that the age profile of those seeking the service is much younger, and there are more women coming to the Organisation. When I came  years ago we had six women in service. Now a third of our service users are female.”She continued: “We are working with homelessness in its most chronic form. We can’t forget that there is hidden homelessness. By that I mean people sleeping on sofas, moving from pillar to post. Nobody has a handle on that. One in  people within their le in Northern Ireland will experience homelessness. Le expectancy of someone who has had periods of continuous homelessness is  for a woman and  for a man.”Sandra said that currently those service users at the centre are predominantly young males from North and West Belfast.As  comes to a close, Sandra said that the issue of homelessness is facing a constant struggle in the New Year.“All services are facing pressure, lack of mental health services, lack of drug and alcohol support service and not just in Belfast, right across the North. We do not have detox or rehab facilities here, what services are there, due to severe pressures, aren’t responsive enough. We are trying to bridge that gap. It’s quite evident right across the city that there is a growing drug problem, there is a real need for education in communities. “People have to bear in mind that there is a back story to each and every person who is homeless. This is someone’s son, somebody’s daughter. Nobody has ever set out on that path. What child do you ask and they say ‘I want to be ill’, ‘I want to be struggling with addiction’, ‘I want to be homeless’. It’s not an aspiration but unfortunately it’s were we are. In Belfast I think we have a chance to not end up like Dublin, like London, the big cities. We still have a chance of doing something to contain it, but the agencies need to work together.”“No-one knows what the budget is for Ireland next year. How can you possibly plan while we have no minister for finance or minster for health  We, along with others, are highly dependent on the good will of the public, we couldn’t survive without the public,” she said. “I’ve been here  years and every year I am still overwhelmed by the generosity of people, people are very kind, however homelessness is an issue  days of the year.”Sandra said the levels of increased poverty within households job losses and the impact of Universal Credit are contributing factors to homelessness. “Regardless of whatever way Brexit goes, the economy is shrinking again, there is higher unemployment. “As my grandmother always said ‘when poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window’. We see so many times relationships breaking down because of the stresses of poverty linked to job losses. Statistics show that children growing up in poverty that their le chances are much worse. Someone who experiences homelessness as a child is much more likely to experience it as an adult – we need more preventive services going forward.”With the Organisation’s core team of staff, Sandra said that they couldn’t provide their service without their “ volunteers”. “We had  for Christmas dinner last year and so far we have wrapped over  Christmas presents,  of those bespoke for our regular users. We are inundated with people wanting to volunteer with us on Christmas Day – it’s a lovely day but it’s a hard day for a lot of people as you can imagine. We try to keep familiar faces around for the people that are coming in.“We just want to thank everyone for their continued support, we couldn’t do our work without it. We have a fantastic team of staff, of volunteers and the support of the public and the community. All I would ask is that people continue to be kind. That’s all I ask, is for people to be kind to those on the street. We don’t always know the story of how or why it has come to that.”For more information on the Welcome Organisation or to donate visit www.homelessbelfast.org"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"young people saying yes to yeha project","story":"ESTABLISHED over ten years ago, the YEHA Project has gone from strength to strength in helping young people in North Belfast.Based in the Flax Centre and the Houben Centre in Ardoyne, YEHA stands for Youth, Education, Health and Advice.The YEHA Project is made up of a small dedicated team of five full-time staff, sessional workers and a team of volunteers. One such youth worker is -year-old Cara O’Kane, who has been involved with YEHA Project for four years.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Cara explained more about the work of YEHA Project.“The YEHA Project supports young people in North Belfast aged  to  to tackle issues affecting their health and emotional well being,” she said.“Our work with young people embraces the core principles of youth work with therapeutic approaches.“Basically, we were set up over ten years ago to tackle health inequalities in North Belfast.“Our focus is on trying to get young people to focus on healthy lestyles and make positive and healthy choices regarding their wellbeing.“We do a lot of mentoring and support work where a young person would work with a youth worker informally centered around mental health and wellbeing. This may involve building coping skills and strategies for any dficulties they are facing in their le and looking at their interests and skills.“We want young people more involved in the community and activities instead of just going home after school as well.“It is about getting them out and about and giving them opportunities to try dferent things“We have had fantastic feedback from the young people themselves about the work that we do. They are testament to the work that they do themselves with our projects.“Our projects are all voluntary and everything is in the young person’s hands. Sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone but the benefits are massive.The YEHA Project is also involved with cross-community work, alongside an organisation based on the Woodvale called Streetbeat Youth Project.Another successful project is the Carezone in Schools project, a pilot programme which is currently into its second year, based at Mercy College.Cara explained: “It is a model where we run one-to-one support within the school and have someone from YEHA project in the school daily to work with students in school.“After running a research programme, we found that over  per cent of young people would be more likely to speak to another young person about their problems rather than an adult.“We run the one-to-one mentoring service alongside a Peer Mentor programme where young people are trained up in Peer Mentoring to help support other young people on issues affecting their mental health and enables them to signpost to relevant support agencies.“It was a successful first year and last year we delivered  sessions to  pupils covering a range of issues including building coping skills and resilience, relationships, communication and social skills, health and well-being and anxiety.“We have a nice room in Mercy College where young people can come and relax and they are more likely to open up in such an environment.“It is all voluntary too, of course.”One young person, who took part in the programme, Jodie Shevlin, praised the benefits of it during the pressures of school exams.“The Carezone in Schools project is a way for pupils to distress and escape from the pressure of school work and exam,” she said.“The one-to-one work the project does is a chance for us to get worries or problems off our chest and be able to just have a more relaxed chat where we are really listened to.“It has really helped me get through my last few years of school.”YEHA ProjectFlax CentreArdoyne AvenueBelfast BT DATel:    "},{"url":null,"title":"full list of northern ireland new years honours","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Former Chief Constable George Hamilton, who had described the officers as \"brave\", later apologised to the families of the teenagers.March: Soldier F is chargedIn March, a former Paratrooper was told he will face murder charges over the killing of two people on Bloody Sunday in Londonderry in .The Public Prosecution Service said there was enough evidence to prosecute Soldier F for the murders of James Wray and William McKinney.William McKinneyThe sole prosecution was seen as a \"terrible disappointment\" by some of the families of the  people killed at a civil rights march on  January, .The day became known as Bloody Sunday - one of the darkest days of the Troubles.Soldier F also faces charges for the attempted murders of Patrick ODonnell, Joseph Friel, Joe Mahon and Michael Quinn.The Public Prosecution Service said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute  other soldiers and two Official IRA men.James Wrays brother Liam said he was \"very saddened for the other families\" of those killed on Bloody Sunday.\"Their hearts must be broken,\" he said.\"It has been a sad day but the Wray family are relieved.\"Linda Nash, whose brother William was shot dead, said she felt \"let down by a law and a justice system thats supposed to protect people\".But the news led to a loyalist campaign of support for Soldier F, with banners erected across Northern Ireland over what some saw as the unfair victimisation of former British soldiers who served here.April: Lyra McKee is shot dead by dissidentsJournalist Lyra McKeewas fatally shot in the head while observing rioting in Londonderrys Creggan estate in April. The New IRA later admitted carrying out the murder.Massive public outcry followed her death, with former prime minister Theresa May, Irish president Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar among those to attend her funeral at St Annes Cathedral in Belfast.Lyra McKeeThere was a standing ovation, and loud applause erupted, at her funeral service when priest Fr Martin Magill openly challenged the politicians in the pews over the ongoing Stormont stalemate. \"Why in Gods name does it take the death of a -year-old woman to get to this point \" he asked.In the days after the murder a protest by friends of Ms McKee took place outside the Londonderry offices of dissident republican political group Saoradh, which has been linked to the New IRA.A number of protesters smeared red handprints on republican slogans outside the office, and they quickly became a symbol for peace across the country.A strong LGBTQ activist, Belfast born Lyra had moved to Derry to be with her partner, Sara Canning, shortly before her death.Her book, Angels with Blue Faces, which deals with the  IRA murder of Belfast MP Robert Bradford, was published several months after her death.June: Boris tackles BrexitAway from the ongoing political turmoil as Stormont remained closed for business, the main topic in the political arena was Brexit.After several failed attempts to get her Brexit deal for the UK to leave the European Union through Parliament, Theresa May announced she would be standing down as Prime Minister on May .Mrs May was finally replaced by Boris Johnston after leaving office on June .After ing to the EU, Mr Johnson came back with a new deal, but several more failed attempts to find a route through parliament finally led to a General Election on December .Boris JohnsonBrexit brought particular concerns for Northern Ireland, the only part of the UK with an EU land border, and debate raged over the frontier. Business leaders said no-deal would have proved disastrous. The farming community was facing devastation with the loss of EU subsidies coupled with new trade tarfs between north and south. Experts warned that farmers would be left facing bankruptcy.A real issue for all was the lack of clarity about what any potential Brexit would mean for Northern Ireland. Everyone had an opinion on what Brexit would mean. When Mr Johnson ed with his new deal from the EU, it became known as the Betrayal Act by loyalists who saw it as a threat to the Union. They claimed it put an economic border in the Irish Sea and meant Northern Ireland would be treated dferently to the rest of the UK.Disagreements about what it all means for Northern Ireland will continue in the next  months.July: Lowry wins at PortrushJuly saw the worlds best golfers and thousands of golf fans flock to the north coast as Royal Portrush hosted The Open for the first time in almost  years.The championship generated more than £ million of economic benefit for Northern Ireland, according to a study commissioned by organisers and proved a real boost to the tourist industry with hotels sold out and fans flocking to the scenic location from across the world - , fans arrived on the north coast with more than half coming from outside Northern Ireland.Shane LowryThe figures helped boost predictions that  will be a record breaking year for tourism in Northern Ireland with .m people expecting to have visited in the year.Irish winner Shane Lowry lted the coveted Claret Jug at the end of the event, six shots clear of nearest challenger, Englands Tommy Fleetwood.

We have no reason to believe she wandered off and is lost.\"Teenager Nora Quoirin went missing on a family holidayIncreasingly desperate after nine days without news, Noras family offered a £, reward, donated by a Belfast businessman, for information, but a day later Noras body was discovered near a waterfall less than two miles from the holiday villa.Malaysian police said they believed she died from internal bleeding probably caused by hunger and stress.Her parents have always maintained a criminal element was involved and have since enlisted the support of the Irish government as they call for Malaysian authorities to carry out an in-depth inquiry.Noras funeral was held at St Brigids Church, Belfast, on September .October: immigrants’ bodies found in lorryIn October, the UK was shocked when  bodies of immigrants were discovered in the back of a lorry.Lorry driver Maurice Mo Robinson from Co Armagh was arrested in the wake of the tragedy.All those who died - eight women and  men - were originally from Vietnam and had been trying to enter the UK illegally in the refrigerated trailer.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The container lorry in which  people were found dead at Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays, Essex Police said they had received the first reports about bodies found in a lorry in Grays, Essex just before .am on October .Robinsonwas later charged with the manslaughter of the  victims, people trafficking, and immigration and money laundering offences.He pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey on November  to conspiring with others to assist illegal immigration between May ,  and October , .A second man from Northern Ireland was charged with multiple counts of manslaughter.

The biggest loser was the DUP, with Nigel Dodds ousted by Sinn Feins John Finucane after serving as North Belfast MP for  years. The DUP also lost South Belfast where the SDLPs Claire Hanna unseated Emma Little-Pengelly by over , votes.

He said issues that were being consistently raised included the availability of ambulances and a dearth of staff working in health clinics and hospitals.“Traditionally, at this time of year the demand on health services starts to build, but what is dferent this time is that we have seen an increase in the number of constituents who are coming to us over hospital admissions.“People waiting for surgery, for a consultant appointment- I even had someone with me recently waiting on cancer treatment.“There is no doubt about it, the health system is under pressure, both locally and further afield. It is a resource issue- we need more staff, more consultants, more doctors and more nurses. Those working in our health care system are left coping with the huge demand and are feeling the pressure.

Ebenezer Scrooge wasnt the first fictional character to see ghosts at this time of year. In fact the tradition probably goes back further than Christmas itself. As the nights grow long and the year creeps towards its close its a natural instinct that people gather together. Its also natural that this time makes us think of people and places that are no longer here. These thoughts have often morphed into tales based on what we encounter at this time of year - winter, death and the eventual rebirth experienced in spring. googletag.cmd.push In Europe this was usually connected to the pagan rituals surrounding the winter solstice known as Yule. The shortest and darkest day of the year was viewed as a time when the dead would have access to the living. The telling of tales at Yuletide began to decline as TV took over as the main form of household entertainment, but it must also be remembered that when Dickens published A Christmas Carol in  the tradition of Christmas itself was also in decline. In fact, for most people in that era Christmas was a working day because the Industrial Revolution meant fewer days off for everyone. As a result, Christmas was considered relatively unimportant and no one really complained. googletag.cmd.push The beginning of disregarding Christmas had come courtesy of Oliver Cromwell around  years earlier. The puritanical Lord Protector of England who in the th Century was “on a mission to cleanse the nation of its most decadent excesses.” These excesses unfortunately included banning Christmas celebrations, its ghostly tales and traditions with even carols making his draconian hit list. Oliver Cromwell is of course remembered in Ireland for his other exploits including the deaths of thousands of people as the result of his orders. But despite his best efforts he failed to quell the traditions of folklore carried over from pre-Christian Ireland. In the Irish tradition, ghosts are called taidhbhse or tais and live in a place halfway between this le and the next. The spirits are held here by some earthly affection or unfulfilled duty or anger against the living. Those who die suddenly, more commonly than others, are believed to become haunting Ghosts. They go about moving the furniture, and in every way trying to attract attention. It was also believed that when the soul has left the body, it is drawn away, sometimes, by the fairies. Such souls are considered lost. If a soul eludes the fairies, it may be snapped up by the evil spirits. The weak souls of young children were especially in danger. In western Ireland for example, people sprinkled the threshold with the blood of a chicken when a very young child died so that the spirits may be drawn away to the blood. A ghost was also compelled to obey the commands of the living. One old tale said, the stable-boy up met the master going round the yards after he had been two days dead, and told him to be away with him to the lighthouse, and haunt that and there he is far out to sea still. Oscar Wildes mother who studied and wrote about the supernatural thought it was only spirits who were too bad for heaven, and too good for hell, who were caught halfway between paradise and damnation. It was also thought that the souls of the dead sometimes took the shapes of animals. They will sometimes take the forms of insects, especially butterflies. If you see one fluttering near a corpse, that is the soul, and is a sign of its having entered upon immortal happiness. The author of the Parochial Survey of Ireland, , heard a woman say to a child who was chasing a butterfly, How do you know it is not the soul of your grandfather. Spirits who remain inside houses can also take on many shapes, including that of the elf and sometimes also of a rat, cat, or black dog. In their natural state they are invisible to people, but they can become visible in these forms. They make a lot of noise in the house at night and live between the walls, in the attic or in the cellar, in the stable, in the shed, sometimes even in a large tree beside the house. These ghosts are not considered particularly intelligent, and remain friendly as long as they are treated well. They like to tease lazy people by pulling the blankets off their beds and sending icy drafts through the room. They also delight in knocking over milk pails and keeping people awake by constantly tapping on the walls. When made very angry, they become malevolent. Their noise making becomes unbearable they throw stones, the cattle become sick, drought or cold weather or continuous storms occur. They leave the house or farm only when it has been totally overwhelmed by disaster and is lost. And, there is a well-known local wintry ghostly tale which refers to The Lady in the Snow which is said to have happened on the outskirts of Derry. The story is of two children, a brother and sister who were playing in the snow near a small stream near Enagh Lough. They were making a snowman and gradually they moved closer and closer to the water until they were standing on the ice. A woman dressed in a grey coat and a fur muff approached them, warning them of the danger. She coaxed them back to the bank just as the ice began to crack. She asked where they lived and she advised them to go home. The little girl askedshe could walk home with them andshe could put her hands in the muff to make them warm. The woman put the muff on the little girl and they chatted as they walked. She told them that she had a little girl who went into the water through the ice and warned them to be careful. At the gate she took her muff back and watched them being greeted at the door by their mother. They were both pointing at the lady and gesticulating but the mother saw no one. However she went to the gate because the children were so convinced that a lady had walked home with them. On the snow there were only the footprints of her children. When the snow melted a muff was found near the lake. The little girl knew it was the one that the lady wore.

For decade upon decade, especially in rural Ireland, New Years Eve was about exactly that - staying in. New Year was never truly a big thing in Ireland - especially for farming communities for who the fortunes of the crops were all important. Irish New Year traditions in agricultural areas, such as they are, are all about the coming twelve months. One belief was that no water could be drawn from the well after the sun went down on New Years Eve. All the water required needed to be inside the house before that and none of it could leave the house until the next day. Defying this belief meant that the family would be faced with a drought in the new year. googletag.cmd.push There was also a tradition that no money could be spent on New Years Day. Nothing could be brought out of a home and anyone visiting should make sure they came bearing a gt. Giving something away meant giving your money away and surely no sensible person would do that. The stroke of midnight on December  carried traditions of its own. Being the first visitor to a house on New Years Day was a popular custom but the warmth of your welcome was largely dependent on the colour of your hair. Unless he arrived empty handed, a dark haired man would be greeted gladly because it was believed that he would bring plenty of good luck. However, a red headed womans arrival meant ill fortune evenher arms were weighed down with all the tokens of what was known as first footing - bread and coal. Red haired females apparently tended to stay at home on New Years Eve. googletag.cmd.push In fact to prevent bad luck, families sometimes sent out a dark haired member of the family immediately after midnight and had them walk back in though the door. All dark haired boys in the area would visit the houses and be welcomed with gts of sweets or money. Anything bad that happened on New Years Eve was considered more signicant the closer it was to midnight. It was believed that there was only a certain amount of luck in the world and everything that could be done to claim a share of it had to be done. It was also important to begin the New Year with a spotlessly clean house signying a fresh start to the New Year. New Years Eve was also known as “Oiacuteche na Coda Moacuteire,”- ‘the night of the big portion’ since people would eat a larger than normal meal to ensure food in plenty for the coming year. Another way of ensuring plenty was to make a cake which was then pounded against the door of the house three times while a prayer was said by the housewe. This would chase the bad luck out of the house and invite the good spirits in. In other areas the man of the house would take three bites out of the cake and then throw it against the front door, in the name of the Trinity and banish hunger from the house. After this the family would then gather up the fragments of the cake and eat it. Many farmers repeated this ceremony at the door of the byre to ensure plentul fodder for the cows. People tried to ensure that no food was taken away from the house on New Years Eve and beggars knew better than to approach a house looking for food. Another New Years Eve Irish tradition was that young girls put mistletoe under their pillows on New Year’s Eve, in hopes of dreaming about their future husband. On New Year’s Eve night, families would remember those who has passed away that year before by setting a place for them at the dinner table and leaving the door unlatched. Anyone entering the house after midnight by the front door would leave by the back door for good luck. Well into the evening on New Years Eve in Ireland there would always be a small group gathered around the fireplace, laughing and joking. Sooner or later, the conversation would turn to reminiscing about Ireland. The old ones, well on their way with a few glasses of the hard stuff, would get all misty-eyed as they remembered times past and the stories would begin in the light of just the fire and candles burning in the windowsill. There was also an Irish tradition of predicting the political future of the country by checking which way the wind blows at midnight on New Year’s Eve. If the wind is from the west, there is a chance that good fortune will reign that year. If the wind is from the east, however, the British will prevail. And,after the stroke of midnight the man of the house would recite the following verse: “May your nets always be full, Your pockets never empty, Your horse not cast a shoe, Nor the devil look at you In the coming year.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It also saw a change from the dominance of Slaughtneil and Ballinderry for most of the decade. The Emmets knocked out the Shamrocks before falling victim to Glens devastating running game in the semi-final. The Watties were unable to carry that form into the final where a Magherafelt team, while only winning by a point, were worthy winners of the John McLaughlin Cup. Away from the final, Banagher were the story that kicked the championship into le. Despite bring relegated without winning a googletag.cmd.push game, they dumped out Bellaghy and Swatragh before pushing Adrian Cushs side to the pin of their collar in the semi-final. - Daryl McDermottAfter picking up the intermediate goalkeeping spot last year and making the hurling selection, Sticks once again is honoured.He was the undisputed goalkeeper of the year. His kicking against Bellaghy was pin-point and ied. In their win over Swatragh he made two fantastic saves and Magherafelt would have been out of sight only for his brilliance. [nd All-Star]  - Conor McCluskeyWhile also a very capable baller, Clucker was Adrian Cushs go-to marker in defence.He was asked to shackle Colm McGoldrick when Darren ONeill was black-carded. He kept a lid on Peter Hagan in the semi-final while getting forward to add to their attacking arsenal. Jack Doherty and Ryan Johnston also struggled against him. Two messy Benny Heron goals, neither of them his fault, was the only blot on a perfect season. [st All-Star] googletag.cmd.push  - Brendan RogersLike goalkeeper McDermott, Roger is a dual selection.In the Ballinderry game, he did a marking job on Ryan Bell yet still was able to get Slaughtneil on the attack with his trademark barnstorming runs from defence.His absence from full-back left the door open for Glen to exploit but his one man crusade almost pegged the Emmets back to nip the Watties. [th All-Star]  - Fergal DuffinGets the nod ahead of Darren ONeill and was a vital cog in Magherafelts defence.Came out on top of his battle with Ruairi Mooney and he blotted out Conor Feeney on Banaghers kick-outs. He held Kilcoos Paul Devlin scoreless from play but it was his county final performance that stands out. Two moments of bravery to win turnovers that resulted in Rossa scores.[nd All-Star]  - Gavin ONeillCharlie OKane kept Bellaghy guessing with Gavin ONeills jersey number positioning and in his new wing back role, he was immense. The fact that he nicked man of the match ahead of Conor Feeney and Tiarnan Moore spoke wonders of his performance.Swatragh didnt learn the lesson and once again ONeill bossed the game from wing-back, edging the battle with Patrick Kearney.[nd All-Star]  - Connor CarvilleWhen Glen licked their wounds after their hammering in the league by Slaughtneil, it was Connor Carville that learned the most. Following Sammy Bradley left Glen open.In the championship he was a dferent animal and when Oisin Hegarty was dismissed against Loup he was one of Glens leaders.Against Magherafelt he was one of the few to offer any help to goalkeeper Callum Mullan-Young. Glen didnt have enough like him. [st All-Star]   - Conor KearnsWith Michael McEvoy going under the kne, Magherafelts system of play needed someone to link their defence to attack. Kearns fitted the bill and thrived in his new found freedom. He handled an endless supply of ball against Coleraine and didnt look back. His goal proved to be the vital score to sink Banagher. He didnt deserve his season to end prematurely with a harsh black card against Kilcoo. [st All-Star] - SENIOR PLAYER OF THE YEAR  - Danny HeavronThe Rossa skipper once again poured out everything he had for the cause.His influence helped them see off Coleraine and his moment of quick-thinking put Kearns through for the all-important goal against Banagher. In the final he pressed high on Glens kick-outs to turn the game. Against Kilcoo he once again linked the play and was missed during a brief spell at full-forward. [st All-Star]  - Ciaran McFaulAfter Loups goal it was McFauls point that made Glen believe again. When they were staring into a defeat against Lavey, he led the way again and his display of fielding was simply awesome. Against Slaughtneil he plucked another one from the air, just when Glen needed a moment of inspiration.Not as influential in the final as was required. Without him, Glen wouldnt have got there and given three more seconds. he wouldve forced a replay. [nd All-Star]  - Christopher BradleySammy led their scoring charts in the league and it was his accuracy that edged out a well-organised Newbridge in round one. When he found the net against Ballinderry, it cemented Slaughtneils place in the last four.Against Glen, he made their attack tick and was unlucky not be their last gasp hero but Oran McGills left foot denied him a potential winning goal and a county final spot.[rd All-Star]  - Danny TallonDespite being captain, he was replaced against Loup but took it on the chin and came back stronger.Kicked a point against Lavey and plucked two vital balls from the skies as Glen dug themselves out of another hole.He gave Keelan Feeney the runaround in the semi-final. A hamstring injury shadowed his preparation for the final, but he saved his best for last and put in a performance that deserved to lt the John McLaughlin Cup.[st All-Star]  - Emmett McGuckinHis goal against Coleraine kicked off Magherafelts route to glory, as he delivered in spades.Revelling in the freedom of midfield he made his side tick and his performance in the final, along with that of Odhraacuten Lynch, ended the Rossa famine. His scores broke Glens hearts.Kilcoo had no answer to him at full-forward and he didnt deserve to be on the losing side. [st All-Star]  - Francis KearneyDaniel McKinless and Paul Gunning can count themselves unlucky to miss out.Francis Kearney carried his league form into the championship. He was in red hot formover Swatraghs two games. If the Swa had been able to get a handle on Banaghers attack, his scoring power wouldve taken them to the last four. [st All-Star]  - Alex DohertyAnother contender for player of the championship, he pinged - from play and was Glens top scorer.His goal against Lavey was sensational. After beating three men on his road to goal, he powered to the net for the goal that arguably changed Glens season. Scoring - off Karl McKaigue is no mean feat and he backed it up with four mighty points in the final. [st All-Star]  - Tiarnan MooreOne year on from tearing intermediate defences apart, Moore was at it again. His tally of -, with one assist from brother Niall, tore the Bellaghy defence asunder as he revelled in the open spaces.While he didnt score against Swatragh he pulled their defence all over the place as Banagher once again made hay.His frightening pace was one of the stories of the championship.

Meanwhile, EU leaders drown migrants in the Mediterranean, provide arms and political cover for dictatorships infor contracts with European companies, collude in Zionist assaults on Palestinian rights, etc.But everywhere, too, there is revolt. Chile, Hong Kong, France, Catalonia, Iraq, Sudan, etc, have all seen millions in the streets against the rule of the rich over the poor. In Lebanon, a by-word for communal hostility, Sunni, Shia, Christians and Druze have come together in angry array against the elites.Young people in unprecedented numbers have swamped cities demanding radical action to save the planet.Long struggle has finally won abortion rights for Irish women, North and South, and equal marriage in the North.There’s evidence everywhere that the isions which keep the working class enchained can begin to melt in the heat of struggle.In Ireland, the battle lines are drawn between those who want unity of the oppressed in pursuit of a better world and defenders of the riven status quo.The battle is unequal. The forces of the Right seem in the ascendant. But  has also shown the depth of resilience and the fighting capacity of plain people. The magnitude of the masses shouting out across continents has had the character of a global uprising.It is in this that socialists find hope for the future, across all Ireland as throughout the world.Orange and Green politics are useless when it comes to defending the NHS, resisting job losses, opposing welfare “reform,” fighting for civil rights for all, etc.What’s needed is to drive forward and expand the emerging struggle all around us. The same perspective lights the way to Irish unity.Homeless deaths on the streets, hospital patients stacked in corridors, teachers run ragged in over-crowded class-rooms, workers denied union rights, State corruption, a suicide epidemic - all these apply in equal measure North and South. It is by bringing these struggles together that we can transcend the borders within and between us.We in People Before Profit put all our trust in the indomitability of the working class of the world.Pessimism is a weapon to be used against us. We don’t believe we won’t win. Here and everywhere, the vanquished of today will be the victors of tomorrow.These are the perspectives which guide us in our work in trades unions, civil rights campaigns, the environmental movement, and in all .We urge all who sympathise with this approach to join us in struggle in the year to come. googletag.cmd.push Eamonn McCann googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He believes the EU budget will be “signicantly reduced” following the UK’s departure, which, coupled with the possible admission of other countries into the EU, will have a detrimental impact on the Republic of Ireland moving forward.The recent Westminster election results can be interpreted as giving voice to the exasperated desire of many people to see a Stormont Government up and running to try and deal with the extreme circumstances that abound in health, education and other sectors in our society. Another element has been seized upon by some in declaring that for the first time there are more Nationalist MPs than Unionist MPs elected. This disguises the more fundamental point that while some Irish republicans go into a frenzy about demographic change bringing with it the so - called inevitability of a united Ireland, they have avoided actual election results which show nothing like that outcome. In this year’s election there were first time voters who had not been born when I was first elected to Parliament in . In that Westminster election  years ago, the united Ireland parties, Sinn Fein and SDLP, obtained .% of the vote, while at last month’s Westminster election Sinn Fein, SDLP and Aontuacute got .%. Support for those parties that advocate a united Ireland is less now than it was when I was elected in . The much vaunted “demographic change” that republicans repeat ad nauseum has worsened their chances not improved them. The other more practical problem they face is that just as any pan unionist vision of an ultimate solution such as total integration within the UK wouldnt have been possible or practical whatever the majority voting for it may have been, just so any pan nationalist vision of an ultimate solution of a United Ireland would fail by the same criteria. The other big ticket item next year will be the Brexit proposition. Again, those who advocate staying in the EU through an impossible united Ireland have not been open about what lies aheadthey were to be successful. The EU budget will be signicantly reduced on an annual basis by the UKs net contributions of approximately poundbillion. Countries such as Serbia and Montenegro potentially joining in the next five or six years means the budget would become even more hard pressed let alone any fancul notion that an Independent Scotland would be re admitted pressurising those net contributing countries, such as the Irish Republic, for more money again. In short, staying in the EU in those circumstances would cost the Irish Republic much more than it is costing them now, anyone looking to join them should ponder that.  is the year we must press the new PM to give us a more equal United Kingdom as opposed to an even more expensive EU. googletag.cmd.push Gregory Campbell googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

But, is the colder weather having an impact on your sleep  Are you struggling to drt off or waking up feeling chilly  If so, don’t fear. Holly Housby, sleep expert from Sealy UK, is here to help with her top tips for sleeping when it’s cold. Take a bathNot just relaxing, having a bath before bed can actually help to promote sleep and induce tiredness. Your temperature naturally dips at night as your body prepares for rest, beginning about two hours before sleep. When you soak in a hot bath, your temperature rises by a degree or two, and the rapid cool-down immediately after the bath imitates this natural decrease of your body temperature, which can help you to fall asleep faster. googletag.cmd.push Wear woolly socks, not cottonOften, poor circulation means that our feet are the first part of our body to get cold. Wearing woollen socks can help to keep you warm throughout the night - unlike cotton, wool is an great insulator and retains heat. And even better, wool has anti-bacterial properties meaning your cosy socks are odour resistant. Get movingExercising in the late-afternoon and early-evening can help to boost your body’s circulation and body temperature. However, it’s important to steer clear of exercise in the hour before bed, so as to avoid this having an impact on your sleep. googletag.cmd.push Say no to a night-capNot only does alcohol limit the amount of time you spend in REM sleep, the most restorative stage of sleep, it’s been suggested that alcohol can actually contribute to a lower body temperature. This is because alcohol causes your blood vessels to dilate, which takes blood and heat away from the core of your body. If you still want to enjoy a nightcap in the evening, make sure you only have one, and have it as early in the evening as possible to minimise its effects at bedtime. Upgrade your TOGIt goes without saying that investing in a thick, cosy duvet is important to staying warm during the winter nights. As a rule of thumb, a winter duvet should have a tog rating of . – . However, it’s also worth considering the filling.Wool-filled duvets can be quite chunky, making a good choice the cold nights. However, there are also synthetic duvets which are manufactured from fibres that are designed keep you warm while you sleep, which can be a great choice for those looking for hypo-allergenic options.

Speaking from Stormont yesterday evening, Mr Eastwood said: “It has always been the case over the last three years that a deal to restore power sharing government in Northern Ireland could be done within a matter of hours. The political will now exists to secure a deal, it’s important that parties work intensively to get this over the line. “The SDLP has worked hard with other parties to deliver proposals which we believe will unlock the impasse by reforming the Petition of Concern to make it a human rights compliant instrument. We are prepared to stretch ourselves to reach a consensus that delivers inclusive power sharing institutions. googletag.cmd.push “Next week healthcare workers will again take strike action in defence of patient safety and to secure a fair deal for hard pressed frontline staff. Their needs should be at the front of all our minds in the time ahead. It’s time we had a government that delivers for healthcare staff, for schools under immense financial strain and for families facing a welfare clfedge. This is a time to deliver. It’s time for politicians to get back to work.”  googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A video introducing Brooke Scullion revealed that she works in a petting zoo but is allergic to animals - its okayI just dont breathe in, she joked. She was joined by her two biggest fans, grannies Peggy and Sheila. They described her as a very lively and bubbly wee girl adding singing is her dream.

They were quickly followed by Olly Murs and Tom Jones. As the performance unfolded Sir Toms eyes were visibly bulging as he digested her vocal range.   Each of the judges implored the -year-old to join their team. Will.I.Am told her he had to turn after three words, Meghan said she was obsessed already and believes Brooke can be a superstar. Tom added that her voice is tremendous, shes wonderful and Olly lauded her as fantastic.

Each coach needs  acts for the next stages - the battle rounds - and will be seen fighting over the best acts. As always, the coaches had their backs to the stage so they can only base their decision to pick an act on the voice alone. Each of the contestants who step out on stage must hold their nerve as they perform in the hope of seeing at least one chair spins round. Butno coaches turn then the contestant leaves the stage immediately as the coaches remain with their backs to the stage, never seeing who performed. After the auditions comes the Battles where the Coaches reduce their teams by half but, with the opportunity to steal one act each from another coach, they will take six through per team to the Knockouts.

His close friends and running colleagues tried every trick in the book to ascertain the route for the annual Castlewellan Christmas Cracker, but uncharacteristically lsquoThe Prophetrsquo remained tight-lipped and taciturn. The usual platitudes and prosaicisms were thrown out by way of appeasement, but they threw no light on the course that has been in the planning since January .Phrases like, lsquothere is something for everyonersquo, lsquothere will be a few good climbsrsquo, lsquowe will go through a field or tworsquo and lsquoI still have a few ditches to clearrsquo served only to add intrigue and mystique to the potential route.From am, parking spaces were snaffled up as the growing crowds made their way to collect their numbers, totally unaware of what lay ahead, another unique characteristic of this now iconic event.When we go to races we usually know what lies ahead as it will be the same as the previous year mdash not so with this one.This led to great speculation at registration and the passing of spurious rumours, lsquoIrsquove heard it is Foxes green firstrsquo, lsquoBunkerrsquos Hill is the first climbrsquo, lsquothe gates at Niall Kingrsquos place are open and that can only mean one thing!rsquoThose unwise enough to listen were tormented, while the more sanguine took it all in their stride realising that what would be would be.The atmosphere in the GAA club was electric and filled with excitement as every little corner became a changing space and in the middle of all of this Stevie Rice had set up a stall and had created a monopoly on udderrmint ndash an essential for the discerning runner.With space at a premium, one team had pre-booked the VIP changing facilities in Ned McCartanrsquos front room. Here the gracious, ebullient and effervescent host provided valet parking, bespoke carb-rich pre-race food, handed out warm fluffy towels and proffered words of wisdom and encouragement. The * package was completed with optional dog therapy ndash petting Socks.The  entries were snapped up in a few weeks, such is the popularity of this event among the NI running fraternity.Running in pairs is far from commonplace in what is largely an inidual sport and this certainly brings a welcome new dimension in that you are only as good as your partner and an ill-conceived or sentimental choice could see you standing waiting at the top of a hill, the bottom of a hill or at the finish.The secret lies in getting the right partner, one you know you can work with and whose running skills complement your own ndash a lesson that has still to be learned by a number of this yearrsquos participants.While the event is a great opportunity to dress up, socialise and enjoy the wonderful scenery that Castlewellan has to offer, the racing at the sharp end of the field is seriously fierce.From the moment they were set on their way at the bottom of the Circular Road, the cream rose to the top as the leading teams thundered their way through the town at breakneck speed.Getting good road position at the front is essential for the leading men and women.In , Newcastlersquos Lynch and Hanna were clear winners with a minute and a half to spare over Johnston and Scott of Mourne Runners, with McMullan and Stephens, from the host club, a further  seconds back in third.These three teams were paired once again, but had to settle for second, third and fth respectively. With Hanna in the form of his le and regularly representing Ireland in the hills and Lynch coming off a superb  minute k at the Seeley, they were the in-form team and pre-race favourites.However, favourites do not always win and on this occasion it was Aaron McGrady from East Down and his partner Andrew Barrington, originally from Oban in Scotlandwho emerged victorious.The pair, who run and race together for Victoria Park Harriers in London, were among a group of leaders along the Crow Road.As the course rose steeply after the Moorish Tower, the pair was second behind Lynch and Hanna as they hurtled through the fields towards the Bannanstown Road.As was the case in , the climb over the Playrock Hill would prove decisive and the eventual winners managed to pull away and open a winning lead.However, McGrady admits that once they hit the front, they had to work very hard over the last three miles as they knew the quality of the team chasing them.When asked about the course, the winner said that it was very dferent to previous years, was far less muddy than anticipated and despite the steep hills offered great opportunities for hard fast running.Overall, he considered it to be a well-planned and carefully balanced route. McKinstry was always in contention, but his partner suffered terribly and put paid to their chances of the win ndash they would finish fourth overall.Beechmount Harriers claimed the ladiesrsquo team prize with Sarah Laverty and Catherine Diver finishing in an excellent th place overall ndash all that training up the hill in Falls Park paid off.They were joined on the podium by Hannah Somani and Georgina Wileyand Amanda Perry and Denise Logue .In the mixed category there was a great win for Shalene McMurray and David McNeilly who were th overall and comfortably clear of their nearest challengers and club mates Mari Troeng and Frank Cunningham. Karen Wilton and Andrew Wills of Jog Lisburn completed the mixed team podium.There were male, female and mixed category winners dotted throughout the field and these are highlighted in the results file available on the Newcastle AC website . Well done to everyone who won a prize.Some of the fancy dress was simply amazing and added greatly to the sense of fun that is central to this race. Special mention to the Power family who once again dressed to impress and the three sheep bleated their way around the course under the ever-watchful eye of Bo Peep, the Newry AC crew who were came as the cast of lsquoIrsquom a Celebrityrsquo, but regrettably failed to get out of there and had to complete all nine miles and the Grant family and their friends who looked lsquoCrackingrsquo for the Cracker.Costumes came in all shapes and sizes with superheroes galore and even the odd beach ball shoved up a T-shirt for maximum effect.Before we draw the curtain on this event there are some necessary closing remarks.Firstly, we have to mention some of those who were lsquopale facedrsquo as they crossed the finish line.Among this number were Connaire McVeigh, his brother Brian McVeigh, Noel lsquoWonderwallrsquo Gallagher , Dee Murrayand Patrick Higgins who it would seem invented a new shade of grey.While all of these are notable and honourable mentions, there can only be on winner of such a prestigious accolade.The worthy recipient is none other than Dominic lsquoMad Dogrsquo McGreevy, who by his own admission was lsquoclean burstedrsquo by evergreen Jim Brown before they even left the show field.Whilst cogitating the next day with McVeigh, he noted that there was a distinct lack of climbing in the opening mile which considerably reduced his chances of the overall win.Of course, all of this is pure conjecture, passed on to me by others who were better placed to judge. As these pale faced warriors finished, I was probably getting a drink at Stephen McMullanrsquos pop-up tavern in Leitrim.The day was a great success due to the hard work and planning that took place. Course designer McCrickard would like to thank his incredible team that spent the best park of two days marking ndash Francie McAlinden, Audey McVeigh , Aidan Brownand Donal Ward.Thanks also to the entry management and registration team who did so much work in creating and continually updating and modying the team ndash no small task, the marshals from our own club and neighbouring clubs, the lead cyclists from Shimna Wheelers and Kilmegan CC, the motorbike riders, Robert and Paddy, the finish team and the presentation party ndash too many to name inidually, but you all know who you are.In conclusion, the feedback from the , that completed the course was amazingly positive and a great time was had by all.

Health unions agreed a .% three-year pay rise for NHS staff, excluding doctors, in  but the deal did not apply to Northern Northern because of the absence of devolved government.Nurses based at the Downpatrick hospitals were among an estimated , from the Royal College who went on strike for the first time in the unionrsquos -year history the week before Christmas.The one-day stoppage marked a serious escalation after weeks of industrial action by other healthcareworkers. RCN nurses were joined by their Unison colleagues on the picket line in poor weather, buffeted by wind and rain.Northern Ireland has the worst hospital waiting lists in the UK, according to figures from the Department of Health with some , people waiting for appointments. On average, there is a four-year wait for knee and hip operations.The December  strike mdash which placed pressure on a range of hospital services and resulted in planned out-patient procedures and appointments being cancelled mdash placed increasing pressure on politicians restore the power-sharing assembly and executive at Stormont.During the industrial action, nurses did provide cover to ensure chemotherapy, intensive care and palliative care services at hospitals remained in place, while district nurses only attended emergency calls. A small number of domiciliary home calls were also cancelled.According to the South Eastern Trust,  outpatient appointments were cancelled and , others were not scheduled due to the recent industrial action.Ms Cullen said the local health service could not survive another winter, without improved pay and conditions for NHS staff.ldquoThe health service is in crisis, the senior RCN official continued.ldquoWe have , people on the waiting list for a hospital appointment and we have a severe nursing shortage, which is highlighted by the Nursing and Midwery Council figures.ldquoOur members have been out on strike to fight for patient safety and to improve conditions for everyone. Quite simply, we cannot afford to wait any longer to address the problems facing the health service.

However, all that will count for nothing when they walk out at Seaview this afternoon.Sloan knows more than most that cup finals are all about what happens on the day and no amount of preparation or game planning can change that.With Olympic what you see is what you get.There are no prima donnas in the squad and they have all bought into the team ethos ndash one in, all in.The Olympic boss has made a few shrewd signings since last season and the new faces have gelled well with the group.Olympic may have lost top scorer Niall Murray to Crumlin Star, but Stefan Mason has proved more than a capable replacement.Stefan, now in his second spell at the club, joined from Drumaness Mills at the start of the season and his insatiable appetite in a main strikerrsquos role has endeared him to all.He is a nightmare for all defenders as he never stays still and is continually looking for space. He is not afraid to shoot and is also as brave as they come, adding a bit of physicality to his game in recent times.He has formed a perfect partnership with the under-rated Chris McNamara and the potentially explosive Nathan Jones mdash and all three are reliable matchwinners.Paul Dickson, another new signing, first came to prominence a few years ago when he starred for Noel lsquoDixiersquo Deanrsquos emerging Temple Rangers side that famously reached the semi-finals of the Clarence Cup.Since then he has played for Ballynahinch United and Saintfield United, but his adventurous style of play from the back has given Olympic an added dimension to their play.He has been joined in the squad by Anton McGrattan, a stylish midfielder, who gets up and down the park with ease and who is not an easy player to dispossess or put off his game.Basically, the rest of the Olympic remains the same and therein lies the secret of their success. Goalkeeper Ryan Walsh, a member of the Amateur Leaguersquos representative team, has enhanced his growing reputation this season and he rarely makes mistakes.Manager Sloan has the luxury of being able to play a number of formations at the back. Jason Noade is a colossus in the centre of defence with either Stevie McGoran, Connor Reid, Dickson or the highly-rated Dalton Tate flanking him.Midfield enforcer Ryan Noade,he is fit, can also play in the back four, but he, brother Stevie, Shane Murray and workaholic Ryan Molloy make up a formidable midfield unit with McGrattan able to cover any position in the engine room.Olympic have serious strength in depth and James McClean, Aaron McLean, Adam McClean, Simon Marmion, Jack Roddy, Josh Fennell, Darren Lyons and Reece McConnell are all ready to step up to the markthey are required.However, standing in Olympicrsquos way is one of their own, now making Rathfriland tick.Andy Kilmartin started out at Olympic as a raw teenager with immense talent.He signed for Glasgow Celtic before moving to Glentoran, Portdown and Glenavon where he won an Irish Cup medal.The martinette is now pulling Rathfrilandrsquos strings alongside Newcastlersquos Jonathan Scannell and Downpatrickrsquos Peter Telford and Ruairi Fitzpatrick.Olympic know these players inside out and given a fair wind, they hope to blow Rathfriland away in what promises to be an intriguing final.Coincidentally, this will be Telfordrsquos fth Border Cup final appearance, but he has yet to appear on a winning side.He has lost three finals with Downpatrick FC and one with Kilmore Rec and is hoping that it will be a case of fth time lucky this afternoon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st January 2020 Out.jpg","title":"Out of Africa book looks at richness of sharing humanity together  ","story":"THE latest book by Downpatrick author Dr Stan Papenfus has just been published.Out of Africa has a title that he plagiarised from Pliny, the ancient Roman writer, who wrote: ldquoOut of Africa always something new.The subtitle of this book, lsquoSharing our livesrsquorsquo, derives from an African proverb mdash lsquoA person is a person through peoplersquo. It an also be translated as lsquoA person becomes a person through peoplersquo.The signicance of this proverb becomes ever more clear in the being and becoming of the three story tellers who share their lives with Dr Papenfus.Each one of them expresses and explores the truth of their own experiences and each one has their personal reality confirmed by the events and situations that unfold. In this telling, they also create how they who are and who they can be.Gabriel Makamanzi, from Zimbabwe, specically sees his own problems and dficulties belonging not merely to himself, but to the whole community in which he lives.This community is brought alive for us as he describes it and he expects us to relate it to our own problems and dficulties. In this way, he says, we all work together to discover our own creative freedom and realise our potential.Gabriel notes that le is for love. And yet, without honesty, our personal and shared reality is not reality at all.Instead, it is a pretense and those of us who pretend he sees us ldquoliving meaningless livesrsquorsquo.Dr Papenfus says: ldquoGabrielrsquos story challenges us, as it challenged him, to recognise our own poverty and despair, only to realise the spiritual power and richness of sharing our humanity with each other.The next exploration of time experiences is by Zakele Makaluza, from South Africa. He talks about his arrogance and his refusal to heed the warnings given to him by his ancestors, as they appear to him in his dreams.Zakelersquos experiences also refer to his relationship with bees, but not ordinary bees, rather with those ldquogentlemen of the honeyrsquorsquo sent by his ancestors to remind him of his duties to others, especially to members of his own clan.Dr Stan said: ldquoZakele, in his exploration of his experiences, brings us to an awareness of our own integrity or lack or integrity, in ourselves and in our relationship with others. He realises his potential only after he is persuaded of a certain truth, which he has been denying nearly all his le.ldquoIt is his cousin who opens up his awareness and tells him also that this was an experience that were lsquodestinedrsquo to share.The last person giving his testimony in the book is David Maganda, from Uganda. He came from a very big family and when his father died he was left to fend for himself, especially with regard to earning enough money to pay for his education.Even as a young boy, he secretly took a train from Uganda to Kenya, hoping to make enough money to sponsor his schooling. But, instead, he found himself on a ldquomission impossible as he calls it.He and his friend found themselves stranded and virtually penniless in the city of Nairobi. They had no place to stay, no work and no friends.How are they toto Uganda  They found themselves walking for mile after mile, along long and dusty roads, depending for their very survival on the kindness and pity of strangers. After living through a fierce storm and other hardships, they eventually arrived at the Kenya-Uganda border. Here, in their completely squalid state, they were interrogated by the police, who eventually let them cross the border.Arriving back in Uganda, they miraculously met Davidrsquos friendrsquos sister, who was working at a trading station. And so, at last, they find themselves able tohome.Each of their families get them to promise never again to engage in such a mad exploit. And yet within ten years he finds himself stranded once again, this time in the Sudan.Here, however, he is able to make do by earning money and pursuing some schooling and eventually being presented with a graduation certicate. Because of the particular school he attended, he was also able to become a confirmed Christian. However, he discovers, through his interaction with others, that his Christianity is only lukewarm.Through many strange encounters he eventually learns how to accept Christ into his very heart of hearts.As a result of this, he preaches the good news of salvation and in Northern Sudan he is even beaten and imprisoned.As time goes by he meets his we, Gillian, at a theological college in England. Today, David lives in Belfast and is only a lay preacher, but also someone who teaches others how to explore and discover the meaning of their lives and with others, how to realise their potential.Out of Africa is available on loan from Downpatrick Library and can also be bought from amazon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st January 2020 Seals.jpg","title":"Seals prosper in Strangford Lough  ","story":"STRANGFORD Lough is proving to be a popular nursery for grey seals.The largest sea inlet in Ireland can boast having  pups born in its waters during last autumn, the most since records began almost  years ago.The National Trust, which records the number of wildle visiting the area, revealed there were  adults in the lough at the peak of the breeding season last year ndash something of a turnaround for the protected species.In the early s records show that only around six or seven grey seals were born in the area each year.Lead ranger at Strangford Lough Hugh Thurgate say several factors have contributed to the growth in numbers.He said: ldquoThe boom reflects the burgeoning population in Scottish waters which is pushing the population down the North Channel and into the Irish Sea and seals are being forced to seek out new places to breed.ldquoThe shelter of Strangford is a strong draw for seals on the look-out for alternative spots to relax on shore during the breeding and moulting seasons.Mr Thurgate agrees that Strangford Lough is just the place for them.He added: ldquoThe seals are looking for a safe and protected place to raise their young ndash somewhere that provides protection from the elements and is relatively free from disturbance ndash which Strangford Lough offers.ldquoPups are quite vulnerable. Seals give birth on the beach andyou get stormy weather, tidal surges and high spring tides, high pup vitalities can occur because seals are unable to thermo-regulate properly.ldquoSo,you have calmer conditions pups are going to have a better chance of survival.The mild lough islands of Strangford are a favourite spot for the seals to haul out in large groups, known as rockeries, now a regular sight for boat users.Mr Thurgate, who has worked on Strangford Lough for two decades, has seen the population steadily rise.He said: ldquoWe starting counting seals in .

He also re-iterated his Governments position that their priority is to reconvene Stormont and to put a deal together which makes that possible.\"For our part, we impressed on him the responsibility that his Government holds. After all, it was his Government that made that commitment around the Irish language Act in  and  years have passed since then. It is now high time that the rights of Irish speakers have now been included and the rights of Irish speakers are no longer marginalised.\"Mr Mac Giolla Bhein said the issue of an Irish Language Act would \"still be on the margins\"it was not for campaign groups keeping it on the political agenda.He said: \"Regardless of what emerges from these talks and whatever deal is put together as a result of these talks, people can be incredibly proud of that.\"In terms of the actual deal and what is there for the Irish speaking community - we will reserve judgment until we see the detail on that.\"Reavey familystill grieving,  years after horric sectarian murdersDeclassied Files: Dublin spad said tax evasion viewed as morally justied Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"He said in  the Irish language community was promised an Irish language Act as part of the St Andrews Agreement and the co-guarantors of The Good Friday Agreement promised \"resolute action\" for the Irish language in .In a statement following the meeting, Conradh na Gaeilge said it will continue to remind Mr Smith of his duty to implement the Irish language Act.It read: \"This new legislation must be drafted, as the St Andrews Agreement compels, from the language legislation in Wales and in the south.\"Those Acts are independent from any other pieces of legislation. They facilitate rights and respect. They secure services and visibility. They recognise their indigenous language as an official language.\"They provide the security of a commissioner to protect and promote the language. That is what the two governments and the parties must deliver with an Irish Language Act.\"Speakers of Irish, be they speakers using the language in their home, in their schools or in the community, can no longer be treated as second class citizens.\"Sinn Feins deputy leader Michelle ONeill said on Friday that \"clearly\" there would be an Irish Language Act in any deal to restore the Executive, one of the major sticking points in previous negotiations.\"Clearly there will be an Irish Language Act as part of a deal, but what we need to see is a package of measures that allows public confidence to be generated again in our ability to deliver good politics,\" Ms ONeill said.Finding consensus on legislative protections for Irish language speakers is key to unlocking the deadline.Parties are also at odds on proposals to reform a contentious cross-community voting mechanism in the Assembly - the petition of concern.Three years on from the collapse of the devolved government, the Stormont parties have until a January  deadline to strike a deal to revive the institutions.On that date, legislation to give civil servants additional powers to run Northern Irelands struggling public services expires and Mr Smith will assume a legal obligation to call a snap Assembly election.DUP MP for East Londonderry Gregory Campbell said the deadline of January  means \"there will be attempts to use it as leverage to get any type of deal over the line as opposed to detailed consideration in order that a good deal is achieved\".He said: \"Whether it is one partymaking unacceptable demands or other parties standing side by side to accept that the unreasonable demand is met, will make no dference to us.\"Where the Irish language has a perfectly acceptable place in Northern Ireland society and is resourced appropriately, as it already is, there will not be a problem or opposition from the DUP or wider Unionism, where there is an unacceptable and unreasonable demand to elevate it above all other minority languages, whether it is SF, other parties or Her Majestys Government saying we will have to yield on this issue as it is preventing devolution ing, we will not do so.\"Let us all take this week to see what is doable, negotiate a balanced set of proposals and get it done instead oftry catch  TrendingYoung man found collapsed in NI woodland on January  has been identied say PSNI -

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.
