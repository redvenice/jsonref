It is also not far away from the coast, with sailing facilities available at Salcombe.          Four bedrooms: This is one of Southside\u0027s stunning bedrooms.

I didn\u0027t like it at first but Mike convinced me it was the right thing.\u0027It was huge, almost like a hangar so we decided to split it in two as a more affordable way of building our dream home.A real escape to the country!

I donned the project manager hat to keep costs down and every day was a first.\u0027It was important to us to build an energy-efficient home and use recycled materials.    The property, located in rural Devon, boasts three bathrooms - one family bathroom and two en-suites.

The interior is seen complete with hay bales, farm vehicles and a tractor \u0027The outside of the shed was built of wood. We kept this timber, cleaned them up and clad internal feature walls and we built our feature fireplaces from old reclaimed bricks.\u0027When Mike showed myself and our daughters his design we poo-pooed it a bit at first because we wanted it to be girly and it was very hard materials and industrial.\u0027I think we were his most difficult clients because we had so many opinions, but now live in the most beautiful space.\u0027There are enormous views and huge skies, the sunsets are epic. We can see a few neighbours in different fields but the view is mostly very green. You feel like you\u0027re on top of the world.\u0027From the outside the barn is discreet and understated - a black shadow on the landscape. But inside we are luxuriating in space and light, surrounded by beautiful Devon countryside and wildlife. We are so proud of the result.\u0027    Two years ago the shed was full of hay bales and farm equipment.

But it will allow Murray to live pain-free and it could open the door to him becoming a tennis coach after he retires.    Murray had previously said ahead of the Australian Open earlier this month that he intended to retire after this year\u0027s WimbledonMurray was set for a farewell six months after emotionally announcing he was in too much pain to carry on in the build up to the first grand slam of the year.After losing to Roberto Bautista-Agut in the first round of the Australian Open, he said: ‘Tonight was not comfortable in terms of my hip. At the end, I’m really struggling, I can’t walk properly at all just now.\u0027I could play another match, but if I want to try to play again, I want to improve my quality of life, because even if I take four months I still can’t walk. I’m still in pain doing just basic day-to-day things.’ But the monumental five-set tussle showed the Scot still has the ability and desire to compete at the top level, and he said he would do everything he could to keep playing. Having the surgery, which happened in London on Monday, means he might not be fit to take part in Wimbledon this summer, where he had planned to say goodbye to the sport.And if it does not allow him to return to the court, he will have played the last game of his glittering career.In the lead up to his operation, he was in constant dialogue with American doubles specialist Bob Bryan, who has just returned to the game following the same procedure last summer.Mr Bryan has said: ‘Seeing the way Andy Murray is feeling hit a nerve with me. I would love to see him do a similar surgery, feel the relief that it gives. I think our hips are pretty similar – just worn down, no cartilage.‘I’m really the only guy to be playing on with a metal hip. So he’s been watching me like a hawk, asking me how I’m feeling after matches, after practices, where I’m at.’    Murray admitted being in pain during the Australian Open this month (pictured there)   A graphic shows how Murray\u0027s hip resurfacing procedure was carried out in hospital Murray had his first hip operation in Australia in January last year. It was carried out by Dr John O’Donnell, who is regarded as one of the leading experts in hip arthroscopy.  Under a resurfacing procedure, damaged bone and cartilage inside a patient’s hip joint are removed and replaced with a metal ‘dome’ surface.Typically patients spend two or three days in hospital and should be walking again soon afterwards.The ATP Tour tweeted support for Murray, posting: ‘Yesterday Andy Murray underwent hip resurfacing surgery in London. Get well soon Andy, we know you will do everything to get back on tour!?’British Tennis also sent out a tweet in support, saying: ‘Good luck in your recovery from hip resurfacing surgery Andy!’"},{"url":null,"title":"Estate agents slash luxury house price 100 000 buyers graveyard garden","story":"    This newly-converted house for sale in North Lopham, Norfolk, has a graveyard in its front garden, which has caused estate agents to slash the asking price          In total the former chapel has 36 gravestones marking burial plots in the front garden as well as 14 leaning against a wallThe house was a chapel until it closed in 2014 due to a dwindling congregation and was bought in October 2016 for £246,000 by local property developer Sam Nayler through his firm SNPD Ltd.It has now been converted into a modern home with a 25ft by 35ft open plan double height living room and kitchen.Estate agents Bedfords are now hoping that buyers will overcome their fears about the graves. Emmerson Dutton, a partner at Bedfords office in Bury St Edmunds office, said: \u0027I am sure that the gravestones have been a factor in putting off some buyers.\u0027It is a very stylish property, but the activity levels around it have certainly been lower than we would expect.          The main living space which has oak flooring includes a kitchen with state of the art cabinets, an island, granite work tops and a range-style oven   The first floor has a galleried landing around three sides of the building which Bedfords say could be used as a playroom, study areas or hobby space\u0027I think the people who are concerned about the graves don\u0027t go as far as asking for a viewing. We are not trying to hide the gravestones away so the details clearly show them.\u0027But although the house still has the original two doors at the front, the main entrance is at the back via driveway on the side.\u0027It means that people don\u0027t have to walk down the path between the graves into the house.\u0027Also when you are inside the house, you are not really overlooking the graves because of the layout inside.\u0027 The house was originally up for sale at £595,000 with a different agent before it was taken on by Bedfords who cut the price to £550,000, before cutting it again.          The home has been converted into a modern and spacious property with a 25ft by 35ft open plan double height living room and kitchenMr Dutton believes the house is worth at least £100,000 more than its price tag due. He said: \u0027It just seems buyers are put off which is such a shame as the cost of the conversion far outweighs the price it\u0027s for sale for.\u0027Someone is going to get a real bargain.

Just last month California Highway Patrol troopers spotted a man sleeping in the driver\u0027s seat of his Tesla Model S. He was going 70mph. The officers had to pull in front of the car and start slowing down so that the car would eventually slow itself down as well, according to Wired. Videos have also been posted on YouTube teaching Tesla drivers how to bypass the system by wedging an orange or water bottle in the steering wheel.           Tesla has since placed restrictions on how long a driver can keep their hands off the steering wheel before a warning beep sounds after a number of crashes occurred "},{"url":null,"title":"Clarks workers told speak engage chat young customers","story":"    Clarks Shoes will tell its employees to engage children in conversation while they measure their feet as part of a radical Government scheme to boost literacy.

Temperatures are expected drop as low as negative 28 degrees as the day progresses. Wind chills in northern Illinois made it feel as cold as negative 57F. In comparison, temperatures are predicted to be in the teens and lows 20s at the US McMurdo Antarctic research station. Temperatures in the North Pole are expected to reach minus 20 degrees and Alaska is forecast to have high in the mid-teens. The extreme weather conditions have prompted Amtrak to cancel all trains into and out of Chicago on Wednesday and most services to or from Chicago on Thursday. Crews had to set rail tracks in fire to keeps trains moving smoothly on Tuesday. More than 2,500 flights were canceled early Wednesday, largely out of Chicago O\u0027Hare and Chicago Midway international airports, according to flight tracking site FlightAware. The U.S. Postal Service has also taken the rare step of suspending mail delivery to parts of Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Ohio, the Dakotas and Nebraska on Wednesday because of the dangerous Arctic blast.

(sic) Please come back fast, we need you!\u0027But the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which operates NWS, tweeted: \u0027Winter storms don\u0027t prove that global warming isn\u0027t happening.\u0027The NOAA also linked to a 2015 explanatory article in their tweet. In New York City, forecasters are expecting temperatures to drop to near 5 degrees on Thursday morning. The wind chill then will be between -10 and -20. The MTA says they will more than likely activate warming devices throughout their system to keep switches warm on all Long Island Rail Road and Metro North Railroad lines. LIRR stations will also keep waiting rooms open 24 hours a day Wednesday through Saturday, according to CBS.In New Jersey, Gov Phil Murphy is warning residents to plan for icy roads and potential blackouts. Forecasters in western New York are warning of blizzard-like conditions over the next few days with up to two feet of snow, plummeting temperatures and wind chills that can cause frostbite in minutes.In advance of the Great Lakes-fed storm, authorities closed schools in Buffalo and surrounding districts for Wednesday and Thursday and the state announced a ban on tractor-trailers and buses from the New York State Thruway. The ban between Rochester and the Pennsylvania border took effect at 8pm Tuesday.Drifting bands of lake-effect snow are expected to drop one to two feet by the storm\u0027s end. The hard-to-predict bands can bury some areas, even as the sun shines a short distance away. Midwest Cities Will be Colder Than Antarctica, Alaska, But There\u0027s a Reason For That | The Weather Channel"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/01/30/18/0000836000000C1D-6647361-image-a-26_1548872099895.jpg","title":"Staffordshire Bull Terrier named Britains favourite dog ITV Britians 100 dogs","story":"    Claire Kyte shared this photo of her four staffies as they eagerly awaited the result of last night\u0027s poll          Coco, a two-year-old cockapoo from Bromley in south east London, reacts to the sad news that her breed only came second in the list  The owners of German Shepherds reacted to the news they came eight in 100 dog breeds          Staffies beat off competition from popular breeds such as the Labrador and the Springer Spaniel to claim the top spot in a nation of dog lovers          Staffie owners were thrilled their dogs were getting positive recognition on Twitter          A shock was on the cards for the viewers when last year\u0027s winning breed, the Labrador, came in at third          Staffies beat off competition from popular breeds such as the Labrador and the Springer Spaniel to claim the top spot in a nation of dog lovers      However a select few were disappointed with the outcome, claiming the breed was \u0027more aggressive than other dogs\u0027 (left)Staffie owner Brad Clough was thrilled. He wrote: \u0027Staffies often get a bad rep mainly down to owners.\u0027Top 100 dogs will hopefully go a long way to dispel the myth that they’re an aggressive breed.

They are up from number 16 last year.                                                                                                                                10.

But it will allow Murray to live pain-free and it could open the door to him becoming a tennis coach after he retires.          Murray had previously said ahead of the Australian Open earlier this month that he intended to retire after this year\u0027s WimbledonMurray was set for a farewell six months after emotionally announcing he was in too much pain to carry on in the build up to the first grand slam of the year.After losing to Roberto Bautista-Agut in the first round of the Australian Open, he said: ‘Tonight was not comfortable in terms of my hip. At the end, I’m really struggling, I can’t walk properly at all just now.\u0027I could play another match, but if I want to try to play again, I want to improve my quality of life, because even if I take four months I still can’t walk. I’m still in pain doing just basic day-to-day things.’ But the monumental five-set tussle showed the Scot still has the ability and desire to compete at the top level, and he said he would do everything he could to keep playing. Having the surgery, which happened in London on Monday, means he might not be fit to take part in Wimbledon this summer, where he had planned to say goodbye to the sport.And if it does not allow him to return to the court, he will have played the last game of his glittering career.In the lead up to his operation, he was in constant dialogue with American doubles specialist Bob Bryan, who has just returned to the game following the same procedure last summer.Mr Bryan has said: ‘Seeing the way Andy Murray is feeling hit a nerve with me. I would love to see him do a similar surgery, feel the relief that it gives. I think our hips are pretty similar – just worn down, no cartilage.‘I’m really the only guy to be playing on with a metal hip. So he’s been watching me like a hawk, asking me how I’m feeling after matches, after practices, where I’m at.’    Murray admitted being in pain during the Australian Open this month (pictured there)   A graphic shows how Murray\u0027s hip resurfacing procedure was carried out in hospital Murray had his first hip operation in Australia in January last year. It was carried out by Dr John O’Donnell, who is regarded as one of the leading experts in hip arthroscopy.  Under a resurfacing procedure, damaged bone and cartilage inside a patient’s hip joint are removed and replaced with a metal ‘dome’ surface.Typically patients spend two or three days in hospital and should be walking again soon afterwards.The ATP Tour tweeted support for Murray, posting: ‘Yesterday Andy Murray underwent hip resurfacing surgery in London. Get well soon Andy, we know you will do everything to get back on tour!?’British Tennis also sent out a tweet in support, saying: ‘Good luck in your recovery from hip resurfacing surgery Andy!’"},{"url":null,"title":"Delighted owners share snaps prized pooches glued TV","story":"    Pet owners shared snaps of their pooches glued to their TV screens as the winner of Britain\u0027s top 100 dog breed was announced.

And he says it so loudly that she can hear him saying it.\u0027And from that day on I’ve just been like nah, that guy is a wrong’un’’\u0027I’m not going to tell you it was Ben Fogle.\u0027Mr Arthanayake\u0027s co-host then broke the news that Mr Fogle was due to present the ITV run-down, to which he replied: \u0027You’re kidding me. He was so rude.\u0027My wife came back to me and said, this guy!. My wife was very upset.\u0027The comments the day before Fogle presented ITV\u0027s Britain\u0027s Top 100 Dogs Live 2019. In immediate response to his comments a spokesperson for Mr Fogle said the TV presenter was \u0027absolutely incensed at this uncorroborated, hurtful and false allegation\u0027. She added: \u0027Apart from the fact that he has never been to Queen\u0027s Park in his life, more importantly there is not a breed of dog on this earth that he does not love.\u0027No-one who knows Ben would believe this absolute rubbish\u0027.On Twitter the TV star went further, promising legal action. In a Tweet he wrote: \u0027I have just been sent a recording from @TherealNihal show on @bbc5live earlier in which a caller made an untrue and libellous accusation about a fictions encounter. I have never even visited Queens Park. I will be seeking legal action.

I have never even been to Queens Park. I LOVE staffies and grew up surrounded by them in my fathers veterinary surgery. Not cool.\u0027In a later Tweet is warned the Corporation would be \u0027hearing from his lawyers\u0027.After Mr Fogle hit back on Twitter the row deepened, with Mr Arthanayake accusing Mr Fogle of calling his wife a liar.          Arthanayake accused Fogle of calling his wife a liar over the claims Arthanayake added: \u0027She swears it was you and in fact she came home and told me about it straight away. it was around nine years ago.\u0027She was incensed at the time as she was with our two very small children. Why would she lie about it being you?\u0027The former Castaway star replied pointing out that timeframe would have meant one of his children was just two months old and the other not yet born, adding \u0027Mistaken identity? I don’t know. But it WASN’T ME. I LOVE staffies mate.\u0027In a later tweet he added: \u0027I’m saying it’s a case of mistaken identity.

Here, author and heroine talk about their life-affirming collaboration‘I must tell you a secret,” Lien de Jong’s mother said to her gently one day. “You are going to stay somewhere else for a while.” It was August 1942 in occupied Holland and De Jong was eight years old. The family was Jewish, but not observant. She would never see her parents again they were murdered in Auschwitz six months later. She was sent to live with a non-Jewish family, the Van Eses, the first in a series of temporary homes in the Netherlands’ wartime underground network.Bart van Es is a Dutch-born English literature professor at Oxford University, who usually “writes scholarly books and articles on Shakespeare and Renaissance poetry”. He is also the grandson of Jans and Henk van Es, who, as part of the Dutch resistance, sheltered Jewish children such as Lien de Jong during the occupation. His account of her extraordinary, harrowing story of loss, survival and love, The Cut Out Girl, has just won the Costa Book of the Year award.“I was very amazed,” 85-year-old De Jong says, laughing, the morning after the ceremony. “I thought the young lady would win.”It is true that Rooney’s much-talked-about second novel, Normal People, was the hands-down favourite to take the prize. But The Cut Out Girl was “a hidden gem”, according to Sophie Raworth, chair of the Costa judges. “It was the book we felt everyone should read.”“I think of it as very much a joint book,” Van Es tells De Jong.Arrestingly and simply told, The Cut Out Girl is a powerful addition to memoirs of the Holocaust. It is a whiplash jolt from Rooney’s knowing story of millennial love and angst. “There is something millennial about this, too, in a way,” Van Es suggests. “It’s about modern Europe as well as about the war.” The book interweaves De Jong’s story with Van Es’s travels around the Netherlands – wartime archives, railway and petrol stations, motorways – during which he was struck by the impact of far-right politics there today, with figures such as Geert Wilders of the Party for Freedom (PVV) making headlines. “He’s had very significant votes and has really changed the tone of Dutch politics in quite a scary way,” Van Es says.Famed for its tolerance, the Netherlands has “also got its nasty side”. Returning to his grandparents’ house, in what is now an almost entirely Muslim area, he says he felt uncomfortable researching a Jewish story. “It made me think, there’s a danger now that the world is becoming compartmentalised again in echo chambers of people who just tell their own stories. This is a story in one way about a non-Jewish person talking to a Jewish person, but beyond that about a person from the 21st century looking back at the 20th century.” If there is a message to the book, he says, it is that “you have to look beyond yourself, you have to have some larger vision, because in the war the people who acted, who did something for the Jews, were largely people who were part of organisations that ned racial ides, things like my grandparents being part of the socialist movement.”“They were very principled people,” De Jong says. “They didn’t accept injustice in any way.”Although he “always had this sort of background idea, that I’m the family academic and I ought to write this up,” there wasn’t one single trigger that prompted Van Es to begin researching the life of the “lost” Jewish girl who lived with his grandparents during the war, but with whom there was a mysterious rift many years later. He has no memories of De Jong, although she remembers him as a tiny child, and he refers to her as “Aunt” in the book. “I like to say that,” he says, when I ask how they like their relationship to be described.“I never thought about it. You can call me Aunt,” she responds fondly.What was meant to be just a cup of coffee and a sandwich with his “aunt” turned into a 10-hour conversation and then a month-long extended interview, in which he came to know her “in a way that I had never known anybody else. Even with your most intimate contacts, you would never normally say: ‘Tell me your life, your earliest memories what was your room like when you were a little girl?’ It was just an astonishing privilege to have that with another human being. I think that is something that has changed me. It has made me a more empathetic person.”Of their first exchange, De Jong says: “I always thought, ‘I have no special story, so what do you want?’ But talking together, it became a story.”And what a story it is. Her time with the Van Eses, which she refers to as “my first hiding parents”, was a particularly happy one. “That was the only place where I felt safe and could be a child and play with the other children,” she says. But then the knock would come on the door. “It’s funny how much shoes would matter in the time of crisis,” Van Es observes in the book, as she would have to pull on whatever was available and literally run for her life. The succession of hideouts that followed were increasingly unhappy, as she was passed from family to family, treated as a servant in one, and sexually abused in the last.It is striking in the book how De Jong’s memories, so vivid at first, become more vague as she becomes more traumatised. “One of the things the book is about is that you only remember things if you experience them in a community,” Van Es says. Towards the end of the war, De Jong became “almost like a zombie … She lived just in herself, living that was just living she suddenly starts having these enormous gaps where she remembers absolutely nothing.”This, of course, presents something of a challenge to the biographer. And it is here that Van Es pulls off a clever authorial sleight of hand, making De Jong’s story intensely immediate and intimate, only then to concede that she herself can’t recall the details at all. “I wanted to be honest about that,” Van Es explains. “I wanted that sort of trick in the book, so you see it and then you don’t see it. And so I wanted those things to be completely historically correct, which they are. I did research.” For example, during the mass exodus from the village of Bennekom in 1944, a procession of families laden with their belongings, or piled on to carts and wagons, we see the bodies of fly-ridden dead horses and soldiers lying in bomb craters, and are told that De Jong “feels sticky” under the three dresses she is wearing to avoid carrying them. But as Van Es admits: “Of the journey to Ede … she can picture nothing at all.” Instead, he has “patched together” the recollections of the hundreds of others who made the journey, taken either from history books and diaries, or from accounts of people he later interviewed.“So it’s not necessarily Lien wearing three dresses. I will always make it clear that’s a made-up bit.” He wanted it to be not just factually accurate – he even checked the weather reports in newspapers from the time – but also “emotionally true”.How does it feel for De Jong, after all these years, to have the gaps filled in by someone else?“The emotional part is not there anywhere. It’s history for me, the whole story,” she replies. “Sometimes I’m sad about my family, who were lost, all of them most of the time it is in a movie or on TV – just looking at other people I can feel emotion.”Today, she says, she is happy “with my friends and children and grandchildren”. She loves Amsterdam, where she lives, and enjoys being part of its cultural life. “I hope very much that my story can help when we are talking about children who are in a terrible situation these days, without parents or without family, going from one country to another,” she says.On the day of the Dutch publication of the book, which also happened to be De Jong’s 85th birthday, they appeared on a TV chatshow. The discussion centered on two Armenian children who were due to be deported back “home” in two days, despite having spent their whole lives with Dutch foster parents and speaking only Dutch. “It was really shocking that the government was saying: ‘We are going to send these children back,’” says Van Es. The following day a decision was made to allow the children to stay. “I had at least the right to speak,” she says, modestly denying Van Es’s reports that people on Twitter were saying DeJong had done more than those in parliament to help. The book sold out in the Netherlands the next day.Against that background, Van Es recounts stories of extraordinary heroism and desperation: the farmer who cut off part of his finger in order to get paid leave so he could build a secret shelter for children or the couple who turned their food-testing laboratory into a safe house, saving 50 children, with the help of a local doctor, but whose own lives ended in depression and poverty or the family who sheltered in a hideout beneath a tree in a pine forest, breathing by means of a hand-pump connected to the ground above them.But The Cut Out Girl doesn’t end with De Jong’s return to the Van Es household after the war. There can be no uncomplicated happy ending. After a period of stability, in which she married and had three children, De Jong felt like “a cut-out picture of a perfect wife from a magazine”. She became increasingly depressed and isolated from her husband, whose traditional Judaism was “not very meaningful” to her. “I couldn’t live with it,” she says. In 1972, she attempted to kill herself.“I don’t think I had survivor’s guilt,” she reflects. “It was more the idea that I did not – I ought not – to be there. There was nobody who wanted me. When you have no family of your own, and you live with people who can send you away, no connection is unbreakable.”Life healed her, she says: “And the children and my choices. It took time.” At 47, she got orced. “I married a very good man. But he couldn’t come along after a long time. I didn’t know what I wanted.”And then there was another terrible fracture, when Jans van Es – the woman she once called “Ma” – cut her off, the family mystery that is the emotional heart of the book: “Why, at my grandmother’s funeral, was Lien unmentioned and unseen?” Van Es asks. “How could such a connection break?”To answer this would be to give too much away. But the book has been healing for Van Es’s family. His mother, who was terrified about what its revelations might do to her parents’ reputation as brave members of the resistance, has been comforted by its reception. As Van Es says, winning the Costa has been an “incredible confirmation of what was quite a scary enterprise. Quite a lot of people have said they think it’s a kind book. So it was really uniting.”It has also been uniting for his immediate family, in particular for him and his teenage stepdaughter, Josie. De Jong’s experiences of feeling unwanted taught him “how important it is to tell people all the time: ‘You matter to me.’ It gave me a really good chance to talk to Josie. It has been a very meaningful thing for our family.”“Nobody is perfect,” De Jong adds. “We can see in the book that you can be a human being with all your faults and all your good things.” Van Es is already at work on another book, if not closer to home, then closer to his academic interests, on Shakespeare and the novel. And De Jong? “Just going on.”There are so many books already out there about the war, Van Es worries at one point. “There are also so many songs about love,’” De Jong replies.The Cut Out Girl: A Story of War and Family, Lost and Found by Bart van Es (Penguin Books, £9.99).

Patisserie Valerie’s former finance director has been arrested on suspicion of fraud.David Dunckley, chief executive of Grant Thornton, which was replaced by RSM as the chain’s auditor in mid-January, told MPs on the business, energy and industrial strategy committee that there was an “expectation gap” that “needs to be fixed”.In a heated exchange with Rachel Reeves, the Labour MP and committee chair, Dunckley reiterated: “If people are colluding and there is a sophisticated fraud that may not be caught by normal audit procedures.”He said in an ideal world it would be spotted. Reeves replied: “But in a shop that sells tea and cakes, you’d sort of think that might be spotted. It’s not a multinational complex organisation.”Reeves also noted that according to the Financial Reporting Council’s ISA (international accounting standards) rules, auditors must pick up misstatements where they are due to fraud or error.More than 30 Patisserie Valerie shareholders have expressed interest in joining legal action against the chain.Legal firm Teacher Stern, which has contacted shareholders about a group action, said any claim was likely to focus on any misleading statements made to the City ahead of the suspension of the company’s shares in October.Patisserie Valerie has been in crisis since then, when it uncovered a £40m black hole in its finances, which it blamed on “potentially fraudulent” accounting irregularities.About 70 of the group’s nearly 200 outlets and concessions have closed with the loss of about 900 jobs. More than 2,800 further jobs are at risk.Potential bidders, including former Little Chef owner RCapital and Birmingham-based entrepreneur David Scott, are lining up to put forward offers on Friday.But documents sent to potential buyers earlier this week indicate that store sales information going back to January 2013 and cash position data going back to September 2014 could be unreliable.Analysis by administrators at KPMG, who are handling the sale process, indicate the company is on track to make a £2.6m loss this year while sales at established stores have been falling for more than a year.Teacher Stern is trying to obtain a copy of a report by forensic accountants at PricewaterhouseCoopers into potential fraudulent activity at Patisserie Valerie which reportedly includes the provision of fake invoices.Philip Rubens, a partner at the law firm, said it was “clearly important” to establish if there had been inaccuracies in documents sent to investors when the firm listed on the junior Aim stock market in May 2014.He said the issue mattered because, under Aim rules, company directors assume personal liability for the accuracy of information contained in stock market admission documents.One top five shareholder told the  it was not prepared to join any action while others suggested there was no point in doing so unless it was found that Patisserie Valerie had insurance in place which would pay out in the case of negligence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de388109d78393e713a8339014c870a04a5684ef/0_317_5453_3272/master/5453.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30fff253d2d2852245857b84fafdf9d5","title":"brexit political class politicians","story":"History will damn the architects of Brexit – and the politicians on both sides whose delusions are leading us to disasterStressed out by Brexit? I have a mindfulness exercise for you, one guaranteed to bring calm. Instead of imagining a deep, cool lake or a beach of bone-white sand, comfort yourself by imagining the day, several years from now, when a Chilcot-style inquiry probes the epic policy disaster that was Brexit. As you take deep breaths, and with your eyes closed, picture the squirming testimony of an aged David Cameron under sustained interrogation. Look on as Boris Johnson is at last called to account for the serial fictions of the 2016 campaign. Or perhaps contemplate the moment the panel delivers its damning, final report, concluding that this was a collective, systemic failure of the entire British political class.Last night’s series of votes in the Commons will provide a rich batch of evidence. Almost everyone involved, from both main parties, showed themselves to be immersed in delusion, trading fantasies and absurdities, each one refusing to meet reality’s eye, let alone tackle it head on.Most culpable, once again, is the prime minister. If our jaws weren’t already slackened to numbness by the last 30 months, they should have hit the floor at this latest performance. Theresa May had repeated endlessly, and for weeks, that her deal was the only deal on offer. Yet there she was, standing at the despatch box urging MPs to vote for an amendment that trashes that very same deal. The Brady amendment, which passed by 16 votes, demands what May had constantly said, up until yesterday morning, was impossible: the replacement of the Northern Irish backstop with “alternative arrangements”. It’s an extraordinary thing, this ability of May’s: she somehow manages to combine grinding intransigence with a willingness to perform the most brazen U-turns.Cheering her on was a Conservative party celebrating the rare thrill of unity. For the first time in ages, they could all be on the same side, declaring with one voice that what they really wanted was May’s deal minus the backstop. They beamed as if this result meant something, when it is in fact triply meaningless.First, it’s really no great achievement to get MPs to agree that they’d like the good bits of a deal but don’t want to swallow the bad bits: yes to the sugar, no to the pill. The Tories have united around a position that says they’d like the benefits of the withdrawal agreement, without paying all the costs.It’s the familiar Brexit delusion, which Brussels took all of six minutes to crush, by declaring – for the millionth time – that “the withdrawal agreement is not open for renegotiation.” In other words, what the Daily Mail calls “Theresa’s triumph” is to have got her party to unite behind a stance that is doomed to fail.But even on its own terms, the vote is hollow. For what did MPs vote for but “alternative arrangements”? Not a specific, detailed counter to the backstop, spelling out concrete ways that a hard border might be avoided, but the nebulous promise of an “alternative”. When you don’t like x, then “not x” looks mighty alluring, not least because it can mean whatever you want it to mean.Brexiteers know the truth of that, because it was that same logic that saw them win the referendum itself. Their message back then boiled down to: do you want to stay in the European Union, with all its concrete, visible flaws, or would you like “alternative arrangements”? What we’ve all learned since is that the moment an “alternative” becomes real, it loses its all-things-to-all-people appeal. Which means that, even if Brussels were to relent and offer a revised proposal to the backstop, the new plan would enrage as many people as it would please – and would likely face rapid rejection by the Commons, by the Brexiteers swiftest of all.But the obloquy should not belong to the Tories alone. MPs had the chance to prevent the national cataclysm of a no-deal crash-out last night – and they refused to take it. They rejected Yvette Cooper’s amendment, which would have made such an exit impossible, thanks in part to 14 Labour rebels who concluded that even a slight delay to Brexit – just a few months – poses more of a threat to their constituents than a crash-out that could see shortages of food and medicine, with more warnings along those lines coming this morning from the leader of a major hospitals group. The future public inquiry into this horror show will damn those 14 especially.Instead, MPs voted for a toothless, non-binding amendment that confirms they don’t like no-deal very much, but are ready to do precisely nothing to prevent it. And while the Tories are still chasing unicorns, Labour is in its own fantasyland. Incredibly, shadow cabinet minister Richard Burgon was on TV last night still mouthing the same vacuities about “Labour’s alternative” Brexit and how it’s going to negotiate a “strong single-market relationship” – all the benefits, none of the costs – as if there isn’t only a matter of weeks to go till Britain leaves the EU. This just 24 hours after the party had embarrassed itself by planning to abstain on Tory legislation ending the free movement of people, only to reverse position 90 minutes later following a backlash on Twitter.The Sir John Chilcot of the future will note all this, even as she or he exempts the handful of MPs who are using every parliamentary wile they can to stop the country from slamming into the iceberg. The names Grieve, Cooper, Boles and others may earn themselves an admiring footnote in the report that will eventually come. But as for almost everyone else: they will be slammed for their role in a saga that disgraces this country and its supposed leaders more with each passing day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb1d6e4b540b218967c2e96c08e83f16980083ff/43_237_3348_2009/master/3348.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fda37444810fe5e89bae0e0142780448","title":"corbyn avert hard brexit tory may deal labour","story":"In spite of the upbeat signals that came from Jeremy Corbyn’s meeting with Theresa May on Wednesday, experience suggests that it will not prove a turning point on Brexit. Neither of them is a natural negotiator or conciliator. These gifts are not part of their skill sets. Of the friendship that can sometimes exist between rival leaders there is no sign. Corbyn’s public sanctimony towards May can make Victor Hugo’s Inspector Javert look like a libertine. May’s default mode towards Corbyn, on show again at question time this week, is to give him her full Lady Disdain.What is more, even if the two leaders wanted to patch something together, their respective Brexit positions do not allow for much common ground anyway. May’s red lines on leaving the single market and the customs union, ending free movement and escaping the jurisdiction of the European court are mostly mirror images of Corbyn’s. He wants a close relationship with the EU market and on customs, and supports his own version of free movement. The only thing that would seem to unite them is that both want Brexit to happen, preferably under a Conservative government.Tuesday’s Commons votes, where Tory MPs rallied around a policy very close to the one they demolished two weeks ago, seem to separate the two leaders still further. Having claimed hers was the only possible deal, May has now pledged to try to change the Northern Ireland backstop arrangement in order to keep her right wing on board. Corbyn, meanwhile, wants her to adopt a soft Brexit approach that would, if she embraced it, trigger a full-scale revolt from her own side and from the Democratic Unionists.For all those reasons and more, the May-Corbyn negotiations seem a sideshow. May has less need of them now. She has regained a bit of control. Her hardliners kept their swords sheathed. The chief whip and the chairman of the Tory backbenchers both played skilful hands, while pro-remain MPs overplayed theirs this time. A second referendum now looks a more distant prospect. All this has won May a reprieve. Given the stunning 230-vote defeat she suffered on 15 January, that is quite a turnaround.But it will not last long. It is not the end of the Brexit battle, and it may not even be the beginning of its end either. May’s characterisation of her majority as “substantial and sustainable” is pure wishful thinking. That is because, as others have argued since Tuesday evening, the vote for the Brady amendment was a vote for something that is both vague and unlikely to happen. The European Union has little incentive to agree to it. And, assuming that it will not happen, certainly not in the small window of time now available, it seems odds-on that May will soon be struggling to find a majority once more.May’s position is neither substantial nor sustainable. It is disjointed and delicate. It bears repeating, after Tuesday’s volte-face, that it was May herself, not the EU, who created the all-UK backstop that she is now seeking to unpick. But the deeper truth, which she must have known when she originally agreed to it in 2017, is that the backstop was an attempt to reconcile three promises that are almost impossible to fit together in one consistent policy.The first of these is May’s promise to leave the customs union, which she made because she knows that the Thatcherite right of her party, including some of the most fanatical long-term advocates of Brexit, attaches immense importance – though it was barely mentioned in 2016 – to an autonomous trade policy. The second is her promise to Ireland, which in law and by treaty she is duty bound to make, that a new trade regime would not cause the creation of a hard border of any kind. And the third is the promise she made to the DUP after the 2017 election that she would not permit customs and regulatory ergence between Britain and Northern Ireland.These three promises are mutually contradictory. That was the case before Tuesday and it is still true now. You can’t have an autonomous trade policy and an open border. That is why the backstop exists at all. It is there to ensure that the open border in Ireland remains in force in the face of May’s commitment, driven by her right wing, to a sovereign trade policy. These unavoidable truths are not going to go away just because May and Graham Brady managed to find a form of words about “alternative arrangements” that pulled the Tory party back from an outright split after the 15 January vote against the deal.This brings us back to the role that Corbyn may yet play. For most of the parliamentary Brexit process, Corbyn has been a large but inert presence. Brexit politics has happened around him, not with or through him. He remains content, it seems, to go through the motions but not to get his hands dirty. Up to a point, it has been a coherent strategy if your three priorities, like Corbyn’s, are for Brexit to happen, for the Tories to own it, and for your own pristine politics to remain unsullied by the most important argument facing the country.In the end, though, events may be propelling Corbyn to mix with the sweatier end of politics. One pressure is that backbenchers in his party – such as Yvette Cooper and Hilary Benn – have emerged as de facto Labour figureheads. Another is that May has begun to engage with workplace and environmental regulatory issues that Labour cares about. Crucially, May’s defeat two weeks ago and her current turn to the Tory right are highlighting the harsh reality of the Brexiter trade autonomy dream that she has now empowered. A more adept Labour leader would have been reaching out relentlessly to Tory moderates over recent months on the customs elements of the eventual UK-EU trade deal, searching for common ground and looking for ways to ensnare them in a shared commitment to the open borders and regulatory alignment that the hard Brexiters so loathe.Such a thing may yet happen anyway. If May fails to get the changes from the EU that she seeks, and if this week’s Tory party unity comes under strain, as it may, then a space could open up for a softer Brexit deal. Such a deal has always been the least worst viable outcome to Brexit. This week’s events have underscored more than ever why May’s deal and no deal need not be the only options. Even Corbyn must see what is now at stake, and why engaging seriously with May is overwhelmingly in the country’s interest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4db79c095d59f8281cdd4a23bbfe778ff7fc8ad/0_200_5150_3091/master/5150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14fccb7c11bd7a878d1450e743e73ab9","title":"education clarks shoes tory shop child development","story":"The government’s proposal that shop workers should help kickstart children’s early development is laughableParents, we’ve all been there: a high-street shoe shop in early September. Everyone with a school-aged child has simultaneously realised that if they don’t get around to buying shoes today, the kids are going to have to start the year wearing flip-flops, or wellies. The queue is out of the door, heaps of small black lace-ups litter the aisles. Babies are wailing. Somebody’s toddler has got a foot stuck in the measuring machine. It’s too hot in the store, and there’s a heady scent of sweat and wee. Your own children are desperate to leave because you rashly bribed them to come here with the promise of a trip to the Lego shop and a doughnut.How, you may wonder, could this annual ritual get any more hellish? As ever, the government is one step ahead: it has come up with the brilliant wheeze of training staff in Clarks shoe shops to “engage children in conversation” with the aim of “improving language skills”. We are assured that this initiative will be up and running by the summer, in time for the pre-school rush. The children and families minister Nadhim Zahawi has explained that “by working with a growing number of businesses, charities and experts, we’re making it easier for parents to kickstart early development”.Really, where do they come up with this stuff? One can only imagine that Zahawi has never been into Clarks during the pre-school rush. If he had, he would know that there is no less suitable educational environment, and the only thing this initiative will help parents to develop is a stress-related migraine. Anyone aware of the cost of Clarks shoes – a typical full-price pair will set you back at least £30 – would also be aware that the chain is not, perhaps, quite the environment in which to engage parents or children from disadvantaged backgrounds.Let’s give our esteemed leaders the benefit of the doubt, however, and assume that somewhere deep within this misguided plan there is a good intention. The government is, quite rightly, concerned about the rates of literacy in the UK, citing the figure that 7.1 million adults have very poor literacy skills, and that rates of early literacy are particularly low among disadvantaged families. There is also plenty of evidence to support the argument that this is not just an issue for schools child from a family in which parents are confident and communicative has a better chance of developing good speech and language skills.But the idea that a shop assistant can provide any kind of meaningful support to parents during a harried interaction in which they are also trying to buy shoes is just laughable. What parents – especially disadvantaged parents – need is proper investment in early-years education. A 2010 evaluation of the Sure Start initiative found that children’s centres, which offered consistent, high-quality expert support, could have a positive influence on the home-learning environment and on parenting more generally. Buts many as 1,000 children’s centres have closed down since 2010, and many of those that are left offer only a fraction of the services they once did. These centres, which were much-loved and so critical to any prospect of social mobility, have been the first thing to go for many cash-strapped local authorities. As have libraries, another crucial source of free support with literacy and communication – almost 130 of them have closed in the last year alone.It’s easy to see the appeal of this scheme, which creates the illusion of commitment to social mobility while costing the government nothing. The cherry on the cake is that the private sector stands to benefit in the form of excellent PR for Clarks and the other businesses involved. But as we parents stand in those stuffy, slow-moving queues next September, listening to sales staff deliver their educational message while we attempt to pacify our restless children with Haribo, perhaps we will be forgiven a hollow laugh.• Alice O’Keeffe is a literary critic and journalist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e4202f2308ccd07178a6d5d9612478fa04072a7/0_100_5012_3008/master/5012.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=157205d934f8bee778fed174a9c2f3a0","title":"labour immigration u turn corbyn","story":"We’re here, then. The point at which a Labour leadership that won support for being different ends up being the same. The stage that jaded observers warned was an inevitability of politics, no matter who was in charge. The day that a political project with impeccably pro-migration credentials triangulated into abstention on a miserable, destructive Conservative immigration bill.OK, so it didn’t fully triangulate in the end. Let’s start at the beginning. On Monday, the government’s immigration bill, their flagship legislation for what the country’s immigration policy would be after Brexit, was due a second reading. The Labour party announced in the afternoon that it would be abstaining, in other words, not voting it down. Within hours, after an excoriating backlash from Labour MPs and Jeremy Corbyn’s supporters alike, the party shifted from abstention to a one-line whip – and the government bill passed with 76 Labour MPs absent. This bill, among other things, ends freedom of movement and strips 3 million EU citizens of their rights in the UK, while threatening them with the hostile environment that others are already cruelly subjected to. It also cavalierly hands immigration powers to ministers and puts a £30,000 salary threshold on skilled worker visas for EU citizens – making it unattainable for skilled workers in key areas such as the NHS, social care and beyond. In this context, Labour’s approach to this bad bill really is staggering.Politics-watchers pointed out that Labour abstaining on a bad immigration bill for the sake of later amendments (as the leadership had claimed) was much like Labour abstaining on a bad welfare bill for the sake of later amendments in 2015. That’s important, because the 2015 moment – not unreasonably – is a defining one for supporters of the Corbyn project. It is invoked both as indication of how far the pre-Corbyn leadership had moved away from core Labour values and as a testament to the current leader’s sticking to his principles – he opposed the welfare bill. This tenet has come unstuck somewhat with the immigration blunder.Corbyn supporters have thus far been accommodating, perhaps because in tone, at least, the party has been more pro-migration since he took the helm. The Corbyn-backing grassroots cut him some slack when he spouted bad takes on migrants suppressing wages – such as on the Andrew Marr Show during the 2017 election campaign, when he pledged to stop the “wholesale importation of underpaid workers from central Europe”. Corbyn supporters seemed prepared even to go along with Labour’s horrible, nothing-to-do-with-us-guv, passive-voice desertion of principle in stating “freedom of movement will end when we leave the EU”. Why? Because it was impossible to believe that the leadership team, iniduals who had over many years repeatedly supported migrants and immigration, could ever abandon all that. It’s a theory I’ve heard many times from pro-Corbyn voices: that if the leadership accepted the end of freedom of movement, it was because they had something better in mind as a replacement.Well, maybe there is a better immigration plan – and Labour’s proposal already includes plans to scrap the hostile environment and try to level up non-EU arrivals to receive the same treatment as EU migrants, rather than levelling everyone downwards, as the Conservatives set out. Perhaps there exists an incredible scheme by which ending freedom of movement does not, by definition, create more hostile border controls. But until Labour gets into government to enact its own plan, a bare minimum is opposition to any cruel, regressive stupidity the Conservatives come up with on the issue. Over immigration, much like Brexit, the argument you hear is that the Labour leadership is building consensus within a disparate party of MPs who disagree over these issues. But the backlash from the frontbench and the parliamentary Labour party over the immigration bill has shown that the leadership has more wriggle room than it imagined – perhaps a combination of the Windrush scandal, Brexit and shortages of workers in positions previously filled by migrants has produced a shift within the party in parliament.Still, beyond that, there is the tougher task of shifting a poisonous national conversation on immigration. Labour managed exactly that over economic narratives, but the starting point was different: counter to assumptions from the political and commentariat classes alike, there has long been public support for key Corbynist policies such as renationalisation, infrastructure investment and higher tax. The test of any Labour leadership’s self-styled radicalism is the capacity to change the political climate when the polling isn’t on its side (although attitudes to immigration have softened, post-Brexit vote). Taking on this challenge means letting go of any lingering old-left beliefs that economics will magically eliminate prejudice that redistributive policies alone will tamp down anti-immigration sentiments.But there is another problem here, too, to do with a narrowing of vision at the top. However quick it was to rectify its approach to the immigration bill vote (and a one-line whip is hardly a full-throated correction), only a leadership that has grown detached from its support base could produce such a failure of judgment in the first place. It doesn’t bode well because, put simply, without letting in the lifeblood of its grassroots, this Labour leadership will atrophy. In this context, maybe the migration blunder has been a wake-up call to the Labour movement. Corbyn supporters have seen that, in being vocally critical rather than unquestioningly loyal, they helped force a change in position. That’s something to keep in mind if the leadership strays again from principles it is supposed to hold dear. • Rachel Shabi is a writer and regular broadcast news commentator"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9de971cba2aa774485a77915c32fdf488ef2839a/0_70_3820_2292/master/3820.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a3ab346c88e5a62b3c287d1f9290bbf","title":"labour not responsible brexit tories","story":"This week’s parliamentary votes on Brexit should mark the death of a delusion. This may seem an odd argument: parliament has just voted for an amendment demanding an alternative to the backstop, which has been repeatedly ruled out by the EU. Tory MPs voted for what they know is impossible. David Lidington, the prime minister’s number two, who three weeks ago denounced “fantasies about magical, alternative deals”, voted for what he knows is impossible. Theresa May, who has repeatedly declared that no alternative to her deal exists and then ludicrously whipped her MPs to vote against that deal, voted for what she knows is impossible. The DUP, which at least has the excuse of being stranded in the 17th century, voted for what it knows is impossible. The Tory party is subjecting the country to a pantomime, acting out a script it knows bears no relation to reality, and is prolonging Britain’s turmoil and our international humiliation, all for the sake of its own partisan interests.No, the delusion that died last night was the idea that Labour has any meaningful say over the substance of Brexit at all. Labour put forward an amendment to strike out no deal, and to provide the option of a second referendum. It backed Yvette Cooper’s amendment to extend article 50 by a mere three months and Dominic Grieve’s amendment to allow consultative votes on alternatives to May’s Brexit plan. All three of the amendments were voted down in parliament. The reason for this is that the Tories have a parliamentary majority, courtesy of the DUP, and Tory MPs – wherever they stand on the Brexit ide – prioritise stopping a party split over the nation’s interests. Along with their ideological obsession with austerity, this is the proximate cause of Britain’s crisis. This should be a statement of the obvious, but sometimes to state the obvious is a revolutionary act.And yet, for some, an opposition party with only a minority of parliamentary seats shares responsibility. Ire is directed at Labour because 14 rebels voted against Cooper’s amendment. For some reason, the leadership is to blame for just over a dozen of its backbenchers defying instructions and rebelling. There really does need to be more consistency in the attack lines directed at Jeremy Corbyn. Is he an authoritarian leader who has subjected the Labour party to a Stalinist reign of terror, leaving MPs in fear of local party members democratically choosing to select another candidate? Or has he imposed insufficient discipline on his MPs? Which is it? As it happens, it has been repeatedly reported that a key reason many rightwing Labour MPs have not declared for May’s deal is because of pressure from Momentum and the threat of deselection. Are Corbyn’s critics now demanding that this pressure should be intensified?If people are angry about the Brexit mess – which they really should be – that fury should be directed at the decisions of the Tory government, decisions voted for and endorsed by virtually every single Tory MP. Let’s look at some so-called Tory rebels. When Jo Johnson resigned from the government over Brexit, he was hailed as a hero of the remain cause and cheered at a People’s Vote rally, where he was interviewed by national treasure Gary Lineker. Yesterday , Johnson voted against the Cooper amendment and against Tory Caroline Spelman’s non-binding amendment to stop a no deal, and abstained on Grieve.Or take Grieve himself, who last year tabled an amendment on a meaningful vote and then voted against it. Or Nicky Morgan, who colluded with Jacob Rees-Mogg to hammer out an unworkable “compromise” that merely makes no deal more likely. Or Anna Soubry, who voted against the right of EU citizens to remain, and declared that she would choose Britain leaving the EU under a Tory government over remaining under a Corbyn government. Time after time, Tory “rebels” have proved themselves charlatan and dupes. Why, then, do some remainers have limitless gullibility when it comes to Tory “rebels” but equally bottomless incredulity when it comes to Labour’s motives?Take Yvette Cooper, who distributed leaflets pledging that she would “not vote to block Brexit”. We are right to condemn Brexiteers for making promises they could not keep during the referendum campaign. But why then demand Labour MPs break their own promises? If Corbyn ordered his MPs to vote for a second referendum, a big chunk of his parliamentary party would rebel, and it would not pass. People’s Vote campaigners have been demanding that Labour commit to a position that would provoke mass resignations from the party’s frontbench, a huge parliamentary rebellion, anger its leave voters, and then still get voted down. For some, the motive is a passionate commitment to a legitimate cause. For others, such as Chuka Umunna, it’s about driving a wedge between Labour’s leadership and its members and voters so that a new “centrist” party can be founded.That doesn’t mean Labour should be absolved of criticism. It has failed to forcefully make the case for immigration, even though key leadership figures – Jeremy Corbyn, Diane Abbott, and John McDonnell – have committed their political lives to pro-migrant and refugee campaigns. Labour nearly abstained on the Tories’ immigration bill on Monday, which would have been scandalous. But to claim that Labour shares the responsibility for Brexit turmoil is completely unfounded.

Whether it’s getting a £1m home refurbishment gifted by the taxpayer, ownership of all the swans or a lifetime of inherited privilege for you and your descendants, royal status shields the bestowed from life’s mundane troubles. But even a five-metre Givenchy wedding veil couldn’t save Meghan, Duchess of Sussex from misogynoir and a barrage of trolling.This week, Kensington Palace had to reach out for help from Twitter and Instagram, as staff members were spending hours each week reporting sexist and racist comments and threats aimed at Meghan and Kate, Duchess of Cambridge. The diatribe is so dire that Hello! magazine has started a campaign #HelloToKindness.Being a woman in public life is not without challenge. Female MPs, athletes and actors are subjected to abuse on and offline. And both Kate and Meghan have been the targets of sexist criticism on the Kensington Palace platforms and in tabloid comment sections. But it should surprise no one that there has been a spike in hateful comments in October and November, following the announcement of Meghan’s pregnancy.Although a strongly worded letter from Prince Harry in 2016 had put the tabloid media on pause, the reality of a more-melanin-infused royal baby joining the House of Windsor has unleashed the hounds once more. Meghan’s crimes since have been numerous travesties that include cupping her baby bump in public and painting her fingernails. Kate cupped her bump on numerous occasions to no comment. “Sources” also claim Meghan is “high maintenance”, “demanding” and “made Kate cry”.Meghan isn’t the first royal to be hounded by the press and criticised frequently. Diana, Princess of Wales was never far away from a front page and faced intense scrutiny. She was also read as a rebel who didn’t follow protocol. But Meghan has the added bonus of being biracial, which brings with it a different type and intensity of abuse.Social media doesn’t cause online abuse but it is a conduit for societies’ baser beliefs. Online trolling of Meghan and Harry has included six knife emojis and claims that Meghan has bleached her skin to look whiter. A Daily Mail headline referred to her as being from a “gang-scarred” home and “(almost) straight outta Compton”. Comments on the Kensington Palace Instagram called her “trashy” and “ghetto”. Like the recent Sunday Times article that referred to the two schools in “gangland” – known to the rest of us as Newham, east London, where the 2012 Olympics were held – that got a number of black teenagers Oxbridge places, the media, and the trolls that follow them, will associate black people with gangs and crime for the most tenuous of reasons.Racism and sexism are social problems. But social media companies could do more to help protect their users. Celebrities and charities such as Amnesty and Glitch UK are left to campaign for change. After a fortnight of news on self-harm, suicides and Katie Price taking a stand for her disabled son, it’s high time they responded seriously to the abuse perpetuated on their platforms. Otherwise, they risk putting off a generation of women, particularly minority women, from entering public life. All communities need some norms, values and standards to make them safe. Online ones are no exception.• Kimberly McIntosh is a writer specialising in race and gender"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a16f45cffd77c6f480bc2b39fab66227040d815/0_221_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a824f3eccd907d94699858c9680b436c","title":"the guardian view on may and the tories choosing unity over reality","story":"Brexit has tested many loyalties in parliament but broken few. The line that ides pro-Europeans and Brexiters cannot be neatly drawn between opposition and governing benches. MPs on both sides have been frustrated by their leaders and defied their whips. But, overall, party bonds have proved remarkably resilient.The slender majority that Theresa May won on Tuesday night, endorsing a theoretical variant of her Brexit deal (minus the Northern Irish backstop), was a case in point. Mrs May had some Labour votes on loan and was as reliant as ever on the DUP, but the determining factor was a Conservative craving to feel whole again after months of civil strife. Many Tory MPs know that the proposition they endorsed was a fiction. The prime minister herself conceded that there was little appetite in the EU to adjust the backstop. Ministers are unable to describe the “alternative arrangements” that are supposed to prevent any return to a hard Irish border. But those technical problems were set aside for the gratification of appearing unified at last.That pretence does not come without cost. There are 27 EU member states whose different interests have been painstakingly funnelled into one withdrawal agreement with the UK. For Mrs May to change her mind about it now, two months before departure day, is not just reckless, it is obnoxious. Governments around the world are watching for signs of what kind of actor “Brexit Britain” will be on the international stage. Previously Mrs May looked obtuse. Now she looks unreliable.The prime minister has often faced a choice between confronting an intransigent strain of Tory anti-Brussels prejudice and indulging it. Each time she has flattered the fanatics. In Brussels, Berlin and Paris it is apparent that the rightwing fringe of the Conservative party harbours nationalistic hostility to the European project, and that some Tory MPs see a purgative value in the chaos that would follow a disorderly collapse of the Brexit process. That wrecking impulse is present within the majority that swung behind Mrs May in the Commons on Tuesday. The Eurosceptic ultras do not expect satisfaction from a renegotiated deal. On the contrary, they make demands in order to mine grievance from the inevitable rejection. They backed the prime minister in preparation for the blame game that will doubtless begin when Brexit fails to deliver its advertised bounties.Mrs May’s tolerance of that faction costs her credibility and goodwill with European partners who also watched David Cameron being manipulated by the same Tory backbenchers with the same incapacity for compromise. Even if the EU27 want to help the prime minister, they know their concessions would simply provoke more demands. There is no interest for the EU side in pandering to the implacables. Mrs May has done so partly because she lacks a Commons majority but that is not a sufficient explanation. For her not once to have challenged the hardliners after all this time suggests a cultural affinity that goes beyond calculation and cowardice. It indicates a sense of belonging – an irrational loyalty that supersedes the call of serious statecraft.Most politicians imagine themselves capable of putting country before party in moments of emergency. That patriotic ambition has rarely been tested as thoroughly or as visibly as it is now with a prime minister who buys transient, worthless moments of Tory unity at a heavy price in national credibility. It is a shameful transaction and one for which Mrs May and the Conservatives will one day be held to account."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92d4e2f61c215a594d2efdf991b0634357d87892/0_0_941_573/master/941.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4aeb1805bbe3de574b02636933200cce 700w","title":"my canadian food odyssey by chef john quilter","story":"On his six-week journey from east to west Canada, chef John Quilter – AKA The Food Busker – finds a salt beef sandwich that’s 10 days in the making, a killer craft beer brewed with foraged herbs and the best Chinese meal outside of ChinaFor many years, Canada has rented a room in my thoughts, ever since I worked there as a young chef. I spent a summer season in the kitchen of a restaurant in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, when I was 18 and had the time of my life. The people, the countryside, the food, I loved it all, and I’ve longed to go back ever since. Last year, I finally returned on an epic six-week food tour of the country.When you think of Canada, I guess you think of mountains, forest, and bears, right? That’s only half the story, but it’s true: the country has a vast natural beauty on a scale we just don’t see in Europe. As I travelled all over, Canada’s vistas constantly stopped me in my tracks. Just when you think you have seen it all – “Nothing, surely, can top Lake Louise, this has to be Canada’s most breathtaking spot!” – two days later you’re on a ranch in Alberta, riding a stallion, hearing about a cougar or a grizzly bear sighting nearby. Canada makes you look at the world through the eyes of a child. Constantly fascinated, completely immersed.The wildlife I expected, what I was not prepared for was how vibrant and unique Canada’s cities are, and the rich foodie scene that each deserves to be proud of.Time and time again I experienced cultural centres humming and sparkling with the day-to-day life of food shopping, eating out or grabbing a coffee. I was astonished and delighted by the quality of the markets and shops, and Canada’s incredibly strong field-to-plate movement, which ensures the freshest, tastiest raw ingredients. Below are a few of my culinary highlights from the trip.Montréal is a befuddling enclave of Francophone culture in this mainly English-speaking country. The city practically fizzes with fierce French passion and values, which you can’t help but be charmed by. I fell in love with its French-style model economy of independent boulangerie, boucher and pâtisserie.Montréal to me was more than just foodie heaven, it was a blueprint for how a city could be. It’s a city that cares about the little things, such as bookshops, delicatessens, decent coffee and croissants the provenance of goods, and the importance of heritage. Montréal is full of independent shops that have been around for generations. From opening their doors every morning to closing at night, they are committed to the simple idea of creating just one thing of value – a coffee or a salt beef sandwich – and taking enjoyment and pride in the “means”.The aforementioned perfect salt beef sandwich was enjoyed at one of Montréal’s ultimate foodie landmarks, Schwartz’s. The smoked-meat experts have been trading on Saint-Laurent Boulevard since 1928, when established by Jewish immigrant Reuben Schwartz. Unlike many places, Schwartz’s still smokes its meat the old-fashioned way: with a 10-day marinade and then an eight-hour smoke before it’s sliced in front of your eyes. Frank Silva, the manager, has worked here since he was a boy, something I found time and again in Montréal. In an age when there is often little customer or staff loyalty to establishments, I found it truly enchanting.The city also lays claim to the world’s best bagel – or, rather, two of the world’s best. Locally, it is considered an undisputed fact that you won’t find a better bagel than the ones made here, but the jury is very much out over which Montréal institution is superior: St-Viateur Bagel or Fairmont Bagel. Some favour St-Viateur for the honey water they boil their bagels in, while Fairmont is so in demand it stays open 24 hours a day. Both, to me, were perfection – yet another example of the city’s impassioned, artisanal approach to food.Halifax, the capital of Nova Scotia, has a kicking live music scene, along with a fabulous market culture. The city’s Seaport Farmers’ Market on the waterfront is the oldest continuously operating farmers’ market in North America, the hub for a long list of cheese makers, fruit and vegetable producers, and wine growers from the plentiful farms in the nearby Annapolis valley. At the stall for That Dutchman’s Cheese Farm, I sampled Dragon’s Breath – one of the stinkiest, creamiest, most kick-ass blue cheeses you could imagine.But it is Halifax’s craft beer scene that rivals anything I’ve seen anywhere else. At the Good Robot Brewing Co, the female brew team of Erica Fraser and Kelly Costello create beers with locally foraged herbs and medicinal plants. The list of brews is extensive – on reflection, I may have investigated it a little too thoroughly.And the restaurants also punch way above their weight. I found classic comfort food at 2 Doors Down, where the braised Prince Edward Island beef short rib is knockout, while Halifax’s privileged coastal position also makes it a hotspot for seafood.Ontario in east-central Canada is the province I have spent the most time in over the years, since working here as a teen, and it still feels like a home away from home. Capital city Toronto is such an enthralling city, with so much going on. What sets it apart from other cities is the sheer wealth of its ethnic communities happily living and eating together. It is one of the world’s most multicultural cities – in fact, a survey by BBC Radio named it the most erse, ahead even of London. Just over half of its residents are foreign-born, hailing from 230 different nationalities. This shows in the food scene, a heavyweight collection of authentic ethnic cuisines alongside young chefs developing and modernising traditional flavours.Here, I had stand-out Indian and Vietnamese, while Mexican food is on the rise in a big way. My favourite restaurant, and the one that sums this all up, was Snack Bar 416 (pictured above). A small hipster joint near bohemian Kensington Market, it uses all the city’s main ethnic communities as inspiration, taking one hero dish from each cuisine. Often when this pick-and-mix approach is attempted it falls flat on its face, with compromise and inexperience resulting in bland creations. Not here, not in Toronto.One of the best ways to take the culinary temperature of a city is to see how its various establishments serve brunch. I hit two spots and became addicted to Chambar on the edge of Gastown, the hipster area of the city, and the waffle heaven of Medina, which served incredible dishes with imagination and attention to detail. And then came the holy grail: a killer cup of coffee. Revolver, again in Gastown, is the coffee shop St Peter would open outside the pearly gate. Trust me.For more information and inspiration, see explore-canada"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/597305e020ab2ad32cb503da49f25aff335f0cf4/0_432_5197_3118/master/5197.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a048cd5a81fdd7e6e30a6f0caf192af1","title":"the lowdown on nova scotia canadas seaside paradise","story":"Sandy beaches, snug harbours and (possibly) the best lobster roll in the world. Welcome to Canada’s ocean playground …Boasting more than 4,300 miles of unspoiled sea coast, Nova Scotia is home to whales, lobster, an extraordinarily friendly creative community, rich cultural heritage and that Canadian icon, the moose. It can be reached in just over six hours from the UK with flights departing all year from Heathrow and, during high season, also from Gatwick and Glasgow. This year-round destination offers all manner of adventures in the great outdoors, plus a thriving live music scene and out-of-this-world seafood. Here’s how to pack the best of Nova Scotia into your trip …Nova Scotia is best known for its seafood – you’ll be hard pressed to find a better lobster roll anywhere (don’t miss those at Capt. Kat’s Lobster Shack in Barrington). It is also one of Canada’s premier wine regions, with no fewer than 18 vineyards and wineries. The Wolfville Magic Winery Bus is the first of its kind in North America, a hop-on, hop-off bus tour of five scenic and storied wineries in the Annapolis Valley.The Nova Scotia lobster and chowder trails will spoil you with remarkably fresh seafood, offering the most authentic boat-to-table experience possible – from lobster dinners to hearty chowder and everything in between.And you can’t visit the region without trying the donair (a pitta filled with roasted shaved beef, tomatoes and onions, slathered in a sweet, garlic sauce). Go directly to the source: King Of Donair in Halifax, Nova Scotia’s capital and the biggest city in Atlantic Canada. Enjoy seaside dining at The Bicycle Thief, located on the thriving, ever-developing waterfront locals love the tuna carpaccio and meatballs stuffed with fior di latte mozzarella. The Wooden Monkey, meanwhile, is a sustainability-minded, award-winning eatery that prides itself on sourcing almost all of its ingredients, produce and drinks locally. Visit its Dartmouth location across the harbour for stunning views of the Halifax skyline, afterwards visit Edna in Halifax’s booming North End is great for tapas and cocktails.Nearby is Peggy’s Cove, one of the province’s most popular and most photographed destinations, thanks to its famous lighthouse and breathtaking coastal views. Enjoy the Oceanstone Resort’s Ultimate Lobster Feast and Peggy’s Cove Adventure, where the resort’s executive chef guides you as you choose your own lobster from Ryer’s Lobster Pound, and after experiencing Peggy’s Cove and craft beer tasting, feast on lobster at sunset.In September, Halifax hosts the FIN: Atlantic International Film Festival celebrating both local and international film-makers. Then, in October, 150 musicians, comedians and speakers come together for the Halifax Pop Explosion, showcasing emerging music and art. A popular draw in the summer, the Halifax Jazz Festival, the oldest in Atlantic Canada, attracts some of the best musicians in the world to a city-wide extravaganza.One of Nova Scotia’s most famous artists is Maud Lewis (played by Sally Hawkins in the award-winning 2016 film Maudie), many of whose naïve, child-like paintings depict rural Nova Scotia. Her work is on display at the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia. The province is also home to a rich and erse cultural heritage, including Mi’kmaq and First Nations, African Nova Scotian, Acadian and Celtic and Gaelic peoples, all of whom have shaped Nova Scotia’s story.There are many museums dotted around the province that bring to life the story of all these peoples. You can find out about African Nova Scotians at the Black Loyalist Heritage Centre in Birchtown on the South Shore – it takes visitors through the journey of early black settlers in Nova Scotia. And discover the history of the Acadian people – descendants from the French settlers – at the Grand-Pré national historic site and at Le Village Historique Acadien de la Nouvelle-Écosse. While, the Highland Village Museum is a living history museum and cultural centre that celebrates the Gaelic experience in Nova Scotia.The Bay of Fundy boasts the highest tides in the world – around 16 metres – and thanks to the Tidal Bore Rafting Resort you can – literally – ride that wave. The Shubenacadie River (don’t worry, the locals just call it “Shubie”) is known for its beauty and for regular sightings of bald eagles. Unforgettably, you can enjoy a seafood and wine tasting on a sandbar before 160bn tonnes of water fill up the estuary.Kejimkujik national park and national historic site is a special place to experience the outdoors with great camping, canoeing and hiking opportunities. Also, learn about the Mi’kmaq, a founding people of Nova Scotia and, to this day, the biggest indigenous group in the province. Hear their stories, see ancient petrogylphs (carvings in stone) and a re-created Mi’kmaw encampment, and paddle the ancient waterways.Biking is another great way to see the province. Train Station Bike \u0026amp Bean in St. Margaret’s Bay is a hidden gem where you can rent a bicycle and enjoy a magnificent ride along the Rum Runners Trail on a former railbed. You will get to see several seaside communities along the South Shore, including Mahone Bay and Chester all the way to Lunenburg.The world-famous Cabot Trail winds its way around and through Cape Breton Highlands national park the 185-mile loop is one of Canada’s genuine wonders. Save a few days to drive around and enjoy the cultural heritage sites and scenic coastal viewpoints. Leave time, though, to hike one of the many trails such as Skyline or Franey in the national park for glimpses of moose, bald eagles and other wildlife.While summer and autumn are the most popular times to visit, there’s plenty to enjoy all year round. The White Point Beach Resort is one of Nova Scotia’s four-season jewels. Enjoy the miles of pure white sand beach in the summer and cozy up to an inviting fireplace next to windows overlooking the ocean during the winter. June to September is whale-watching season head to Brier Island or Cape Breton for the best views.Many trails are open year-round, such as Rogart Mountain Trail in Earltown, ideal for winter snowshoeing and summer hiking. The trail climbs to the summit of Rogart Mountain, which offers spectacular views. After enjoying the trail, stop at Sugar Moon Farm to savour their signature pancakes topped with sweet maple syrup produced on site.Halifax is also home to one of the most architecturally impressive libraries in the world, a Titanic exhibit at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic (the survivors went to New York some of those who died came to Halifax), an impressive waterfront boardwalk, all matter of dining options and stellar art galleries. There are also several pubs throughout the city to catch a local band and enjoy a pint of Nova Scotia craft beer.

They cut out paper starfish – more formally known as sea stars – and put them up for “adoption” for a $1 donation. They assigned them names and personality traits, such as Cherry Bomb, who “loves hanging out on her phone”, “rocks the legging style” and “is really smart but isn’t a nerd”. They sold T-shirts that read: “Save the Starfish.”“We don’t have an ocean anywhere close by,” their now retired teacher Vickie Bailey said. “The students knew that they would never go to the coast, they would probably never get to see this type of starfish, but they were so passionate about what was happening.”When Drew Harvell, a marine ecology professor and researcher at Cornell University, received the $400 or so that Carl Stuart middle school in Conway collected, she knew the money should go to something important.“I almost cried, I was so touched. So I matched it with $400 of my own and then one of our donors here put in a bigger amount of money and that’s basically the funding that allowed us to do the initial survey,” Harvell said.Flash forward to today: Harvell and her co-authors are releasing their study inspired by the seed money from the kids. Cornell and the University of California, Davis, are publishing their work in the journal Science Advances.The campaign didn’t exactly save the starfish. The findings are dire. But researchers now know much more about the scope of the die-off after analyzing data from trained recreational and professional ers and deep offshore trawls.Sea star wasting disease has affected more than 20 species from Mexico to Alaska. Some species resisted the disease better and others have evolved to survive.At the time of the outbreak, videos showed beaches littered with the arms of dead starfish, internal organs spilling out through lesions, Harvell recalled.The effect has been particularly bad for the sunflower star, a 3-4ft-wide creature that can have as many as two dozen arms. The sunflower star “crawls over the seafloor like a robotic vacuum cleaner, munching on everything in its path”, as described by Cornell’s media team.Sunflower sea stars, which live only on the west coast of North America, are now virtually gone from the waters off California, Oregon and Washington.Previous research has suggested that with warmer temperatures linked to climate change, the wasting disease has a higher risk of infection and kills sea stars faster. The new study finds that outbreaks of the virus among sunflower sea stars coincided with anomalously warm waters.And the disappearance of the species is having cascading effects on the ecosystem.Sunflower sea stars once kept the sea urchin population under control, but now urchin numbers are exploding, leading to barrens where they have devoured kelp habitats down to the pink sea floor beneath them.While the species is imperiled in the lower 48, they’re doing a little better in British Columbia and in some places in Alaska, Harvell said. Researchers will need to understand whether the sunflower sea star can be repatriated if the disease ever leaves west coast waters.“It’s really vital that something be done,” Harvell said. “It’s not an issue that we’ve dealt with before so I don’t have an immediate suggestion of what we would do. I think that we definitely need to convene a group of scientists and really talk about the issue and what are the highest priority items.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/901f0a4b0c78893af276f13aafdaaed0ea2db3ee/0_0_3438_2063/master/3438.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c217eae975a5efddd314dbcd28587a5e","title":"dior exhibition victoria and albert museum maria grazia chiuri","story":"Designer Maria Grazia Chiuri talks about aligning the fashion house with modern feminism ahead of the exhibition openingClose your eyes and think of Dior. What comes to mind? Christian Dior never had a pet movie star, like Givenchy had Audrey Hepburn nor a longstanding muse, as Catherine Deneuve was for Yves Saint Laurent. So the odds are, that you think first of all of the New Look suit. The wasp-waist jacket with a full skirt have come to stand for Dior and, beyond that, for fashion itself – the very idea of a must-have New Look. This suit is the first thing you see when you enter Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams, which opens at London’s V\u0026ampA Museum on Saturday.On Monday morning, as the exhibition installation was in its final stages, the head of Dior had arrived from the Eurostar, ready to host the opening parties. Maria Grazia Chiuri, Dior’s first female designer, was wearing jeans, black boots, and a thick-ribbed navy sweater under a clean-lined navy cashmere coat. Maria Grazia, as her team call her, wears her short hair bleached and slicked back, her eyes heavily rimmed with kohl, her knuckles encrusted with heavy jewellery. She is not the wasp-waisted, full-skirt type.What the designer, who was born in Rome in 1964, does have in common with Christian Dior, who founded his eponymous house 17 years before she was born, is a love of Britain. This Dior exhibition was first shown in Paris two years ago, but has been expanded by the curator Oriole Cullen to tell the story of Dior in the UK. British society adopted Dior from the start – Nancy Mitford and Margot Fonteyn were two of the 21 private clients who ordered the Daisy suit – a rounder, more decorative version of the Bar from Dior’s first Paris show. Within a year, Dior was staging fashion shows at the Savoy, conveniently close to his preferred Savile Row tailor soon, he upsized to Blenheim Palace.“I love being in a country where the past lies so vividly around me,” he wrote in his memoir, Dior on Dior. (Monsieur Dior raved not only about Savile Row tailoring but also the style of British women and the food.)“From the moment I came to Dior, the link with Britain was very clear to me,” says Chiuri. “People tend to think of the Bar suit as being very feminine, and it is. But when I look at it, what I see is tailoring – really strong British tailoring. Almost severe.”Chiuri has loved London since she discovered the Beatles when was 12, she says. As a fashion student, she talked her way into an early John Galliano show in Olympia. These days, she is a frequent visitor to London, as her 24-year-old daughter, Raquelle, lives in the city. “For anyone who works in fashion at a brand with a history, Britain is fascinating, because it balances modernity with tradition, which is what we try to do,” she says.This will be the first fashion exhibition to be staged in the V\u0026ampA’s new Sainsbury Wing, and the Dior in Britain section gives the show a timely emphasis on the idea of Britishness, and presents Princess Margaret as Dior’s answer to Hepburn or Deneuve. Her status as a fashion icon has been boosted by gorgeous wardrobing in the Netflix series The Crown, presenting Dior with an opportune moment to lay claim to the real-life princess, who wore Dior for her 21st birthday party.“She crystallised the whole popular frantic interest in royalty. The public had chosen well. She was a real fairy princess, delicate, graceful, exquisite,” wrote Dior of the young Margaret. The birthday party dress takes pride of place in the room devoted to his work in Britain, alongside the famous portrait of Margaret by Cecil Beaton.No fashion exhibition staged since Savage Beauty, the world-beating Alexander McQueen retrospective, can escape the comparison. The success of that show put fashion exhibitions on the map by showing museums their potential for pulling in a wider audience. But it is impossible to match for sheer drama, and casts a long shadow. This exhibition has an entirely different emotional tone. There are no shock tactics. All is sunny, pretty and deliciously gossipy – which is not to damn with faint praise it is, frankly, charming.Dior died after just a decade helming the house, and so his talent is not part of the story long enough to be the central focus of this show. Instead, in this sensational line-up of haute couture dresses – every single piece in this show is handmade – we see the work of the stable of designers, including Yves Saint Laurent and John Galliano, who have captained the ship between Dior and Chiuri.It is the creation-myth Dior years, however, that make the case for fashion as an epoch-defining art form. The New Look was not just a trend, it was a vision of Paris reborn in a perilous postwar moment when it was not at all clear that French fashion would be able to reclaim its primacy. Dior became a national hero in France as a result.The cover of Time magazine on which he featured shortly before his death is displayed alongside the Bar suit. A true modernist, he was decades ahead of his time in building a global brand, travelling to Venezuela, Japan and Australia as well as London and New York. In the afterglow of the New Look’s success, he literally bottled his success and sold it: Miss Dior perfume went on sale for Christmas in 1947.The pale grey walls and white columns of Dior’s Avenue Montaigne headquarters have been adopted in the exhibition, adding to the sense that this is a show about a design house, not just a man. Rooms are arranged thematically, from “Historicism” to “Garden”. This doesn’t lend itself to narrative drama, but the Garden room – with hanging paper wisteria and roses, and a bench to enjoy the view of ravishing dresses – is a delight.As a result of the thematic layout, haute couture by Dior and Chiuri is mixed in with the other designers in each room. The Yves Saint Laurent pieces are, in many cases, the most timelessly chic. But it is impossible not to become aware that it is the Galliano pieces to which the eye is immediately drawn. The rest of a group of Egyptian-themed dresses seem to blend into the background when juxtaposed by Galliano’s turquoise python skirt suit with a swollen stomach, paired with the jackal-headed Anubis mask with which it was worn on the catwalk.No mention is made of the ignominious circumstances in which Galliano, who was found guilty of racist and antisemitic abuse in 2011, left the house. To revisit the showstopping dazzle of the Galliano years without context feels a little jarring, in an exhibition that elsewhere embraces the links between fashion and wider society.Chiuri wants to align Dior with modern feminism, and it is Marc Bohan, one of the lesser-known Dior designers, with whom she feels the most affinity. “His work was so contemporary.

The fashion world is currently consumed by a homeware obsession – making the “shelfie” the new selfie.It’s not a hard trend to hunt down. On social media, aesthetically pleasing backgrounds now get at least as much attention as the outfits we post photographs of. Elsewhere on our feeds, Peggy Guggenheim’s terrazzo-tiled palazzo in Venice, the quiet sophistication of Kettle’s Yard in Cambridge and the sugary millennial-pink interior of the tea room at Sketch in London are just as likely to be pictured as a new pair of shoes. The hashtag #IHaveThisThingWithTiles has become as commonplace as #TodayI’mWearing, while Le Corbusier is the new Calvin Klein and Charlotte Perriand the new Prada.“It’s a natural extension of accessorising in fashion in the way you might buy something to cheer an outfit up the equivalent is buying a cushion for your sofa or a vase for your mantlepiece,” says Vogue’s fashion features editor, Ellie Pithers. She too credits Instagram for the rate at which we are consuming images of people’s houses, hence increasing our appetite for interiors (witness the Italian fashion brand Bottega Veneta this week releasing its spring 2019 campaign, in which the chrome and snakeskin chair the model sat on stole the show). “The next stage of showing off your good taste is extended to your house.”The new offering from Asos – which self-identifies as “a global fashion destination for 20-somethings” – promises to work, says Pithers, because it is targeting young trend-driven shoppers who don’t have a lot of space or money. “They haven’t focused on big furniture, because their customers are students who don’t have big flats.” Instead, they can “buy a standard sofa from Ikea then beautify it with lots of nice little bits”, such as placing a wicker wastepaper basket, a printed plate or a water jug nearby. River Island’s bestsellers so far – a coaster, a planter and a leopard-print mug –chime with this psychology.That the popularity of interiors has coincided with the rise of the Swedish H\u0026ampM group on the high street is no coincidence. The group capitalised on the mid-century Scandinavian aesthetic – one of the most prevailing interiors trends of this century – by bottling the formula, firstly through its H\u0026ampM Home brand and then with Arket, which launched in 2017. “Arket has been clever,” says Pithers. “The way they have the homewares by the till. Instead of buying a chocolate bar on the way out of the newsagent, you’re buying a little vase or a pack of matches that doesn’t cost very much and cheers you up.”When it comes to fashion, quick-fix, fast interiors are the new food for thought.

The key to its Dark Universe surely lies in the hands of emerging talentIf the Marvel Cinematic Universe goes down in film history as a textbook example of how to build a perfect spider-web of interconnected movies, with each new arrival in multiplexes enriching and adding nuance to those that came before, Universal’s recently deceased “Dark Universe” will surely be remembered as the exact opposite: a cinematic end of line, full stop, dead end.The rumblings that this one might have breathed its last breath – before it ever really emerged from a thousand-year slumber to embark on a reign of terror – were there from the beginning. After the studio released a weird-looking shot of Tom Cruise (star of The Mummy) with Johnny Depp (the Invisible Man), Russell Crowe (Dr Jekyll) and Javier Bardem (Frankenstein’s monster) in 2017, it emerged that the image had in fact been put together via composite techniques. Even the A-list actors themselves clearly weren’t confident enough in the future of the franchise to find the time to be properly photographed together.Later that month, The Mummy bombed critically (though it eventually grasped its way to a not-completely terrible $410m worldwide), leading the rest of those remakes to being quietly locked back in the crypt. Until now, that is. For the Hollywood Reporter suggests Universal is resurrecting its plans for The Invisible Man – sans Depp, and with no plans to have the heavily bandaged monstrosity hang out with his monster buddies, Abbott and Costello-style, in future movies this time around.This can only be a good thing. The studio’s concoction Prodigium, a Dark Universe agency equivalent to Marvel’s SHIELD, complete with green-faced Russell Crowe presumably hamming it up in every movie as JekyllHyde, always looked as clumsily stitched together as Frankenstein’s monster himself. Moreover, the star-focused model for the franchise rather ignored the fact that it is pretty difficult to create a gothic mist of suspense when the key protagonists are among Hollywood’s most famous faces … and we all know they are guaranteed to make it to the end credits.The presence of Cruise and Crowe in The Mummy unbalanced Alex Kurtzman’s film so severely that it was nearly impossible to recall that this was a film ostensibly designed to chill the spine, so comic were its hamfisted attempts at knockabout action thrills and mega-movie world-building.Perhaps Universal’s determination to throw a little star power into the mix was predicated on the studio’s own insecurities, for most of the original titles that spawned the classic monster movies of the 1930s are long out of copyright in the US. If another studio wants to make a movie version of HG Wells’s The Invisible Man, it is perfectly entitled to do so, though that studio may not be able to persuade Johnny Depp to get on board.Nobody yet knows who will be stepping into Claude Rains’s shoes in the new version, but the spirit of James Whale’s original 1933 film and Wells’s source novel surely require that it be an unknown, or at the very least not an instantly recognisable face. Universal has recruited Insidious and Saw’s Leigh Whannell to direct, and it’s clear the studio sees this as a new start with a very different approach to its ill-fated previous plans.“Throughout cinematic history, Universal’s classic monsters have been reinvented through the prism of each new film-maker who brought these characters to life,” said the studio’s president of production, Peter Cramer. “We are excited to take a more inidualised approach for their return to screen, shepherded by creators who have stories they are passionate to tell with them.”Let us hope Universal really can wrap its latest efforts up in a veil of eerie enigma this time around, rather than batter us around the chops with corny action cliches. If the studio wants to bring its most infamous horror icons back from the dead, it had better make sure to inject them with some real creative electricity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/647cc4c60a6ed91ee4d923b6eafb3c3e2f194740/155_173_1378_827/master/1378.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43bff91ae7f5d58a92986dc781728713","title":"green book review mahershala ali viggo mortensen peter farrelly","story":"Mahershala Ali plays a jazz musician who confronts the racism of his driver, played by Viggo Mortensen, in a warm but tentative real-life storyMahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen are two excellent actors outclassing their material in this amiable, feelgood entertainment, inspired by a true story. Mortensen plays Tony Vallelonga, a 1960s nightclub bouncer from New York who got a job as personal driver and minder to African-American jazz musician Don Shirley (Ali) on a tour through the Jim Crow south – armed with the “green book”, a guide to hotels and restaurants hospitable to black people.The movie, in fact, has its own green book, negotiating subjects and areas where it needs to tread carefully. Class and race aren’t the only issues – there is also sexual identity, which the film touches on once and then moves on without the principals ever saying a word about it.In real life, Tony became a show business figure, acting in Goodfellas and The Sopranos he died in 2013 and his son Nick is this film’s producer and co-screenwriter, with Peter Farrelly directing. It’s a standard-issue heartwarmer, a liberal whiteblack tale like Driving Miss Daisy or the recent The Upside. (There are some eerily close resemblances to the latter film, including a moment in which the servant must teach the master about Aretha Franklin.)Tony’s job is to cure Don of his snobbery and emotional frigidity, and Don must cure Tony of his racism and ignorance – although this half of the equation is fudged. In an initial scene, Tony puts a couple of glasses in the bin because his wife has let two black workmen drink out of them. But the level of fanatical racism that this implies pretty much vanishes when Tony meets Don. So their road trip to self-discovery begins, and we hold our breath for when the white good-ol’-boy racists inevitably show up, or for when Shirley wishes to use the white bathroom at those grand places where he has been booked to play.Vallelonga’s nickname is “Tony Lip” he tells Shirley this is because of his reputation as a bullshitter. Shirley’s surviving relatives have evidently suspected some “lip” in this film, which appears to erase them from the story in the service of exaggerating his redemptive friendship with Tony.Well, it’s a handsomely made and watchable picture and there is a real warmth in Ali and Mortensen’s performances."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94ac92e1c2a0050d455c2176a49fbe827c45935f/0_4068_6192_3715/master/6192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53bfac983424c0cf3152cb1f35190f3b","title":"20 best egg recipes part 3 giorgio locatelli souffle custard tart carbonara","story":"A classic cheese souffle, an indulgent custard tart and Giorgio Locatelli’s perfect spaghetti carbonara – great recipes for an every day ingredientYou don’t need to use fancy bread for this recipe – a basic white bloomer or a soft white bread works best because it can be squeezed to enclose the filling.

Cook this roux on a gentle heat for a couple of minutes until it acquires a sandy texture. Add a small ladleful of the cooled milk to the roux and work it together, on the heat, to form a stiff paste. Strain the remainder of the milk into the paste and bring to the boil, whisking constantly. Simmer this white sauce on a very low heat, whisking occasionally, for 10 minutes. Pour in the cream and egg yolk mixture, simmer for a minute before adding all the gruyere and half the parmesan and then removing from the heat. Whisk the sauce to ensure the cheese melts before pouring into a large bowl and laying clingfilm across the surface.Melt the remaining butter and brush the interiors of the souffle moulds very thoroughly with the butter. Sprinkle the remaining parmesan in the moulds and rotate them in order to ensure an even coating. Place the moulds in the fridge.Preheat the oven to 190Cgas mark 5.Add a squeeze of lemon juice and a pinch of salt to the egg whites. Whisk the egg whites – preferably with an electric mixer – until they form stiff shiny peaks. Remove the film from the cheese mixture and whisk in a small amount of egg white, whisking vigorously to make a smooth mixture. Now add the remaining white and very gently cut and fold the mixtures together, making the mixture as homogenous as possible without losing volume. Spoon the mixture into the chilled souffle moulds. Smooth the surface with a palette knife before running a little knife around the top of the inside perimeter of the moulds to prevent the mixture sticking to the sides as it rises. The souffles can be chilled for up to an hour in the fridge at this juncture.Pour some boiling water into an oven tray. Place the souffles, spaced apart, in the tray and then bake the souffles for 11-13 minutes, by which time they should be well risen and firm to the touch.

In a sauté pan, heat the butter, then put in the guanciale or pancetta and fry until golden and crispy. Take off the heat, and lift out the guanciale or pancetta to a warm plate, so that it stays crunchy.Put the peppercorns into the pan and crush with a meat hammer or the end of a rolling pin, then add a couple of spoonfuls of the cooking water from the pasta and stir it around to take up all the bits of guanciale or pancetta which may have stuck to the bottom of the pan.Beat the egg yolks and a whole egg in a warm bowl with the grated pecorino romano.One minute before the spaghetti is ready, start to mix in a ladleful of the cooking water at a time until the eggs and cheese become creamy.Drain the pasta (but reserve the cooking water) and toss it in the pan of pepper, together with the reserved guanciale or pancetta.Add a little more cooking water if the pasta seems too dry, then transfer it to the bowl of eggs and cheese and toss well, until coated in the silky mixture. The heat of the spaghetti will cook the eggs without scrambling them.

Add the leek and sauté to soften – it will take 3-4 minutes – then start adding the spinach, a large handful at a time. Stir between each addition to wilt it. It may seem as if it will never fit in the pan, but as it wilts there will be hardly any volume left. Finally add the chopped herbs and mix them in to wilt, too. The whole process will take about 6-8 minutes, depending on the leaves you are using just make sure they are soft by the end of it.Remove the frying pan from the stove and season with the garlic and some salt and pepper. You can set this aside until you are ready to eat and the table is set it will also keep in the fridge until later.You only want to cook the eggs once everyone is at the table, as it is best to eat this while the yolks are still runny.Heat the spinach mixture again and use a spoon to create 4 little wells in the cooked leaves, one in each quarter. Crack an egg into each well, season the eggs with a touch of salt and pepper and cover the pan. Cook on a low heat until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny – about 3-4 minutes. Serve straight away. You can drizzle with some yogurt and sumac or serve it as is. It’s delicious either way.From Honey \u0026amp Co At Home by Sarit Packer \u0026amp Itamar Srulovich (Pavilion Books, £26)A custard tart is one of the finest puddings – crisp pastry filled with a rich, wobbly custard and topped with grated nutmeg. I usually like it best in its simplest form, but when raspberries, rhubarb or sweet, juicy cherries are in season, they make an excellent addition, creating little pockets of fruitiness and an even prettier pudding just leave out the nutmeg.Makes 1 tart, serving 6-8For the sweet pastryunsalted butter 80gcaster sugar 50gfine sea salt a pinchegg yolk 1plain flour 160g, plus extra for dustingFor the custardegg yolks 7 caster sugar 50g double cream 450ml vanilla pod 1 nutmeg for gratingTo make the pastry, mix the butter and sugar with a pinch of salt in an electric mixer or in a large bowl with a hand-held blender, until smooth and creamy.Add the egg yolk and continue to mix so it is well combined.Add the flour and mix briefly, then scoop the mixture into a clean bowl, add a tablespoon of cold water and, using your hands, bring the pastry together. Add another tablespoon of water if necessary to form a cohesive but firm dough. Wrap in clingfilm and allow to rest for at least an hour or overnight in the fridge.On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry until it is large enough to fit a 23cm loose-bottomed tart tin. When ready to make your tart, line your tin with the pastry, keeping any offcuts in case you need to plug any holes after blind baking.Chill in the fridge for 20 minutes while you preheat the oven to 150Cgas mark 2.Line the pastry case with baking parchment and fill with baking beans. Bake blind for 15 minutes. Remove the paper and beans and return to the oven for a further 15 minutes, until golden and sandy textured. Leave to cool while you prepare the custard.In a large bowl, whisk the yolks and sugar until the sugar has dissolved. Put the cream into a pan, slit the vanilla pod lengthways and scrape the seeds into the cream. (Place the empty pod in a jar of caster sugar to make vanilla sugar.)Heat the cream until it just starts to come to the boil, then pour it in a thin stream into the yolks, whisking as you do. Return the whole mixture to the pan and heat very gently, stirring continuously, until it thickens slightly.Strain the custard into a jug. If there are any lumps in the custard (caused by cooking it at too high a temperature), give it a whizz with a handheld blender until it is completely smooth.Pour the custard into the baked tart shell and return to the oven for 35-40 minutes or until the filling feels firm but still a little wobbly to the touch. Grate the nutmeg all over the surface and allow to cool completely. (The custard will set further.)

They’re not hesitating to send a few crosses into the Liverpool area. However, Vardy’s yet to get close to beating Van Dijk.31 min: Ndidi pinches the ball off Wijnaldum in the middle and makes off towards the Liverpool area. He slips a pass through to Gray, who looks for Vardy in the middle. Who’s there, though? Van Dijk.29 min: Maddison hoofs a free-kick into the Kop. Awful. Especially with the big men up from the back.25 min: Another poor clearance from Alisson, who doesn’t look comfortable with the ball at his feet this evening, lands Liverpool in more bother. Albrighton whips a cross into the middle from the right and Maddison is completely unmarked six yards from goal. Incredibly, though, he manages to cushion his header wide of the far post! What a miss! He had to score.23 min: Salah spins brilliantly and tries to release Shaqiri, but Ricardo reads the danger and covers well.21 min: “I think Kloppo watched a John Wayne movie last night,” Josh Bains says. “Jurgen was asked once to pick an actor to play him in a film, and he chose John Wayne. I don’t think the Duke would’ve been able to play him, though.”18 min: This is a decent spell for Leicester. Ricardo drives inside from the right and finds Maddison, who’s tackled by Maddison. Then Gray skips round Robertson and fizzes in a low cross. It’s too close to Alisson, though.16 min: Matip upends Vardy on the halfway line and earns a booking. 15 min: A short spell of Leicester passing ends with Mendy drifting a pass out for a throw.

It was, however, surely a foul by the Liverpool player.7 min: A poor pass from Alisson puts Henderson in trouble and the makeshift right-back tangles with Maddison, who goes down looking for a penalty. Martin Atkinson waves the Leicester man’s appeals away.6 min: Gray scoots down the right flank and tries to release Albrighton. Matip steps in to win the ball and Liverpool set off again. Salah drives down the right flank, cuts inside and floats a ball to the far post for Firmino. The Brazilian takes it on his chest, dips past Ricardo and tries to fire past Schmeichel. This time the Leicester goalkeeper makes a stunning save. From the resulting corner Mane should score, only to head wide at the near post. Leicester are rocking.5 min: Leicester have barely had a sniff yet. It also looked like the snow helped Mane make that chance. The Leicester defenders looked very uncertain on their feet.Liverpool probe down the left, looking to make a fast start. Firmino schemes on the edge of the Leicester area and when a pass from the Brazilian squirts free, nobody’s more alert than Mane.

Other chants are available.“The question behind many Liverpool fan’s thousand yard stare is what cruel form of deflation fate is serving up for us if the lead does build, expectation does grow and a title looms into view,” Ian Copestake says. “So for now let’s just win some games and enjoy the ride!”Ah, the torment of being a fan. Is it possible to be optimistic? The default setting is pessimism for most. Easier that way. Jurgen Klopp is asked about Manchester City’s defeat last night. “I had a long working day and came home late. I went to my missus and we didn’t watch the game, we watched a movie. When the final whistle happened and Newcastle won, my smart phone was buzz buzz buzz ... and I really hate that. If they would have won we would have played tonight. If they lost we would have played tonight. We want to play football and if there is something to celebrate you will see it in my face then.”Liverpool’s shortage of right-backs means Jordan Henderson is pushed back into defence. In the James Milner role. Milner is suspended after being sent off against Crystal Palace, so Georginio Wijnaldum comes in, while Xherdan Shaqiri replaces Fabinho.Claude Puel makes three changes after Leicester’s 4-3 defeat to Wolves. Out go Danny Simpson, Wes Morgan and Harvey Barnes. In come Jonny Evans, Marc Albrighton and Demarai Gray.First Roy Hodgson, now Rafa Benitez at this rate Liverpool will have the title sewn up in no time at all if they can persuade Manchester City’s next few opponents to hire Gerard Houllier, Roy Evans and Graeme Souness. All it takes, it seems, to turn the race into a procession is for former Liverpool managers to stand in Pep Guardiola’s way and come to Jurgen Klopp’s aid. Hodgson’s Crystal Palace managed it last month and Benitez did his old side a huge favour last night, with Newcastle’s shock win over City opening the door for Liverpool to establish a seven-point lead over the champions. All hail Rafa! Still a Kopite after all those years.Presumably the locals be singing the Spaniard’s name lustily at Anfield this evening. After all, what an opportunity this is for Liverpool. They still have 15 games left and know there’s plenty of football to play – but a seven-point lead over City as they head into February is the stuff of dreams for a team who have only lost once in 23 matches. If they can handle Leicester tonight, they’ll be entitled to think that 29-year itch is going to be scratched in May.Mind you, the question is whether they can keep a lid on all that bubbling emotion. We’ve been here before with Liverpool. We’ve seen what can happen. We know Klopp shouldn’t go asking Brendan Rodgers for any tips on keeping the pitch nice and slick. Instead Liverpool’s task here is not to get too far ahead of themselves they need to maintain the calm, cold and ruthless mentality that has taken them this far, not to mention keep in mind that Leicester are a very good counterattacking side who have already beaten Chelsea and City this season.

Only a very close offside decision denies the Spaniard the chance to hilariously fluff yet another one-on-one!At Wembley, Llorente plays a fine 40-yard left-footed through-ball to Vertonghen, steaming unchecked into the Watford half, but Foster comes out of his area well to boot clear!At Liverpool, Maddison misses a fabulous chance to equalise for Leicester with a free header after an Allison error!Palace take the lead at Southampton! Townsend is absolutely taken out on the edge of the area as he plays the ball to his left to Zaha but the referee waves play on and Zaha slams a low shot inside the near post!Chelsea run down the other end, and within 30 seconds of that Brooks shot Azpilicueta unleashes a 20-yard curler that’s well saved.At Bournemouth Brooks runs from his own half and, without a hint of a challenge, gets within 20 yards of goal before spearing a shot at goal that’s well struck but easily saved.At Nantes, the match was stopped for in the ninth minute to allow for a minute’s applause for Smiliano Sala.Kepa has a save to make on the south coast, saving from a Brooks header after King’s flick-on.Watford started their game very well, but Spurs have taken control and are regularly threatening the Watford goal. A long ball is taken down well by Llorente, nudged on by Eriksen and fractionally overrun by Son, allowing Foster to claim.At Wembley, Vertonghen crosses from the left and the ball drops to Eriksen at the edge of the area, whose deflected shot is smartly saved by Foster.Chelsea attack down the right again, but Azpilicueta’s lovely low cross rumbles across the edge of the six-yard box without anyone anywhere near to putting it away.At Wembley, Son gets the ball, runs from left to right across the area, spins, heads back the other way and then curls a shot with his left foot that spins just wide of the far post!The snow on the turf at Anfield does seem to be getting in the way of things. Players are slipping a bit, and the ball is being held up on the surface. I don’t know what’s up with the undersoil heating, but it needs to be on full blast.Liverpool come close to a second! Firmino chests the ball down to the left of goal and shoots towards the far post, but it’s well saved! From the corner Mané has a free header, but it flies well wide of goal.Oooh! At Wembley a lovely cross from Janmaat on the right looks perfect for Deeney, but Alderweireld just gets the top of his head to it first and it flies away to safety.The league leaders take the lead! Like City yesterday, Liverpool grab an early goal. Mané has the ball outside the area, passes to his left and runs into the box. The ball is passed inside, backheeled into his path, and Mané clips a shot across goal and in!All four games are now under way. Anfield is looking particularly frosty this evening.Hazard has a pop at goal, from about 20 yards after zigging this way and that for a while, but it’s a straightforward save.The players are out at Wembley, with kick-off about four minutes away. At Anfield they’re gathering in the tunnel and about to take the field.Chelsea hit the bar at Bournemouth! They move the ball from left to right, Pedro puts in the cross and Kovacic’s ing header sends the ball into the woodwork, with the keeper nowhere!Two of our Premier League matches have kicked off! No goals yet, mind.Jürgen Klopp says he did not watch Manchester City’s defeat to Newcastle yesterday, preferring instead a night on the sofa with his wife.We watched a movie, and when the final whistle in Newcastle happened my smartphone was like, buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz. I don’t celebrate something that’s nothing to do with me. There’s nothing that can distract us or cause us problems concentration-wise if we don’t let it happen. The only problem is having to talk to people like you who always ask us about things that do not interest us.So much for Callum Wilson having a late fitness test – turns out he’s had surgery. Tuesday: Maurizio Sarri says Callum Hudson-Odoi should be loyal to Chelsea. “I think he’ll be the future of our club. He will be the future of English football.” Wednesday: Does not name Hudson-Odoi in his squad to play Bournemouth.“Sarri showing Hudson-Odoi exactly what he thinks about being pressured into giving young Callum more gametime,” writes Felix Wood. “It’s the reserves for you for the rest of the season, son!”Roy Hodgson talks about Southampton:Often when a team gets a new manager of course it makes a difference. At the moment they’re playing with much more aggression, their pressurising is good, they’re getting players forward when they need to. At the moment you’ve got to say they pose a big threat. They beat us earlier in the season so we know they’re a very capable team, a team we can lose to. It’s a question of seeing how the game pans out. We respect all our opponents and we certainly respect our opponents today.Meanwhile in Nantes, fans are arriving at the Stade de la Beaujoire ahead of tonight’s game, with a giant image of Emiliano Sala filling the centre circle.“We’re out of the Coppa Italia,” say Roma. And how – they’ve lost 7-1 to Fiorentina.This chap, meanwhile, comes straight back into the Spurs team and seems quite happy about it.So Liverpool make two changes from their last game, against Crystal Palace: Xherdan Shaqiri and Georginio Wijnaldum are in, James Milner and Fabinho are out.And finally the news from Anfield:More team news, this time from Wembley:Meanwhile in France, Nantes are playing Saint-Etienne, the game postponed from last weekend after Emiliano Sala’s plane went missing and their first since his disappearance.

We have a separate liveblog focusing entirely on Liverpool v Leicester, though that won’t stop me keeping a beady eye on it as well. So let’s see what we’ve got to look forward to, shall we?Gonzalo Higuain is expected to make his league debut for Chelsea tonight after his recent transfer from Juventus. Callum Wilson, another striker who has been linked with Chelsea in this transfer window, is doubtful with a knee injury. “Callum’s going to be a doubt for the game,” said Eddie Howe. “It’s a knee problem, but we are going to wait and see. We are going to give him all the time he needs to try and get fit for this game.” Liverpool would go seven points clear at the top of the table if they win, but will beware Jamie Vardy, who has scored in his last five games against them. “Jamie is a fantastic striker. It’s quality, the speed he has, the finishing skills he has,” says Jurgen Klopp. “He’s a massive threat and he always was, but a few times we made it pretty easy for him. We expect a very dangerous opponent. They have quality, it’s a super team.” Claude Puel meanwhile has been eulogising about Virgil van Dijk. “He is now a modern defender at a very high level,” says the Frenchman. “At Liverpool, he has took another dimension. He is a fantastic player. My feeling about him doesn’t change with Liverpool. He is strong, powerful, fast, technical, he can play under pressure without a problem. It is fantastic. At Southampton he was the best defender in the world, but he confirmed it I think with Liverpool.” Southampton and Crystal Palace are level on 22 points, with the latter ahead on goal difference and only the bottom three below them, which makes this a hugely important game for both sides. “It is too early to talk about six-pointer games,” says Roy Hodgson, whose Palace team will be out to avenge their 2-0 home defeat to the Saints in September. “There are still 15 matches left to play, and that’s an awful lot of football. There are 45 points left to play for, and normally 37 or 38 points keep you in the league.” Ralph Hasenhuttl meanwhile is a big Crystal Palace fan: “Roy Hodgson is a very good manager with a clear plan,” he said. “It’s tactically a very interesting game, against a very well-organised well-balanced team. So we need very good solutions with and without the ball, we had a lot of things to show the players. We’ve had a good mixture of physically intense work on the pitch and good mind-work. Hopefully you’ll see on Wednesday that we are prepared in the right moments.”“It’s a good chance to show what we are able to do and try to show our improvements,” says Javi Gracia, whose Watford side beat Spurs 2-1 at home back in early September. “Always it’s difficult to play against Tottenham because they are a good team and they have good options. I know they have injured players, but after losing their chances in the FA Cup and Carabao Cup, they will be very, very focused on their next game.” Spurs are without Harry Kane and Dele Alli but Son Heung-min could be back, following South Korea’s elimination from the Asian Cup. “We’re going to decide if he will play from the beginning or the bench but I am very optimistic because he showed very good energy in the training session.” says Mauricio Pochettino."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02df984548ec31b45276e8e8bb8022947124d441/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=baf9a3905f596647b735f2214e61b3ea","title":"penny mordaunt criticised over call for aid to come from private sector","story":"International development secretary says she wants DfID to become more a fundraising than a spending departmentPenny Mordaunt has been criticised by charities and MPs for suggesting the government’s international development spending should become more reliant on private sector investment and philanthropy.The international development secretary told cabinet ministers she would aim for her department to become a fundraising department rather than a spending department, telling them it was unsustainable to continue to meet the spending target with taxpayer cash.The cabinet minister has begun a series of meetings with charities and investors about how £14.1bn of aid spending could become less reliant on public funds.In a presentation ahead of the spending review later this year, Mordaunt also repeated that she wanted DfID’s spending to be more aligned with the UK national security strategy, essentially meaning closer alignment between defence and counter-terrorism spending and international aid, a Whitehall source said.The OECD’s development assistance committee sets strict guidelines for how aid money can be spent.Mordaunt has also suggested that rules should be reformed to include millions of pounds spent through DfID’s profit-making investment arm, CDC Group.DfID sources characterised the proposals as simply a new way of thinking about funding, rather than threatening the target.Downing Street said it remained committed to the target. “The commitment which we have to foreign aid is set down in statute,” a No 10 spokesman said.“It remains unchanged, there are no plans to change it. The secretary of state has discussed publicly that she is looking at the aid process and making sure the money from taxpayers is being used in the most efficient way and gets the greatest contribution.”Dan Carden, the shadow international development secretary, said it was a cynical attempt to undermine the target. “Suggesting that poverty be turned in to a profitable business opportunity will do nothing to tackle the root causes of poverty or inequality,” he said.“It will simply enable the rich to get richer and exacerbate inequalities. Under a Labour government the UK’s overseas development programme will focus on tackling the root causes of both poverty and inequality.”Tory MP Anna Soubry tweeted her disapproval. “First Brexit now foreign aid. Not so slowly the Conservative party moves to the right,” she said.Christian Aid said Mordaunt’s comments would cause “further uncertainty for the world’s poorest”, and said the UK should celebrate its commitment to aid.Christine Allen, Christian Aid’s policy director, said: “Far from being unsustainable, the world urgently needs greater aid and investment to end poverty, build peace and tackle climate change. Asking others to foot the bill is backtracking and would be a betrayal.”The subject was also raised in the Lords on Wednesday by Labour’s international development spokesman Ray Collins, the party’s former general secretary.The government’s spokesman Michael Bates said the aid budget was “fully funded and we have firm plans in place to continue to meet that important commitment”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b34dc34165c231284abeacec142013efbc38b2c/0_3382_5792_3475/master/5792.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9011cede453f0ce4b2605372740e63b4","title":"young or old tell us about the major life events that shaped you","story":"We would like to hear from you as part of a project introducing readers of different generations to one anotherAs part of a new project that aims to explore major life events from different perspectives and across generational ides, the ’s Weekend magazine is looking to hear from readers.If one of the following questions apply to you, we’d like to hear from you.

Time may be at a premium to find a Brexit deal but MPs from all sides needed a little “me time”. A safe space to chill out. After their exertions the previous day, they were all a little dazed. Shellshocked even. Surprised at their ability to have reached a decision. Albeit one that had largely involved not making a decision. The cameras, the lights, the action had been all too much. A lie down was called for.On days like this, politicians often default to greater self-regard than usual. Parliament has spoken, they say grandiosely. And they have listened. Only they have all invariably heard something different and come to radically different conclusions. Some could have sworn they had voted to declare war on Jerry again. A handful were under the impression they had said they didn’t want a no deal but not enough to do anything about it. Most were just stunned – STUNNED – to discover they did have principles after all. Though not necessarily the principles they’d had the day before. A day is a long time in politics.Even Theresa May appeared to have undergone her own learning journey. In the past few years she has tried a number of different roles. The badly programmed Maybot incapable of coherent thought. The hopeless, dim-witted fall guy in a Channel 5 sitcom. But for this prime minister’s questions she appeared to have stepped up a gear. It wasn’t enough that the UK had turned into an international laughing stock. She had to go out and really own the shitshow. Make it hers and hers alone by stamping her lack of authority all over it. Only she could reconfigure a heavy defeat for her own deal as a massive victory.Jeremy Corbyn appeared rather less comatose – there was at least a pulse now – than he had in Tuesday’s debate and immediately put May on the back foot by asking what alternative arrangements she had in mind to replace the Northern Ireland backstop. You’d have thought the prime minister might have expected this question – after all, it was one her own Brexit secretary had failed to answer five times on the radio that morning – but she appeared to be completely wrongfooted.“Um ... We are engaging positively in a lot of things,” she mumbled. Not that any immediately came to mind, other than a trusted trader scheme – an idea so brainless that even David Davis had given up on it – and there were some exciting technologies in development involving badgers and night-vision goggles. May paused. It wasn’t always easy knowing what it was you didn’t know.Sensing the exchanges weren’t landing quite as well as she had hoped, she started digging herself in deeper. Under stress, she can’t help herself. The reason the UK was in its current mess was because of the EU’s insistence on maintaining a withdrawal agreement that she had negotiated and signed up to and though parliament may not want a no deal she was quite relaxed about delivering one if the worst came to the worst. Taking back control meant ignoring the will of parliament. A few members of the European Research Group grunted appreciatively but for the most part she was heard in near silence.After winding to a close by saying she had no intention of listening to the Labour leader’s proposals to remain in a customs union, May signed off by saying how much she was looking forward to meeting Corbyn later in the afternoon. The contempt in her voice was unmistakeable. As was the hostility in Corbyn’s body language.It is a match made in therapy and there is a worrying possibility that the future of the country might just depend on the ability of the Four Pot Plants to act as mediators for two social and political inadequates. “Now start by saying hello, Theresa, and offering Jeremy a biscuit. And Jeremy, you say thank you. Well done. That’s very good. Now stop hunching your shoulders and try to maintain eye contact with one another while you’re pretending to talk about a customs union. We’re not here to apportion blame.“That’s excellent. You’ve both done very well. Even though neither of you can really articulate exactly what you want. Now why don’t you spend the rest of the hour watching Jean-Claude Juncker and Guy Verhofstadt on TV explaining to the European parliament why they aren’t going to reopen the withdrawal agreement.”It would have been no more unlikely than the rest of PMQs at which May first defended her record on racism by citing her hostile environment as home secretary and closed with Nigel Dodds insisting that the Democratic Unionist party was the moderate voice of Northern Ireland. This from a party that boasts of never blinking in negotiations as it has cut off its own eyelids. The few MPs who were still in the chamber took note. That was one way of making sure they stayed awake."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e741cb50e50e2a46f76e92fe384549376f5d2578/0_252_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bd9b055ed64c91886762a6a66d13631","title":"collective insanity readers on the brexit amendment vote","story":"You have been reacting to MPs passing an amendment to replace the Irish backstop and discussing what might be next for BrexitWell, thanks, politicians.

That’ll be the warm up act to destabilisation of the EU and God knows what after. The arms dealers must be rubbing their hands with glee. And we all are collateral damage, at best. I loathe politicians. tlswimmerWe are witnessing a government that is intellectually and morally bankrupt. The PM flies to Brussels on a completely pointless trip, to speak to people who do not want to talk to her, because she has to be seen to be doing something. The government uses dubious tactics to fend off legitimate challenges, the Labour opposition proves once again just how impotent it is, and the Tory press tout it as a triumph for the government. What we are seeing is no more than the twitching of a corpse. Terry PotterWatching this yesterday, it appears that, with a number of notable and honourable exceptions, our MPs have joined in a form of collective insanity, earnestly discussing the number, size and temperament of the unicorns Treeza must bring back from Brussels, all the while ignoring the detailed report that declares the whole of the European continent to be a unicorn-free zone. It must be clear to almost everybody that ‘alternative arrangements’ on the backstop roughly translates as ‘we’ll blag it and hope no-one notices’, which may be OK in Westminster but could lead to violence in NI and Ireland. MrCosmopoliteTo the extent that I’m British I can only feel ashamed at the arrogance and stupidity of this country. To the extent that I’m not, I can only feel angry about my decision to live here and commit money and effort to the place. The sooner I can get out the better, but as it is for business, so it is with families: the costs and losses involved in doing so are considerable. LastNameOnTheShelfSo parla-la-la-iament has voted for the latest fantasy to avoid the Tory Party from splitting. May has another two weeks being PM. Jacob Rees Mogg is another two weeks nearer his dream of a no-deal Brexit so he and his other hedge fund friends can make themselves richer unfettered by any EU directives. And vote-leavers can live happily ever after, even if they are poorer. Us remainers have been ignored again and if, as expected, the EU refuse to reopen negotiations then the blue press will have the headline they always wanted - that it is all the EU’s fault. It looks like we will be forced to go it alone before we can see who is right or wrong. TheDudleyOmmerPlease - going back to Brussels is nonsense. Labour in opposition totally outmanoeuvred in the political playground by the current prime minister. Corbyn is dust, Labour finished. Theresa May won’t stand for re-election and so it will go on post no-deal Brexit. Spencer Leonard WainThe Tories only squeaked a very narrow majority for a switch to the right by imposing a three-line whip on the party, meaning that any minister or junior minister who voted for Cooper-Bowles or against Brady would lose their government job - and any backbench Tory MP who did so would leave themselves open to deselection by their constituency party, egged on by Tory Central Office. The real battle will be when May comes back to the House on 14 February with whatever limp ‘alternative arrangements’, if any, she has been able to cobble together. If the nutters in the European Research Group won’t buy it, the Tory Remainers may have one last chance to demonstrate that they do actually have a backbone - if indeed they do. cripes2How is it possible that Corbyn comes out the bigger loser from last night’s latest episode of the Brexit farce? It surely requires a leader of exceptional ineffectiveness to have presided over last night’s debacle. The Labour party’s role has been absolutely woeful throughout Brexit, right from its failure to campaign strongly for remain in 2016. NowThatYouAskThe serious miscalculation here is that Britain hasn’t recognised the cost to the EU of the single market losing its integrity. In the eyes of the EU, having a blurry border in Ireland sets a precedent that makes their other external borders impossible to defend. This poses a greater cost and a greater risk to the whole of the EU than does a no-deal Brexit and for this reason they will not move. London has miscalculated. stuart255The UK signed up to the Good Friday Agreement after years of hard work to bring about and sustain peace in Northern Ireland and Ireland. Yesterday we saw parliament vote to refuse to accept May’s deal with the EU if we don’t have the right to renege on the GFA, which apparently parliament wishes to do, otherwise why kick up such a monster fuss over something we don’t want to do. So, parliament wants to scrap the GFA so we can make some trade deals. Can we sink any lower?

Sources said she had told the Labour leader that the UK must be free to sign its own trade deals.The party leaders met for 45 minutes at the prime minister’s office in the House of Commons on Wednesday afternoon.Labour has been stung by criticism that Corbyn had refused to engage with May over Brexit – and the opposition party was keen to meet the prime minister after the Commons voted in principle against leaving the EU without a deal on Tuesday night.Previously Corbyn had refused to meet May because she would not rule out leaving without a deal. But he changed his position after MPs voted in favour of an amendment from Conservative backbencher Caroline Spelman, inviting parliament to declare its opposition to a no-deal scenario.The Labour spokesman said May was “interested in exploring the details of each element” of Labour’s Brexit proposals, which also include a strong single-market relationship and greater protection for workers’ rights.Downing Street said the conversation about the customs union amounted to a longer version of the exchange between Corbyn and May on the floor of the Commons during the Brexit debate on Tuesday.May had asked Corbyn: “Will he now tell the house whether he means accepting the common commercial policy, accepting the common external tariffs, accepting the Union customs code … and accepting the EU’s state aid rules?”In reply Corbyn had said a customs union “would be designed to ensure that our jobs and investment are protected, that there is frictionless and seamless trade with the European Union, and that we have a say in future trade arrangements”.The two party leaders will meet again soon, most likely within days, although there are considerable reservations on both sides as to whether it would be possible to complete a cross-party Brexit deal.Earlier, it emerged that May has asked cabinet ministers Stephen Barclay and Greg Clark to consult Labour MPs and trade unions over proposals to introduce greater protections for workers’ rights in another attempt to woo the opposition.The Brexit secretary and the business secretary will meet unions and Labour members over the next couple of days to discuss the possibility of future legislation, which would also cover enhanced environmental protections.At a lunchtime briefing, Downing Street advisers pointed to remarks made by the prime minister during Tuesday’s Brexit debate, where she said: “The government will not allow the UK leaving the EU to result in any lowering of standards in relation to employment, ​environmental protection or health and safety.”May also told the Commons she wanted parliament to be able to “consider any measure approved by EU institutions that strengthens any of those protections” after Brexit in a calculated bid to win over some Labour MPs.The plans were also expected to be discussed at the afternoon meeting between May and Corbyn – although the Labour leadership is highly sceptical as to whether her comments will satisfy key trade unions.Downing Street nevertheless hopes to persuade a handful of pro-Brexit Labour MPs to support any final deal that May brings back to parliament, partly because it needs to offset a group of diehard Conservative MPs who will not vote for any deal with the EU.The MPs No 10 will hope to target include the 24 who rebelled against the party whip either by voting against or abstaining on Yvette Cooper’s amendment that aimed to delay article 50 to buy time to prevent a no-deal Brexit.Fourteen MPs voted against Cooper, including the former minister Caroline Flint and Laura Smith, the MP for Crewe and Nantwich, as well as veteran Eurosceptics Kate Hoey, Graham Stringer and Dennis Skinner.A further 10 MPs abstained including the junior shadow ministers Gloria De Piero and Melanie Onn, as well as Tracy Brabin, Judith Cummins, Yvonne Fovargue, Mike Kane, Emma Lewell-Buck, Jim McMahon, Ruth Smeeth and John Spellar.Anti-Brexit MPs expressed disappointment at the size of the rebellion, saying it had strengthened the prime minister’s hand in showing that there was not a united front opposed to her. “What’s the point of Tories coming across if we can’t keep our side together?” one MP asked.Labour indicated there would be little meaningful sanction against those who defied the party whip on Cooper on Tuesday night. A party spokesman said they would be “spoken to by the whips’ office in the next few days”.The spokesman added that Corbyn would press May to consider supporting a customs union with the EU as a way to deal with the Irish backstop that is so unpopular on the Tory right.He added that the Labour leader “had no confidence” in the idea that the prime minister could otherwise secure any concessions from EU member states over the next fortnight in terms of eliminating the backstop from the draft withdrawal agreement, that covers the UK’s exit from the EU.• This article was amended on 30 January 2018 as it wrongly said Stephen Twigg abstained.

He worked with the pro-Brexit thinktank the Legatum Institute before being brought into government.The prime minister met Corbyn on Wednesday afternoon, after which the two sides disagreed about whether the prime minister was willing to soften her opposition to a customs union.A spokesman for the Labour leader said shortly after the meeting broke up that the prime minister had shown a “serious engagement in the detail” of Corbyn’s proposal for a customs union with the European Union after Brexit.A few minutes later, Downing Street responded by saying that while May had asked Corbyn questions, her underlying position had not shifted.The party leaders met for 45 minutes at the prime minister’s office on Wednesday afternoon in the House of Commons for a meeting that was described as “serious and engaged” by Labour. The Labour spokesman added that May was “interested in exploring the details of each element” of Labour’s Brexit proposals.The two party leaders will meet again soon, most likely within days. Corbyn made an offer to May at last year’s party conference that Labour could swing behind her deal if she backed a customs union, and offered fresh reassurances on workers’ rights and environmental standards.May has repeatedly insisted the UK must be able to strike its own trade deals, which would rule out joining a customs union — but many in Westminster still believe she could ultimately be pushed in that direction.Some Tory Brexiters have even hinted they might be willing to swallow the idea of a customs union if the controversial backstop was struck out of the legally binding withdrawal agreement. “Can we get up and leave this thing one day, if we want to?” asked one senior Leaver. “Is our destiny in our hands?”Other Brexiters are urging their restive colleagues to be patient, however, and give May the space to negotiate. Former Brexit secretary David Davis said it was unlikely that May would make significant progress before 13 February, when she has promised to report back to parliament. “I would not expect the Europeans to start moving seriously until March – until the exit day is absolutely imminent. That’s just based on their past behaviour,” Davis said.Meanwhile, a leaked memo from industry minister Richard Harrington, obtained by Sky News, poured cold water on proposals drawn up by Nicky Morgan and Jacob Rees-Mogg, among others, to resolve the Brexit impasse.On the idea of technological solutions to avoid a hard border, his note said: “This idea was considered and rejected by both the UK and the EU in summer 2018, as both parties concluded that it would not maintain an open border. That is why we ended up with the current backstop. There is currently no border in the world, outside a customs union, that has eliminated border infrastructure.”Harrington has issued a series of increasingly dire public warnings about the risks of a no-deal Brexit in recent days, even going as far as to say that he was prepared to be sacked for doing so.Brexit select committee chair Hilary Benn also questioned May’s plans on Wednesday, describing her remarks in the Commons as “a rerun of last summer, when the cabinet discussed technology, trusted traders and the maximum facilitation proposal as a way of solving the NI border problem” – all of which were then rejected by the EU. He warned that May appeared to have “decided to go through the same process all over again for reasons of party management rather than in the national interest”.Downing Street later dismissed remarks from European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker suggesting that Tuesday’s cross-cutting series of votes had made a “disorderly” Brexit more likely.“What the vote has done is set out what parliament requires in order to pass this deal, so we now have clarity. The EU has said that it was seeking clarity,” a spokesman said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b33f5e9984ad844247619e0e63897dad9afe4b8/0_90_5104_3063/master/5104.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03041aa7dce738dd1964f4a94c2dad38","title":"brexit theresa may given two weeks to renegotiate irish backstop politics live","story":"As Theresa May girds herself for renewed talks with the EU about changing the Irish backstop, follow all the news and reaction with our live blog The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has told French radio he remains confident that “common interest” shall prevail and a deal will be secured with the UK within two months.However, he refused to reopen negotiations on the withdrawal agreement.In an interview he said the two-year orce negotiations had looked for an alternative to the “Irish backstop” which was designed to ensure that the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland remained free of border posts. “No one, on either side, was able to say what arrangement would be needed to ensure controls on goods, animals and merchandise without having a border,” Barnier said. “We have neither the time, nor the technologies.” He insisted on Wednesday that the remaining 27 EU members were united and determined not to abandon the backstop clause they believe is key to maintaining peace on the border.Earlier, Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney said it was “an extraordinary situation when a prime minister and a government negotiates a deal and then goes back and during the ratification process votes against their own deal”.“That’s like saying in a negotiation, ‘Well either you give me what I want or I’m jumping out of the window’,” he told RTE radio.Labour grandee Alastair Campbell asks whether it is time for MPs to force the Cabinet to choose which Brexit they would like, as the former prime minister Tony Blair criticises May’s deal.Welsh Assembly members have voted for work to begin on preparing for another vote on EU membership if the UK cannot participate in the single market after Brexit, “as it now seems”, although they stopped short of calling for an immediate second referendum.The call comes after First Minister Mark Drakeford met Theresa May at Downing Street today in what was the first of regular weekly meetings between the UK government and devolved Welsh and Scottish governments.After the meeting, Drakeford said he told the prime minister that a no deal Brexit should not be an option and the UK government should look to extend the Article 50 deadline, something that the Welsh Government and Plaid Cymru motion urged in order to avoid no-deal.The assembly agreed: “If, as it now seems, the UK Parliament cannot unite around an alternative proposition which includes participation in the single market and a customs union then the only option which remains is to give the decision back to the people and believes that work should begin immediately on preparing for a public vote.”Plaid Cymru leader, Adam Price, told ITV that allowing the people to decide the way forward is the “only way to solve the Brexit deadlock.”“People are fed up with seeing politicians acting in such an unedifying way during a time of real crisis, which is why Plaid Cymru decided to approach the Labour Welsh Government to offer to work together on a solution that is in Wales’ national interest,” he said.“While Westminster serves up nothing but chaos, our parliament here in Wales is coming together to find real solutions that can move politics forward from its current point of toxic stasis.”ITV’s Robert Peston says shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer’s absence from the meeting between Corbyn and May today was a signal of the Labour leader’s “own clear preference to avoid another referendum”.“In the battle over whether Labour should ever back a Brexit referendum or People’s Vote, Murphy and Milne are implacably opposed, and Starmer is battling to keep that option alive,” he wrote on Facebook.“So it matters that in choosing to explain what kind of Brexit deal Labour would support, Corbyn was accompanied by the two influential aides who are convinced that Labour should deliver Brexit and not ask the views of the people again.“Even more striking is that those close to Labour’s leader tell me they can indeed envisage a moment in the coming weeks when it will be official Labour policy to vote for a Brexit plan,” he added.“Those at the top of Labour, and in the grassroots, who want a referendum should fear they are being properly outmanoeuvred.”However, my colleague Jessica Elgot says conclusions should not be drawn from Starmer’s absence, since the Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay was not at the meeting either.Conor McGinn, a Labour MP, has called on the government to stand by the Good Friday agreement as he expressed his disappointment with Jeremy Corbyn’s remarks about the backstop.The prime minister Theresa May has now tweeted about her meeting with Jeremy Corbyn, reiterating that a failure to vote for her deal would amount to a vote for no deal.Earlier, May spoke over the phone with Irish premier Leo Varadkar to discuss the outcome of Tuesday’s Commons vote. In a statement, the Irish government said: “The Taoiseach set out once again the unchanged Irish and EU position on the Withdrawal Agreement and the backstop, noting that the latest developments had reinforced the need for a backstop which is legally robust and workable in practice. “The Prime Minister indicated that further consultations are taking place in London .. They agreed to stay in touch over the coming period.”Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, has tweeted:It comes after MPs voted last night for an amendment to pass the Brexit deal bill if Theresa May can secure changes to the Irish backstop.The prime minister said she would return to the Commons so that a revised deal – if she can get one – could be voted on by 13 February, but the EU immediately said the backstop was ‘not open for renegotiation’.We now have more from Jeremy Corbyn’s interview with the BBC following his meeting with Theresa May today.The Labour leader said he is “suspicious” that May is trying to “run down the clock” on Brexit.He warned: “The whole process looks like it’s running down the clock by saying well it’s either the problems and the difficulties of no deal or support a deal that’s already been rejected by the House of Commons.“I’m suspicious that there is a programme of running down the clock here.” The DUP’s Brexit spokesman has been criticised for saying people should “go to the chippy” in the event of a no-deal Brexit leading to food shortages at supermarkets.DUP MP Sammy Wilson made the throw-away remark in the Commons earlier today after the SNP’s Ian Blackford cited a warning from the British Retail Consortium that there is potential for food shortages, after the main supermarkets voiced fears this week.As Blackford told MPs: “Just dwell on this, Sainsbury’s, Asda, Marks \u0026amp Spencer, the Co-op, Waitrose, Costcutter all warning of not being able to have sufficient supplies, of shelves lying empty,” the East Antrim MP shouted: “go to the chippy!”Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery told HuffPost UK: “This outrageous comment highlights quite vividly how many Parliamentarians are woefully out of touch and insulting many poor and vulnerable people is not the answer.“Instead of the DUP filling their political coffers with central government finances and propping up a zombie government, they should focus their attentions on how to better the lives of people who are suffering out their in the real world, many who reside in his constituency.” Green MP Caroline Lucas said on Twitter:Here is a video of European Parliament Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt’s impassioned speech earlier today.Jeremy Corbyn says he discussed “various issues surrounding the problems of the back stop” in his meeting with Theresa May this afternoon and that the prime minister will speak with the EU about these concerns. During the 45-minute conversation, the Labour leader told May that under her proposals the UK would enter into a treaty arrangement without the right to leave it for the first time in the country’s history. “I have a problem where we go into an agreement which is one sided, I want an agreement which is mutual,” he said.“The last words I said to her were ‘don’t bring no deal back to Parliament’ because it’s not acceptable, it’s not a sensible or serious way of going forward.”He added that he would like a “comprehensive customs union” with the EU, with a say in how those trade agreements are made. That’s all from me for today.My colleague Mattha Busby is now taking over.Here is the BBC’s Nick Robinson with his analysis of what’s going on.Listening to the European parliament debate, it was striking how keen MEPs were to see political leaders in London come together and reach a consensus on the way forward.The ’s Christopher Hope has a line from Number 10 with their take on the MayCorbyn meeting.This is from Sky’s Lewis Goodall on the MayCorbyn talks.And these are from Goodall on what Jeremy Corbyn told him about what happened.This is from Stefan Rousseau, the Press Association’s chief political photographer.This is from my Observer colleague Michael Savage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/599b56d653792c8fbc510c88b502dfb0c9262b5e/0_479_2836_1701/master/2836.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6c604a0a4ae73f35c157098393d19f9","title":"grand national horse racing ireland entries no deal brexit","story":"The looming possibility of a no-deal Brexit on 29 March has not deterred Ireland’s trainers from making a record entry of 47 horses for the Grand National at Aintree in April, which is due to be run just eight days after the UK is due to leave the European Union. The entry from Ireland is up from 40 last year, when 16 of the eventual 38 runners were Irish-trained, including the first four home.A no-deal Brexit could pose significant logistical problems for horses travelling from Ireland, however, as it would remove the current certainty of frictionless travel across borders. Predictions of tailbacks at ferry ports would inevitably prompt fears of welfare issues for thoroughbreds moving to and from Britain for racing, breeding or the sales, not least as the majority of horses moving from Ireland to the UK do so by ferry.The number of Irish-trained runners in Great Britain has risen steadily in recent years, from just over 1,100 in 2014 to 1,504 in 2018. Ireland sent 50 runners to last season’s three-day Aintree Festival meeting, up from 40 in 2017, and 150 to the Cheltenham Festival in March, from where 17 returned home as winners.The rise in the number of Irish-trained runners in the UK reflects racing’s enduring popularity in a country where the number of inidual owners and horses in training continued to rise in 2018. The ease of movement between the two countries has also helped to facilitate the Irish challenge at all levels in Britain, however, and any threat to the status quo is a major concern for racing executives on both sides of the Irish Sea.“Whether that’s a horse travelling to and from Britain for a race or a sale, it will cause disruption and delay.”Aintree itself, however, remains optimistic that its showpiece event will not suffer in the fallout from even a no-deal Brexit.“We recognise the huge amount of uncertainty surrounding Brexit right now,” a spokesperson for the track said, “but the government has issued clear guidance that the import of thoroughbreds from the EU into the UK will not be impacted even in a no-deal Brexit scenario as the UK will replicate current systems."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d601056cd0f3c3cc1f8703b3ac4eaf803bbd819c/405_0_3304_1982/master/3304.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=041dc54298aac43534a1d3145c78aa9c","title":"ireland women ready to tackle englands professionals in six nations","story":"Ireland women’s team will not be overawed by England when they face them in their Six Nations opener in Dublin on Friday, coach Adam Griggs has said.England, who won seven successive Six Nations titles from 2006, gave 28 players contracts this month but Griggs said his players cannot be worried about the disparity and must be ready for the challenge. “In terms of the professionalism, the England squad have always had that depth anyway,” Griggs told reporters. “There’s no bigger challenge than to open the Six Nations against England, they are second in the world for a reason and are a very good side who challenge you in every part of the game.” Ireland finished behind champions France and England in the 2018 Women’s Six Nations Championship and Griggs will rely on captain Ciara Griffin, supported by Sene Naoupu and Claire Molloy, as they look to improve on their third-place finish. “We had a good test against them in November and, while we didn’t get the result, we showed some of the standards and improvements that are required to compete at this level, which was a huge positive for us,” he said.Experienced winger Alison Miller, who broke her leg in last year’s Championship, has been named among the substitutes.For England, Amy Cokayne returns having missed games last autumn due to her RAF commitments.

He was laid off recently along with his entire department in quality control, many of whom were also long-time employees. “I have no idea how they expect to run without us,” said Ochoa.Ochoa predicts Tesla’s “difficult road” will not be helped by laying off experienced staff.He said: “My last repair on Friday was finding a rear fascia was missing a screw so if you pulled on it, it would pop out. I grabbed a drill, the screw, got down on my knees and made the repair myself. No one would have known about it unless they tugged on the edges of the rear fascia like I had made it a habit to do.“But I know once the car starts driving it would become unseated due to the wind pulling it out.”An internal document provided to laid-off employees explained those who were dismissed were selected “by evaluating the criticality of each position, identifying duplicate roles, and by assessing the specific skills and abilities of each inidual in the company”.Workers past and present believe Tesla is trying to cut costs by getting rid of more expensive, and experienced, staff. The company disputes this.Tesla has a one through five pay ranking system for employees. Five represents the most senior.Anthony Lamendola worked at the Lathrop facility, also in California, for nearly seven years before being laid off.Lamendola, who was also level five, said: “They let all the people go who have been there level rive or more, all level fours and threes, only kept one, two, some threes. I’ve never been late, never called in, never been wrote up in over six years. I’m just am in shock for them to do this and keep temps and new hires.”A current Tesla employee at Lathrop who requested anonymity for fear of losing their job, noted temporary employees and recent hires were kept on, while many long-time employees were laid off as part of the cuts. “This was a move I was expecting due to the high price of raw metal from our president’s tariff war with China,” the worker said. “Tesla Lathrop has a large amount of people that wanted to go union.”Back at the Fremont plant, a current employee who has worked for over four years at the plant was transferred to work on car seats as part of restructuring. He noted many transferred employees took hourly pay cuts, and a few walked off the job as a result.“It seems like they tried to get rid of the older, more experienced guys making more money than the entry level. I personally see and feel this is aimed at the higher-waged employees,” the employee said. “They replaced me with a $19 an hour worker. I make $26 an hour.” He was told his transfer would be a lateral move and wouldn’t include a pay cut, but he’s still wary that his pay will be reduced from changing departments.“I loved Tesla at one point. But four and a half years of living what I lived through, I don’t feel the love, what a good, dedicated employee should feel from a company.”Another employee at the Fremont plant noted that dozens of newly hired workers started training the week after the mass layoff, and that there was also an elimination of overtime. “You get in trouble with one minute of overtime, which is counter-productive because you have people wrapping up earlier than they normally would so they don’t risk going over,’ the worker said.A Tesla spokesperson said: “We are continuing to hire for essential positions.” The company denied senior and high-waged employees were targeted in the layoff.The cuts have been severe. A third employee at the Fremont plant explained his department was cut in half, with the employees who survived this round of layoffs forced to do even more work.“We’re going to have to take over their positions,” the employee said. “We have to do our job, plus the contractor job. Usually we have to work for two people, now, we’re going to have to work for three people.”Tesla has suffered quality control setbacks in the past and workers fear those issues may be worsened by the cuts. Ochoa explained he was making several dozen repairs a day on quality control, depending on what line he was on.He said: “I fear the quality will be greatly diminished. Not all of my repairs were easy to see but would have a lasting effect.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/835c3800cf2e75604ffc5bc284a8eaa9d7976714/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10948cdc97342cb1ae66b05e2fb4c782","title":"from buffy to boardwalk empire your favourite boxsets ever","story":"Vampire slayers, bootleggers, polygamists and the most evil villain since Satan ... readers respond to our critics’ list with more brilliant binge-worthy TV we missedI’m surprised by the omission of this.

It holds up pretty well on rewatching, although you can see the strain between Ron Moore and Sci-Fi Channel, as it was then, all the more with the passage of time, from the weak “standalone” episodes in season three (Sci-Fi wanted more of those) to the rushed last season (it was supposed to run five seasons, but Sci-Fi would only commit to one more after series three, so Moore cut parts out.) Craig DeBlockMy absolute favourite. Yes, a few poor episodes and sub-plots, but all in all it was brilliant.

Characters, plots, subplots and twists on a Shakespearean level, with the quality of the likes of Glenn Close and Forest Whitaker coming in to add further lustre to a cast that was on point the whole way through. Glorious. gmancThe American version of The Office is just so much better than the original: I can’t believe it didn’t get a mention. Yes, Ricky Gervais came up with the original concept, but Steve Carrell knocked the socks off him with depth of character and humour. After a couple of episodes of the original you just want to punch David Brent quite hard and turn it off. Addie21I came across this late last year and watched it to the end of season three in only a few days, despite an effort to slow down and extend the pleasure. Then my husband and I watched it together, again a “box-set” binge-experience. He enjoyed it so much that we watched the first eight episodes in one day. I’ve been casting around ever since for something as good (suggestions welcome!).

He has even played super-villain Charles Augustus Magnussen in Sherlock. But on a stopover in London between shoots, the laidback 54-year-old startlingly reveals that his latest TV role has truly transformed him, prompting a major life-change that still bemuses many around him.The decision that rocked the Mikkelsen clan occurred while he was shooting the show for which he recently won best actor at the International Emmys. He plays Johannes Krogh, a pastor who feels an intense personal connection with God, in Ride Upon the Storm. The ecclesiastical TV drama – written by Adam Price, creator of the Danish political epic Borgen – started in the UK this week after acclaim in Denmark, France and the US.Mikkelsen was raised by communist atheist parents, but says that at first he felt no obstacle to playing a man of God. You don’t have to be a Scottish murderer to act Macbeth, as Mikkelsen has done on the Copenhagen stage. “At the start,” he says, “my own background didn’t matter in terms of making a priest seem real.” But the longer he inhabited the part, the more impact it had. “Acting is a messy thing: it’s partly you, partly what’s in the script, and partly what you can pick up from your research. You’re left with a bloody mess in the end. You tend to want to make sense of it after.”But how could he make sense of playing a priest whose faith is so fervent that at one point, like a desperate lover, he climbs a ladder to kiss a statue of crucified Christ? Late in the filming of the second season, Mikkelsen went to see a pastor himself, and asked to be baptised into the National Church of Denmark. It was rather as if, while paying Petrov in House of Cards, he had gone to the Kremlin and started running Russia.The ceremony was low-key – head splashed three times with holy water, rather than total immersion – but it was such a change that it unnerved his family and friends. “I don’t know if they’ve accepted it yet,” he says. “Actually, I’m not sure I have. I can’t explain it. I think I’d been fighting it for a while. As I get older, I feel it’s important to be true to myself. And this felt true to myself.”His character has a line about churches being “built for the big moments in life”, and he came to the same conclusion. “I’m getting older, experiencing people dying, and to give that meaning, I found churches and ministers to be the right place.” He also wanted to feel part of a community: “For me it was the church. But if you don’t like that, join a fucking political party, join a trade union. It’s important to me that we join rather than disconnect.”For those viewers who may be resistant to religion, Johannes is a very human type of priest, prone to heavy drinking and adultery. Conflict with his sons – one also a priest, the other a troubled drifter – make Ride Upon the Storm a pacy, racy family drama as well as an exploration of faith.“Johannes is a real piece of work,” says Mikkelsen. “One of the concerns that often comes up in drama is how to make the character more likable, so we can relate to them. Actually, why can’t we sometimes just let the characters fucking cross a line, so the audience dislikes the guy and he has to retain our trust? Shakespeare does it all the time, but we’re now so afraid of losing the audience. Real people can be horrible. My family is not sympathetic to me the whole time.” He has two children with the Danish actress Anette Støvelbæk. “Sometimes I need to gain their trust again.”The pressure to follow parental example is another key theme of Ride Upon the Storm, though such an idea never seems to have occurred to Mikkelsen, whose parents were a nurse and bank worker. His younger brother, Mads, is also an internationally successful actor, having starred in movies including Pusher, Casino Royale and King Arthur. Was there some greasepaint DNA further back? “Nothing! It’s crazy, I know. We tend to attribute it to a rebellion. Mads was a street-dancer and I was a juggler originally. The 80s was a good time to try whatever appealed to you. The young generation now are pushed into further education, which I think is a bad thing. We were freer.”Lars says he and his brother are not competitive, and have only been up for the same role once. “It’s not been common, because we are very different-looking. But we were once up for a part Mads got but then couldn’t do, so I did it. It was called The Spider, and turned out to be my breakthrough role.” He soon attracted the attention of UK and US casting directors, leading to Sherlock and House of Cards, after the 2008 crime drama Forbrydelsen – AKA The Killing – led the surprise Scandinavian invasion of worldwide television.Lars had a small role in Borgen, which prompted Price to give him the lead in Ride Upon the Storm. “Adam wanted to do something more political than Borgen, and found that in religion. Nowadays, Norwegian church elections get nasty. By telling the truth about what the church is supposed to believe in, my character gets into trouble. Is that the democracy we want?”In House of Cards, Lars’s character, Viktor Petrov, president of the Russian Federation, has the same initials and KGB background as the real deal. Was Mikkelsen really just playing Putin? “Oh yeah, it was some version of him. But the work I did was how to elaborate on that and not just make it a parody.” Mikkelsen watched films of Putin’s prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, and foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, and was struck by their being soft cops to his hard cop. “Lavrov is much more suave than Putin, who comes across as very callous and harsh. And Petrov, to me, was a suave character.”The final run of House of Cards was unusual because the show had lost the lead, after Netflix’s removal of Kevin Spacey, who played President Frank Underwood. This followed multiple allegations of past sexual misbehaviour on movie sets and elsewhere, some of which he has denied, but which remain in various stages of investigation.Was there a strained atmosphere on the Spacey-less set? “I got in so late in the last season – there were doubts about whether it was going to happen at all – that everyone had settled by then. People just wanted to finish it off as well as possible. So I didn’t really feel any tension. But of course, it was strange that he wasn’t there. That was weird.”Turning suddenly solemn, Mikkelsen says: “All I can say is that he was nice to me, man. And a phenomenal actor. It’s sad, really sad.” Has he had any contact with Spacey subsequently? “No! I don’t know the man. That’s the difference between working in Denmark and outside. I didn’t really know any of the people on House of Cards. In Denmark, we go out and have beers.” Had there ever been any gossip or unease about Spacey on set? “I never heard anything really. But for that final season, I was maybe there four days.”The #MeToo movement has hit Scandinavian showbusiness also, he says: “It’s a necessary movement. Predators have no place in the business.” Scandinavia has always been seen as a very sexually free place. Was that a complication? “Yes, that was an issue. But it has to be freedom with consent. You can always discuss how serious an offence was and whether there can be assumption of guilt without trial and so on. But that’s all secondary to the need to do something – and this movement did something.”Mikkelsen now acts regularly in both Danish and English. Does he think of them as “home” and “away” tongues, or is he comfortable in both? “I’m getting more and more at home in English, but it’s still quite an effort. With House of Cards, I had a Russian accent, which really helps to go somewhere that isn’t English English. For Sherlock, I had a Scandi accent. I’d like to be able to speak English without an accent, but it will take years yet.”He’s currently filming The Witcher, a fantasy series for Netflix based on a video game, and will host more episodes of the factual series Historien om Danmark, a huge hit at home, which tells the story of the people, landscape and wildlife of his nation. It has given him the second surprise conversion of his career. He laughs loudly. “Now I’m the David Attenborough of Denmark!”• Ride Upon the Storm is on Channel 4 on Sunday nights at 11pm, and is available on All 4 now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e63a76b71b2990f49f6856b0032a4b1f595bfac/0_230_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6100526b154d3e4a05fe20566fa23788","title":"polar vortex 2019 usa what is it temperatures cold weather climate change explained","story":"The polar vortex has broken into ‘two swirling blobs of cold air’, bringing the most frigid conditions in decades to the midwestAs its name suggests, the polar vortex is found around the north pole. It’s a band of strong winds, high up in the atmosphere that keeps bitterly cold air locked around the Arctic region. This circulation isn’t considered a single storm, or even a weather pattern as such.Occasionally, the vortex can become distorted and meander far further south than normal. The phenomenon became widely known to Americans during a particularly frigid spell in 2014, when the media first started using the term “polar vortex”. It was also a factor in the “bomb cyclone” that battered the US east coast last year.This time, the polar vortex has broken in two, bringing the coldest conditions in decades to the midwest US. On Wednesday, Chicago was 10 degrees F colder than Antarctica.“At the moment the vortex looks like two swirling blobs of cold air, one settled over North America, the other over Eurasia,” said Jennifer Francis, the senior scientist at the Woods Hole Research Center. “It splits up when there is sudden stratospheric warming.”Studies have pointed to a recent increase in instances where the polar vortex has bulged down into heavily populated areas. Scientists are gaining a better understanding of why this is happening, with many identifying climate change as an influence.There’s some evidence that the jet stream, a meandering air current that flows over North America and Europe, is slowing and becoming wavier as the planet warms. The jet stream interacts with the polar vortex, helping bring numbing temperatures further south.Scientists also point to a complex sequence of events involving sea ice, which is rapidly diminishing in the Arctic. As the ice retreats, summertime heat is absorbed by the dark ocean that lies underneath. This heat is released into the atmosphere during winter, spurring winds that can disrupt the polar vortex.“We aren’t entirely there yet but there’s more and more support for this concept,” said Francis. “It’s a new and developing hot research topic.”Well, Donald Trump certainly thinks so. “In coming days, expected to get even colder. People can’t last outside even for minutes,” the US president tweeted on Monday. “What the hell is going on with Global Waming (sic)? Please come back fast, we need you!”Scientists were quick to point out climate change’s role in allowing Arctic air to flow south, as well as to remind the president that winters still exist.A localized, albeit large, cold snap isn’t representative of the rest of the planet, as Australians currently sweltering in searing record heat of more than 46C (114F) will be well aware of. The past four years have been the hottest on record for the globe.In the US, record-breaking high temperatures are outnumbering record lows by a ratio of two to one. Research suggests this ratio will expand to 16 heat records for every cold record set if the US warms by 3C (5.4F) this century, which is likely unless greenhouse gases are severely curtailed.Trump’s repeated tweets mocking climate science when the temperature drops are “ridiculous, in a word”, said Francis. “He cares not to understand. It’s the only explanation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa5a0c119b9196b341ebb858f5379523e6fd014c/0_13_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b7a4832a1f1b4e1bc28d78e876c31f6","title":"polar vortex us weather latest temperatures midwest east","story":"The polar vortex, a stream of air that spins around over the North Pole, has pushed toward the US: ‘The heart of this cold is hitting us now’Frozen Arctic winds brought record-low temperatures across much of the US Midwest on Wednesday, as a blast of Arctic air known as the polar vortex unnerved residents accustomed to brutal winters, keeping them huddled indoors as offices closed and even mail carriers halted their rounds.Classes were canceled Wednesday and Thursday in many cities, including Chicago, home of the nation’s third-largest school system, and police warned of the risk of accidents on icy highways.In a rare move, the US Postal Service appeared to temporarily set aside its credo that “neither snow nor rain ... nor gloom of night” would stop its work: it halted deliveries from parts of the Dakotas through Ohio.Temperatures in parts of the Northern Plains and Great Lakes plunged to as low as -42F (-41C) in Park Rapids, Minnesota, and -31F in Fargo, North Dakota, according to the National Weather Service. The frigid winds were bound for the US east coast later on Wednesday into Thursday.As of Wednesday morning, Chicago briefly became colder than Antarctica (where is it summer), when temperatures reached -21F versus -11F in the south pole. With the wind chill factor, temperatures in Los Angeles felt about 100F warmer than Chicago on Wednesday morning.Andrew Orrison, a meteorologist with the service, said the some of the coldest wind chills were recorded in International Falls, Minnesota, at -55F (-48C). Even the south pole in Antarctica was warmer, with an expected low of minus 24F (minus 31C) with wind chill. In many cities, concern is especially acute for homeless people who may have nowhere to stay. Advocates said there are rarely enough shelter beds for all homeless people.“I’m cold and I’m afraid,” homeless Chicago resident Tony Neeley told the New York Times, Tuesday evening. The mayor of Lansing, Michigan reported shelters in his city were becoming “overloaded,” and a senior advisor to the mayor of Detroit worried anyone who refused help would “freeze or lose a limb”, according to the Detroit News.Many cities opened warming shelters in government buildings, churches, high schools and charities. At the same time, powerful wind gusts have brought down tree limbs and knocked out power as temperatures began to fall. In Indiana, trees downed power lines as temperatures hit -10F.Some people shared pictures of their pet’s multi-layered winter outfits, and reminded people to bring pets inside.Almost 2,000 flights were canceled early Wednesday, largely out of Chicago O’Hare and Chicago Midway international airports, according to the flight tracking site FlightAware.Amtrak said it had canceled all trains in and out of the city, where Hurley forecast -15F on Wednesday and a record-low -27F on Thursday. In New York, interstates are closed to trucks for fear of invisible “black ice”. Government offices are closed in New Jersey as the western part of the state.The bitter cold is being carried by the polar vortex, an area of low pressure which spins counterclockwise in the stratospheres over the north and south poles. The current of this low pressure area has been disrupted and is now pushing south.Advised to stay home, some Americans are taking the cold in their stride. One Wisconsin woman filled balloons with water and food coloring on her porch railing, to make icy colored orbs. Some set soda cans outside and filmed as the cold caused them to explode.In Buffalo, New York, intense cold and snow storms combined Tuesday evening to produce whiteout conditions. Dashcam footage from one trucker taken outside Grand Rapids, Michigan gave a snapshot of hair-raising driving conditions.“I about just got caught in a giant wreck cars are into other pickups, there’s people hurt.

After an initial delay that Parrella’s wife blamed on a medical insurance dispute, the judge was flown out on Wednesday morning.The Office of Military Commissions issued a brief statement that read: “Due to a medical issue impacting the military judge’s ability to work, the rest of the session is cancelled.”Parrella was made judge in the 911 case last August, taking control of a case that has been dogged by false starts, procedural delays and controversy over the military commissions themselves. The defendants, accused of having orchestrated the attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon killing nearly 3,000 people, were first charged in 2008. But the case is still in its preliminary phase, with a trial not expected to begin before 2020 at the earliest.Much of the contention is testimony from the defendants obtained after long periods of torture in CIA “black sites” before they were flown to Guantánamo.Parrella’s fitness to try the case is being challenged in federal court by defence lawyers for failing to disclose the extent of prior relationships with members of the prosecution team.On Monday one of the defendants, Ramzi bin al-Shibh – a Yemeni accused of arranging for some of the hijackers to go to flight school in the US and helping finance the operation – challenged Parrella’s authority to preside over the court.The defendant had raised a similar objection before, but on this occasion Parrella appeared rattled by the challenge and said his attitude “could potentially put everyone in this room’s safety in jeopardy” – a claim that surprised defence lawyers, who interpreted it as a threat to shackle the prisoner.On the same day, defence lawyers threatened to boycott proceedings over what they said was aggressive FBI questioning of a legal assistant who had left Guantánamo in December.On Tuesday, Parrella heard opposing arguments over whether the testimony of a former defence interpreter could be heard in open court. Defendants had claimed they had seen the interpreter at a “black site” and it was confirmed he had worked for the CIA. Defence lawyers have been seeking to question him on whether he had been CIA infiltrator. Parrella ruled that the hearing would have to be held behind closed doors."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ffed2c05b41f74d2e5d4576ea2192eb309acddc/0_229_2968_1782/master/2968.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07c3e02cb6d5e8cb9eb8dc646cd1e189","title":"eu leaders must do more to save rule of law in hungary says mep","story":"Judith Sargentini of Dutch Greens says situation has got worse since her report last yearEuropean Union leaders are failing to act despite the “worsening” outlook for the rule of law in Hungary, according to a leading MEP.Judith Sargentini, a Dutch MEP whose report triggered the EU’s most serious disciplinary procedure against Hungary last September, called on the Council of EU member states to start “a real process” that would examine the rule of law in that country.“Since the vote on my report in September things in Hungary actually only got worse,” said the Green MEP.Since MEPs voted to trigger action from EU member states, she said the Central European University had moved to Vienna and the government had created a new court that will be subject to ministerial control.She also listed the decision to award refugee status to a former Macedonian prime minister convicted of corruption, the “slave law” on overtime, which has brought Hungarians on to the streets, as well as the merger of 450 media outlets without authorities being able to make usual checks.The MEP called on Romania, which is chairing the EU rotating presidency, to produce a timetable for examining the rule of law in Hungary, as she accused Budapest of stalling the process. “Hungarian citizens have the right for protection and have the right to know what you are planning to do.”Frans Timmermans, the vice-president of the European commission, said he regretted that Sargentini had not been given a chance to present her analysis of threats to the rule of law in Hungary to EU ministers.The European parliament voted to trigger the EU’s most serious disciplinary procedure against Hungary last September, a move that was supported by some MEPs in the centre-right European People’s Party, the group that houses the ruling Fidesz party.Although EU law requires member states to act, the procedure has languished and little progress is expected before European elections in May.Hungary’s government refused to take part in the latest debate in Brussels, saying that the European institutions had been hijacked by “the political left and political liberals” for a political rally. Viktor Orbán’s spokesman, Zoltán Kovács, claimed that the rule of law procedure was a “political plot” linked to the philanthropist George Soros, the Hungarian-born billionaire philanthropist who is subject to relentless attack by the Hungarian government.The government also singled out Timmermans, describing the Dutch EU commissioner as “an arm of these leftist liberal Soros-related organisations”.Timmermans, who is seeking to become the next commission president, rejected attempts to portray him as pursuing his own agenda. “In my work on the rule of law I have the full support of the president of the commission and all of the other members,” he told journalists. “I would be more worried if Viktor Orbán started praising me frankly,” in remarks that highlight the depth of tensions between Brussels and Budapest.During the debate on Wednesday evening Hungary’s government received support from conservative MPs, including members of the group created by David Cameron, once he took the Tories out of the moderate centre-right European People’s Party. One Polish MEP, who sits with the British Conservatives, said the “European establishment” had been attacking “people you want to get rid of” ever since the moves to isolate the far-right Austrian leader Jörg Haider.Responding to such points, Timmermans said democracy was always invoked as justification for not complying with EU legislation. Hungary had made the “wonderful” and “sovereign choice” to become a member of the EU. “If you choose to become member of a treaty-based organisation, like the European Union, you by that choice say you will follow the rules of that treaty.”The debate came one day after new research from Transparency International showed that Hungary was deemed to have become more corrupt since Orbán returned to office in 2010. According to Transparency international’s latest corruption perceptions index, Hungary has fallen nine points in the rankings since 2012 to a level that suggests “serious problems with corruption”.Kovács dismissed suggestions that Hungary had questions to answer about alleged misuse of EU funds by Orbán’s friends and families. Kovács said it was “a very nice political agenda” for critics, but insisted Hungary obeyed all EU rules."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27dbe78eea2622ee4abb1913af474670a866c1f4/0_56_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af9297f77f18643cd958af438ef48297","title":"matteo salvini makes u turn prospect facing kidnapping trial","story":"Far-right minister initially welcomed potential case but now says it should not happenMatteo Salvini, Italy’s far-right interior minister, has asked his government to deny prosecutors the right to try him on potential kidnapping charges over his order to prevent 177 people from disembarking a migrant boat.The move is a stark reversal from Salvini’s previous position that he was ready to be tried and proud of “having defended the country from illegal migrants”.In August, prosecutors in Agrigento, Sicily, placed Salvini under investigation after he prevented people from leaving the Italian coastguard ship Ubaldo Diciotti. The ship had been docked for six days at the Sicilian port of Catania as Salvini maintained a standoff with the EU in an attempt to push other member states to take in its mostly Eritrean passengers. The Catholic church, Ireland and Albania, which is not an EU state, eventually agreed to host the migrants.But the breakthrough did not stop the investigation into Salvini and the minister is a step away from facing court after a surprise ruling last week determined that he be tried. “I could face up to 15 years of jail because I have stopped the disembarking of illegals in Italy,” Salvini wrote on Facebook. “I’m speechless. Am I afraid? Not at all.”Nevertheless, in a letter to the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera published on Tuesday, Salvini, the leader of the far-right League party, said he was no longer sure he was ready to face a trial.“After reflecting on the whole affair, I believe the authorisation to try me must be denied,” he wrote. “My judicial case is closely linked to my activities as interior minister and my strong will to keep the commitments made in the election campaign. I’m convinced that I acted in the supreme interest of the country and within the full respect of my mandate.“I would do it all again. And I won’t give up,” he wrote, but added: “The judges should be denied authorisation.”The investigation of Salvini poses a political risk to Italy’s governing coalition as well as a personal risk to his criminal record. The accusations against him will pass now through the senate, whose members will decide whether to proceed with a trial or halt the proceedings altogether. One of the founding principles of the League’s coalition partner, the Five Star Movement (M5S), is that politicians under investigation should be asked to resign.Until two years ago, this principle was written into M5S’s statutes as part of an attempt to present a clean image and distance itself from corruption in Italian politics. On one hand, should M5S senators vote against criminal proceedings, thereby rescuing Salvini from a possible conviction, the party would lose credibility among its supporters. On the other, if it supports the investigation against Salvini, then it risks losing him and the political alliance, causing the government to fall.A senate commission will meet to begin examining the papers on the investigation into Salvini on Wednesday. The vote on whether to proceed is expected in late February.Conte said on Wednesday that 47 people kept at sea for over a week on the Sea-Watch 3 migrant rescue ship could finally disembark after six countries came forward to take them in.The people were rescued on 19 January off the coast of Libya and have been waiting off Sicily since Friday.

But we will go back and sharpen the pencil even further in relation to the traffic counts.”The council has begun work with the National Transport Authority (NTA) in relation to the BusConnects plan to establish how many buses would still use the College Green area after the network redesign, and this information would form part of a revised application to the board.The council had initially considered seeking a judicial review of the board’s decision, but instead decided to submit a fresh planning application.However, an environmental campaigner is seeking leave to take a judicial review, on the basis of differing opinions in relation to effects the scheme would have on traffic.John Conway, a member of the Louth Environmental Group, wants the board’s decision quashed and the application returned to it for reconsideration. The council is a notice party to his proceedings.He claims the refusal was unlawful because the board’s traffic assessment failed to take account of significant changes proposed by the NTA to the Dublin Bus network under the BusConnects plan.The case is due to be heard in the High Court on Thursday.The street, close to College Green, has been closed to through traffic for several years since work began on laying the cross city Luas tracks, but has not had any formal pedestrianisation status and is used during the day as a drop off point for delivery vans and taxis.The council had planned to use it as a pedestrian and cycle street as part of the College Green plans, but Mr Brady said, during a six week trial period, it will be used for pedestrians only, on the same basis as Grafton Street, with deliveries allowed before 11am."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3775984.1548851145!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"harris declines to be drawn on penalties for striking nurses","story":"A 24-hour strike by nearly 40,000 nurses and midwives belonging to the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation is taking place nationwide.

File photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsMinister for Health Simon Harris has declined to be drawn on the issue of applying financial penalties on nurses for going on strike.He said the Government’s priority was to engage with nurses to find a resolution to the current dispute over pay and staffing issues within the confines of the current public service agreement. Mr Harris said he wanted to find a resolution to the strike and did not want to be upping the ante by talking about financial sanctions. “I do not want to be in that space today. The Government is not in that space today”, he said. Mr Harris said the Department of Public Expenditure would “legally consider” the issue of applying sanctions on members of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO) in the coming days and weeks. Under legislation the Government can put in place financial sanctions such as a freeze on increments and delays in securing pay rises on members of organizations considered to be outside of the current public service agreement. He said under the accord, unions which secured benefits from its provisions in return could not lodge cost-increasing claims while it was in place. Me Harris said nurses seeking pay parity with other groups at a cost of €300 million was “by any court a cost-rising claim”. A no-deal Brexit was a real and daunting risk for the country. He said the idea , weeks out from a potential no-deal Brexit , “of taking any action that would undermine the public service agreement would be grossly irresponsible”.Mr Harris maintained any payments to nurses outside the terms of the current agreement would lead to other groups of State employees also seeking similar increases. The Government was honouring its side of the public service agreement and expected unions to do the same, he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3775891.1548853691!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tipperary nurses strike i m here because we re just at the end of our tether","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNurse’s strike outside Connolly Hospital in Dublin on Wednesday. Photograph: Clodagh KilcoyneReuters Nurses at South Tipperary General Hospital say that the patient to staff ratio in the children’s ward can be as high as eight to one at times of emergency rather than the recommended three to one, or two to one for a paediatric unit.Up to 300 nurses at the Clonmel hospital went on strike and are operating two-hour blocks on the picket line, with a certain percentage providing necessary cover and others on night duty.Members of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO) are staging the first in a series of six 24-hour work stoppages on Wednesday as part of a campaign to secure pay parity with other graduate-entry healthcare professional staff such as physiotherapists. The nurses maintain that such increases are needed to tackle recruitment and retention problems in the health service. The strike began at 8am.“I’m here because we’re just at the end of our tether with it,” Ms Murphy said. “We’re also here on behalf of our patients, to try and improve things. If we just maintain what we are doing now, we’re never going to improve anything. We need more staff to get improvements for all patients, young and old.”The current strike is “not about pay, solely,” she said, “but pay is one aspect that’s going to have to be looked at.”Co-chair of the strike committee at Clonmel, Adette O’Connor, said the dispute is “about patient care, about patient safety,” and with current staffing levels “we can’t do that”.The apparent gap between the two sides, which the Labour Court wasn’t able to bridge on Tuesday, “is a big worry,” Ms O’Connor said, “but . . . there are mechanisms within the existing paraphernalia of solving disputes that could solve this. Even though we are poles apart there is nothing to stop us sitting down and solving this with a resolution that’s mutually agreeable to both sides.”In South Tipperary General Hospital nurses come into work and maybe they should have three or four colleagues with them, they might come and only have two. So two nurses might be expected to do the job of four. And it’s not as if nursing management are not trying to solve the problem, the nurses just aren’t there. They’ve moved, they’ve gone to Australia, they’ve gone to Canada, they’ve gone to America, to the Middle East, they’ve gone to the UK, where they have better conditions, better pay and they have more colleagues to work with them,” she said. The nurses have had “nothing but support” from other medical staff in the hospital as well as patients and their families, she said. “The public shouldn’t be worried that we’re not looking after the patients. We’re here and the strike committee are co-ordinating and when there’s a deteriorating patient or someone who needs extra help, we’re providing that. Nobody is left out in the cold.”She said a colleague, “a young doctor that I work with on a regular basis, he actually came up to me and said what he could do to help us today, and he was going to go to the shop and buy some tea and coffee and send it down to us. All our professional colleagues recognise that we’re in a no-win situation and we have to take this action and everybody knows it’s reluctant measure but it has to be done.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Former consultant surgeon giving evidence in trial of Michael Shine (86) who has pleaded not guilty to 13 charges of indecent assaultIrish-American caucus opposition to hard border has implications for UK trade dealsDublin City Council executive says Bord Plean\u0026aacutela refusal of plan was \u0026lsquoflawed\u0026rsquoDiarmuid O\u0026rsquoDonovan was senior administrator of the Cork GAA County Board since 2013Woman allegedly breaks back into property with children who are being \u0026lsquoused as pawns\u0026rsquoGary Watson (35) is accused of murdering Warren O\u0026rsquoConnor (24) in Dublin in 2010Dr Michael McKenna gives evidence of reviewing 2009 slide from tests on Ruth Morrissey (37) who has cancerThe Dubliners\u0026rsquo singer who died 35 years ago on Wednesday is commemorated in DublinIndustry rejects need for quotas, cuts in livestock numbers and carbon tax increasesHundreds of Irish students participating in Erasmus programme had faced uncertaintyNick Hardwick and Barry Goldson raised \u0026lsquoserious concerns\u0026rsquo about facility\u0026rsquos conditionsSave Leitrim group protester says conifer plantations \u0026lsquokilling everything that\u0026rsquos under it\u0026rsquoAccused told GSOC investigators that the allegations against him were \u0026lsquoall lies\u0026rsquoNurses said pay will be lower in 2020 than in 2008 and they are working longer hoursSociety had warned it will have to close unless the State grants \u0026euro300,000 in fundingIrish Rail dismissed David Hunt (37) by letter while he was in prison in 2016 after telling him he was unable to fulfill his contractNurses at St James\u0026rsquos Hospital in Dublin protest pay and conditions in 24-hour stoppageSchools closed and buses cancelled as \u0026lsquosignificant accumulations in places\u0026rsquoMartin Finn (60) died and his daughter was injured after driver had no warning two pedestrians were on roadQuestion will arise over CTA\u0026rsquos viability in regulating travel between Britain and Ireland when UK leaves"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3776175.1548862009!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"australia is full of irish nurses they are homesick i must be mad to come back","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tStriking nurses (clockwise from left): Siobhán Ní Chinnéide, Fiona Pardy, Amy Wilkinson, Tracy McNultyStriking nurses from St James’s Hospital congregated outside the entrance to the new children’s hospital to demand higher wages.Most believe St James’s, which is one of the busiest hospitals in the country, is becoming unsafe because of staffing levels.“We are currently working most days with eight nurses on the floor when there should be 14.

Photograph: Oli ScarffGetty ImagesDuring the Spanish Civil War, sympathetic guides took volunteers wishing to fight for the republic over mountain passes from France, which only goats might have been expected to cross.Decades later, a heavily-militarised German Democratic Republic (the DDR or Communist East Germany) prevented its citizens from leaving by a 1,400 km long wall of concrete, barbed wire and guns stretching from the Baltic Sea to Czechoslovakia.Even in today’s times of modern surveillance it is difficult fully to control the crossing of borders by those who are sufficiently motivated to attempt to do so, whether they are desperate refugees, smugglers and criminals, or fighters in some cause.The complex and sometimes bloody history of Ireland’s porous own borderlands has been documented more than once, most recently in writer and mapmaker Garrett Carr’s fascinating book The Rule of the Land.Carr traversed every kilometre of the contested territory, illustrating how notoriously difficult they are to seal and to police – a reality that was too visible for too long to Border communities.For two years, the movement of goods has dominated the Brexit negotiations. The movement of people, by contrast, appears on the face of it to be a far simpler matter, but this is not the whole story.Even if ways and means can be found to regulate the movement of goods, or if it proves possible to do away with the need for such controls, this will not be the case for the movement of people. The implications of this have not been fully considered.The 1921 Anglo Irish Treaty was silent on matters of migration and settlement, including cross-Border movement. By default, it was assumed that the new Free State would, for all practical purposes, continue to function in the same manner as before.Irish and British people continued to have reciprocal immigration and settlement rights in one another’s jurisdictions. It also meant that border controls were concerned primarily with goods and not people.The free movement regime between the two jurisdictions changed during the second World War. Travel from Ireland to Britain, usually for employment purposes, was subject to permission from both sides.Travel from the Free State to Northern Ireland required an identity document a residence permit was necessary if a longer stay was intended. Interestingly, Northern Ireland travellers faced control checks if they sought to enter Britain.In itself, this is an indication of how impracticable it was considered to seek a hard land border within the island, even though Northern Unionists resented being placed on a different footing from people in other parts of the UK.Such anger was frequently ventilated by Unionist MPs in the House of Commons. The British requirement for a travel permit for those coming from any part of the island of Ireland did not lapse until the end of 1947.The UK view was that travel controls would only be fully abolished if and when a similar immigration policy was established between the two governments. Such a policy was agreed by the Department of Justice in Dublin and the UK home office in London in 1952.It formed the basis for what is now known as the Common Travel Area (CTA), a term first used in 1953. Irish officials went to some lengths to conceal the background to the negotiation, telling London the rules would be “entirely informal”.Consequently, the terms of the 1952 agreement were not made public at the time - a deal that lay at the heart of UKIrish immigration arrangements for decades was effectively kept secret for decades, at Dublin’s behest.The CTA is an unusual arrangement, as may be judged by the Ireland Act passed by Westminster. Within this, “the Republic of Ireland is not a foreign country for the purposes of any law in force in any part of the United Kingdom”.British prime minster Theresa May has insisted it will remain in place after Brexit. So, too, has the Irish Government. Under it, Irish and British citizens have free movement rights, the right to work, settle, claim benefits, even vote.There was, nevertheless, an obvious downside. The CTA has meant that Dublin remained subservient to London in all key matters regarding immigration policy. Moreover, when the UK changed its policies, Ireland followed suit.Sometimes, the co-operation jarred notably Dublin’s willingness to follow the diktats of the home office’s ‘blackbook’. If a person on that list applied for a visa to enter Ireland, a refusal was automatic.The CTA was premised on the assumption that both countries showed, as it were, an identical face, and applied more or less identical policies, to the outside world and its citizens. Such a stance was unsavoury and unpalatable but arguably sustainable, where one of those countries was one with very limited immigration - the loss of autonomy it implied for Ireland was small.However, the immigrant population of Ireland today is 17 per cent, albeit mostly from the European Union. The entire question of humanitarian migration - asylum seekers and refugees - is more important today than it was for the Ireland of the 1950s.What if, for instance, the UK was to lurch further towards a xenophobically anti-immigrant stance, or even to contemplate a radical rejection of the terms of the 1951 Refugee Convention? Would Ireland’s hands be tied as well?For Ireland, the CTA has guaranteed ready access for generations of Irish emigrants to a nearby labour market with a shared language and a strong demand for Irish workers. From a UK point of view, such labour has been readily available and affordable.Often, the UK was a\u0026nbspsafety valve for Ireland’s social problems. It accepted Ireland’s pregnant, unmarried women those seeking abortions, the poor, or simply those who did not feel at home in an often intolerant State.The CTA has also constituted a key element in the management of a complex set of close relations and tensions between the two jurisdictions. It withstood even the most difficult and fractious period of the Troubles without substantial modification.The Belfast Agreement of 1998 spurred the dismantling of day-to-day barriers between the two parts of Ireland and between the two islands, including any requirement for the inspection of documents or other Border controls.Brexit will give rise to a situation where the freedom of movement enshrined in European Union policy and law will no longer apply in the UK, but the CTA will remain in force.Now, however, a question will arise as to the viability and adequacy of the CTA in the regulation of travel between the UK and Ireland when one of these remains in the EU and the other leaves.It now seems likely that post-Brexit Britain will move to restrict and regulate the movement of all third-party nationals into the UK, including those coming from the European Union - with the exception of Irish nationals.The changes will bring consequences. Regarding the movement of non-EU immigrants, we may expect to see strengthened co-operation between the Irish and British authorities to make the two jurisdictions a common jurisdiction in all but name.Citizens from other EU member states will have an unimpeded right of movement to Ireland, but no right of onward travel to the UK. The UK is now suggesting that national insurance checks, or other such inspections can prevent illegal immigration from Ireland.However, the creation of such a back-door seems logically and practically incompatible with the regulation of movements into Britain at ports, airports or by train. In all such cases, the UK has been insistent on the need for tight controls and reinforced borders.For instance, this is why the UK would not join the Schengen zone in the 1990s. It would be no exaggeration to say that “taking back control of our borders” was a key element in the Brexit platform.Why should it be different for IrelandUK movements and what might happen, say, to the putative 10,000 Spanish or Romanian migrants who might legally come to Ireland and proceed to attempt to cross the Border, if there are no border controls in place?Indeed, would the Irish authorities themselves be comfortable with potential flows in the other direction in an unstable post-Brexit situation? Electronic surveillance will not address these issues.The initial removal of Border controls in the 1990s was accompanied by a number of “soft control” measures to\u0026nbspensure that people not entitled to take advantage of the new freedoms did not seek to do so.This led to regular inspections on ferries between Scotland and Northern Ireland, for instance, in order to ascertain whether people who were not Irish or British might have crossed, or intended to cross the Irish border.It also led to Garda checks on buses and trains. Sometimes, ethnic profiling was used, as one black west Belfast man found out to his cost. Such checks now could see people carrying documents to prove that they had the right to circulate without carrying documents.More generally, it must give rise to the fear that the British and Irish authorities will in effect operate a shared zone of control between the two islands - one that might affect Ireland’s place in the European Union.For the UK authorities, the Common Travel Policy survived because Irish and UK immigration policies were strongly aligned. It is equally clear that neither the UK nor Ireland regard the notion of a “hard” land border as practicable or desirable.But jointly-imposed Anglo-Irish controls are very much on the horizon now after the UK leaves the European Union, involving cross-Border surveillance of asylum seekers, refugees and EU migrants - even if no hard border in the conventional sense returns.Piaras Mac Éinrí, is a lecturer in geography and European studies in the Department of Geography, University College Cork Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photo: Gareth ChaneyCollinsLuke Kelly’s version of A Town I Loved So Well is regarded as the definitive one though it was written about Derry and not his native Dublin. The late singer who died 35 years ago on Wednesday at the age of just 44 would hardly recognise the place he loved so well, where he laughed through the smoke and the rain. In the shadow of Sheriff Street there is now a giant two-metre high representation of his head by the artist Vera Klute. It seeks to capture the unique intensity Kelly brought to his singing. The eyes are shut and the mouth is open.The statue, one of two unveiled in Kelly’s memory on the same day, stands at the junction of Guild Street and Sheriff Street.This sculpture is now part of Dublin’s docklands. In Kelly’s day there was no Luas, no Convention Centre and none of the ziggurat-style apartment blocks that now overlook the location where he grew up. The youthful Kelly, though, might still recognise the rusted orange swing bridge across the Royal Canal and the spire of St Laurence O’Toole’s church. The unveiling of both sculptures was done by President Michael D Higgins and his wife, Sabina. Ms Higgins knew Kelly in his days when she was an actor in the Focus Theatre and he was the singer with The Dubliners. “Like so many of you, Sabina and I were proud to call ourselves friends of Luke Kelly, and to have had our lives enriched by his genius, his generosity, his good humour and his great sense of shared humanity,” the President said. He went on to speak of Kelly’s working-class sensibilities which informed his socialist politics and his concern for the people he grew up with. Mr Higgins was followed by Kelly’s niece Paula McCann who remembered her uncle Jimmy, Luke’s brother, who died last year. Luke Kelly, she said, was together somewhere in the great gig in the sky with his fellow Dubliners, Ronnie Drew, Barney McKenna and Ciaran Bourke. “They are all singing together and looking down on the town they loved so well,” she said. She remembered “Uncle Luke” as a man who would bring strangers home for Christmas dinner and preferred a mug of his mother’s cabbage water to a pint of Guinness.Watching it all from the sidelines was the only surviving Dubliner, the sage-like figure of John Sheahan who played a medley of the band’s songs with local schoolchildren, some of them wearing red wigs in honour of Kelly. Earlier on Wednesday, 120 guest unveiled a sculpture at South King Street by the artist John Coll. The sculpture is a life-size bronze featuring Luke Kelly singing and playing a banjo.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WirePeace in Ireland is more important than relationships that could affect economic growth, Tánaiste Simon Coveney has said.He also warned the British government that Ireland will not be the “casualty” of isions in the Conservative Party.Mr Coveney warned the Tories against a strategy that may be “about keeping a party together that for 30 years has been torn apart” by the UK’s relationship with Europe. “If that what this is about, I cannot allow that agenda make Ireland the casualty of,”he said.In a speech in Dublin on Wednesday, Mr Coveney criticised the decision of British prime minister Theresa May to support a vote in the House of Commons calling for the backstop, the insurance policy to avoid a hard border after Brexit, to be replaced.The Tánaiste mounted a strong defence of the backstop, which would see the UK remain in a common customs area with the EU, with add ons in terms of customs and regulations for Northern Ireland to keep the Irish border open, if there is no future trade deal between the EU and the UK.Mr Coveney said the backstop and issues relating to the peace process were difficult to deal with during Brexit negotiations and took a long time to reach a compromise on.“That is why the backstop, and the peace process and the border issues…have been so difficult to deal with and took so long to get compromises on.”On peace, Mr Coveney told a meeting of the Institute of International and European Affairs (IIEA) in the Gresham Hotel: “There are some things that are more important than economic relationships, and this is one of them.”Mrs May has said she will return to Brussels to seek changes to the backstop, the element of the Brexit withdrawal agreement that is the main stumbling block to the deal passing Westminster.The motion she backed in a House of Commons vote on Tuesday, and which won a majority in the house, called for the backstop to be replaced by unspecified alternative arrangements. Mr Coveney said a legally operable backstop cannot be given up for hopes that the Border can be kept open by some other method.“These hopes have already been tested in negotiations and have come up short,” he said. He said the vote in the Commons “signals a turning point of a British prime minister on this issue” and said that is why it has had “such an impact here” and in Northern Ireland.He called on the UK to listen to all political parties in Northern Ireland and not just Mrs May’s confidence and supply partners in the DUP, saying it is “all the more critical”.Mr Coveney said he has been equally critical of Sinn Féin’s call for a referendum on Irish unity to take place as a result of Brexit.The Tánaiste also said that any replacements for the backstop could be tested but insisted the “backstop has got to be there”. He said it “ceases to be a backstop” if it is subject to a time limit with no clear answer on what comes when that time limit ends.Mr Coveney also said that trust between Ireland and the British government had been put under strain by the House of Commons vote to replace the backstop. He also said there is trust between Ireland and Britain, but added: “Some of it was tested last night.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3661517.1539356993!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit explained why does the border matter and what is the backstop","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t A defaced ‘Welcome to Northern Ireland’ sign is displayed on the Border in Derry. Photograph: Charles McQuillanGettyWhy is the Irish Border such a big deal with Brexit? The 499-kilometre border running from Carlingford Lough to Lough Foyle will become the only land border between the UK and the European Union after Brexit.The 1998 Belfast Agreement brought peace to Northern Ireland and removed the need for border checks.It also established North-South rules and institutions that helped solidify the Peace Process. The border is currently invisible and neither side wants the return of infrastructure along the border or the creation of a hard border.So what exactly is a hard border? It is a frontier monitored and protected by customs officials and border inspectors, and potentially police or military personnel if there are security issues around the border.That could in turn lead to a police or military presence along the Border to protect check points. Customs and security posts along the Border were regular targets of republican paramilitaries during the 30-year Troubles.Why would there be a need for border checks? Different customs rules, regulations and standards will apply in Northern Ireland and the Republic if the UK is leaving the EU so the different rules could have to be enforced at a border.What do the EU and UK want along the Border? Neither party to the Brexit negotiations wants to see the return of a hard border but they cannot agree a plan on how to achieve this.So have they come up with anything to solve this problem? The EU and UK agreed in a political deal in December 2017 that a “backstop” was required in the withdrawal agreement – the orce deal – that would guarantee an invisible border in the event of no other solution to achieve this being found in a Brexit deal, either in a specific solution for Northern Ireland or in a broader EU-UK trade deal.The December 2017 agreement also aims to protect North-South co-operation, support the all-island economy and safeguards the 1998 Belfast Agreement. In March 2018 the two sides agreed that there had to be a legal text – not just a political declaration – around how this option would work in practice should no better option be found.What exactly is the backstop? It is an insurance policy written into the withdrawal agreement, or Brexit treaty, guaranteeing no harder border on the island of Ireland.It would only be used as a last resort or the default option if the EU and UK could not reach an overarching free trade deal that would make trade so frictionless that there would be no border between the EU and the UK, including on the frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic.How have the backstop talks developed? Brussels believed a hard border could be avoided and the Belfast Agreement upheld if Northern Ireland remains fully aligned with the EU’s customs union and parts of the single market after Brexit.This would mean matching the rules north and south of the Border for customs, energy, environmental regulations and laws covering agriculture and fisheries,.Northern Ireland would stick to EU rules covering state aid and would fall under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in applying those rules. The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier initially insisted that this backstop can only apply to Northern Ireland.London argued that if the backstop only applies to Northern Ireland, it would effectively create a customs and regulatory border in the Irish Sea. The Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which keeps May’s minority Conservative government in power,\u0026nbspalso objected. They oppose any checks between Ireland and Britain and what they see as a border in the Irish Sea.So what finally appeared in the withdrawal agreement on the backstop? The UK government suggested a backstop that would keep the whole of the UK aligned with EU customs union \u0026nbspafter the post-Brexit transition period.\u0026nbsp The transition is\u0026nbspa standstill period when current EU economic rules continue to apply over the UK. Under the agreement it is due to\u0026nbspexpire\u0026nbspat the end of 2020 but it could be extended to 2022.\u0026nbspThe backstop would be triggered if the two sides\u0026nbspfail to agree\u0026nbspa new trade deal by that time\u0026nbspthat is far-reaching enough to avoid Irish border checks. Under the backstop, the North would also follow EU regulatory rules set down by the single market for goods. This would be enough to avoid a hard Irish Border, but would still involve some regulatory checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea.But there are still problems?Yes, while the UK government signed off on the withdrawal agreement, Theresa May faced fierce opposition to it in the House of Commons and the backstop was one of the reasons why the House of Commons rejected the withdrawal agreement by 230 votes on January 15th, inflicting the heaviest parliamentary defeat ever on a British government. Many Conservatives fear that once the backstop is triggered, there will be no way out of it for the UK. The DUP objects to the fact that regulatory checks would be needed on goods crossing from Britain to the North and that the North would have to follow some rules set down in Brussels.\u0026nbspIs there a way around this? It is difficult. The EU has\u0026nbspgiven the UK assurances that it will make every effort to negotiate a new trade deal to make the backstop unnecessary, or – if it is introduced – to ensure that it is in force for as short a time as possible. However, crucially, the EU insists that the withdrawal agreement itself must remain untouched. This says that the backstop remains in place “unless and until” another way is found to avoid a hard Irish Border.\u0026nbspMany Conservative MPs and the DUP are not satisfied by non-binding assurances, fearing that the legal withdrawal agreement is the key document.\u0026nbspWhat if\u0026nbspthere is no agreement?If there is no backstop, there will be no orce deal and no transition period. In other words, there would be a disorderly Brexit and the UK would crash out of the EU in March 2019. It is anyone’s guess how goods passing over the Irish Border would be treated in such a scenario but the UK’s chaotic departure from the EU could create all sorts of difficulties for cross-border trade and beyond. It is also \u0026nbspopen to the UK to ask for an extension of the article 50 process – its departure date. The other 27 EU members would all have to agree. So far Theresa May has said she will not do this. She has also set her face against a second referendum vote. Under a recent ECJ ruling, the UK could withdraw its article 50 notification unilaterally. In other words if it decided to stay, it must be allowed to do so.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

On Tuesday, a resolution opposing the reimposition of a hard border in Northern Ireland was introduced in the US Congress by congressman Brendan Boyle. It calls on Congress to oppose the establishment of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Mr Boyle said Tuesday’s vote in the British House of Commons had underlined the urgency of the issue. The resolution, which was introduced on Tuesday, has now been referred to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs for consideration. It notes that the people of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland voted overwhelmingly in favour of the Belfast Agreement in a referendum on May 22nd, 1998. It also highlights the fact the US is one of the guarantors of the agreement. The motion calls for the House of Representatives to express its opposition to the imposition of a hard border, “whether one that is strongly controlled by officials, police, or soldiers, or a physical barrier, between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland”.Members of the Irish-American caucus in the US capital are watching events in London closely. And several have indicated that a return to a hard border in Ireland must be avoided at all costs, in particular, Richard Neal, the Massachusetts congressman who was centrally involved in the Belfast Agreement and is the co-chairman of the Friends of Ireland caucus on Capitol Hill. He has recently been appointed as head of the powerful Ways and Means committee. This committee will play a key role in overseeing any future trade agreement between Britain and the US after Britain leaves the EU. Two other Irish-American members of congress – Brendan Boyle and New York congressman Brian Higgins – are also members of the committee.The promise of a bilateral trade agreement between Britain and the US is a central plank of Britain’s post-Brexit economic policy given that British exports to the States are worth about £100 billion to the British economy.Though President Donald Trump supports Brexit, he has given mixed messages about the viability of a EU-US trade deal in recent months. In November, he said the withdrawal agreement negotiated by Theresa May with the EU meant that the UK may not be able to trade with the US after it leaves the European Union.Official negotiations between the US and Britain cannot begin until Britain officially leaves the bloc.US food and pharmaceutical companies have argued that Britain needs to align more closely with US standards, particularly in the food sector, as a precondition for a trade deal post-Brexit. The office of the US trade representative published a request for input from interested parties about a potential new trade deal last November. It received approximately 130 comments from interested companies. Some called for access to US hormone-fed beef in Britain as a condition for the trade deal. Others urged the NHS to lower the barriers that prevent the national health service from sourcing more medicines from the United States.

Photograph:  UK ParliamentJessica TaylorPA WireBritain is exploring alternative options to the Irish backstop within the Withdrawal Agreement, after parliament voted to order Theresa May to renegotiate the terms, Brexit minister Stephen Barclay said.MPs voted on Tuesday to support the prime minister’s Brexit deal if she secures changes from Brussels to the Northern Ireland backstop - an insurance policy written into the Withdrawal Agreement, or Brexit treaty, guaranteeing no harder border on the island of Ireland.At the end of a dramatic day at Westminster, MPs endorsed the proposal by 317 votes to 301, a majority of 16.The DUP’s 10 MPs joined Conservative Brexiteers to support the amendment after Mrs May said she would seek to reopen the text of the agreement. It was a striking reversal of fortune for Mrs May, who saw her Brexit deal rejected by 230 votes two weeks ago.“The dynamic did change last night and it gives a clear mandate to the prime minister to take back to Brussels,” Mr Barclay told BBC radio on Wednesday. He claimed that Tuesday night’s amendments, two weeks after Mrs May suffered the heaviest parliamentary defeat in modern history over the meaningful vote, had “overturned a defeat of 230 into a victory”.Asked repeatedly what could replace the backstop in the deal he said: “There are a number of options, there are issues in terms of having time limits, issues in terms of exit clauses, issues in terms of technology and this will be the nature of the negotiation with the EU in the coming days.” He said the UK was “exploring in terms of the use of technology... looking at things like the time limit” to deal with the backstop.“There are a number of options, there are issues in terms of having time limits, issues in terms of exit clauses, issues in terms of technology and this will be the nature of the negotiation with the European Union in the coming days.” However, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said Brexit negotiators have spent two years looking at alternatives to the backstop and not found any that work.“We have been through all of these things. We have tested them and we have found that they do not stand up to scrutiny, and now we have a British prime minister advocating again for the same things that were tested,” Mr Coveney told RTÉ Radio. Mrs May will meet Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn later on Wednesday to discuss Brexit. The meeting comes two weeks after Mr Corbyn rejected the prime minister’s invitations on the grounds that she should first rule out a no-deal Brexit.Mrs May is also due to speak to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar by telephone on Wednesday. Mr Corbyn told the House of Commons he would meet Mrs May because “parliament has voted to remove the immediate threat of crashing out without a deal on 29 March”. The decision to hold the meeting follows internal pressure upon Labour’s leader from some of his closest aides.One senior party source said: “If we want to avoid a no-deal Brexit, there has to be some level of negotiations between the parties. We have to be involved.”At the meeting, a Labour source said that confirming rejection of a no deal will remain a key issue. “Jeremy will insist that the will of parliament is respected and that no deal is now off the table,” he said. Mr Corbyn will also press Labour’s Brexit plan, which envisages a customs union, a strong single-market relationship and a guarantee on workers’ rights, consumer standards and environmental protections. “That now must be the focus for negotiations,” the source said. Two weeks ago, Mrs May wrote to Mr Corbyn urging him to take part in meetings with her and other ministers following the rejection of her negotiated deal on the withdrawal bill. Mr Corbyn dismissed the invitation as a stunt. In a speech in Hastings, he said: “With no deal on the table, the prime minister will enter into phoney talks just to run down the clock and try to blackmail MPs to vote through her botched deal on a second attempt by threatening the country with the chaos that no-deal would bring.” They last met to discuss the Brexit process in November.On Tuesday night, Mrs May said she would go back to Brussels. “We will now take this mandate forward and seek to obtain legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement that deal with concerns on the backstop while guaranteeing no return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. My colleagues and I will talk to the EU about how we address the House’s views,” she said.“There is limited appetite for such a change in the EU and negotiating it will not be easy. But in contrast to a fortnight ago, this House has made it clear what it needs to approve a withdrawal agreement.”In a further boost for the PM, MPs rejected an amendment that could have postponed Brexit rather than leaving the EU without a deal. They backed another amendment that rejected a no-deal Brexit without prescribing any action to prevent it.In Dublin, the Government issued a terse statement: “The EU position on the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop, is set out in the conclusions of the December meeting of the European Council. It has not changed.”It said that the administration would “continue our preparations for all outcomes, including for a no-deal scenario.”European Council President Donald Tusk said the withdrawal agreement “remains the best and only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal”. In a statement issued on his behalf, he said: “The backstop is part of the withdrawal agreement, and the withdrawal agreement is not open for renegotiation.”Mr Tusk and Mrs May will have a phone call about Brexit on Wednesday evening, his press office said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Jessica TaylorPA WireBritish prime minister Theresa May’s plan to renegotiate Britain’s Brexit withdrawal agreement has met a wall of resistance from the EU, with the continent’s most senior politicians and officials lining up to insist the deal cannot be unpicked.European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker described the agreement reached after 18 months of negotiation last November as “the best and only deal possible”.And he told MEPs in the European Parliament in Brussels: “The debate and votes in the House of Commons yesterday do not change that.“The withdrawal agreement will not be renegotiated.”Mr Juncker said he would stay in close contact with Mrs May and would “listen to her ideas”.But he added: “I will also be extremely clear about the position of the EU. Yesterday’s vote has further increased the risk of a disorderly exit of the UK.”Tuesday’s Commons vote demanded the replacement of the backstop with “alternative arrangements” to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.But the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier told MEPs that “no-one, on one side or the other, can say very clearly and precisely what form these alternative arrangements will take”.Insisting that the plan remains “at the heart” of the EU’s efforts to protect the single market, Mr Barnier said: “The backstop is part and parcel of the withdrawal agreement and this agreement will not be renegotiated.”The prime minister’s spokesman said: “The EU had said it was seeking clarity — there had been suggestions that the backstop was not the main issue of concern, which had originated in Brussels.“I think yesterday a clear message was given by the House of Commons that the backstop is the concern which MPs have, and that if we can find a way to address those concerns that there is a stable majority for getting support for the deal in parliament.”Mrs May met privately with Jeremy Corbyn to discuss the way ahead, after clashing with the Labour leader at Prime Minister’s Questions in the Commons.Having boycotted earlier cross-party talks, Mr Corbyn said he was ready to discuss a “sensible” approach to Brexit after MPs voted on Tuesday night to rule out no deal.Following the meeting, Mr Corbyn said he is “suspicious” that Mrs May is trying to “run down the clock” on Brexit.He said the pair held “serious” talks which were “exploratory on the issues” and he “set out the Labour case for a comprehensive customs union with the European Union in order to protect jobs in this country”.But he warned: “The whole process looks like it’s running down the clock by saying well it’s either the problems and the difficulties of no deal or support a deal that’s already been rejected by the House of Commons.“I’m suspicious that there is a programme of running down the clock here.”Mrs May was later due to speak by phone with European Council president Donald Tusk and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.In the Commons, Mr Corbyn demanded to know which of her red lines Mrs May was prepared to compromise on in order to avoid a no-deal Brexit.“It really is time that the prime minister acknowledged she has got to move on from the red lines she put down in the first place,” he said.But the prime minister told Mr Corbyn he had opposed “every move by this government to get a deal” and “he is the one risking no deal”.In dramatic scenes on Tuesday night, MPs voted by a margin of 317 to 301 to back a plan — the “Brady amendment” — which requires the prime minister to replace the agreement’s controversial backstop with “alternative arrangements” to keep the Irish border open after Brexit.But asked five times on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme what this “alternative” involved, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay was unable to provide any specific explanation.Mr Barclay said the UK was “exploring in terms of the use of technology... looking at things like the time limit” to deal with the backstop.He added: “There are a number of options, there are issues in terms of having time limits, issues in terms of exit clauses, issues in terms of technology, and this will be the nature of the negotiation with the European Union in the coming days.”Downing Street has suggested that the UK’s position could involve a time-limit or exit clause to the backstop or swapping it for a free trade agreement, as proposed in the so-called Malthouse Compromise drawn up by MPs from the Tories’ Remain and Leave wings.But the suggestion that the deal struck between the Government and Brussels could be unpicked was rejected by senior figures across the EU. Mr Varadkar told the Dáil that the EU was not offering a renegotiation of the existing Brexit deal.“A renegotiation is not on the table,” said the Taoiseach. “There’s no plans to organise an emergency summit to discuss any changes to the guidelines. Nor is there any pressure to hold one.”French President Emmanuel Macron said the withdrawal agreement was “not renegotiable”, while a spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that reopening the deal was “not on the agenda”.Germany’s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said: “Germany and the entire Union are firmly on Ireland’s side. We will not allow Ireland to be isolated on this issue.”French Europe minister Nathalie Loiseau said: “The withdrawal agreement that is on the table is the best possible agreement. Let us not reopen it.”Brexiteer ringleader Jacob Rees-Mogg made clear on Wednesday that he remains prepared to see the UK leave without a deal on March 29th if the EU refuses to reopen negotiations.“If (the EU) think the withdrawal agreement is non-negotiable then we will have to leave without an agreement,” he told TalkRadio. “Do they want the £39 billion, do they want an agreement... or us just to leave? It’s up to them.”Conservative former Cabinet minister Sir Oliver Letwin said he did not think it was “at all likely” that Mrs May would succeed in getting changes to her withdrawal agreement.He told BBC Radio 5 Live: “If you were a betting person, would you bet two weeks from now that she is going to come back with something that will obtain a majority? I’d have to say, I wouldn’t bet on it, no.” - PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

Finally, less than 5 percent of the people who chose to participate in this market research program were teens. All of them with signed parental consent forms.Apple and Facebook have found themselves arguing over user privacy and the protection of personal data in recent months. Tim Cook criticised Facebook over its handling of the Cambridge Analytica crisis and suggested it was different because it chose not to make its customers its products – which Mark Zuckerberg said was extremely glib and did not represent how Facebook thinks about its customers.Despite those fallouts, Facebook and Apple rely heavily on each other. That arrangement is said to have led to problems in the past, with Apple unable to punish Facebook without threatening many of the biggest apps on its platform.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He told The Independent that a customer based in the Republic of Ireland had already stopped working with his firm “because they are scared about what will happen after Brexit”.“We have customers asking us about what we are going to do and about our supply chains. It’s really, really difficult,” he said. “It’s the uncertainty more than anything. Business does not like uncertainty and it’s creating havoc with us.”Trading partners across Europe are nervous about the future, and investment at a standstill because of the uncertainty. “We are holding back and keeping our cash because we many need it to get over the next few years,” the businessman said. “It’s created a real issue for us going forward. We just don’t know what’s going to happen and we won’t be investing until we know what’s going to happen and until we know what happens with the customs union.“If we get into the position where we can’t trade freely across the border our competitors in the rest of Europe will jump on that and take that trade away from us.”He pointed out that if a deal is reached, there will still be two years of negotiations to get through.\u0026nbspThe alternative – a no-deal Brexit – is even more daunting. “If we go into WTO rules, that’s going to create serious issues,” he said. “Within Northern Ireland we will have a struggling economy in the UK on one side, the Republic of Ireland is going to have issues, and we will be left in the middle trying to trade. It’s a no-win situation.” Meanwhile, firms feel like they have been somewhat abandoned by the UK government. Mr Kelly said that the government’s advice to business in Northern Ireland was essentially “not to do anything”. “It’s 58 days to go – there’s food on the shelves that has a longer shelf life than that,” he added. “The Irish government has been working with industries for the past two years. We have nothing, we’ve have been left hung out, hoping for the best. It’s unacceptable.”The business owner told The Independent that communication from Westminster had been “very, very lacking”. “The whole thing has been handled particularly badly,” he said.\u0026nbsp“We are in limbo, paddling away. We aren’t growing but we haven’t contracted, so that’s something – but that could change very quickly. It’s a nightmare.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And what precisely does it entail for the UK?What is the World Trade Organisation?It is an inter-governmental organisation with 164 members – almost every state in the world and certainly all the major economies.Its central purpose is to permit goods and services\u0026nbspto flow across borders with relative ease.The key element of its agreements is that every member shall treat every other member equally in terms of tariff charges, meaning there shall be no arbitrary discrimination.So if country X, say, offers a lower tariff on a certain imported product to country Y it also has to automatically offer that lower tariff to every other country too. This is the “most favoured nation” principle.However, there is an exception. Where two countries enter into a free trade agreement that covers the bulk of their trade, they can offer each other lower tariffs without having to also offer them to everyone else.So the countries of the EU free trade area can charge zero tariffs on cars imported from each other but can keep the levies in place on cars imported from America.Another function of the WTO is to arbitrate disputes. So if one country accuses another of breaking the rules of the system the WTO will examine the case and decide which party is in the right.The party that is in the wrong will face sanctions and the party that is in the right is allowed to impose import restrictions.If we leave the EU would we be able to trade on WTO rules with the rest of the world?Yes. The UK is already an independent member of the WTO.To trade in its own right (outside the European Union’s customs union) we would first need to notify the rest of the membership about our proposed tariffs and quotas. Other countries in the WTO could then raise objections to these – and indeed have already done so. But this is a pretty minor obstacle.A far more important problem is that many aspects of our economic\u0026nbsprelations would not be underpinned by WTO rules.The WTO framework doesn’t cover extremely important aspects of a modern economy like the UK such as aviation, medicine export licencing, data flow and many other areas.The UK would also, incidentally, fall out of the coverage of all the free trade agreements between the EU and states such as Mexico and South Korea.This is the reason why it is misleading to talk about a “WTO deal”. The WTO is a patchy, minimum framework not any kind of substitute for a comprehensive free trade agreement such as we have had with the EU.But doesn’t most of the world trade perfectly happily on basic WTO rules?No. This is a fallacy. Even if countries are not in comprehensive free trade agreements, almost all have bilateral agreements with other states on top of their WTO relationship.Do the WTO rules say that if we agree with the EU to pursue a free trade deal we can keep tariffs at zero until it’s ready?Another fallacy. This claim seems to be a reference to Article XXIV of the WTO rules.But trade experts say this covers the circumstances of two countries forming a new trade agreement, not of them leaving one. And they insist that those who cite it as a reason why nothing has to change on trade after Brexit are labouring under a gross\u0026nbspmisunderstanding\u0026nbspof the rule.“The idea that Article XXIV...somehow obliges the EU to continue providing the full benefits of the single market for the next ten years, or even allows the UK to unilaterally offer the EU (and no one else) market access is preposterous,” says\u0026nbspDmitry Grozoubinski, a former Australian trade negotiator.In any case the overriding concern of industry resulting from a no-deal Brexit is not actually tariffs but the negative impact of border checks resulting from leaving the EU’s customs union and single market.Do WTO rules compel the EU not to impose trade frictions on the UK?Yet another fallacy. Some have argued that the WTO “commits members to facilitate trade”, implying the EU would be breaking the law if it imposed\u0026nbspany new border restrictions or tariffs after a no-deal Brexit, including on the Irish border.But analysts say that, however onerous they are, tariffs and border checks are perfectly compatible with this WTO “facilitate trade” requirement.“Both the UK and the EU already comply with this agreement, meaning any procedures they introduce on imports from each other will also comply, as long as the criteria are the same as for imports from, say, the US, China or India,” says\u0026nbspPeter Ungphakorn, formerly of the WTO Secretariat.As for EU tariffs, the opposite is the case. If the EU did not impose its common external tariff\u0026nbspon the UK after a no-deal Brexit it would be breaking WTO rules by favouring a state with which it didn’t have a free trade deal.So is the WTO really any use at all?“The WTO is not useless. Its rules are an essential part of the architecture for a peaceful and prosperous world,” says Alan Winters of the UK Trade Policy Observatory.“But they are lowest common denominator rules for trade between 164 separate and sometimes mutually hostile states, not the rules for deeply integrated, highly cooperative, sophisticated allies.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.The gap between the revenues that unit produces and those from Apple’s various products is enormous. But it is closing, and the margins are stunning.\u0026nbspApple’s shares have lost nearly a third since October, driven by a widespread tech tumble as well as its own problems. It has also surrendered its much vaunted status as the world’s biggest company by market value. Accustomed to dazzling investors, the weather looks set to be cloudy for some time to come and full year revenues will likely be down on last year.\u0026nbspStill, Cook is sitting on a near $250bn cash pile, and the stock’s fall may have been over done. Big investors seem to think so. They’ve started to order portions of Apple pie, scenting a buying opportunity at the current levels. They may well be right about that.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Holly Exley still remembers her most outrageous offer of free work.Exley is a watercolour illustrator with a decade of experience making artwork for top-end clients, from monthly commissions of animals for BBC Wildlife Magazine, to mouthwatering illustrations for the Esquire Food and Drink Awards. But not that long ago a luxury luggage company approached her to work “in collaboration” on illustrations for their products – in return for a free suitcase.“It devalues the industry,” Exley says. “Illustration is used everywhere: from advertising to animation, packaging to publishing. It has value, and illustrators spend years honing their craft and promoting their talents, only to be asked to give it all away for free.”For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialWhy do female freelancers earn less than male counterpartsSmall Talk: Half the workforce could be freelance soon, but ministersExley is one of hundreds of freelancers who have signed a #nofreework petition\u0026nbspstarted by The Freelancer\u0026nbspClub, a support network for freelancers in the creative industries, pledging not to accept unpaid work. The campaign, which started in 2016, is stepping up a notch in 2019 and calling for legislation to give freelancers more rights.\u0026nbspThe problem of free work is getting worse as the UK’s freelance army grows. The number of self-employed people in the UK has increased from 3.3 million in 2001 to 4.8 million in 2017, according to the ONS, contributing the most to employment growth since the financial crisis. Yet self-employed workers earn on average £240 a week, compared to £400 by those in full-time work.\u0026nbspMany young people entering creative industries like photography, graphic design or illustration take free work in return for exposure, hoping it leads to paid work further down the line. But the practice is not uncommon among experienced freelancers. In 2017, the Association for Independent Professionals estimated that free work costs freelancers with an average of seven years’ experience £5,394 a year. The law currently offers no protection and many creatives keep quiet for fear of a backlash from potential clients. \u0026nbsp“So many freelancers are scared to say anything, they are scared to name any company for fear of the backlash,” says Matt Dowling, founder of The Freelancer Club and a former freelance photographer. Since starting the campaign, he has been shocked by the stories of unpaid work and its consequences. One make-up artist couldn’t feed her children after her successful business turned into “an epidemic of unpaid work”\u0026nbspbecause so many other artists were willing to work for free.“I can’t imagine people approaching a plumber or a lawyer and asking them to work for free,” Dowling says. “But anything like photography\u0026nbspor design, anything that’s deemed to be a privilege, it doesn\u0027t get valued. Freelancers are accepting that work, and as soon as companies see that, they decide to save money.”Dowling started The Freelancer Club in 2016 after a company refused to pay him for photography work worth £11,000. It\u0026nbspnow has 30,000 members on a tiered payment scheme. Membership gives freelancers access to guides, discounts, access to paid work and legal advice. “Freelancers are told from an early stage that it’s a rite of passage to work for free,” he says. “It’s absolutely nonsense. Being an ethical company actually helps the bottom line. Millennials prefer to work for ethical companies, for instance.”Khandiz Joni is the\u0026nbspfounder of Novel Creatives, a booking platform for\u0026nbspsustainable and ethical fashion and lifestyle brands to find photographers, hair and make-up artists and other creatives\u0026nbspaligned with their ethos.\u0026nbspJoni says it has pledged not to promote free work through the #nofreework campaign.“We support this because we are freelancers and understand the very real and direct impact it has on our own livelihoods,” Joni says. “Also, working with brands that are in the area of ethics and sustainability, we feel that it is important that all parties need to be paid fairly for their work and expertise, if these brands can make claims of their fair wage principles.”Working for ethical brands and charities is just one of the grey areas Dowling and The Freelancer Club have identified. Others include work experience, collaborative projects like test shoots, where no one stands to gain, and speculative work, which can be requested by agencies for clients in anticipation of paid work.\u0026nbspBut Dowling says companies should never ask a freelancer to do professional work for free if they intend to gain from it commercially. He is calling for the UK Government to introduce legislation similar the Freelance Isn’t Free Act in New York, which establishes and enhances protection for freelance workers, specifically the right to a written contract, timely and full payment and protection from retaliation.\u0026nbspAnna Codrea-Rado, a freelance journalist and author of The Professional Freelancer newsletter, says the onus needs to be taken off the freelancer to go against a system that is already rigged.\u0026nbsp“The conversation needs to shift away from asking freelancers not to work for free, to demanding that companies not exploit the self-employed workforce,” she says.\u0026nbspThe hidden cost of self-employmentCodrea-Rado says it is not uncommon for well-established journalists to say that young journalists should never work for free. “That is a privileged statement to make that puts the onus on those at the very beginnings of their career to fight against a broken system that they did not break,” she says. “We shouldn\u0027t be telling young journalists not to write for free, it simply shouldn\u0027t be legal for a publication to commission a piece of writing without paying for it.“Exley frequently discusses issues around work and pay on her YouTube channel, which has 32,000 followers. She agrees that legislation is necessary to raise the profile of the issue and to provide security for freelancers as it becomes more popular for young creatives to go it alone.\u0026nbsp“I often feel vulnerable as a freelancer,” she says. “We don\u0027t have many of the benefits of traditional employment. We need a better support system to rely on and laws we can enforce.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Newtownabbey, Co AntrimThe uncertainty is already having a huge impact on companies in Northern Ireland. “I know a number of firms have been taking on agency workers instead of full-time staff so they have greater flexibility if it comes to a no-deal Brexit,” said Mr Kelly. “So at a minimum, Brexit is making work short-term and tenuous.”One business owner based in Northern Ireland, who did not want to be named, said Brexit was already creating problems with trade. He told The Independent that a customer based in the Republic of Ireland had already stopped working with his firm “because they are scared about what will happen after Brexit”.“We have customers asking us about what we are going to do and about our supply chains. It’s really, really difficult,” he said. “It’s the uncertainty more than anything. Business does not like uncertainty and it’s creating havoc with us.”Trading partners across Europe are nervous about the future, and investment at a standstill because of the uncertainty. “We are holding back and keeping our cash because we many need it to get over the next few years,” the businessman said. “It’s created a real issue for us going forward. We just don’t know what’s going to happen and we won’t be investing until we know what’s going to happen and until we know what happens with the customs union.“If we get into the position where we can’t trade freely across the border our competitors in the rest of Europe will jump on that and take that trade away from us.”He pointed out that if a deal is reached, there will still be two years of negotiations to get through.\u0026nbspThe alternative – a no-deal Brexit – is even more daunting. “If we go into WTO rules, that’s going to create serious issues,” he said. “Within Northern Ireland we will have a struggling economy in the UK on one side, the Republic of Ireland is going to have issues, and we will be left in the middle trying to trade. It’s a no-win situation.” Meanwhile, firms feel like they have been somewhat abandoned by the UK government. Mr Kelly said that the government’s advice to business in Northern Ireland was essentially “not to do anything”. “It’s 58 days to go – there’s food on the shelves that has a longer shelf life than that,” he added. “The Irish government has been working with industries for the past two years. We have nothing, we’ve have been left hung out, hoping for the best. It’s unacceptable.”The business owner told The Independent that communication from Westminster had been “very, very lacking”. “The whole thing has been handled particularly badly,” he said.\u0026nbsp“We are in limbo, paddling away. We aren’t growing but we haven’t contracted, so that’s something – but that could change very quickly.

The company has only once before cut iPhone prices, shortly after it debuted in 2007.Apple did not say in which countries it would adjust iPhone prices. Resellers in China already began cutting iPhone prices earlier this month after Apple lowered its sales forecast for the quarter ended in December.Apple profits fall as demand for iPhones slowsThe company priced its new iPhone XS, which was released in September, at $999, the same price in U.S. dollars as its predecessor, 2017\u0027s iPhone X.That worked for U.S. consumers, but in countries such as China and Turkey the local currency had fallen so much against the surging U.S. dollar, it made the phone significantly pricier than its predecessor a year before. Apple had essentially asked the consumer to bear the cost of the strengthening dollar.On Tuesday, Cook said Apple will adjust foreign prices in some markets by resetting them at or close to what they were one year before in local currencies. Effectively that means Apple will absorb the cost of the strengthening dollar.We\u0027ve decided to go back to (iPhone prices) more commensurate with what our local prices were a year ago, in hopes of helping the sales in those areas, Cook told Reuters in an interview.In the company\u0027s quarterly earnings call on Tuesday, Cook also highlighted the impact of foreign exchange problems in Turkey, where he said the local lira had depreciated by 33 percent against the dollar and Apple\u0027s sales were down by $700 million from the previous year. In November, Apple also cited currency pressure on its prices in Brazil, India and Russia.Apple has not said when or how often it might reset its prices because of foreign currency changes.Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said the price adjustments may not extend to its services business, which includes Apple Music and the App Store.While that unit beat analyst expectations with $10.8 billion in sales in the quarter ended in December, growth has slowed compared to previous years.Maestri said slower growth was partly because prices rose for users in non-U.S. markets.Roughly 60 percent of our services business is outside the United States, and as you know, the U.S. dollar has appreciated in recent months, Maestri said. And in general, we tend not to reprice our services for foreign exchange on a very frequent basis.Additional reporting by ReutersBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In the same year, the company\u0027s shares dropped 30 per cent.\u0026nbspJosie Cox\u0026nbspexplains how\u0026nbspit got there and where it\u0027s going nextClick to followThe IndependentApple Park, the new headquarters in Cupertino designed by Lord Norman Foster, cost roughly $5bn, and will house 13,000 employees when everyone has moved inFor an interview published in the\u0026nbspFinancial Times\u0026nbspback in 2006, journalist Richard Waters hauled himself to a nondescript corner of the Californian city of San Jose to meet with a corpulent computer scientist called Steve. As Richard walked into a vinyl-clad diner called The Hickory Pit, Steve sat –\u0026nbspbearded and burly – hunched over some sort of hand-held device, engrossed in a game of Tetris.The setting of the interview was unusual for the FT. The salmon pink daily is more widely known for its profiles of the buffed and manicured business elite, lounging in grand villas, chalets and penthouse pads, preferably in Davos or Cannes. But Steve – eating cherry pie in a washed-out T-shirt – had certainly earned his column inches: 30\u0026nbspyears earlier, together with another Steve and an electronics industry worker called Ronald, the Hickory Pit’s favourite tech geek created what would later become the world’s largest publicly traded company. For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialHis unremarkable appearance and the profoundly mundane setting of his encounter with the FT, convey a banality neatly reflected in the origins of the very firm he was instrumental in founding: An experimental three-man band (the original start-up, if you will) that took a crazy punt on a simple motherboard and now has more cash than the vast majority of countries.Apple was founded on 1 April 1976 by the late Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne in Cupertino. It wormed its way on to the tech scene with a creation named the Apple I, a computer designed and built by Tetris-loving Wozniak, and sold for the ominous sum of $666.66 – or about $2,900 in today’s inflation-adjusted money. Unremarkably, the name reportedly stems from Jobs’ fondness of the humble fruit.Less than a year later, the company was incorporated. Wayne had already jumped ship, having sold his stake in the group for the paltry sum of $800, but –\u0026nbspunhampered by the exit of a third of its staff –\u0026nbspApple’s operational revenues were heading north. According to media reports, they almost doubled every four months during the first five years of the company operating. Between September 1977 and the same month in 1980, sales increased by more than 500 per cent, on average annually.Apple’s mysterious new charger might be about to arriveThe Apple II and Apple III followed, and the company’s success grew with every launch. On 12 December 12 1980 it listed on the stock exchange, publicly floating around 4.6 million shares at $22 apiece. The offering turned scores of Apple’s early employees into instant millionaires. Shares in the company ended the day at $29 each, giving Jobs a net worth of well over $200 million. He was 25 at the time.In 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh. Its debut was marked with a high-budget neo-noir dystopian commercial, aired during that year’s Super Bowl and directed by Bladerunner’s Ridley Scott. The release was hailed a watershed moment not just for the tech world, but also for the advertising industry. Already then Apple was inventing itself as a generation-defining, industry straddling brand a firm that challenged the status quo and confronted the norm ruthlessly.Though Jobs and Wozniak both left the company in the mid-1980s amid disputes with management, predominantly over strategy, Apple’s success initially continued untarnished.In 1991 the company created the PowerBook, presenting a blueprint for all modern laptops. That same year it launched System 7, adding colour to the interface. But not all its products proved a hit. The company was struggling to tap into its client base and it was failing to gain traction with its strategy of marketing high-end products with a high price – dubbed the High-Right Policy – while simultaneously battling heavyweight rivals, like Microsoft, which in many cases were offering similar technology at a vastly smaller price.By 1997, marred by constant leadership change, an unclear approach to the market and a series of painful restructuring exercises, Apple was forced to choose between sticking to its poorly performing guns or risking a dramatic high-stakes turnaround. It chose the latter. It snapped up NeXT, – Jobs’ new venture – for $429 million and scrapped the High-Right Policy. Shortly after, it launched the iMac G3, an affordable machine with a quirky, futuristic look that jarred with Apple’s previous designs, but spoke to a new generation of tech-savvy, progressive professionals. The move proved a lifeline for the financially bruised group and catapulted it into a new era. Apple computers were no longer just the tools of businessmen and accountants, but the product of choice for students, designers and artists. It had won over the creative elite and would continue to claim there support for many years to come.Jobs, who had returned to Apple as an adviser in early 1997, assumed the position of interim CEO when Gilbert Frank Amelio, the company’s boss since February 1996, was pushed out for overseeing several quarters of lacklustre earnings. And it was at this time too that Jonathan Ive joined the upper echelons of management, injecting fresh energy into the brand and later designing the decade-defining iPod and iPad.\u0026nbspThe 2000s were a period of revival for Apple, which the company kicked off with a wild buying spree. It snapped up a portfolio of corporations, including a DVD authoring platform and a music software group. In May 2001, doors to its first retail stores opened and it debuted the iPod, of which more than 100 million were sold over the subsequent six years. The iTunes Store launched in 2003. Within just two years it was the world’s largest music retailer. The MacPro, MacBook, and MacBook Pro hit the market with resounding success, marking the dawn of Apple’s gradual shift away from computers and towards the future of portable consumer electronics.At the Macworld Expo on January 9 2007, Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone of which hundreds of thousands were sold within hours. A year later the App Store was introduced, allowing users to buy third-party applications for their devices and generating millions of dollars of revenue within its own right.\u0026nbspIn 2010, shortly after Jobs took his first medical leave of absence, Apple introduced the iPad which was met with massive demand globally, helping the company’s market capitalisation eclipse that of arch rival Microsoft for the first time in over two decades. The iPhone 4 was released in June of that year, offering a range of new features, including video calling, and sporting a now iconic stainless steel design. The iPod Nano, iPod Touch and iPod Shuffle were also relaunched and the MacBook Air was updated, powering Apple to the top of the list of the world’s most valuable consumer brands.In dire contrast to his professional success though, Jobs’ health was deteriorating. In January 2011 he announced to staff that he would be taking another period of leave of indefinite length, handing the reigns to chief operating officer Tim Cook.\u0026nbspIn August 2011 he officially resigned as CEO. He passed away in October in Palo Alto, succumbing to a rare and aggressive form of pancreatic cancer. Jobs was 56 years old.In many ways, Apple’s post-Jobs years were an era of superlatives. Thanks largely to the launch of the iPhone4S and iPhone 5, and later the iPad mini, Apple’s market value in 2012 soared to an unprecedented $624bn, beating the previous record set by Microsoft. It used that financial momentum to further its quest to ersify into newfangled fields like augmented reality and artificial intelligence. It also remained fiercely committed to design and in 2013 recruited the former CEO of Yves Saint Laurent, as well as former Burberry executive Angela Ahrendts to oversee its digital strategy.Why Apple plans to stop putting a number on iPhone salesApple boss says data is being ‘weaponised with military efficiency’Tim Cook responds after Apple becomes first trillion-dollar companyThe company became a staple on lists of the world’s most valuable, best-known and influential brands. By January 2016 a billion Apple devices were reported to be in active use around the world. It moved into smart home technology and ride-sharing, through its investment in Chinese Uber rival Didi Chuxing. It bought Shazam, a music recognition service, launched its own video unit and signed a content partnership with Oprah Winfrey. Several series are reportedly in development as well as a film. Elsewhere collaborations with Hermes and Nike spurred sales of the Apple Watch, and in October 2018 it launched the twelfth generation of the iPhone. Its slogan? “Brilliant. In every way”.In\u0026nbsp2018, Apple became the first company in history to have a market value in excess of $1 trillion, an amount greater than the gross domestic product of most countries in the world, including TurkeyIn late summer 2018, Apple became the first company in history to have a market value in excess of $1 trillion, an amount greater than the gross domestic product of most countries in the world, including Turkey, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia and Sweden.\u0026nbspEmployment hit more than\u0026nbsp90,000 and, according to some reports, the company has more readily deployable cash than the US Treasury. The combined wealth of the world’s 10\u0026nbsprichest people – a list that includes Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, financier Warren Buffett, and Facebook founder Mark Zuckergerg – doesn’t even come close to the size of Apple’s market capitalisation.The “too big to fail” economic theory prescribes that some organisations, particularly banks, are so large and influential, that their failure would be catastrophic for the broader economy. Apple is undoubtedly one of those organisations, and in the last few months of 2018 markets were offered a taste of what that could actually mean.Shares peaked around the launch of the latest iPhone, and started trending lower shortly thereafter. Between early October and the end of the year, Apple’s shares lost more than 30 per cent of their value, taking them to below $160 from a peak of over $230 just a week earlier, and dragging swathes of the broader stock market with them.Analysts said that investors were falling out of love with the name for a slew of reasons. Product sales were slowing and consumers were becoming more sensitive to prices amid fears of an impending economic downturn. After reporting a set of quarterly results on 1 November\u0026nbspthat reflected a weakening in crucial emerging markets, Apple’s shares fell by 7 per cent in a single day wiping an estimated $70 billion off the group’s value.Executives at the time said that they would stop providing quarterly updates for the number of iPhones, iPads and Mac computers sold, unnerving investors further. The cost of new products also spawned worries, with the average selling price of iPhones climbing to $793 during the final quarter of 2018.After reporting quarterly results that reflected a weakening in emerging markets, Apple’s shares fell by 7 per cent, wiping $70 billuon off the group’s value“Our worry is there must be a limit to Apple’s pricing power,” George Salmon, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, told Reuters at the time. “The group is now charging close to $800 per phone, and while that’s helping revenues climb despite flat sales volumes, one has to wonder how the strategy to shimmy up the price ladder fares in a downturn. If consumers start feeling the pinch, those price tags could put the punters off.”Analyst Chaim Siegel at Elazar Advisors told the agency that trade issues between China and the US are also threatening to throw a ner in the works if they make it hard for Apple to get the supplies it needs. “As for emerging markets slowing, that’s also contagion from China. Both trade war issues coming to reality,” he said.Elsewhere analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch slashed their recommendation on the stock to “neutral” from “buy”, explaining that they are “incrementally concerned that not all the weakness is captured in the near-term” and that there are likely to be “further negative estimate revisions” to Apple’s financials. Analysts at Goldman Sachs cut their share price target on the stock repeatedly.Others have shown concern about the company’s emphasis on its services business: ApplePay, Apple Music and the App store. Potential for growth is undoubtedly there, but the company has yet to share concrete plans about its strategy going forward and how it intends to keep growing.\u0026nbspNot helping the situation, Tim Cook in early January wrote a letter to shareholders in which he announced that Apple’s results for the quarter that ended on 29 December\u0026nbsp2018 were likely to be worse than previously anticipated. Cook cited the unforeseen “magnitude” of the economic slowdown in markets such as\u0026nbspChina. The profit warning was Apple’s first since 2002 and dealt a fresh hefty blow to the share price, as well as the performance of dozens of smaller suppliers and competitors whose fate is closely linked to that of Apple. It also sent shockwaves through broader financial markets, sending stocks – which are generally considered a fairly risky asset – sharply lower in most regions and driving demand for perceived safe havens, like gold and Japan’s yen. The sell-off was a dramatic reminder of the sheer scale of the Apple ecosystem. If Apple sneezes many parts of the financial system will most certainly catch a cold.Since then Apple shares have continued to trade sideways, keeping the company’s market capitalisation well below that psychologically significant $1\u0026nbsptrillion\u0026nbspmark and raising questions about how much more correcting still needs to be done, before – or if – the trajectory can turn.So what will 2019 hold for the company which is no longer quite the world’s largest (having\u0026nbsprelinquished that role to Microsoft and Amazon)? Opinions are ided. While many experts who have been tracking the stock for years predict this to be a turning point, others consider it more of a blip.“When we get into these situations where the current product may not be moving as well as investors expected, some get scared and then the fear compounds itself,” Jason Benowitz, a senior portfolio manager at Roosevelt Investors, told Bloomberg. “We’re not really too concerned. Some of this is probably just noise like it always is.”Also speaking to the news agency, Ross Gerber, co-founder of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth \u0026amp Investment Management, described the climate of fear around Apple as “absurd”. “It doesn’t make any sense. It’s a solid business even if it’s not going to grow as much as it did,” he said.Apple is still hugely profitable. It’s sitting on well over $200 billion of cash, and shares – despite their recent brutal tumble – have roughly doubled in the past five years. The omnipresence of Apple devices across the planet also suggests that if the company’s heyday really is over, then its decline would likely be glacial rather than sudden. It simply has too many dependents, both in the corporate world and the consumer world, to swiftly fizzle out.As for Wozniak, the smiley 68-year old with a penchant for pie and Tetris, is unperturbed the ultimate bull, in market parlance. In an interview with CNBC at the end of last year, he said that Jobs would be proud of what Apple had become. Speaking of rivals, like Samsung, Wozniak said that they don’t present a real threat. They’re not innovating, he explained. They’re simply creating “fun features”. Apple, meanwhile, is concentrating on innovations that “literally affect everything we do all the time in life”.If Wozniak is right, then Apple’s dominance is far from over. Technology famously knows no limits and it’s increasingly evident that consumer appetite hardly does either. We want lives that are interconnected, homes that are smarter than us, phones that manage our whole existence and privacy that is safeguarded unconditionally.Amid all this, the most serious challenge for Apple will be to keep up with contracting attention s.

cold to a wide swath of the eastern United States on Tuesday, stretching from the Dakotas through Maine, with snow expected as far south as Alabama and Georgia.Cities in the Midwest opened warming shelters as temperatures plummeted well below zero degrees Fahrenheit (minus 17.8 degrees Celsius). Regional governments closed hundreds of schools and airlines canceled more than 1,000 flights, including many to Atlanta days before the National Football League\u0027s Super Bowl.The Midwest will be the hardest-hit area, with a life-threatening wind chill bringing temperatures down as low as minus 50F (minus 46C) in the Chicago area and northern Illinois by Tuesday evening, the National Weather Service reported.This storm poses a serious threat to the well-being of people around the state, and we will use every tool at our disposal to keep our residents safe, said Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker in a statement on Tuesday.As much as two feet (60 cm) of snow was forecast in Wisconsin, and six inches (15 cm) in Illinois.Listen to the people in your area ... We\u0027re taking about what could be a very dangerous situation, especially for those traveling, NWS forecaster Jim Hayes warned on Tuesday.He said frostbite was possible within 10 minutes in the intense cold, which was forecast to linger for days.The brutal chill was caused by the polar vortex, a mass of freezing air that normally spins around the North Pole, but has made its way south into the United States.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers  – 2008No frills, just good old-fashioned rock and roll. Tom Petty’s performance is often omitted from rankings of the best Super Bowl halftime shows, but we’re including it here because he absolutely crushed it. Kicking things off with “American Girl”, he followed it up with “Won’t Back Down”, “Full Moon Fever” and the emotional “Free Fallin’”, rounding off with a stirring rendition of “Runnin’ Down a Dream”.U2 had the unenviable task of trying to raise everyone’s spirits just six months after the 911 attacks, but they did an admirable job, with performances of uplifting tracks like “Beautiful Day”.McCartney preceded the pop stars trying to outdo one another with extravagant stage designs and lavish costumes. Instead, he offered four beautifully played songs, of which the final one, “Hey Jude”, prompted an epic singalong with the crowd at Jacksonville’s EverBank Field Stadium.One of the few to outdo Katy Perry’s 2015 entrance was Madonna, three years earlier, who appeared on a giant golden chariot led by about a hundred buff men dressed as Roman soldiers. She brought out Nicki Minaj and MIA for “Give Me All Your Luvin’” and also performed hits “Like a Prayer”, “Music” and “Express Yourself”.There are few entrances as grand as standing on top of a giant golden lion with glowing eyes. Katy Perry went all out for her halftime show in 2015 with performances of “Roar”, “Dark Horse”, “California Gurls”, “Firework” and “Teenage Dream”. And who can forget the notorious Left Shark and his poor coordination?“Put the chicken fingers down and turn your television all the way up,” the Boss ordered. Springsteen’s 12-minute set started out with “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out” and also included “Born to Run”, “Glory Days” and “Working on a Dream”.710 Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake – 2004Janet Jackson delivered a blistering, brilliantly choreographed show that ended with “Rock Your Body”. But the moment Justin Timberlake ripped away her costume, and exposed her breast for approximately half a second, overshadowed all of that. The incident, dubbed “nipplegate”, even inspired the creation of YouTube. Jackson was turned into a scapegoat for the ensuing controversy, while Timberlake didn’t receive anywhere near as much scrutiny.One of the most outlandish halftime shows in recent memory, Lady Gaga began her performance by hurtling herself from the top of the stadium (attached to a harness, of course) – sparking a thousand memes. Once safely on the ground, she thrilled audiences with her biggest hits: “Poker Face”, “Born This Way”, “Telephone”, “Just Dance”, “Million Reasons” and “Bad Romance”.Beyonce basically ties with Prince for the greatest all-time Super Bowl performance. It was bold, it was fierce, it was virtually flawless. Bursting onto the stage with “Crazy in Love” after an a capella “Love on Top”, she threw down some of her best dance moves, before moving on to other hits including “End of Time” and “Baby Boy”. Lastly, there was a hysteria-inducing Destiny’s Child reunion with Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland – a performance so powerful, the lights at the stadium cut out when it ended.The greatest. Of course, the Purple One wasn’t responsible for the rain that began to pour during his hair-raising 12-minute performance, which included covers of “We Will Rock You” and “All Along the Watchtower”. But the timing was so perfect, you wanted to believe he was. Following renditions of “1999Baby I’m a Star”, Prince closed on “Purple Rain” in what has to be ranked among one of his greatest live performances of that song.110 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers  – 2008No frills, just good old-fashioned rock and roll.

But does one exist? Ben Chu looks at the evidenceClick to followThe IndependentIs the prime minister looking for something that isn’t actually there?Theresa May is returning to Brussels to try to renegotiate the European Union withdrawal agreement to make it acceptable to a majority of MPs in the House of Commons.But what will she ask for?On Tuesday night almost all of her party’s MPs and\u0026nbspa majority of the Commons voted in favour of an amendment put forward by the senior Tory backbencher Sir Graham Brady calling for the Irish backstop (the insurance clause that says the entire UK will remain in an EU customs union if there is no EU free trade deal struck that manages to avoid a hard border in Ireland) in the withdrawal agreement to be replaced with unspecified “alternative arrangements”.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialDowning Street’s logic is that, if the EU agrees\u0026nbspto this, the agreement she brings back will finally make it through the Commons.But what might these alternative arrangements be? Even if the EU was prepared to reopen the withdrawal agreement, do they really exist?How badly could Brexit disrupt farming exports from Northern Ireland?The “Malthouse Compromise”, a proposal put together by Tory MPs from both wings of the party, refers to a “protocol” to replace the backstop in a document put out last month called “A better deal”. This was written by Shanker Singham of the Institute of Economic Affairs, a think tank with opaque funding.This protocol offers various technological and procedural measures – including, among other things, customs checks away from the border and a new regime of regulatory equivalence between the UK and EU – which would supposedly eliminate any new frictions on the Irish border as a result of the UK leaving the EU customs union and single market.But how credible is it?Dr Katy Hayward of Queen’s University Belfast says its provisions for policing standards and preventing smuggling would not be secure.Sam Lowe of the Centre for European Reform agrees that the document is not\u0026nbspcredible in terms of policing.“Can you do it without physical infrastructure? Maybe. Can you do it without a significant uptick in ‘associated checks’? I don’t think so. Would it still constitute a border in many peoples’ minds and be disruptive? I think yes,” he says.In other words, if the Singham\u0026nbspplan is the only alternative to the Irish backstop that Theresa May can offer to Brussels her renegotiation effort looks likely to be short and unsuccessful.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

Still,\u0026nbspit would be foolish not to listen to the concerns of a group of companies that between them sell about half the\u0026nbspnation’s groceries.Their warning is backed up by evidence from several sources. Government figures show the UK produces 48.7 per cent of the food it eats and the proportion has been steadily declining. The rest is imported, with about two thirds of that coming from the EU.\u0026nbspAdditional border checks on thousands of containers of food each year could mean significant delays which are a particular problem for fresh fruit and vegetables (the very items we are most dependent on imports for,\u0026nbsp84 per cent of our fruit and 48 per cent of our vegetables\u0026nbspnot being homegrown).\u0026nbspEventually, supermarkets may be able to re-engineer their supply chains to restore the flow\u0026nbspof fresh produce but many goods will undoubtedly be more expensive.Rising prices of fruit and vegetables will lead to 12,400 additional cardiovascular deaths between 2021 and 2030, research published in the British Medical Journal this week estimated.While some have argued that Brexit presents an opportunity to reduce\u0026nbspour reliance on food imports and boost British farming, this cannot happen in the short term.And even if domestic production were\u0026nbspto be ramped up drastically, UK climate conditions will not be suitable for all crops. We could heat thousands of greenhouses of course, but that raises significant environmental questions.There is a saying among optimists\u0026nbspthat when life give you lemons, you should make lemonade.

The best way to do this is to support a people’s vote on the Brexit deal, and to truly give us a final say.”The fall in student support for Labour could be explained by several different reasons, but the concurrent rise in support for a new vote just as Mr Corbyn’s own MPs accuse him of prevarication over the issue is stark.At an event on the steps of parliament last week Labour and Tory MPs announced they would not table a cross-party amendment for a second referendum because it stood no chance of passing the Commons without Mr Corbyn’s support.Created with Sketch.Final Say petition delivered to Downing Street Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Today the Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign and People\u0027s Vote delivered to 10 Downing Street their respective petitions calling for a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit dealL to R:  Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Holly Baxter, Co-Editor Independent Voices and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote hand in a petition to Downing StreetFront row L to R: Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for PutneyThe Independent\u0027s editor Christian Broughton delivered over one million Final Say signatures and People\u0027s Vote spokesman Chuka Umunna MP delivered 300,000 signatures to Downing Street on Monday December 3 at middayA supporter of the second referendum helps Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham out of the rain during a protestL to R:  Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote on their way to hand in a petition to Downing StreetChristian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna hand in the petition to Downing StreetCaroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney hand in petitions to Downing StreetToday the Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign and People\u0027s Vote delivered to 10 Downing Street their respective petitions calling for a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit dealL to R:  Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Holly Baxter, Co-Editor Independent Voices and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote hand in a petition to Downing StreetFront row L to R: Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for PutneyThe Independent\u0027s editor Christian Broughton delivered over one million Final Say signatures and People\u0027s Vote spokesman Chuka Umunna MP delivered 300,000 signatures to Downing Street on Monday December 3 at middayA supporter of the second referendum helps Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham out of the rain during a protestL to R:  Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote on their way to hand in a petition to Downing StreetChristian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna hand in the petition to Downing StreetCaroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney hand in petitions to Downing StreetLuciana Berger, a former shadow health minister,\u0026nbspsaid: “Regrettably the Labour leadership won’t commit to an achievable policy and yet we know that the majority of Labour voters, supporters and members want a final say on any Brexit deal.“Yet at a time when Labour should be championing a people’s vote, the leadership avoids answering that call.”She added: “There are millions of young people in our country that supported the Labour Party at the last general election. Over two million of them were under the age of 18 in 2016. They would today now have a vote. And so many whom I speak to cannot understand why Labour is standing in the way of the younger generation having a say on this.”Three of Mr Corbyn’s MPs later moved in parliament to redraft his strategy, so it ties Labour unambiguously to giving Britain a new referendum.The leader has already submitted the Labour Party’s own amendment setting out how he thinks the country should proceed, but it disappointed many backers of the People’s Vote campaign because it failed to fully commit the party to backing a new referendum.Mr Corbyn’s approach would require ministers to find time for MPs only to “consider and vote on options” including renegotiating the withdrawal agreement and also then “legislating to hold a public vote” on any deal that successfully passes through the Commons.The Labour Party has been contacted for comment.HEPI sponsored Wave 5 of the HEPIYouthSight Monitor, which was answered by 1,048 full-time undergraduate students and undertaken between 4-8\u0026nbspJanuary.

Yesterday, we found out what the UK doesn\u0027t want. But we still don\u0027t\u0026nbspknow what the UK does want.Irish premier Leo Varadkar and Theresa May have spoken by phone this afternoon to discuss the outcome of the House of Commons vote on Tuesday night.In a statement, the Irish government said: The Taoiseach set out once again the unchanged Irish and EU position on the Withdrawal Agreement and the backstop, noting that the latest developments had reinforced the need for a backstop which is legally robust and workable in practice.\u0026nbspThe prime minister indicated that further consultations are taking place in London. They agreed to stay in touch over the coming period.Time is too short to find an alternative arrangement to the Irish backstop and Britain\u0027s orce deal with the European Union will not be re-opened for negotiation, the EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has said.We ourselves talked of so-called alternative arrangements which could prevent the return of a hard border. Only, no one, on either side, was able to say what arrangement would be needed to ensure controls on goods, animals and merchandise, without having a border, Mr Barnier told France\u0027s RTL radio.We have neither the time, nor the technologies.Former Ukip leader Nigel Farage said the prospect of a no-deal Brexit had increased because of the attitude of Brussels fanatics who refused to compromise.He said Theresa\u0026nbspMay had now realised the mistake made in agreeing to the backstop, adding: She signed up to something that no country - unless it had been defeated in war - would have signed up to.\u0026nbspThere was now an appreciation in Britain that unelected bureaucrats in Brussels have been talking down to and humiliating the prime minister of our nation, and we don\u0027t like it.\u0026nbspHe added: Many will say we are simply dealing with fanatics who are not prepared to be reasonable and make any sense of compromise.Jeremy Corbyn has said he is suspicious Theresa May is trying to run down the clock on Brexit.The Labour leader said he held serious talks with the prime minister on Wednesday afternoon which were exploratory on the issues and he set out the Labour case for a comprehensive customs union with the European Union in order to protect jobs in this country.\u0026nbspBut, speaking to reporters in his parliamentary office after the meeting, he warned: The whole process looks like it\u0027s running down the clock by saying, well, it\u0027s either the problems and the difficulties of no deal or support a deal that\u0027s already been rejected by the House of Commons.\u0026nbspI\u0027m suspicious that there is a programme of running down the clock here.\u0026nbspMr Corbyn said he was disappointed some Labour MPs had voted in favour of the Brady amendment or abstained on Tuesday night.I\u0027m very disappointed of those that chose to vote with the Conservatives last night on those issues.\u0026nbspAsked if he would take disciplinary action against MPs who rebelled, he said: We will be having discussions with them.European Parliament Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt hit out at the lack of clarity and lack of stability in the British position, with teeny-tiny majorities deciding different positions in the Commons.What started as a catfight inside the Conservative Party is today an existential problem for the whole of Britain, he said.\u0026nbspMr Verhofstadt said he hoped Theresa\u0026nbspMay and Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s meeting amounted to more than eating biscuits and drinking tea as a cross-party approach was needed to secure a stable UK position.\u0026nbspIt could be the solution for this problem if they start working together on a cross-party approach so that we know what the position of the UK is in the future, because we don\u0027t know it.\u0026nbspFollowing a meeting between Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May a Labour spokesperson said: Jeremy made the case of our alternative plan. They claimed the pair had agreed to meet again and said the tone was serious and engaged.The EU\u0027s chief\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspnegotiator Michel Barnier told the European Parliament today:We share the will of the UK Parliament to avoid a no deal.I agree with Theresa May, voting against a no deal - as happened yesterday - does not rule out the risk of a no deal.For us, the Withdrawal Agreement remains the best and only means to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the UK.The backstop is part and parcel of the Withdrawal Agreement and this agreement will not be renegotiated.Here is Michel Barnier saying the backstop is part and parcel of the withdrawal agreement and will not be re-negotiated.\u0026nbspMr Juncker said he still does not know what the UK wants and that the notion of alternative arrangements is a concept and not a plan.\u0026nbspWe know from yesterday\u0027s debate that the House of Commons is against many things. It is against a no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit, it is against a backstop.But we still don\u0027t know what exactly the House of Commons is for.A concept is not a plan. It is not an operational solution.I will listen to her ideas, but I will also be extremely clear about the position of the EU.Yesterday\u0027s vote has further increased the risk of a disorderly exit of the UK. We have tried everything in our power to prepare for all scenarios, including the worst.Mr Juncker told MEPs that the backstop represented a safety net for the Irish border, adding: No safety net can ever truly be safe if it can just be removed at any time.He said he sometimes had the impression that some on the UK side hoped that 26 EU states will abandon the backstop - and so Ireland - at the last minute.But he insisted: This is not a game and neither is it a simple bilateral issue. It goes to the heart of what being a member of the EU means.Ireland\u0027s border is Europe\u0027s border and it is our Union\u0027s priority.\u0026nbspEuropean Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker is speaking to the European Parliament right now and repeating the lines we have heard on repeat in the last few days.\u0026nbspThe Withdrawal Agreement remains the best and only deal possible.The debate and votes in the House of Commons yesterday do not change that.The Withdrawal Agreement will not be renegotiated.Please allow a moment for the liveblog to loadMPs approved an amendment tabled by\u0026nbspSir Graham Brady\u0026nbspby 317 votes to 301 to accept Ms May’s Brexit deal as long as an alternative to the backstop could be found.However, within minutes of Ms May’s victory in the House of Commons, EU leaders ruled out renegotiating.\u0026nbsp“The backstop is part of the withdrawal agreement, and the withdrawal agreement is not open for re-negotiation. The December European Council conclusions are very clear on this point,” a statement from Donald Tusk said.Created with Sketch.Brexit so far: in pictures Show all 37Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

It does not legally prevent such a scenario and rather acts a symbolic move.A further motion seeking to give MPs the legal power to request an extension to Article 50 - the Cooper amendment - and prevent a no-deal Brexit in March was actually voted down in parliament on Tuesday evening.But the Brady amendment has more significance. It is quite ambiguous, but calls for alternatives to the backstop - the EU\u0027s insurance policy in the withdrawal agreement to prevent a hard border in Ireland.Don\u0027t relax now, Theresa May – your Brexit allies are for turningEU would rather no-deal Brexit than abandon Irish backstop, May toldMay set for Brexit talks with Corbyn as EU insists \u0027no renegotiation\u0027 May wins backing to renegotiate backstop but EU says noMPs reject plan to stop no-deal Brexit in March Theresa May is using this victory in the Commons in the hope of returning to Brussels to negotiate changes to the UK-EU agreement.2 Will Theresa May be able to renegotiate the Irish backstop with the EU?While the Brady amendment does for the first time demonstrate there is a majority in the Commons for one type of Brexit, there is one very significant problem with the plan.\u0026nbspImmediately after MPs passed the amendment, European Council president Donald Tusk\u0027s spokesman said the withdrawal agreement is not open for renegotiation. \u0026nbspFrench president Emmanuel Macron also said the agreement was not renegotiable.\u0026nbspExpect more messages today from European leaders denouncing the proposals, and a major confrontation between the UK and the EU over the next stage in the Brexit process.Downing Street aides admitted the task ahead look difficult, and Ms May herself admitted there was little appetite in Brussels for renegotiations over the backstop. But they highlighted her previous deal had been heavily defeated and that the Commons had shown what was needed to happen for the deal to pass.Created with Sketch.

operated a ferry service and has no ships.Lilian Greenwood, the chairwoman of the Commons transport committee – which sent Mr Grayling 22 detailed questions – said he had refused to say why he had chosen to “bypass the normal procurement process”.EU would rather no-deal Brexit than abandon Irish backstop, May told“It seems extraordinary to me that the government’s response fails to provide any additional insight into why the department used emergency powers in the award of the contracts,” she said.Ms Greenwood said her committee had been told Mr Grayling had “acted illegally in securing these contracts without a full procurement process,” adding: “This was an opportunity for the secretary of state to put the record straight.”The contracts were announced just after Christmas, to help ease congestion at Dover if the UK crashes out of the EU without a deal, by providing lorry capacity on different routes.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by

and increasing to four by the end of the summer.Meanwhile, the department for transport is facing accusations, including from a university reader in economic law, that the contracts break “the core rules of EU law and policy”.Eurotunnel has also protested against the “distortionary and anti-competitive effects” of a breach of “competition and state aid law”.Among questions Mr Grayling did not answer directly were:Brussels says UK should still pay into EU budget after no-deal BrexitWhat just happened with Brexit- and what happens next?Don\u0027t relax now, Theresa May – your Brexit allies are for turningBusinesses to accelerate no-deal planning after Brexit vote, CBI warns* How the companies were chosen – and how many others were approached, or made bids?* What performance measures are included in the contracts?* How many services the companies are required to run?* Whether the firms will still receive a payment if their ships “are not required or cannot be run”.In a letter, Mr Grayling defended the deals as a “responsible measure to secure capacity in the public interest in conditions of extreme urgency” – but without saying they were legal.On the use of emergency powers, he wrote: “The lead times required for acquisition of vessels, planning of fleets, marketing of routes, and necessary works at ports on each end of the routes was limited.”Mr Grayling has previously admitted the extra ferries will only deliver “around 8 per cent of normal flows across the Dover Straights”, which will be “not be sufficient to mitigate the full level of disruption possible”The

It will simply enable the rich to get richer and exacerbate inequalities.\u0026nbsp“And using UK aid to plug funding gaps in the Ministry of Defence only proves that the Tories can’t be trusted to keep the aid budget focused on its core purpose of ending poverty.”Toni Pearce, Oxfam GB\u0027s head of advocacy, said: “The sheer number of people in need today – from Yemen to Bangladesh to DRC – shows that the global 0.7 aid target remains as critical as ever. Stepping back from our aid promises would be lose-lose it would damage the UK’s standing in the world and deprive the world’s poorest people of a vital lifeline.”Girish Menon, the chief executive of ActionAid UK, said overseas support “reflects the best of British values”, but warned: “While we recognise there is always room for improvement, if the UK is to continue to be a world leader for its support, aid spending must continue to be fully transparent to ensure its supporting the most vulnerable in the world and delivering lasting change.”At the snap election in 2017, the Conservative manifesto praised UK foreign aid spending as a “powerful statement of global Britain’s place in the world”.\u0026nbspIt continued: “This is the right ambition for a country with a global outlook, so we will maintain the commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of our gross national income on assistance to developing nations and international emergencies.\u0026nbsp“We will continue to use our aid budget in alignment with the sustainable development goals, to end extreme poverty, save children’s lives, and provide an education for girls.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some of the contracts last two or three years, meaning payments could continue for some time.“As highlighted on many occasions, all commitments taken by the 28 Member States should be honoured by the 28 Member States,” A statement released by the European Commission said.“This is also true in a ‘no-deal’ scenario, where the UK would be expected to continue to honour all commitments made during EU membership.”The statement continues: “Today’s proposal enables the EU to be in a position, in a ‘no-deal’ scenario, to honour its commitments and to continue making payments in 2019 to UK beneficiaries for contracts signed and decisions made before 30 March 2019, on condition that the UK honours its obligations under the 2019 budget and that it accepts the necessary audit checks and controls.EU takes less than 10 minutes to reject MPs’ demand to bin backstop“This would help mitigate the significant impact of a “no-deal” scenario for a wide range of areas that receive EU funding, such as research, innovation or agriculture.\u0026nbsp“This issue is separate from and without prejudice to the financial settlement between the EU and the United Kingdom in a no-deal scenario.”Officials admit they cannot force the UK to make any payments once it has left the bloc, though they hope Britain\u0026nbspwill take up the offer.Though the EU has ruled out doing ‘side deals’ with the UK to soften a no-deal Brexit, the move on the budget contributions suggests the commitment is open to interpretation.\u0026nbspThe Commission says its no-deal planning “cannot replicate the withdrawal agreement”, is “unilateral” and is aimed at mitigating the “most disruptive effect on EU27 stakeholders”. It has stepped up preparations in recent weeks and months, with 88 stakeholder notices and 18 legislative proposals.What just happened with Brexit- and what happens next?EU would rather no-deal Brexit than abandon Irish backstop, May toldMay wins backing to renegotiate backstop but EU says noOn Wednesday it also unveiled measures to protect the Erasmus international study programme, confirming that it would honour the overseas placements of UK and EU27 students who were abroad at the time of a no-deal. This commitment affects around 7,000 UK nationals on the continent and 14,000 EU nationals in the UK.Former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said last year that “the Government would not pay the terms of the financial settlement, as agreed with the EU as part of the withdrawal agreement” in the event of a no-deal, because\u0026nbsp”there’s no deal without the whole deal”. It is not clear whether the Government’s policy has shifted since Mr Raab’s departure, however, with the issue of the orce bill falling off the agenda and the focus moving to Northern Ireland.In September Theresa May said “the position changes” on the issue of the payments if the UK left without a deal: leaving herself room for manoeuvre.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The “backstop” would see Britain mirror EU rules indefinitelyno new trade deal is in place to keep the Northern Irish border open.The EU now suggests a longer post-Brexit transition until December , citing lack of progress. It would see us paying Brussels billions extra.But Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab insisted that it must be “time-limited” and cannot leave Britain “in definite limbo”.However he stopped short of demanding a named date as Brussels has rejected this and Downing Street said his stance was consistent with the PM.No said the PM would never agree to a deal which would trap the UK in a backstop permanently.” But Ireland said having an open ended backstop was “a deal-breaker” for them.Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said: “The backstop needs to be there unless and until something better comes along. Nobody wants to use the backstop - this is like taking out fire insurance on your house.”But yesterday Philip Hammond explicitly stated the temporary period would be needed to be invoked.Mrs May has always insisted the backstop is unlikely to ever be needed, yet Mr Hammond said: “It is true that there needs to be a period - probably following the transition period that weve negotiated and before we enter into our long-term partnership.Mrs May now heads to Brussels on Wednesday to meet fellow EU leaders for a crunch summit that faces deadlock.Meanwhile open civil war broke out between Tory MPs and their crucial DUP allies over the issue, after the Northern Irish threatened to dethrone the PM.And as Sun columnist James Forsyth reveals today, some senior figures in the DUP want the PM to be ousted within weeks.Tory MP Nick Boles hit out: “Conservative leaders are chosen by Conservative MPs and Conservative Party members. Not by MPs of any other party. And we respond no better to threats than proud Ulster men or women do.And it emerged Eurocrats are mulling plans to prolong the transition period in a bid to stop the DUP torpedoing a Brexit deal.Sources said the withdrawal pact could be changed so the  month window can be extended to reassure Unionists the backstop will never be needed.The EU is making a demand of Theresa May she cannot fulfil without national humiliation, mass Cabinet resignations and near-certain Commons defeat.Brussels must know it is utterly unreasonable to demand we stay locked in their customs union indefinitely. Or that they should dictate when we can finally leave. Which they never would.A .million majority voted to leave. MPs voted that meant leaving the customs union. Our democracy, sovereignty and trading future are all at stake. Mrs May must defend all three. God knows what happens next weekshe doesn’t.The Remain ultras should be loving this chaos. Except they have suffered their own disaster. The EU sayswe held a second referendum and voted Remain, they’d strip us of our historic rebate on payments to Brussels.So along with violent unrest, a ­collapse of trust in democracy and a huge surge in extremism, Remaining would come with a whole new price tag on top of EU membership fees: Four thousand million quid a year.Good luck selling that.But the plot will enrage Brexiteers, who fear efforts to trap Britain permanently in the Single Market and Customs Union as a vassal state.During a transition the UK will be banned from striking trade deals and will have to keep making budget payments, while following EU rules without any say.Sources said Michel Barnier is considering a new plan that would see the transition stay in place until the end of  - meaning a two year, nine month phase.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Taxes will rise. We’ll even run out of Mars bars.But across the Atlantic, something has been ­happening that should give us all some perspective.Over the past decade, Venezuela has plunged into the abyss — but there’s been no civil war, no earthquakes or hurricanes.Just a brutal, corrupt government that has turned what was once Latin America’s richest country into a hellhole.Starvation rations plunged millions into hunger and ­malnutrition, with some resorting to eating dogs, cats, even zoo animals.People got into kne fights over the right to scavenge from a dumpster.Its economy is more than three times smaller than in . Inflation climbed into the thousands, then millions of per cent.The result has been a refugee crisis on the scale of the Syria conflict.No wonder tens of ­thousands of people took to the streets of the capital Caracas this week, declaring national assembly head Juan Guaido the legitimate president.All this is awful for the poor bloody Venezuelans.But what does it have to do with Britain The answer is that Venezuela wasn’t just a ­disaster. It was an experiment — cheered on by Jeremy Corbyn and his cronies.In , Hugo Chavez took over Venezuela.He ruled until his death in , when he was succeeded by his hand-picked protege Nicolas Maduro.Chavez modelled himself on Latin American ­revolutionaries like Fidel Castro and Simon Boli. He nationalised much of the oil industry — which dominates the ­Venezuelan economy — and imposed punitive taxes on foreign firms.He introduced price controls and later currency controls. He declared “economic war” on the “stateless ­bourgeoisie” and seized the goods of private companies he denounced as saboteurs.For Corbyn, the Chavez regime was an inspiration — a chance to see true socialism brought to le.Venezuela, Corbyn has said, “showed us that there is a dferent, and a better, way of doing things. It’s called socialism”.It wasn’t just Corbyn. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott and Corbyn’s media chief Seumas Milne have all praised the ­Venezuelan revolution.That “better way of doing things” has ruined tens of millions of lives but there has not been a hint of an apology from Corbyn.Normally, the fact that people are taking to the streets to free themselves of a vicious regime would be cheered to the rafters by the Left.Instead, there is the silence of those who find themselves ­hideously embarrassed.The few who are not ­staring at their shoes claim that Venezuela has been the ­victim of an American plot.That Maduro took, in McDonnell’s words, a “wrong turn” from Chavez’s true socialism.That it was all down to a falling oil price.Yes, Maduro took a wrong turn. But that turn was to follow the path laid out by Chavez.From the Soviet Union to Cuba to Venezuela, there is a long and shabby history of British left-wingers acclaiming a workers’ paradise — only to declare, once its ­failure is clear, that it wasn’t really socialist after all.Never mind the millions of lives ruined — let’s have another go!If he became Prime ­Minister, Corbyn might not succeed in turning Britain into Venezuela. But we’d be Caracas to let him try.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They are paid to inspire you to buy stuff.Most insist they only endorse ­products they actually believe in — and we’d all hope they take their responsibility seriously.But it is easy to see how an offer of, say, £, to endorse something they “sort of” believe in might make it harder to hang on to those principles.Equally,guidelines aren’t strictly enforced, you can understand the temptation to convey the impression that you just happen to really like a particular laxative herbal tea, say, or a moisturiser that gives you a “glow”.It’s a grey area. And you might ask why it matters.But given recent news about the ­negative impact social media can have on the mental health of young people — and young women in particular — regulation of this brave new world affects us all.I need only point to another big story this week.Schoolgirl Molly Russell was  when she took her own le after showing “no obvious signs” of severe mental health issues.Her family later found she had been viewing material on social media linked to anxiety, depression, self-harm and suicide.Her father even went as far as accusing Instagram of “helping to kill her”.Social media makes it so easy to tap into someone’s daily le, their home-decor proclivities and their innermost thoughts.The intimate nature of Instagram lets you feel like these influencers are your friends, and the products they rave about their personal ­recommendations, not the outcome of a business deal.This is a real problem. But the mistake is much harder to makeadverts are clearly labelled as such.Part of the problem is how obsessed with celebrities our young people have become.When I was growing up, my main influenceswere my parents and my friends.Now, young people are influenced by people they will never meet.Some of these people, dare I say it, are talentless nobodies.You might argue you would have to be naive not to realise they are selling you something.Perhaps young people are not as cynical as the likes of me.And that is why regulation is key.IT’S hard to sympathise with Fungi, a “star” of hit telly documentary Benefits Street, who says universal credit is “the worst thing in the world”.Tracked down by this paper, James Clarkeclaimed his monthly payments had been more than halved and the all-in-one benefit was causing “hell” for him and others like him . . . because their booze budget has been cut.Fungi was claiming £ a month to spend on food and sundries. But this was slashed to £ – which doesn’t cover the £ a month he and his partner spend on strong cider.His rent, meanwhile, is paid in full via a separate taxpayer-funded handout.Fungi also says his drinking habit means he can’t work. Sorry, what Here’s another way of looking at it. People who work for eight hours a day don’t have the time to down three litres of cider a day.If Mr Clarke got a job, he might recover some of his self-esteem – and probably save his le in the process.Just to be clear – I BELIEVE in the benefits system.But it was invented to help people get back on their feet, to help those who can’t help themselves because of illness or disability.It should be a short-term measure, not a lestyle choice.In the meantime, the rest of us go to work to pay for this man’s rent and booze.All because he can’t be bothered to sort himself out.No wonder people get angry.In fact, I suspect most readers will have steam coming out of their ears.This man must start taking responsibility for himself.I SUPPOSE it was worth a shot for Diane Abbott to complain that Fiona Bruce was “badly briefed” and that her treatment as a list on Question Time was racist.But she can’t blame Fiona for her own incompetence in answering questions – and not just on Question Time.There are so many car-crash interviews to choose from . . . although the one in which Diane suggested police officers could be paid £ a year springs to mind.WHAT a nasty piece of work Dancing On Ice judge Jason Gardiner seems.We expect the judges to give feedback.And we know it won’t all be good.But his comment to Gemma Collins last week – “We are not going to see big lts from you” – came across as body-shaming.Because his real point is that she is overweight, right It’s shocking, really. I’m surprised ITV allowed it.THE secret behind Elle Macpherson’s phenomenal bod has been revealed.In an interview, she said it all comes down to . . . late breakfasts.Hmmm. No matter when we eat breakfast, most of us will never come close to looking how she does at .Actually, forget breakfast times. What struck me is her diet seems to contain just FIVE ingredients . . . one of which is nut cheese.And the only liquid is water.Elle looks great.But by God, she must be miserable.THE Premier League’s popularity continues to soar, as a study into attendances across Europe proves.And I was immensely proud to see West Ham ranked seventh by attendance in all of Europe last year.We are up there with the Continent’s elite, in a table headed by Barcelona.And that will only get better now the capacity of the London Stadium is up to , – adding to the incredible support we get from what I believe are the league’s best fans.This week, accountancy firm EY published a report on the impact the Premier League has on our economy.It generates £.billion a year in tax for the Exchequer, supporting , jobs and contributing £.billion overall to the country’s GDP.Last season, Premier League players paid more than £billion in taxes.But never mind the money.It’s still the best league in the world.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

These people are ­consistent and have my respect.But there are just as many who are in danger now of sitting on the fence until rigor mortis sets in, coming up with process rather than substance.They are simply hoping that others will do the dirty deed and respect the will of the people.It is also, for every Labour and Conservative MP, the manesto ­promise that we stood on at the last election. We voted for a referendum. We promised to respect the result.We got re-elected promising the same, yet Parliament continues to sit on the roundabout to nowhere.It is time to stop the shenanigans and work across the political ide to bring our country and our people together.At stake is our democracy. And in a democracy the winner prevails.Of course, in future years, people can argue that we have got it wrong and that people are entitled to change their mind. But for democracy to be true and real, we have to deliver the mandate we have been given and leave the EU on March .The referendum ided people and families, with lots of strong and dfering views. But in cherishing our democracy, we now need to come together to deliver a Brexit that respects the people’s vote and helps heal that ide.In le we have to compromise. We all have our own perfect Brexit, me included. And with ten of my colleagues we have forced through a big part of that, guaranteeing in law workers’ rights, health and safety and environmental standards. We will be competing with Europe by being the best, not by being the cheapest.I would love to have been a fly on the wall when Theresa May told union bosses that she was meeting their key demands not just with a promise but with a legal guarantee. But then she knew it was only right, because union members were the bedrock of leave voters across the country.And, I believe, we can get more in the next fortnight. A clear commitment to a once-in-a-generation investment into the Leave-voting areas that have long been starved of our fair shares — those former coal, iron and steel industrial heartlands, the unfashionable places, the areas still manufacturing. I think, as well, that union bosses and industrialists can be brought to act as advisers to the trade negotiations when we have left the EU, bringing their expertise into play to ensure a jobs-first Brexit for Britain.A country, proud and independent, standing on its own two feet, ­confident again in our democracy, bold enough to compete by being the best, British workers making high- quality products and delivering high-quality services.A country that says it will be the best by having better pay, conditions and a healthier environment than anyone  in Europe or worldwide.Is that not something to be confident in voting for, my fellow MPs  Let’s get on with it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Along with the likes of megabucks Remainers Tony Blair, Peter Mandelson and PR guru Roland Rudd, he seems to think Brexiters are basically pond le.That theory should be buried forever after this weekend’s passionate plea from leading academic Sir Noel Malcolm for MPs to stop wrecking Brexit.Writing in the devoutly pro-EU Financial Times, this distinguished Fellow of All Souls, Oxford, spells out the essence of the Leave case: “Brexit is about sovereignty — and parliament must respect that.”“If the UK is now on the brink of a constitutional crisis,” he adds, “one major reason is that a signicant number of MPs still oppose any version of Brexit, and seek a second ­referendum solely for the sake of reversing the decision of the last one.”Sir Noel does not believe people voted Out because they were racist.“The most important reason was democracy,” he says.“They wanted to live under laws made by the people they elected. Immigration came second.What they objected to was a supranational government ­making some of their laws and lting all immigration controls on the inhabitants of  other countries.”Another Remainer fiction is that Brexiters are narrow-minded Little Englanders.Yet the Daily Mail found space for a German view that Brussels should stop “insulting Britain” and honour us as champions of peace in Europe.“Such blinkered and sour responses are wrong-headed,” says Alexander von Schoenburg, a senior editor of Germany’s biggest newspaper, Bild.“They ignore the great debt Germany and the whole ­Continent owes our friends across the Channel.“We must always remember that throughout your history, independence and sovereignty have been paramount.“Germany in particular should tread lightly when it comes to dealing with your proud nation. It was Great Britain that first stood up to Hitler in .And it was Britain that opened its doors to thousands of ­Jewish refugees fleeing certain death during the Holocaust.“Put simply, there would be no free Europe without you and the bloody sacrice you made to rescue the Continent.”This remarkable tribute ­follows a recent love letter to the UK from Germany’s next Chancellor calling for a friendly Brexit orce and an end to bitterness.It is now clear hardline Remainers have over-reached themselves. The worm has turned.Talk of a second referendum is dead and voters are on the warpath against MPs plotting to scupper Brexit in tomorrow’s Commons showdown.Brussels is in chaos over the Northern Ireland backstop.Michel Barnier has started muttering about new tech- nology to police post-Brexit ­frontiers — a UK idea initially dismissed as “magical thinking”.EU allies are breaking ranks to demand a decent deal — for their sake as much as ours.It is way past time now for Theresa May to scrap the backstop and tell Brussels exactly what she needs to get her deal through Parliament.“There is absolutely no truth in speculation that ­passengers are being advised not to book,” stormed Brittany Ferries as it announced plans to INCREASE services.Meanwhile, mischief-making aviation giant Airbus admits it was asked by Downing Street to warn – incredibly – that it would shut up shopBritain left without a deal.Project Fear is shameless.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are useless. Have a trophy.”And it’s a depressing cycle that will continue for as long as there are National Television Awards, live from The O.A ceremony where the categories may chop and change every year, but the stupidity remains ritualised.As well as getting all the usual winners though, viewers also had to endure a technical nightmare on Tuesday, where things went wrong — from the shambolic opening scenes right through to the unedited version of the closing credits: “With thanks to — Television Centre White City or just Television Centretoo long.”It’s always a case of fine margins, of course, at the NTAs, and the evening might have strayed into so-bad-it’s-good territorythe cameras had just focused on one of the Love Island gang when host Dermot O’Leary said: “Danny DeVito will be in Dumbo next year.”They didn’t, though. So a night bedevilled by sound issues, rotten acceptance speeches and foul Danny Dyer language was crowned by Special Recognition winner David Dimbleby eulogising the BBC and ordering us to be nicer to politicians, in a speech that could hardly be descri- bed as “mood capturing”.It’s the awards themselves though, that I know get viewers’ goats the most, starting, painful as it is to admit, with the fact perennial winners This Morning absolutely robbed Piers Morgan’s Good Morning Britain operation in the Daytime category.Given that Jack Whitehall’s Travels With My Father managed to scrape on to the Comedy shortlist, there’s also an argument that says Chunk, Charlotte Hawkins, Richard Arnold and Susanna Reid — who was styled quite magnicently on the night as Waitrose’s answer to Vicky Pattison — should have made that final five as well.Because almost no show made me laugh as loud or as regularly as Good Morning Britain did in .A glaring omission too in the TV Judge section — always won by David Walliams — which included X Factor’s Robbie Williams on the shortlist, but not Craig Revel Horwood, who didn’t take a two-week sabbatical in the middle of Strictly, cost the BBC £million or throw in his other half as part of the deal.The award that made a nonsense of the whole occasion though was Ant  Dec winning Best Presenters for the th time in a row, despite the presence of Bradley Walsh and Graham Norton on the shortlist, and the fact Ant spent far more weeks in rehab than he did in a TV studio.The mutual affection is touching in one way, of course, but it ultimately does neither them nor the NTAs any good at all and has robbed both of a glorious moment of redemption when they win the  award.Before that foregone conclusion takes place, please stay tuned to This Morning and sit tight until mid-March, when Dr Chris will be along with part II of his bottom-wiping masterclass: Flushing, FLU-SHING.Practially the only programme I watched at the weekend that wasn’t punctuated by uncontrollable sobbing fits from the participants was BBC’s landmark Holocaust documentary The Last Survivors.Men and women who are all in their late eighties and nineties now and understand that time is precious.When you’re a living part of history you also know facts are far more precious than tears.So in the words of the remarkable Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, who avoided the Auschwitz gas chamber purely because she could play the cello: “I won’t give people the pleasure of seeing my emotions.”The very least we owe all of them is an audience. The Last Survivors is available on the BBC iPlayer and will probably be the most unforgettable  minutes of television you’ll watch all year.At approximately : hours, Sunday, Gemma Collins stumbled over while Dancing On Ice.The tectonic plates groaned a little on impact, the front row scattered like ten pins and there was a surge on the national grid as several million viewers went “click, rewind, play,” then “click, rewind, play,” again.In fact, by the time I’d stopped rewinding and playing, Gemma had “bounced back,”and Piers Morgan, no doubt angling for a Le Stories interview, had claimed it was “the gutsiest thing I’ve seen on a talent show” – probably since the days Piers himself was wedged in behind the judges’ desk on Britain’s Got Talent.It was an undeniably great television moment, though.A proper face plant, with a full Klinsmann snow plough to finish.The downside, obviously, is that it’s guaranteed she’ll be back next week, when Melody, Wes, James and the others will be performing to a Fairytale theme and Gemma will be clearing the B Fettercairn to Banchory road,ITV want to find a proper use for her.Click, rewind, play.Things remain cheerful as hell on EastEnders.Alfie Moon’s car has been discovered near some clfs and a policeman has the job of breaking the most awful news imaginable to Kat and the Slaters.“Considering the location and the evidence at hand, we would suggest you prepare yourself for the worst.”Big Mo: “You understand what they’re saying ”Yes, bloody Redwater’s getting a second series.

But she also says Britain will not leave the EU without a deal.And her deal — the only one on the table at this late stage — was defeated in the House of Commons by a record majority just two weeks ago.Tonight’s Brexit votes are not quite the final shoot-out between the dferent factions in Parliament. The Government has promised that MPs will vote soon on a new plan.Remainers and soft Brexit supporters in government are pushing to hold that vote as soon as possible.And MPs — backed by a Speaker who will rewrite any Commons rules to soften or stop Brexit — will force more votes on what happens next.Nevertheless, tonight’s votes do matter.One proposal comes from Yvette Cooper, a Labour MP.Her Yorkshire constituents voted to leave the EU by more than two to one and, during the election, she promised them she would “not vote to block Brexit.”Yet that is what her plan does:     MPs vote for her   amendment, they will be able to stop Brexit happening this year.Cooper has the support of several rebel Tories, soJeremy Corbyn whips his MPs to vote for it, she stands a good chance of getting her way.Caroline Spelman and Jack Dromey, Conservative and Labour, have an amendment that calls on the Government to avoid a no-deal Brexit.Dominic Grieve wants MPs to control the Commons timetable, allowing Parliament to vote on dferent ways of watering Brexit down.Labour want to present MPs with options that include, predictably, a second referendum.Despite drafting a manesto saying “Labour accepts the referendum result”, the Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer says in a second referendum he would campaign to overturn the result of the first.It is possible that none of these amendments might pass.Remainers and soft Brexiteers are ided about what should happen.Some want to delay Brexit, some want to tie us to European rules and regulations, and others want another referendum to stop it altogether.Evenno proposal wins a Commons majority, the votes cast by MPs will probably demonstrate that there is a majority to water down Brexit one way or another.For Brexit supporters, this is very dangerous indeed.Some believe they simply need to run down the clock and, in  days, we can leave without a deal.For Leavers who want a negotiated departure, this feels like a serious risk.But Leavers who favour no deal need to ask themselves, can they really be so sure they will get what they want With several Cabinet ministers, many more junior ministers and a Commons majority against no deal, it seems increasingly likely that MPs will ultimately find a way of stopping no deal.When they do, Brexit will only get softer and softer.This is why the amendment proposed by Graham Brady, a senior Conservative, is so important.His idea is to approve the Prime Minister’s original Brexit deal, but with the “backstop” removed.The backstop is hated by unionists, because to prevent barriers to trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland, it creates new barriers to trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.And it is hated by Leavers, because it ties the UK to the EU’s customs union, and Northern Ireland to EU single market rules.Brady wants MPs to vote simply for “alternative arrangements” to the backstop.By avoiding a specic proposal, he hopes the amendment can win a Commons majority and, in doing so, demonstrate to Brussels that the deal they struck with Theresa May can be ratied — but only without the backstop.Critics, largely Remainers, say this is impossible.But in the past week or so, Angela Merkel has questioned whether the backstop is such a good idea after all.The Polish foreign minister has suggested it should expire after five years. And the European Commission effectively conceded that in the event of no deal, they would use policy and technology to prevent a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.In other words, they proposed solutions they once dismissed as “unicorns” and “magical thinking” when they were suggested by the British — and which could render the backstop unnecessary.But this is not all. Some European officials have floated, in private, a more inventive solution: that the UK and Ireland should form a British Isles customs zone, with Britain compensating Ireland for any new friction in their trade with Europe.So it is clear: whatever Remainers claim, alternatives to the backstop are technically and politically feasible.Recognising this, the Brady amendment would give the Government one last chance to negotiate something better.Yet Tory Brexiteers say they might not vote for it. They fear the ambiguity of “alternative arrangements” could allow ministers to negotiate an even worse deal, perhaps tying the whole of the UK to the EU’s customs union and single market rules for good.They do not trust May, her advisers, or most of her Cabinet and demand a specic time limit on the backstop.Butthey vote down the Brady amendment, they will not get what they want, and are more likely to get what they fear.As the clock ticks on and bottoms get even squeakier, MPs will coalesce around a plan to stop a no-deal Brexit.The EU will have no reason to compromise, and Parliament will soften our departure by aligning us with more and more European laws.If Leavers vote against Brady, they will be shooting themselves not in one foot, and not even in both feet, but in the head.As the Commons debates the proposals today, Leavers need to start compromising with reality. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Both are powered by an inexorable sense of self-righteousness. And both have an awful lot of experience of saying sorry.The most recent example came when Sir Nick appeared on the BBC in the wake of the furore over the death of -year-old Molly Russell.It turned out, after she was found dead in her bedroom in December , that she had been viewing material online relating to depression, self-harm and suicide — material which was shockingly easy to find.As her father Ian Russell put it bluntly: “Instagram helped kill my daughter.”Sir Nick, to his credit, said all the right things about how the firm was determined to do more. But he also made the striking claim that it is sometimes better for Facebook and Instagram to keep suicide images online, because it helps other vulnerable young people get support.This after The Sun, on Saturday, found and flagged up multiple images appearing to normalise and even romanticise suicide, all within a few clicks. Many remained published for days, and a Facebook spokesman claimed they could be beneficial to users battling mental health issues.Sir Nick says the firm is following the advice from leading experts and charities. And it may well be doing the right thing. But this is the latest example of Facebook — and other social media giants in general — only acting to tackle a problem once it becomes impossible not to.Over the past decade, social media has come to dominate our lives. The latest research from Ofcom shows internet use rocketing among children and teenagers, with friendships and social lives increasingly run through screens and phones.And it is now clear that this great move online has been accompanied, for our children, by a staggering increase in mental health problems.The situation is particularly alarming when it comes to young women. The latest NHS data found that one in four of those aged  to  report having a mental health disorder — twice the rate among boys.In  alone, one in five US girls aged between  and  suffered a major depressive episode — one in five! Suicide rates for teenage girls, according to academic Jonathan Haidt, have risen by  per cent in the US and  per cent in the UK in a decade.This isn’t just about what happens on the internet. Those having problems online often tend to be experiencing problems offline too, such as bullying, harassment or broken families.More broadly, Haidt believes the “snowflake” phenomenon reflects that “helicopter parenting” leaves children less prepared to cope with shocks and dficulty. But the internet, and social media, are very clearly intensying those problems. And the big tech firms are still playing catch-up.The traditional argument from Silicon Valley is that it’s not their job to regulate human behaviour. They add that eventhey wanted to, there is simply too much out there.They are doing their best to crack down on inappropriate content, but it’s like trying to stem the tide. Behind the scenes — they insist — thousands of people are working day and night to detect and delete messages promoting terrorism, hatred, Holocaust denial and self-harm.But this argument just doesn’t wash. It’s very clear that, in the interests of their bottom lines, many of the big social media firms have long failed to put enough resources into detecting damaging content.Researchers have shown, for example, how following the recommended links from reputable YouTube content can lead to a carnival of horrors. News reports that segue into crackpot conspiracy theories and videos for toddlers that give way to horrendous scenes of a bloodied Minnie Mouse trapped in an escalator.Every day brings new horror stories, such as rival fans of royals Kate and Meghan using the Kensington Palace Instagram to send death threats to each other. Increasingly, online hate is triggering real-le violence. The slaughter of the Rohingya Muslims in Burma was, The New York Times said, “a genocide incited on Facebook”.Part of the reason that Zuckerberg has hired Clegg is to put his house in order. Clegg has talked the right talk about changing Facebook’s culture, and in particular doing more to tackle self-harm.He even says they might start paying more tax. ButZuckerberg’s answer to “how to fix the internet” is “hire Nick Clegg”, we have still got an awfully long way to go.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some EU figures have admitted it isn’t. They could tweak the text, time-limit the backstop or find another solution.They choose not to. And they will stick to that as long as they believe Parliament’s Remainers will ultimately strip the Government of its only negotiating leverage, the threat to just walk away.Remainers, some in Cabinet, may well yet do that. Nonetheless last night should sow doubt in Brussels’ minds.The victorious Brady amendment demands a vital, legally binding change to the Irish backstop before the PM’s deal can pass, just as The Sun called for. Even a dejected Corbyn has conceded he now needs to talk to Mrs May.The PM needs to know precisely what she’s demanding from Brussels — and we’re far from confident the EU will see reason. It is still more likely Brexit will be delayed, softened to a point that could tear the Tories apart or halted.But, after last night’s staggering turnaround, who knows Corbynista MP Fiona Onasanya is a liar and crook richly deserving of a jail term far longer than three months.She must resign immediately.

Irelands border is Europes border and is our unions priority.This evening Mrs May will confront chief Eurocrat Donald Tusk in a crunch phone call.After winning support for a plan to ditch the backstop proposal - designed to keep the Irish border open - the PM promised MPs shed play hardball with Brussels.Mrs May told the Commons today she wont back down on her red lines of taking Britain out of the EU customs union and ending open-doors migration.The PM said: The plan that was set out last night shows that we can get a substantial and sustainable majority in this house.And she ridiculed Remainer efforts to rule out No Deal without saying what should happen instead - saying: Last night the house did vote to reject No Deal but that cannot be the end of the story. You cant just vote to reject No Deal, you have to vote for a deal.Now MPs have signalled they want “alternative arrangements” to the hated Northern Ireland backstop, then she can tell the EU thatthey make the change, Parliament is almost certain to sign it off in the coming weeks.Mrs May will speak to EU leaders today and the rest of the week - and could dash to Brussels for emergency talks too to thrash out a compromise.If they manage to get a change, she will then give MPs another vote on her deal within weeks.If not, the PM will probably tell her MPs it’s her deal or nothing, having fought with the EU as much as possible but to no avail.MPs who fear crashing out could then turn around at the last minute and back the deal.But the EU claims its not possible to impose legally binding changes on the existing deal.In a furious rant, Irish deputy PM Simon Coveney compared Mrs May to someone saying, Give me what I want or Ill jump out of the window.But Polands prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki gave Mrs May a glimmer of hope, saying: Acting together, with all EU member states, we should do our best to avoid hard Brexit.And the European shipping industry body demanded movement from the EU and warned that without an agreement there will only be losers at all sides.A Downing Street source admitted there would be a clash with the EU but insisted there would be space for compromise later this week.The source said: We always knew the next  hours would be a firefight and they’ll say ‘no, no no’.We’ll see what happens after that. It’s a positive day but only the start of what will be an incredibly challenging process.”Brexiteers warned Brussels thatthey dont agree to fresh talks on the deal, they risk Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal on March .Jacob Rees-Mogg told talkRADIO: If they think that the withdrawal agreement is not negotiable, then we must leave without an agreement.Ex-minister Greg Hands added: Brussels is risking a hard Brexit.And Dominic Raab said: The balls now in the EUs court - theyve got to decide.Speaking in the Commons, Mark Harper warned fellow Brexit backers to give the Prime Minister space to get concessions out of the EU.He told MPs: Theyre not going to crumble tomorrow - were going to have to hold our nerve.The backstop is hated by Brexiteers because they fear it will leave Britain trapped in the customs union permanently.They want to see it replaced by technical measures which can carry out automatic checks on goods travelling between Northern Ireland and Republic.Last night the anti-backstop amendment tabled by senior Tory Sir Graham Brady passed through the Commons by  votes.At the same time MPs voted against a motion from Yvette Cooper which would have taken No Deal off the table.But the PM has promised them another vote on the way forward on Valentines Day where Remainers could restart their anti-Brexit campaign."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000465234564.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brexit second referendum peoples vote","story":"Remainers are worried that a second referendum could be off the table in the wake of last nights Commons showdown.Theyre now gearing up for another push next month - but fear that could be the final chance to delay Brexit and secure a so-called peoples vote.Remain campaigners last night piled in behind a wrecking amendment tabled by Labours Yvette Cooper.But the motion, which would have seen Brexit pushed backBritain is heading for No Deal, was defeated by  votes.Pro-EU Tory Anna Soubry lamented: We’ve come closer to crashing out.The odds of a second referendum have slipped to   in the wake of the vote, from   at the beginning of this week, according to Ladbrokes.The Remainers are now pinning their hopes on a Valentines Day debate when the PM will give MPs another chance to have their say on the way forward.A senior source from one of the anti-Brexit campaigns told The Sun: It was a bad night - its worrying that we didnt have the numbers to extend Article .I think February  is the last chance saloon now.Brexit backers also claimed the result of last nights votes showed a rerun of the  vote isnt going to happen.Ex-minister Greg Hands said today: Support for a second referendum is so low amongst MPs that nobody even bothered to put it to the vote.Other Remainers insisted the campaign isnt dead and vowed to secure a victory next month.A Lib Dem source said: A handful of Labour MPs got the Tories out of a tight spot.But it was a pyrrhic victory - were just going to end up back at square one after the PMs macabre tour of Europe.

Corporation bosses were hauled before the Commons Public Account Committee to explain a staggering poundmillion cost overrun for the E project, creating the soap’s Albert Square.During the -minute hearing, Labour ’s Chris Evans tackled BBC Content’s chief operating officer Richard Dawkins over specications for the project.Quizzing the broadcasting executive over an apparent delay between the BBC and contractor Wates in selecting raw materials, the MP said: “There seems to be an issue with bricks.” Mr Dawkins confirmed: “Before going into contract, we felt it was important to look at a range of dferent types of brick and, very importantly, bring in our production colleagues to review those bricks themselves given, ultimately, they’re the ones who will be operating the set.  “We did that in advance of letting the contract with Wates. “The objective for the ‘front lot’ is to replicate the existing Albert Square site - making sure we have that right was really important.” In a bizarre exchange which could have come straight from “mockumentary” WA, Mr Dawkins admitted the selection process took “weeks”. Baffled Mr Evans said: “Wouldn’t it have been easier just to go to a DIY shop and compare them ” But the BBC boss hit back: “It’s quite important that we replicate the look and feel of Walford and Albert Square. “It’s Victorian era, it’s an extensive build around the entire Square, so this is really important.”  He insisted: “If you look at the current set there are dferent shades of brick. “This is not just about going and finding off your local DIY store a limited choice. “It was the right thing to do.” The E project to rebuild the soap’s HQ in Elstree, Herts is costing licence fee payers a staggering poundmillion rather than the poundmillion originally planned. It will not be finished until . Mr Evans suggested EastEenders could have followed rival Emmerdale’s example. The ITV soap staged a plane crash two decades ago and revamped its set. “Obviously there’s the example of Emmerdale in the ‘s who flew a fictional aeroplane into... and they wiped out the cast and the set and rebuilt it,” said Mr Evans. “Would it be cheaper through a plot line to have something fall out of the sky fictionally and wipe out the EastEnders set and rebuild it as new ” Lord Hall said: “ I think we are now in WA territory ... but no is the answer.” Asking the peer what lessons the BBC had learned, the MP asked: “Apart from dropping a bomb on the set, what would you dferently ” Lord Hall said: “I think we have got the right team together but leadership is important.” He also blamed the discovery of asbestos for the spiralling cost.

In approving the move, Mr Justice Snowden said in his judgment: Due to the continuing uncertainty over whether there might be a no-deal Brexit, the Barclays Group has determined that it cannot wait any longer to implement the scheme. In light of the large volume of business to be transferred, the scheme contains a number of phased dates upon which the transfer of the dferent types of business, and the business of the branches in Spain, Italy and France, will become effective. The overriding requirement, however, is that BBImust be legally and operationally ready to conduct all relevant regulated business with the in-scope clients by no later than March  , which is the date currently set for Brexit.

The Prime Minister met a wall of resistance from the EU’s top politicians who insisted the withdrawal agreement could not be unpicked. Senior figures in Brussels, Berlin, Paris and Dublin all warned that her demand increased the chances of no-deal Brexit as the clock ticks down towards March . Mrs May has admitted there is “little appetite” for reopening a deal in EU capitals, but has been instructed by MPs to try to strike a Plan B. She is desperately trying to hold together a fragile truce in the Tory ranks after a vote on Tuesday demanded the hated Irish backstop was replaced with “alternative arrangements”. So where do things go from here  Weve spoken to sources who are plotting the way forward.  The PM and her ministers will spend the next few days working out exactly what to take back to Brussels. Mrs May has already held talks with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Irish PM Leo Varadker and EU chief Donald Tusk. She will now try to nail down the detail of her Plan B. Some Tory MPs thought the Brady amendment just meant a few tweaks on the Irish border backstop plan. But many Brexiteers only backed it on the understanding she would rip up the withdrawal agreement altogether. She will meet with some of those backbenchers on Thursday. As well as trying to hold together the Tory party’s fragile truce, the also needs to push key EU figures as far as they will go.  Mrs May is expected to jet out to Brussels early next week after, as one No  insider put it, “the howling stops and the dust settles”. Government insiders are not optimistic about their chances of persuading Brussels to reopen the orce deal after EU leaders lined up to say “Non. Nein. Nej.” But they’re keeping their fingers crossed that the EU might have one last big compromise up its sleeve. Even the PM admitted it would be a big ask. But in order to deliver on Parliament’s wishesshe has to at least try. She is looking at three areas for the backstop - technological solutions, a time limit and a unilateral exit clause - all of which she has said would be impossible in the past.  The Government has promised thatit gets a deal, MPs will get a second ‘meaningful vote’ on her revised Brexit plan as soon as possible. If, as expected, Brussels rejects her pleas and she comes home empty handed, they will be given a fresh chance to debate Brexit on February  with a vote the next day. This will give MPs the chance to re-run this week’s amendmentsthey wish - potentially handing back control of the Brexit process to Parliament, delaying the UK’s departure beyond March  or legally ruling out crashing out altogether. Mrs May promised another set of votes - which she hopes will not turn into a Valentines’ Day massacre - to stave off a Remainer rebellion on Tuesday. WHAT NOW FOR BREXIT   Unless Brussels puts a last minute offer on the table, which looks unlikely, Mrs May will be back at the despatch box in two weeks’ time. Her party will be more ided than ever. Tory Brexiteers and the DUP will be pushing her to the next stage of the ‘Malthouse compromise’ which would ultimately mean leaving the EU a year later and on damaging WTO terms. Her Remainer MPs who stuck by her this time will be in no mood for standing quietly by. They will push her towards a softer Brexit - working with Labour MPs to get a deal that Brussels would accept. After years of kicking decisions down the road, it will finally be decision day for the PM - continue to appease her hardline Brexiteers, or work across the Commons in the national interest, but risk splitting her party.

He added: I think this is quite crazy. The European Parliament was debating Brexit at a session in Brussels. Mr Brok added: The backstop we have now with the customs union was invented by the British, it was a British proposal The European Union had made other proposals to achieve this so now.In a wide-ranging speech in which he tore into the UKs approach to leaving, Brok also poured scorn on the fact that Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May had not met to speak about Brexit until today. He said: Its vital really that the head of the government and the leader of the opposition have not been speaking to one another in a period of three years,you are leaving you need to know what it is you want before you bother other people with this so please come with a unied position, a constructive idea and come back to Brussels that might be the important question.Talk to each other. We are united, you are not united within the government, within the Tory Party, in the Labour Party. A number of amendments were defeated yesterday which would have put forward other ways of tackling the Brexit impasse - including the Cooper-Boles amendment to delay Article  to help avoid a no deal BrexitAll the positive constructive proposals were rejected, Mr Brok said. The only thing people agree on is this proposal that May has made for the third or fourth time now which is to go back to Brussels and renegotiate the backstop. There is nothing new that has been agreed.  As Mr Brok wrapped up his speech MEPs from UKIP could be heard yelling Auf Wiedersen which means goodbye. Later in the debate the Ukip MEPs interupted as the Green Partys Molly Scott Cato spoke. The chair told them off saying the issue was “far too serious”, adding:“This is not the House of Commons, this is the European Parliament”.

Michel Barnier and Jean-Claude Juncker gave defiant speeches today as they savaged Theresa Mays demand to re-open the -page Brexit deal. MPs backed the Prime Ministers strategy to re-open talks last night - giving her a mandate toto Brussels. But EU chief negotiator Mr Barnier said  days before Brexit, he will not restart talks - because MPs still hadnt voted for anything that will actually work. Demanding ludicity and realism and accusing the UK of a blame game, he told the European Parliament: We share the will of the UK Parliament to avoid a no deal. [But] voting against a No Deal, as happened yesterday, does not rule out the risk of a No Deal. Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission President, added: I will listen to her ideas, but I will also be extremely clear about the position of the EU.   Yesterdays vote has further increased the risk of a disorderly exit of the UK. We have tried everything in our power to prepare for all scenarios, including the worst. Mr Barnier backed up the warning by saying no-deal preparations were now more essential than ever. He told MEPs: I mentioned lucidity and realism.  Its less than  days now to when the UK is going to leave, but we dont have a positive majority in the House of Commons on a clearly identied solution accepted by the UK. It is therefore urgent that we should be prepared for all scenarios and bring in all contingency measures, which are more essential than ever. The EU is offering to add guarantees to the small political declaration spelling out future trade. But Mr Barnier refused to change the Withdrawal Agreement - they key document that contains the backstop. The backstop is an insurance clause that would extend EU customs rules over the UKthere isnt a solution to keep the Irish border open.  Former Ukip leader Nigel Farage said the prospect of a no-deal Brexit had increased because of the attitude of Brussels fanatics who refused to compromise. He said Mrs May now realised the mistake made in agreeing to the backstop, adding: She signed up to something that no country - unless it had been defeated in war - would have signed up to. There was now an appreciation in Britain that unelected bureaucrats in Brussels have been talking down to and humiliating the Prime Minister of our nation, and we dont like it. He added: Many will say we are simply dealing with fanatics who are not prepared to be reasonable and make any sense of compromise.  Theresa May got MPs approval last night to seek either a time limit, an exit clause or alternative arrangements to the backstop. But Mr Barnier fumed: The backstop is part and parcel of the Withdrawal Agreement and this agreement will not be renegotiated. We need this backstop as it is.   Rejecting the backstop as it stands today boils down to rejecting the solution which was found with the British. He added: The European Council and the European Parliament, on several occasions, have already clearly rejected the idea of having a limit in time or leaving unilaterally. Because that would undermine the very idea of the backstop. It comes after Ireland steamrollered Theresa Mays wishful thinking new Brexit plan in a dire warning that shell be judged harshly in history - and rightly so.  Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney said EU chiefs have explored alternatives endlessly and they have all come up short. He said the Brexit deal, which includes the backstop, wont be reopened because we are quite simply running out of road. The Deputy PM suggested Ireland is willing to sacrice trade because some things that are more important than economic relationships. And accusing the UK of threats, he declared: It’s like saying give me what I want or I’m jumping out the window.

Something has finally happened on Brexit.What has happened is that the Tories have agreed to stop screaming up their own bumholes and scream at the EU instead. This will come as a relief to all those who witnessed their -month act of circular self-abuse, but they did at least give us a new definition for windbags.  This has been described as Theresa Mays best day at work since  by all those people who have not had enough fresh air recently. Her great success is that someone  has been able to unite the Tories around a version of Brexit that is impossible, impractical and undeliverable.They even managed to persuade  of the crazier members of the Labour Party to join them in this unmedicated dreamland, where the DUP have long gambolled in the insane belief it will reignite their holy war against the Fenians.The Tories have, for the first time in two and a half years, decided what they want. The problem is that it is the opposite of what Theresa has done or can do. On November , , she told the House of Commons: The Brexit talks are about acting in the national interest, and that means making what I believe to be the right choices, not the easy ones.I know there are some who have said I should simply rip up the UK’s commitment to a backstop, but this would have been an entirelyirresponsible course of action. It would have meant reneging on a promise made to the people of Northern Ireland during the referendum campaign and afterwards - that under no circumstances would Brexit lead to ato the borders of the past - and it would have made it impossible to deliver a withdrawal agreement.As Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, I have a responsibility to people in every part of our country, and I intend to honour that promise.And last night, she was told to do all the things she didnt want to do on the grounds that doing them would be f***ing disastrous. What has happened is this: . Theresa presented Plan A, which guaranteed the rights and safety of .m British citizens in Northern Ireland, and was punched in the face by Parliament which snarled stuff em.. Theresa presented Plan B, which was much the same but had a dferent letter on the front page, and Parliament said well maybe so long as we can decide to say stuff em later, slapped Theresa lightly and sent her back to Brussels. The EU are about to say alors, but you people cest tres thick. Theresas people are already briefing therell be a Plan C. And I can tell you now whats in it.  Plan C will have moved on signicantly from Plan B by being more like Plan A. Itll have the same words in much the same order, with very similar promises about protecting those .m British citizens with a backstop, and it will get voted through by Parliament for two reasons.First, theyve voted on it twice already, and have been dragged towards accepting a version of it. On the third time of asking, theyll be ready to back ANY version, in much the same way a man who has kicked himself in the head will wonderits possible to do it again.Imagine such a person, and you will have invented Iain Duncan Smith.  Secondly, there will be no other option.There is now no Parliamentary time left for Theresas deal to get the necessary legislation through before its self-imposed Article  deadline. There isnt even enough time for the new laws we need to trade under WTO rules in the event of a No Deal Brexit.By automatic operation of the law, on March  all EU treaties cease to be effective. Predicted results include motorways turning into lorry parks, medicines being rationed, the imposition of martial law and Jacob Rees-Mogg declaring an ancestral right to eat peasants. Even those Parliamentarians whove been hoarding gold and have a Barbudan bolthole dont want that sort of legacy hung around their neck, so extending the deadline is inevitable. And fortunately, the law they wrote about all this allows for a minister to change the exit date whenever they fancy. And most importantly there is no other option for the border in Northern Ireland. No way to take back control, no way to superimpose a UK referendum on to a people who had a referendum on this already, and managed a % mandate on an % turnout. People traffickers and drug smugglers dont fill in customs forms, weve no way to police a -mile border with  crossing points, and as the cherry on the cake elderly IRA bombers are coming out of retirement to make car bombs for new splinter groups.The only way all these things were resolved was with an open border, that allowed the unionists to remain British while allowing the republicans to pretend they were Irish.No-one has an alternative to that, and it is a fact of quite beautul irony that the only way anyones going to Brexit isthey refuse to take back control of our sole land border with the EU.So we wont Brexit on March , because we cant. Well call it Brexit a bit later, and it wont be because all this arguing was just to get us to the point where we could discuss what Brexit will look like. And it wont ever BE Brexit, because every power-crazed demand the backbench fruitloops have made has had to be dropped - when courts ruled it unlawful, when public opinion swung against them, and when Theresa persisted them into submission.Her problem is that all the Brexit chaos has been laid at her door. She has been blamed for the indecision, poor negotiation and infighting, for a dud election and international humiliation.Yet somehow, through either great stupidity or brilliant stratagem, she has forced her party and the country to agree what it never would have done in , a year or even  months ago. Leavers and Remainers now fervently believe any deal is better than none at all, appreciate Northern Irelands problems in a way few ever bothered to do, andthe polls are right are coming to the opinion that the current deal we have with the EU is the best of all possible worlds.What happened last night is that the hardliners have taken their latest of , tiny steps towards admitting their dream is just that. Thats why Theresa is stronger than ever, why the Labour Party is on the back foot and the EU is scratching its head.Sanity is beginning to reassert itself. It says do something, avert disaster, extract cranium from bum, ask yourselfthis is a good idea. All those Parliamentarians who complained Parliament was being undemocratic are now praising it for embodying the will of the people.Theres months and probably years more of arseing about, of course, and any group of people with a fetish for rectal screaming are probably going to try it a few times more before they realise it hurts too much.Sanity is not immediate. But it is there, flickering gently in the place where dreams meet geography.

And by and large he did. He began with a simple question. Would the Prime Minister set out the ‘alternative arrangements’ to the backstop she is seeking to negotiate  “Absolutely,” Theresa May replied and then spent several sentences doing the complete opposite. She referenced the Malthouse compromise and nodded to Sir Graham Brady’s amendment and waffled about a possible technical change but the one thing she consciously avoided doing in her long and rambling answer was explain what she wanted to achieve in the talks. Mr Corbyn then did what he rarely does, he made a joke.  “None of that was very clear to me and I doubt it was to anybody ,” he deadpanned. The Labour leader valiantly tried asking Mrs May which of her red lines she was willing to change in order to secure a deal. He then asked, somewhat mischievously, what technological advances did she expect to make in the next  days that could prevent a hard border in Ireland. Mrs May, who appeared oblivious to what had happened in the chamber last night, then accused Labour of not having a clear position on Brexit. There may be some truth in this but it was a bit rich from a leader whose strategy on Brexit was to spend two years negotiating a deal and then whip her own MPs to vote against it. The Prime Minister repeated the calumny by claiming her government had “won” last night’s vote on Brexit.  Technically, this is correct in terms of the votes passed but it is a strange victory which requires you to abandon everything you had achieved in the last  months and had previously insisted was the only deal on the table. Having run out of non answers the Prime Minister used her final response to list her government’s achievements - apparently more money is going to councils which will surprise anyone working in local government - before accusing Labour of having no plan for the economy. Some will conclude that whatever plan Labour has it can hardly be worse than the no deal with which this government continues to flirt.

Amber Peat was found sitting in the library, filled with worry, on one occasion after losing the belt from her coat, the hearing was told. Teacher Joanne Holland described how she had to call the youngsters mum because she was scared of going home and getting told off. During the phone conversation, Mrs Holland assured Ambers mother: We will find it, Nottinghamshire Coroners Court heard this week. She was worried about going home because she had lost the belt off her coat, the teacher told the court, according to the BBC. She basically said she was scared she was going to get told off. I had to phone home and tell mum, It really is fine, we will find it.   The encounter happened at the end of the school day, it was said. Amber was found hanged in  three days after she went missing from her home, following a row with her mum over household chores. The court has heard the argument was about cleaning a cool box, which was used to store food on a recent family holiday in Cornwall, where the youngster had hatched plans to run away with her cousin. Ambers mother Kelly Peat heard the front door slam shut shortly after the dispute at around .pm on May , , at the home in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, the inquest had been told. A passer-by saw somebody of Ambers description enter a hedgerow area near the address around  minutes later, it was said.  Up to  police staff were involved in the search for the missing youngster, before her body was tragically recovered on June . Speaking at the inquest, Mrs Holland, an ex-form tutor of Amber, described how the schoolgirl often tried to get attention. The teacher said she felt this could be because the student didnt get as much attention at home as would be considered normal. She recalled the youngsters habit of leaving an item behind after form time, so she couldto the classroom to retrieve it. She said she liked walking into a room filled with older students. Obviously the older students, because she was small and cute, were like, aww, look at Amber and she would love that, said Mrs Holland.  The teacher had been Ambers form tutor at Tibshelf Community School, but the pupil left the school before the end of her first year. Instead, she moved to Queen Elizabeth School in Mansfield . Another teacher has told the inquest that she didnt want to move. Before she vanished from her home before her death, the teenager had got into trouble for drinking Cherryade without permission. She had a history of running away, and Mrs Peat only called police to report her missing at .am on May , the inquest has heard. Detective Constable Tina Gilfoyle, of Nottinghamshire Police, said the mum and Ambers stepfather, Danny Peat, had been to Tesco and had tea while the youngster was missing.   Providing background of the the teenagers disappearance, Ms Gilfoyle said the family had moved  times in Ambers letime. The hearing has been told there was no evidence of physical neglect and no sign Amber was malnourished at the time of her death. Home Office pathologist Frances Hollingbury said there were no traces of alcohol or drugs in her body and no suggestion of a mental illness. A post-mortem found no evidence to suggest anyone  was involved. The inquest continues.

The study of , adults, including , dog owners, found those with a pet will walk more than  miles a week - covering almost  miles alone while taking their beloved pooch out for a stroll. In comparison, those without a dog to walk will travel less than  miles each week. It also emerged that not only are they fitter, but almost half of dog owners believe having a four-legged friend has improved their overall mental health and reduced their stress levels. Gemma Cunningham, spokesman for Lintbells, a manufacturer of natural joint supplements for pets which commissioned the research, said: “Dogs can be a great addition to the family and a real incentive to get out and spend some quality time with your family and friends.   It’s great to see that the results of the survey show how much our dogs have a positive impact on their owner’s lives. It is important to take time out of your busy schedule to exercise – both for your own and your canine’s overall health and well-being. “Just like humans, dogs are social beings and don’t welcome loneliness so getting out and exercising can be a perfect way to leading happier and healthier lives.” The study found the average pooch is taken on a walk an average of nine times a week, for  minutes on each occasion. With each walk covering almost two miles, that means a total of around five hours a week - or  days a year - is spent exercising the dog. More than a third of dog owners also said they walk further now than they did before getting their four-legged friend. And three quarters of non-dog owning adults wish they did more walking, with  per cent believing they would go out morethey had a pet to exercise.   It also found  per cent of dog owners believe their pet has made them more sociable while  per cent feel more connected to the community, with the average owner striking up two conversations with fellow dog lovers during each walk. Dog walking isnt always perfect though, as before pet owners even step outside the door there will be more than  family rows over ‘whose turn it is’ to take the pooch out each year. More than a third of dog owners also admit they try and pass the walk on to their children – an average of four times a month.The survey carried out via OnePoll also found that although  per cent of dog owners say they enjoy walking mans best friend, three in  blame poor weather for not getting out more often.A quarter don’t have time to walk their dog any more than they already do, while one in five are too busy with work issues. During the walk, dog owners also use  ‘poop bags’, play , games of fetch and call their pet’s name at least , times annually. Lintbells Gemma Cunningham added: “The winter months, especially January can make even the best of us feel down in the dumps. The cold dreary weather, post-Christmas blues and lack of sleep can make us feel sluggish and overweight. “At Lintbells, we have always emphasised the importance of staying active as it is the key to a happier and healthier lestyle, both mentally and physically. The results of this survey solidy this claim and we urge all dog and non-dog owners to set aside some time for exercise every day. If you’ve got a dog that’s the perfect motivator as well. “Dferent breeds and age dogs require dferent amounts of exercise, so we have developed a handy exercise calculator to check how many miles your dog would benefit from walking each week.”The new exercise calculator is entirely free to use and can be accessed on www.lintbells ."},{"url":null,"title":"kate middleton pays subtle tribute","story":"NewsKate Middleton pays subtle tribute to Princess Diana on latest outingKate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, wore a very special pair of earrings during her visit to the VA Museum in DindeeShareCommentsByZoe ForseyActing Audience Editor:,  JAN NewsKate wore a very special earrings \"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email The Duchess of Cambridge carries a constant reminder to her late mother-in-law Princess Diana with her every day - her stunning sapphire engagement ring.But during her latest official engagement Kate wore another of Dianas favourite items in a sweet tribute to the woman she never met.She opted for a striking Alexander McQueen tartan coat to officially open the VA Museum in Dundee, teamed with a pair of stunning sapphire drop earrings.

In just three weeks, Curtis Kelly has gained more than , followers on his @Cleanwithme Instagram account and counts the clean queen herself Mrs Hinch among his fans. He was inspired by the phenomenon Sophie Hinchclfe, who has .million followers, has appeared on This Morning and is releasing her own book, Hinch Yourself Happy, in April. And he might soon be giving the Essex hairdresser a run for her money with his before and after photo transformations. Curtis, who lives with is mum in Newtownards, Northern Ireland, “never ever expected” his mopping, scrubbing and hoovering stories would be such an inspiration to others, some who have credited him for helping them with depression.  The care worker told Belfast Live : “I broke my spine nine weeks ago and I thought to myself, ‘I’ll start an Instagram and it’ll just be something to do when I’m off work’. “I was putting up some Christmas lights and fell off a ladder straight on to the concrete. It was terrible. “When I was taken to AE in a neck brace, there was a question as to whether I would walk again as they were doing nerve tests and I couldn’t feel.” Thankfully, his feeling ed in a “couple of hours”.   “I am incredibly grateful and a lucky person to be able to come back from an injury like that,” he added. “I fractured three vertebrae in my back, which was agony.” Curtis was then “laid up for four weeks” and wasn’t allowed to drive. “When I was back up on my feet that’s when the Instagram came because I was bored on my own every day,” he said. “I just needed something.”   But Curtis said he never expected his page to take off, never mind inspire others facing their own troubles. He said: “It’s just exploded out of nowhere. “It’s a massive shock. It was a wee bit of fun, but it’s just escalated. “ Mrs Hinch follows my page and she messages me. I have always loved cleaning and when I saw her making her Instagram account, I thought ‘why not ’ to give me something to do.  “My Instagram account is to inspire and help people and show them my wee cleaning tips and the hacks that I do. “My mum tells me that from no age I was running about the house with my little cleaning trolly cleaning up behind people,” said Curtis. “It’s just something I have always been into and I take a lot of pride in having a clean house.” But he said “it came as a bit of a surprise” when people started reaching out to him.   “I thought people might watch and have a laugh at me cleaning as I dance about the house like a mad man,” he added. “I just didn’t think I’d become such an inspiration to people. I never ever expected that and I wouldn’t change it for the world. “I have had so many messages daily. There was one woman who told me she was depressed when her partner died years ago and she hadn’t touched his clothes. “I did a video where I cleared my wardrobe and sort of keeping sentimental things, but I put them in boxes somewhere.   “She said ‘I’m glad you did that, because it gave me the push I needed’. “It’s amazing getting messages from people saying I help them fight anxiety and depression, that, for me, makes it so worth it. While his videos are all about leaving making sure the house he shares with his mother is gleaming, they have also helped a Ballybeen woman with depression and anxiety, to get out of bed in the mornings.   The woman, who did not want to be named, said: “He is just amazing. “I live on my own and some days with my depression and social anxiety I can’t even get out the door or even get out of bed. But when I switch on my Instagram, I watch him and Mrs Hinch and they are just enough for me to just get up out of bed and do even the tiniest wee thing like making my bed and sitting in the living room. “They can inspire me to do that. They just make me feel that little bit more human.”   Meanwhile, Curtis has revealed his number one cleaning tip. Get music on when you’re cleaning, he said. “I stick the music on and dance about the house and do each room one at a time. Just have fun with it. It’s not the funnest thing to do and a lot of people don’t enjoy it like I do. “But when you do it one room at a time and get your favourite play list or artist on, it just makes it so much easier.” "},{"url":null,"title":"man universal credit barricades jobcentre","story":"NewsUniversal Credit row sees man barricade Jobcentre because he had p in his pocketSteve Bailey, , said he wanted money from Bolton job centre to set up a dog grooming market stallShareCommentsByTom DavidsonOnline Reporter:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsSteve Bailey blockades the entrance to Boltons Jobcentre \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man on Universal Credit barricaded the entrance to a Jobcentre because they would not give him money to set up a dog grooming market stall.

Seriously MS! She added: Just to put it in perspective, in India firstly there is no such thing as a veg biryani. Most places will serve mutton or chicken or even fish. Its wrong on many levels when people will assume this is what a biryani looks like! Biryani needs rice, isnt stuffed in bread and doesnt include lettuce.   More than  people liked her tweet, with many taking the time to share their thoughts. One person replied: OMG a complete abomination and wrong on every single level. SO tired of all these brands and supermarkets plundering and murdering other people’s cuisines. Genuinely should be illegal. Another commented: Im on hold to the police. A third added: Eurgh! What were they thinking    Darjeeling Express, a Soho-based Indian restaurant, also shared their disgust about the wrap. They wrote: This is wrong at SO many levels - who are you paying to design your wraps @marksandspencer  You seriously need to rethink your exotic wrap selection. That is not biryani - you do not appropriate names from a cuisine without even bothering to do any research. However not everyone was opposed to trying the new MS offering.   A dferent Twitter user posted: I tried one, not bad but not enough spice. As a veggie its nice to find a sandwich I can buy when in a hurry.Meanwhile, Chef Vivek Singh, of Cinnamon Club, London, told The Times people accusing MS of cultural appropriation should loosen up.He continued: People in Britain love biryani as much as most of us from the sub-continent. Having cooked professionally for  years, I think a vegetarian biryani is just as authentic as anything . Responding to the backlash, a spokesperson for Marks  Spencer said: MS is famous for its food innovation and our developers use a fusion of dferent flavours and ingredients to create an exciting range of products to appeal to customers tastes.

The -year-old Duchess of Sussex looked stunning as she stepped out in a pound, nude tailored blazer with matching pound, v-neck mini dress by designer Brandon Maxwell. She teamed the outfit with her pound. Carolina Herrera clutch, which she debuted at Trooping the Colour last year, and her classic pound Aquazzura Matilde heels that she wore for her engagement announcement. The smiling Duchess also wore her hair in a chic up-do for her first visit to the theatre in Londons Southbank since taking over as patron from the Queen. A chorus of cheers were heard from fans gathered outside to catch a glimpse of the mum-to-be as she stepped out the car.  She was greeted by Rufus Norris, director of the National Theatre, who reportedly said after the visit that the Duchess ‘has her own production’ to be getting on with and revealed Meghan had talked about her interest in Greek tragedies. She also met with carpenters, metalworkers and other craftsman preparing the sets before watching a performance inspired by War Horse by pupils from Edith Neville Primary School in Camden. It was announced earlier this month that the former actress was succeeding the Queen as the organisations patron, a role Her Majesty held for almost five decades.  The visit will no doubt have brought back memories of the career that thrust Meghan into the spotlight - and helped her bag her prince. She spent a decade working as an actress in television, where she was best known for her role in the hit US legal drama series Suits, playing paralegal-turned-lawyer Rachel Zane. She also has a theatre background having studied theatre and international relations at Northwestern University, Illinois, and volunteered at a performing arts after-school programme for children in underprivileged school districts in Los Angeles. And as we previously reported , Meghans father Thomas Markle made numerous sacrices so she could fulfil her dream of becoming a performer. He is the person who believed in this grand dream of mine well before I could even see it as a possibility, she previously said   Thomas also worked as a lighting director on two television shows. It was while accompanying her father, that a young Meghan got a taste of what le was like to be an actress. She was surrounded by famous actors, their glam teams, multi-million dollar budgets, and crew lunches that always included filet mignon and enough sweets to make you think you were at Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory. As she went from audition to audition trying to make it as an actress, it was Thomas who put gas in her car so she could get to them. Suits was her big break and she described it as stealing her heart and being the Goldilocks of my acting career – where finally I was just right.. Her patronage with the National Theatre is a natural fit as she is a strong believer in using the arts to bring people from dferent backgrounds and communities together.  The theatre accidentally announced Meghans patronage in an online gaffe - a day before Kensington Palace was set to confirm it. It said in a statement: The National Theatre is honoured to announce thatHer Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussexhas become its Royal Patron. The patronage reflects Her Royal Highness’s belief in using the arts to bring people from dferent backgrounds and communities together. Her Majesty The Queen has passed on the Royal Patronage to The Duchess of Sussex having held the role for the last  years and has been associated with the organisation since its earliest days at the Old Vic in the s.   The Duchess has spent decades championing the arts and feels that she can use her position to focus attention on and make a particular dference to the sector. Meanwhile, Prince Harry in his role of Commonwealth Youth Ambassador, met young people from across the Commonwealth at a roundtable discussion at Lancaster House this morning. The Duke heard from young people about the issues that are key to them in the run up to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting  .   He also gave a speech and said: I can honestly say I feel more passionate than ever about the huge opportunity we have here. To empower young people across the Commonwealth, you who are here in this room today, and the millions around the world who are part of this global collective of change makers. Tomorrow Meghan will also be visiting the Association of Commonwealth Universities tohear more about how it is working to promote inclusion and access to education for underrepresented groups. While on Friday, the Duchess and Prince Harry are heading to Bristol where they will visit the Bristol Old Vic theatre.

A study of , workers found more than half want their staff benefits to help improve their work le balance and  per cent want added extras which will save them money. And while younger adults highlight the need for help with housing, older generations are more concerned with private healthcare. Access to mental health care is also more important to those who started working this decade than to those who began their careers in any decade before.   It also emerged fewer than one in five are currently totally satisfied with the benefits package provided by their employer. And half of employees would leave their current employmentthey thought they could get a position where with more perks, with just  per cent preferring extra pay over comprehensive benefits. Steven Osei, spokesman for the Preferential Partnerships programme at Get Living, said: It’s no surprise that employees’ attitudes to workplace benefits have changed over the last five decades since the world we live in is almost unrecognisable now. “Employees are moving jobs more often, increasingly working from home and expecting to be compensated for their dedication. “To keep up with the competition, employers need to reflect workers more flexible lestyles.” The study also revealed employees who started their working le in  or later are most likely to want pets in the office, and free breakfast supplies. And the demand for company-expensed dental care has decreased over the decades, with nearly a quarter of older workers feeling it should be offered as standard by employers. This compares to just nine per cent of people who started their careers during this decade. Free tea and coffee is most valued by workers aged between -, with over-s the most likely to seek out an enhanced pension contribution.   People aged between - cite unlimited holiday days as the most attractive perk they think a company could offer. It also emerged employees who have been working the longest are most satisfied with their current benefits package, with those starting work in the s the least happy. Although more people who started work during this decade are currently looking for a job with better benefits than any other workers. But unusually, younger workers are also most likely to stay in their jobs because the benefits are too good to pass up.More than six in  workers who took part in the survey, conducted through OnePoll , believe their employer has a responsibility to look after their personal well-being.And workers agree they have become more demanding of their employers due to the hours spent at work, increased retirement age and the always-on nature of work making them feel their companies should offer more for their service. Get Living works with employers through its Preferential Partnerships programme to learn the challenges their people face living and commuting in the city where they work and offer a better way of renting.   Steven Osei added: “If a company wants to attract the top talent then they need to offer the best benefits, especially in London where the cost of living is leading to a brain drain. Since beginning the Preferential Partnerships programme, we’ve been working with top employers to create solutions for the challenges that their employees face when it comes to finding a place to live. “In this hyper-connected world an employer’s duty of care no longer ends at the office door. Well-being starts at home and we can support this by offering a simple move in process and quality, well-managed homes. “We know from speaking to our partners that this takes a weight off staff who are relocating or moving to a new city when starting a new job. We hope the success of this scheme will encourage more companies to take a vested interest in their employees’ living situations.” The most attractive workplace benefits - by age - .

Most of the expensive presents are given to her on dates with men, whose ages range from  to -years-old. But the mum from East London insists that she doesnt have sex with them.She told Sun Online about how she was inspired into escorting while she worked in an office on minimum wage.  She was talking to a friend about her money woes who encouraged her to pay it off by working as an escort. I wasn’t sure at first, but when my mate explained I’d get good money and wouldnt need to have sex with anybody, I went for it - I had no close family to help me out and I was desperate, she said. Michelle was advised to start advertising via a social media site called Faceparty. Here, she uploaded pictures and explained she was available for dates. Clients began to flood in from ious backgrounds - including one woman. She added: Clients don’t pay me for my time - but,they want to, they give me gt.

Others have handed over pound, worth of diamonds, an pound dress and treated her to food at Michelin-starred restaurants. Michelle claims that businessmen say women at work will try to seduce them and fall pregnant so that they prefer to have a woman as their plus one at events to scare them off.  She ensures she is safe in every situation, checking the location and escape points beforehand. Clients also request specic outfits and makeup depending on their taste. Michelle claims that many of her clients have fallen in love with her and she has been asked to move to Dubai by one client in her own flat - but she turned him down.

ITV carried out a survey of , people to determine which is Britains favourite breed, and the beloved Staffie was officially declared the top dog.The vast majority of Mirror readers reacting to the story on Facebook were pleased the breed is finally getting positive recognition, with many applauding the pups loyal, loving and soft nature that make them great family pets.Some Twitter users were keen to debunk the dogs bad rep in light of the news, posting adorable snaps of their dangerous and vicious pooches.   However, there was still some viewers expressing their dismay at the results, with several social media users describing the dogs as dangerous - but staffie lovers have quickly defended them. One wrote: Staffies are dangerous dogs. Who is even questioning this  Potentially dangerous to people and certainly to other animals, cats and dogs included.To which another Twitter user replied: I grew up with a staffie and she was the most loving and protective dog. If you bring them up to be dangerous, they will be. Idiot. Another wrote: Already seen a few morons calling them ugly chav dogs and vicious baby killers I honestly believe these muppets are in the minority and I hope our pooches will be given the credit theyre due. So why is it there still stigma associated with the breed  According to the Dogs Trust its partly down to the dogs fighting history which has tarnished the breed with the dangerous dog label, as well as their muscular appearance. A spokesperson for the charity told : There are lots of misconceptions and myths around theStaffordshire Bull Terrier, probablydue to their stocky and muscular appearance.However, it’s important to remember that there is greater iation in behavioural characteristics within breeds than between them - so we cant judge a dog by its appearance any more than a book by its cover.As with any breed of dog, the majority of Staffies are amazing, happy, friendly and fun members of the family - behaviouralproblems only arise where they dont have good early le socialisation, consistent interactions and positive training. The charity said it often sees a lot of Staffies at their centres due to over-breeding, or dogs being handed in by people who may not have realised how much care and attention they really need. Last year  Staffies and Staffie crosses were adopted across the Dogs Trusts network of rehoming centres. We see first-hand the positive dference these dogs make to their owners lives, sowe were delighted to see this breed crowned as the nations favourite, Dogs Trust added.We hope this boost for Staffies will encourage people to embrace the affectionate and loyal qualities that we know are so true of the breed.

Yuma Shinohara, , called the bug his “first love” and said though the relationship was platonic he fantasised about bedding her - either with himself insect-sized or with Lisa being human-sized. He also said that no human girl was as “hot” as Lisa and that they were “ per cent serious” about each other. But events took an even more macabee turn when Lisa died - and Yuma ate her.  Yuma is an entomophagist, which means he advocates and practises eating insects as an alternative to meat for environmental reasons. He is well known for organising bug eating contest in his native Japan. In a video interview with Asian Boss, Yuma said he bought Lisa as an African farm-reared cockroach and that he believed they could communicate with each other. He also said that as a entomophagist it was only natural he ate her once she died. Yuma added: “I did it with reverence.   The day she passed away was dficult but I knew it had to come since she was a cockroach with a short le span. So now Lisa lives in my heart and continues living as part of my body. Eating insects is becoming more popular as an alternative to meat because less land is used for farming and less damage is caused to the environment as a result.   Yuta said he does eat other food but there was a wide iety of tastes among edible insects. For instance, caterpillars which eat cherry blossom taste like rice cake, he added.

It was written for Count Friedrich Wilhelm, supposedly simplied for amateurs to play. However, Jamal and Jâms being master musicians showed the power of this often disregarded piece, to be immense. One of the first works to make piano and cello equal musical partners, it is full of ingenious dialogue between the instruments. The structure is unusual, but with such expert performers it delighted the audience who were moved by every turn and twist of this deeply emotional work.Jâms, from North Wales, after remarking on the three ferry crossings required to get to Ardrishaig via Bute, introduced the next piece, Ernest Bloch’s work ‘From Jewish Le’. In a style close to Jamal’s heart and heritage, having been born in Baku Azerbaijan, its three elements, ‘Prayer’, ‘Supplication’ and ‘Jewish Song’, are full of the pathos and sorrow felt by the Jewish nation and also full of the signature augmented intervals and minor key tonality of much of middle eastern musics. How beautully these pieces demonstrated the lyrical qualities of the cello. Jamal’s bow searched for all possible nuances of tone and dynamic as his instrument sang from its lowest notes to a seductive soprano register.The concert continued after the interval with a second Beethoven work. The audience may have noticed a minor kerfuffle at the piano as many pages were rapidly turned before starting. Would it be the ‘Seven Variations’ for cello and piano or the ‘Twelve’, both based on themes from Mozart’s Magic Flute  The ‘Seven Variations’ won, being on the theme from the ‘Pamina’ and ‘Papageno’ duet entitled ‘In men, who know the feeling of love’. This work exhibits Beethoven’s practised ingenuity in the iation form and brought a lighter mood to the programme.Jâms Coleman introduced the final work, Frank Bridge’s Cello Sonata. He told of the four years of torment for the composer as he struggled to express his feelings about the First World War, finally finishing the composition in . The adagio in the piece caused the composer the most dficulty as he struggled with ambivalence about his own pacist views. Jâms and Jamal dealt with the challenges of this complex work which tracks huge changes in the world of music composition that were under way at that time. Again, the lyrical powers of the cello came to the fore as did the virtuosic requirements heaped on the pianist. Despite its undoubted innovations, this piece generously reaches out to its audience. Bridge uses the new musical freedoms only when justied, being happy toto more traditional tonal stability in the lyrical sections.Fulfilled, but not overburdened by the weightiness of the final piece, the audience applauded Jamal and Jâms back to the concert room to perform the ‘Swan’ from Saint-Saens ‘Carnival of the Animals’ as encore. This piece so beautully confirmed the excellence of Jamal’s playing and the superb quality of his quite special instrument.PIC:Jamal Aliyev and Jâms Coleman. no_aJamalandJam"},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray carpet bowling club festive pairs competition","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Inveraray Carpet Bowling Club held its annual festive pairs competition.The first prize of turkeys was won by George Morrison and Alan Cameron.

Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.

But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending. And were the team with the best defensive record in the league. I think a draw would’ve been fair but it’s just one of those nights. It’s a dficult one to take to get beat.They’re a big strong team and at times we didn’t cope with that.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsAyr United FC"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13927335.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS122635663.jpg","title":"exclusive uk government announce 100","story":"NewsEXCLUSIVE: UK Government to announce £ million for Ayrshire Growth DealThe long awaited Growth Deal will be rubber stamped tomorrowwith the regions economy set to receive a \"massive boost\".Share with the regions economy set to receive a massive boost.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _JS.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\" with the regions economy set to receive a massive boost.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _JS.jpg\" data-tracking\"messenger|share|\" with the regions economy set to receive a massive boost.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _JS.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\" with the regions economy set to receive a massive boost.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _JS.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\" with the regions economy set to receive a massive boost.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _JS.jpg\" data-tracking\"linkedin|share|\" with the regions economy set to receive a massive boost.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _JS.jpg\" data-tracking\"flipboard|share|\" with the regions economy set to receive a massive boost.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _JS.jpg\" data-tracking\"email|share|\"ByStephen Houston:,  JAN NewsSecretary of State for Scotland David Mundell will announce the investment \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe UK Government is handing over pound million to try and make Ayrshire great for employment again. It is the first solid guarantee in the long-awaited Ayrshire Growth Deal.The nine-figure sum will be announced by Scots Secretary David Mundell tomorrow, the Ayrshire Post can exclusively reveal.Sources say he will reveal the jackpot figure during a visit to the Halo urban regeneration on the old Johnnie Walker whisky land in Kilmarnock. A senior source said: “The UK Government’s contribution to the Ayrshire Growth Deal will be in the region of pound million. “It’s clear from the growth deal process that a lot of very exciting projects have been put forward. We are confident the deal can deliver a massive boost to the local economy.” The Ayrshire Growth Deal will provide signicant investment in the key sectors of aerospace and space at Prestwick, le sciences, manufacturing and tourism. It has been talked about for years as a poundm fund but the Scottish Government and three Ayrshire councils have all failed to reveal their financial input. The aim is to make key investments that will grow the economy and lead to , new jobs.  To do that the poundm public sector finance will have to trigger poundbillion of private investment. It is widely accepted Ayrshire has missed out on big investment deals as it has three councils scrapping for superiority, rather than a single strategic voice. Growth money is expected to be spent on luring a medicines manufacturing innovation centre, developing brownfield sites for industry, improving the Bellfield Interchange, upgrading digital infrastructure and free port status at Prestwick , the Port of Ayr and Falkland Rail Yard in Ayr and a renewable energy hub in Cumnock. It is expected the signing of heads of terms - the stage when all the ious partners get together and announce which projects will receive funding - will be reached within several months. All seven of Scotland’s cities are now covered by the deals and Ayrshire is in the first wave of regions. The poundm for Ayrshire takes total UK Government commitment to pound. billion across Scotland. List MSP Brian Whittle said: “Along with investment by the Scottish Government in our transport network, the Ayrshire Growth Deal can supercharge the area’s economy for the coming years.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnWhiskyAyrKilmarnockEconomyPrestwickCumnockAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13927636.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS160381835.jpg","title":"south ayrshire voters urged say","story":"NewsSouth Ayrshire voters urged to have their say on £million budget cutsCouncil chiefs admit they have no firm proposals on the table - but will head for a public showdown.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN NewsBudget problems are mounting\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCouncil chiefs are to ask the public how they feel ahead of poundmillion budget cuts next month.

It was a cold day but my friend, who is skilled in bushcraft, had brought his portable fire pit with him.We searched for drtwood and sat by the fire, roasting marshmallows and warming our hands. It was a short walk but dramatic rock formations loomed above us, making it feel like a real adventure. The kids climbed them and explored the rocky beach, where once there had been an open-air bathing pool.On our , we went through a small tunnel-like arch. I stopped for a moment, suddenly taken by the view. The ruins of Dunbar Castle were beautully framed by the archway. Locals call this archway the keyhole and I reflected that the term is a perfect name.When we look through a keyhole, our vision is narrowly focussed. Such was the effect here. It cast a visual spotlight on what is left of what was once a mighty fortress.The kids trundled on before me, noticing smaller wonders: a frozen worm on the path, a sea shell and interesting-looking stones. But I stood for some moments, taking in the view beyond and thinking of what stories those old stones of the castle could tell.Many people pass this way every day, both locals and visitors. Itrsquos a section of the John Muir Way. I have often been with my family to Dunbar Leisure Pool and the harbour and town. But somehow I had missed this short but spectacular nearby walk until this day.Dunbar Castle is now but a fallen-down ruin. Indeed, itrsquos dficult to imagine what it once was. But the weathered sandstone castles on the shoreline built by nature still stand defiant, somehow reminding us of their greater permanence in the face of human transience. But as I stood looking at the ruins, the keyhole focussed my thoughts as well as my vision.History is also viewed through a keyhole, a very narrow one. The lives and events of the castle were lived in most part unrecorded by it. The spotlight of history has illuminated only brief moments, and even then the characters have been only those deemed lsquoimportantrsquo.There are moments where the view through the narrow keyhole of history has included insights to untold stories. The bravery of Black Agnes, as she defied the siege in , is one of those. With her husband away, she was in charge of this important fortress during war with England. She refused to give up the castle, even in the face of bombardment and attempts to starve her small garrison into submission. Her mocking of her besiegers by dusting down the battlements with her maids after a bombardment is an image seared in legend.But itrsquos a chink of light on a huge untold story we are led to believe by historyrsquos silence that women were insignicant players in events. For sure they were oppressed and put down by a system that centred on male power, but they are half of humanity and at least half the story.As the actions of Black Agnes reveal, even with such constraints put on them, women were there, part of events and often refusing to accept their assigned role.The le of Mary Queen of Scots has always been for me an example of this. Yes, she was privileged and powerful by birth, but because of this history took notice of her.Despite all the political and religious challenges she faced, it was her womanhood which men deemed her main failing. And so she was judged by dferent standards. Had she behaved with the morals of her father she would not have lasted five minutes in power. But no one raised an eyebrow because he was a man.But more than this, even though Mary was the monarch, her royal authority was deemed diluted and even less legitimate merely because she was a woman.So she understood she needed to find a husband to bring her royal authority to full strength in a country full of powerful and bullying misogynist men.She chose the dashing young Darnley, and the fact that he turned out to be dross was not, in my opinion, Maryrsquos fault. How easy it is to blame a woman for a manrsquos failings. She was taken in by him it was he who was the failure, not her.Thatrsquos what Irsquove always maintained, despite the protestations of my tutors at university. And her third husband Bothwell, well he was a disappointment as well.It is the stones of Dunbar,they could speak, who could tell us of the truth of his forced union with Mary. She had been taken there by him in April . The circumstances of this still remain debated. Was she abducted by him as later claimed, or did she go willingly It was also claimed she was raped and forced to marry Bothwell soon afterwards to save her honour . This idea has been disputed by some because Mary is said to have miscarried with twins while imprisoned at Lochleven Castle some months after, suggesting a relationship with Bothwell even before Darnleyrsquos murder. So a woman cannot be abused by a man she has had a relationship with  Really If they could talk, the stones of Dunbar would whisper the truths of those events in , and the despair and desperation of a strong and clever woman whose destiny was stolen mainly because of her sex.These were my thoughts as I stood looking through the keyhole towards Dunbar Castle. Suddenly, my daughter Manja broke my trance by wiggling the frozen worm in front of me. I smiled and thought to myself that thankfully times have changed since the days when the castle was a fortress.But sometimes, I fear, not as much as we think they have."},{"url":null,"title":"new-fidra-gin-hoping-for-east-lothian-base","story":"Fidra Gin is the brainchild of Emma Bouglet and Jo Brydie and is currently based at Ballencrieff and Aviemore.The duo came together to create the juniper berry-based drink and have already enjoyed immediate success, with the product already available in a number of Edinburgh restaurants.Now they are hoping to make it  per cent based in the county, with plans under way to find suitable premises.Emma said: ldquoWe pick all the botanicals in East Lothian and, at the moment, we use a still in Aviemore.ldquoA friend has lent us his still for the time being so we can get enough momentum behind us and bring the whole operation to East Lothian.ldquoWe have potentially secured a premise in East Lothian.

So Paisley Opera commissioned a brand new English translation of the libretto from Lindsay Bramley, and she consulted the chorus-members over details of the local vernacular to create a version of the doomed love of Mimi and Rudolfo that is set in Paisley and right now. The food and the drink, the toys and the clothes, the patter and the insults, are all instantly recognisable ndash and making opera accessible is what Paisley Opera is all about. The new libretto is full of memorable lines, like Schaunardrsquos assessment of Musettarsquos wealthy beau Alcindoro: ldquoWhat a spanner! Where did she find him In the Parish Hall of St Mirinrsquos Cathedral, the company has gathered for rehearsal. The principals have been working on their parts in Glasgow all afternoon with conductor Alistair Digges, and now they are combining with the chorus and young people director Fiona Williams has found through schools workshops, to run through the wonderful Act  of Puccinirsquos masterpiece. It was one of the main reasons the team chose Boheme as their first full- repertoire work.ldquoAct  is one of the best pieces of theatre ever written, says Williams unequivocally. ldquoThere is so much going on, and so much for the performers to get their teeth into. Rather than have the chorus work as a single unit, we have the chance to give people inidual roles alongside the big chorus numbers, so people are cast as specic characters.She is not alone in her assessment of the wonder of the Cafeacute Momus sequence in La Boheme. In his biography of Puccini, critic Conrad Wilson wrote: ldquoIn Boheme the music is the action, and the action the music, in a manner new to opera. This is what makes the vividly exact musical depiction of every incident in Act  unique in operatic history.Baritone Simon Hannigan, a regular with Scottish Opera and where, established the company after moving to Paisley with his we and finding a community spirit that matched his desire to found a community opera company.ldquoThe whole thing about Paisley Opera is trying to make opera accessible and we wanted to do something that was not too long and had a strong, powerful story that we could easily update.Adds Williams: ldquoWe were looking for was a piece that would be musically fantastic, and give some young professional singers really juicy roles, but also give us a dferent way of engaging with our audience.ldquoWhen we performed Witches in Paisley Abbey it was a front-on presentation, while this has a promenade feel to Act   , and Lindsay Bramley has done an amazing job, with the input of the chorus, in creating a piece that is for Paisley in , in the language of it. That has been an important interactive process.Williams has been part of the creative team in Paisley with Hannigan since the pair worked together on a production of Verdirsquos Simon Boccanegra in Fulham and Paisley Opera was only a germ of an idea.Says Hannigan: ldquoWe wanted a genuinely community-based company, so we put stuff out on Facebook and put posters up in shops asking people to come and join Paisley Opera ndash it doesnrsquot matteryou have never sung before. It was coincidental that it happened at the same time as the City of Culture bid, but fortunate because Renfrewshire Council were putting money into artistic ventures and they generously funded the first show and now a large part of this one too. It was a very happy coincidence.ldquoAt our first meeting  people turned up, and we now have really strong core of people who love it and love singing. Surprisingly few were from other choirs, and a lot just fancied trying singing and had never been to an opera. One of our tenors came up to me after one of our pop-up performances at the Piazza in Paisley and askedit was OKcame along although he had only ever sung on the football terraces. Hersquos great and really throws himself into it.ldquoWitches was the first experience on a stage for many of the chorus, and then Scottish Opera came and did Pagliacci, which a lot of our people did, and that was a great experience. The fact that we were on their doorstep was good for Scottish Opera too, and that has made our singers more ready to do this.Williams echoes how the work of the company has developed: ldquoWitches was written specially, and a blend of poetry, dialogue and music with big choruses that fitted the drama. This is a completely dferent beast and in the process the company as a whole has become much more cohesive.ldquoYou get to know dferent personalities and dferent voices that you can work with. There is a real spirit that has developed over the last  months, and I think that will come across in the central section of Boheme.In the church hall there is evidence aplenty of that being the case, as the challenging ebb and flow of Act  is bashed into shape, with trestle tables, crutches and imaginary trolleys pressed into service as improvised set and props occupying the whole notional stage space. Director Fiona Williams and conductor Alistair Digges are more interested in telling the company what has to be achieved and letting the performers find the best way to that result than in telling them what to do ndash and the fluid nature of the performance in rehearsal reflects exactly how the work will be staged at the University of the West of Scotland on Paisley High Street.ldquoAct , in the impoverished young artistsrsquo flat, is on a thrust stage with a seated audience, explains Williams. ldquoThen wersquoll bring people through into the big foyer space at UWS for the Christmas Market for Act , where you will actually be able to do some shopping. There will be a cake stall with real cakes for sale, andyou are very lucky Alan will sell you a beer.ldquoAct  will also play in that space, and then everyone willto the intimacy of the flat for Act . So it is a mix of promenade and sit-and-watch, and people who come will get the chance to be both the audience and an interactive member of the crowd.With an  piece specially-assembled band of freelancers playing a reduced version of the score, the musicians will be part of the action as well, buskers who will be happy to accept donations flung into their instrument cases.With its teacakes and Tennents, doner kebabs and chicken tikka, Playstation and X-box, River City and St Mirren, this Boheme may have come a long way from a garret in Paris, but the seeds of its interaction were sown by Puccini in his masterful Act  at the end of the th century.Paisley Operarsquos La Boheme is at the University of the West of Scotland, High Street, Paisley at pm on February  and  and pm on February  and ."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-dinosaurs-and-chocolate-shortages","story":"In a fixMIND you, talking of daughters, a reader heard a young woman on the train into town tell her pal: \"Looking back, my le started going downhill when I had to look after my car maintenance instead of my dad doing it.\"Gingerly speakingTHE utterly pompous TV presenter Piers Morgan described young Green MSP Ross Greer as a \"thick ginger turd\" as he took exception to Ross criticising his hero Winston Churchill.

He worked ‘On the Beat’ for a few years and was then asked to set up the first dog unit in the area. He and Rennie were the sole members of the unit to start with but Sandy gradually built up a team of handlers and dogs.After setting up the dog unit Sandy went on to set up the Underwater Diving Unit for the Force and also the Specialist Policing Unit based at Aberdeen Airport. Sandy retired as a Sergeant in Bucksburn in .Speaking about the celebration Instructor PC Steve Warden said: “We are delighted to have Sandy back in the unit today to help us celebrate  years of the North East Dog Unit. Since founding the unit, there have been hundreds of dogs and handlers who have all worked hard to help keep people safe here in the North East. We are a very special unit and we assist operational colleagues on all manner of calls from locating missing people, searching for items such as weapons, evidence and drugs and helping control volatile or aggressive situations. “Despite the many changes in policing in the North East over the last  years, it is great that the dog unit has remained and developed. We have a very strong team with a mix of experience but with the same dedication to the unit and the job. We hope that the North East Dog Unit enjoys many more decades of work.” As part of the celebration, Mr Reid has donated Rennie’s original collar and dog tag which is engraved stating that Rennie was owned by the Chief Constable of Aberdeen City Police and has been framed as a lasting memento.Retired officer, Sandy Reid added: “I have kept in touch with the Unit since I retired more than  years ago and it was great to celebrate this milestone with them today. The current dog handlers face much of the same challenges I did. It is a ied and exciting job to have but the most special element is the unique bond which develops from working and training with your dog.”PC Laura Fairbairn has been a police officer for  years and recently completed her dog handler training at the Scottish Police Dog Training Centre. PD Ava is a two year old German Shepherd who was bred in the Czech Republic and sourced by the national dog unit last summer. Ava and Laura were paired up during Laura’s initial training and have been putting into practice what they have learned during their training.Speaking about her new role PC Fairbairn said: “I’m really pleased and excited to be part of the dog unit. It’s a unique team and very dferent to the roles I’ve held within the police so far. Ava and I are getting on great. She’s a really good dog and we’ve bonded really well. She’s a general purpose dog so we get called to tracking and tracing calls at the moment.\"Once we’ve developed our experience and expertise I’ll take on a second specialist dog such as a drugs or explosives dog.

We are also very aware there needs to be some internal structural alterations.Given the urgency, the board is using its capital reserves to order the new air handling unit which is should be installed in March.ldquoIf the equipment breaks down between now and then, the pool will have to close, Mrs Manson said. ldquoSome people attend the pool on a weekly basis and that is what keeps them going.

In recent years their numbers have been rising, while the number of spec­ialist ASN teachers has fallen.During a debate in the Scottish Parliament, MSPs from all parties praised the intentions of the system, which is supposed to ensure that children do not feel left out or excluded from schools.But some claimed that the system was putting an extra burden on already overstretched teachers and in some cases actively hindered the education of the children it was supposed to help. Tory MSP Jeremy Balfour said he had received a letter from a parent with a child in P who recently requested that her son was taken out of the mainstream school he was attending.“He spends  per cent of his time out of the classroom working independently with an adult,” he said. “He doesn’t have any friends, he is lonely, isolated and hates going to school. Can I suggest... that this is a time when mainstreaming has gone too far – when we’re not looking at every child, looking at his or her needs.”“If people are being excluded from the classroom,even worse they are standing alone in the playground every break time, then they are missing out.”Mr Balfour also said that some ASN pupils could be disruptive, claiming he had spoken to teachers who felt like “more like policemen” due to a daily struggle to control classes.Labour’s Johann Lamont said she supported the mainstreaming policy, but criticised ministers for failing to offer enough support to teachers and monitor how it was affecting pupils.Larry Flanagan, the general secretary of the EIS, said the levels of ASN provision in schools was “one of the top concerns” raised by classroom staff.“Teachers want to provide the best possible educational experience for all young people, but years of austerity cuts to ASN resources and staffing have left schools struggling to meet the specialist requirements of pupils,” he said.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4864434.1548784851!/image/image.jpg","title":"alexander mccall smith a literary paradise in india s pink city","story":"The Jaipur Literature Festival, which this year attracted the likes of Irvine Welsh, Indian intellectuals such as Shashi Tharoor, Bollywood singers and Jeffrey Archer, does not charge for tickets, giving this remarkable and magnicent event a democratic feel, writes Alexander McCall Smith.I am writing this column from Jaipur, the Pink City, the capital of the Indian state of Rajasthan. Outside my window, in the grounds of the hotel – a -year-old maharajah’s palace, converted now to commercial use, as is the lot of many palaces in India – a peacock struts. Peacocks are the last bastion of unashamed, shamelessly self-advertisingmasculine flamboyance, but their time of reckoning will no doubt come. The peahens lurk in the bushes, more modest, more hard-working, I imagine, while their fancy partners draw all the admiring glances.Earlier today, on the Oriental Lawn of the hotel, a touching ceremony took place. It is Republic Day, the th anniversary of the promulgation of the Indian Constitution, a document that guided this vastly populous democracy through the sometimes trying second half of the th century and into its exciting and very dferent present. To mark this, the hotel staff, splendidly liveried, some wearing turbans with long colourful tails, lined up before a flagstaff. The national anthem was sung – rare amongst national anthems a lively, infectious tune. Then as the Indian flag, bunched up at the top of the pole, was released, flower petals fluttered from its folds, creating a settling orange cloud. After that, a tug-of-war took place on the lawn between, on the one side, management, smartly suited, and on the other the hotel’s security staff in their impressive unorms. Unfortunately for the security side, their shining black shoes had slippery soles, and they were easily defeated by the combined managers and waiters.: Alexander McCall Smith: Time to wake up and smell Europa’s coffee Jaipur has been en fête, not only because of Republic Day, but for the Jaipur Literature Festival, one of the most remarkable and magnicent literary festivals in the world. The Festival is in large measure the creation of three active imaginations – Sanjoy Roy, and the two founders, the writer Namita Gokhale and the Scottish author and historian, William Dalrymple. Willy, a member of a talented Scottish family, has devoted his le to writing about India, a country which he has portrayed in a series of works written since he was in his early s. His net has widened since the publication of his highly regarded White Mughals, with a book on Afghan history and a recent biography of the Koh-i-Noor diamond. He has also explored Indian beliefs in his Nine Lives, a study of the mosaic of religious systems that exist in this most spiritual of countries.Jaipur started modestly, as all literary festivals must do, but soon made its mark. Authors who came to speak here were taken by the extraordinary atmosphere of enthusiasm that prevails here. Le in India often strikes the outsider as being one great animated and passionate conversation, conducted at high pitch and with a gusto that makes the rest of us sound distinctly piano. The Jaipur Literature Festival very much embodies this with its massive audiences and the sparky exchanges that develop between readers and writers.: Alexander McCall Smith: Edinburgh Airport should charge people to sit downWhat distinguishes this festival from the numerous other book festivals on offer is its democratic feel. The events are free. There are inescapable financial reasons why Edinburgh and Hay, and most other UK festivals, have to charge for tickets, but there is something wonderful about people being able to participate in this sort of event eventhey are on a very tight budget. Jaipur is crowded with young people – students and schoolchildren – who are clearly thrilled to be part of an international event. As a writer, you are stopped at every turn by eager young readers who pose questions they have clearly carefully rehearsed. “What advice can you give me in the writing of my novel ” “What authors should I be readingI want to become an author ” And so on. When last here, I was approached by a young man who wanted to recite to me the poem he had written on the subject of Wittgenstein. That has never happened, as far as I know, to any author who has been at the Edinburgh International Book Festival, nor even at the Tobermory Book Festival on Mull. From that encounter sprung a correspondence that continues today.This year Irvine Welsh was in Jaipur. He has keen readers here, and they love him. They listen to him attentively, just as they listen, in the next breath, to Indian public intellectuals such as Shashi Tharoor or historians such as Charles Spencer. This is a very broad church indeed, no subjects are off limits, and freedom of speech is celebrated with determination and vigour. And the contrasts are striking. At one moment one of the stages will be taken over by a Bollywood singer who has written a memoir , at the next on comes ... well, that seems to be Jeffrey Archer, whose thrillers are lapped up in India. And next up is Germaine Greer. In the evenings the parties begin. Gardens are transformed by thousands of candles. The Indian moon comes up . A sitar plays. Readers, writers, publishers, discover one another. A thousand conversations begin.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4864375.1548783802!/image/image.jpg","title":"as a christian country uk should give asia bibi asylum stephen kerr mp","story":"Asia Bibi # a Christian whose conviction and death sentence for blasphemy has just been overturned by Pakistan#s Supreme Court # should be offered asylum by the UK as it has a duty to protect Christians from persecution around the world, writes Stephen Kerr MP.Our United Kingdom should be extremely proud of the role we have played advocating religious freedom. Enshrined in our law is the fundamental right to believe or not to believe in any religion without the fear of persecution. People from all religions live and work together for the greater good of our society. We are far from perfect though. Reports of anti-semitism in the United Kingdom were the second highest in recorded history in . There were over , Islamophobic hate crimes committed in  . Crimes against Catholics rose by  per cent in Scotland in  . There is a lot to work required to combat religious hate crime in our country and I urge politicians of all parties to come together and tackle this issue.I feel passionately about the subject because I am a member of a religious minority — the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints — that has a long history of persecution and misrepresentation. Happily, those dark days are largely behind us, but the lessons learned are deeply ingrained and any suggestion of intolerance or persecution of any minority religious group or minority group of any kind is anathema to me.The first President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Joseph Smith, declared the human right to exercise “that free independence of mind which heaven has so graciously bestowed upon the human family is one of its choicest gts”.It is core to my religious belief to respect the religious beliefs of others. This is a respect that is enshrined in the UN Declaration of Human Rights which states: “Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.”: Kirk calls on government to protect persecuted womanWe must protect this right and protect the rights of all faith groups and the right to atheism around the world. Within this must be a protection of Christians. As a member of the UN Security Council, our United Kingdom also has the moral responsibility to protect religious freedom across the globe. The persecution of Christians is increasing at an alarming rate, particularly in Asia where it is estimated that a third of Christians face repression. In China, measures have recently been introduced by President Xi Jinping which have resulted in worshippers being detained, the sale of bibles restricted, and the crucix being removed from public buildings. The Chinese Government has also banned Christmas in some cities.India, a country with the proud history of promoting peace and the largest democracy in the world, has recently become the tenth most dangerous country in the world for Christians to live in. A rise in Hindu extremism has resulted in a greater amount of violent attacks on churches and practising Christians. Across Asia and Africa, there has also been a substantial growth in attacks on Christian women, with higher rates of sexual violence, rape and forced marriages in North Korea, Afghanistan, Somalia, Libya and Pakistan.The Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has recently announced a global review into the persecution of Christians. This is a move that I welcome whole-heartedly. This review will make recommendations on the steps our Government can take to protect Christians around the world.: Sentenced to hang: Pakistan Christian in blasphemy trialBefore this review is complete, I believe that our Government should signy our determination to protect Christians by granting Asia Bibi political asylum. Asia was convicted of blasphemy in Pakistan in  after a group of women said they could not use a bucket she had used for water as she was unclean due to her Christian faith. The accusers claimed that Asia confirmed she made offensive comments about the Prophet Muhammad to the group of women, but this was after Asia was beaten up in her own house. She was sentenced to death by hanging.After ious international campaigns, Asia was acquitted in October . The Government of Pakistan, however, signed an agreement with those leading the protests against Asia’s acquittal a month later which barred her from leaving the country. This is despite her family having to go into hiding. A bounty of half a million Pakistani rupees has been offered to anyone who can kill Asia. It is obvious that Asia’s le is in danger whilst she remains in Pakistan. With the welcome news that the appeal to her conviction has been thrown out, Asia will now be free to leave the country. The people of Canada should be proud that an offer of asylum was made by their Government after the original conviction. The UK did not make such an offer and it should have. This needs to change and a clear message sent that we will provide a safe haven for people such as Asia.Britain should be playing a leading role in protecting Christians around the world. The review announced by the Government is the first step in our becoming that. I look forward with anticipation to what it recommends but we must deliver more than words. Around  Christians a month are killed due to their faith and millions are oppressed. We must be brave and make it clear to the world that we, as a Christian nation, do not tolerate the persecution of Christians anywhere.Stephen Kerr is the Scottish Conservative MP for Stirling©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4865141.1548871339!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit barclays given green light to transfer 160bn to ireland","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Barclays has been given the green light to transfer  billion eurosworth of assets to Ireland.The banking giant received approval from the High Court today for the move, which involves , clients.It comes as the company ramps up its Brexit contingency planning.: Brexit: PM wins reprieve but risks no deal with call for renegotiation“As we announced in , Barclays will use our existing licensed EU-based bank subsidiary to continue to serve our clients within the EU beyond  March  regardless of the outcome of Brexit,” the bank said.“Our preparations are well-advanced and we expect to be fully operational by  March .”The move is designed to deal with the consequences of a no-deal hard Brexit in which UK based banks would lose passporting rights that allow them toin the EU’s single market – the world’s richest trading bloc.In approving the move, Mr Justice Snowden said in his judgment: “Due to the continuing uncertainty over whether there might be a ‘no-deal’ Brexit, the Barclays Group has determined that it cannot wait any longer to implement the scheme.“In light of the large volume of business to be transferred, the scheme contains a number of phased dates upon which the transfer of the dferent types of business and the business of the branches in Spain, Italy and France, will become effective.“The overriding requirement, however, is that BBImust be legally and operationally ready to conduct all relevant regulated business with the in-scope clients by no later than  March , which is the date currently set for Brexit.”Several banks, including the Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and a host of others, have set up continental hubs in preparation for Britain’s exit from the EU.This involves hundreds of jobs and hundreds of billions in assets being shted out of London, hitting the Treasury’s tax revenue and denting the capital’s reputation as a financial centre.Frankfurt, Germany’s financial capital, is one of the biggest beneficiaries of Brexit.For its part, Barclays will increase its Dublin headcount by around  to  as a result of Brexit.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4864513.1548837157!/image/image.jpg","title":"ian blackford scotland must have option to be independent eu nation","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The SNP#s Westminster leader infuriated the DUP in the aftermath of last night#s Commons votes on Brexit by claiming the Conservatives had #ripped up the Good Friday Agreement#.Ian Blackford accused the UK Government of treating the Northern Irish peace process with contempt by supporting Brexiteer demands to replace the backstop in the EU withdrawal agreement and called for Scotland to have the option of becoming and independent EU state.“Tonight the Conservative Party has effectively ripped apart the Good Friday Agreement,” Mr Blackford said.The DUP’s Westminster leader Nigel Dodds replied that it was “utterly reckless to talk in those terms”.Mr Dodds added: “Nobody in Northern Ireland, no political party, is advocating any kind of hard border in the island of Ireland, and we certainly do not advocate what others advocate, which is creating borders in the United Kingdom or ripping up the United Kingdom.”In the latest escalation of constitutional rhetoric over Brexit, Mr Blackford said during the debate the UK Government must respect a demand from the Scottish Parliament for a second independence referendum.“If our First Minister calls for a section  order, then his house must respect the will of the Scottish people,” he told the House of Commons.Nicola Sturgeon is expected to reveal details of her timetable for a second independence vote within weeks, with the UK set to leave the EU at the end of March. Mr Blackford said Scotland “must no longer be left at the mercy of events” and must have the choice to become an independent member of the EU.“Whatever happens here, the SNP will not be dropping its policy of independence,” he said.

To date no case in Scotland has been stopped because of prejudicial publicity and that’s despite there having been some high-profile cases that attracted considerable, sometimes extremely prejudicial, media attention.These cases were dferent in that the accused were not well-known public figures, but it was argued that publicity about the allegations could prejudice any trial.I wouldn’t call this case unprecedented, but it has its own unique aspects. However, the challenges for the court have been considered before. Two examples are the trial of William Beggs for what became known as the “Limbs in the Loch” murder, and that of Nat Fraser, who was accused of killing his we, Arlene. There had been a great deal of reporting about the cases and the courts had to decide whether fair trials could be achieved. In both situations, the courts decided the cases could proceed fairly, referring to the safeguards of the passage of time between any publicity and a trial the focusing effect for a jury of listening to the evidence and the strong directions given to a jury in such cases to decide only based on evidence they hear in court.Those representing Salmond may argue that he is uniquely well-known and that some allegations against him have, to an extent, been canvassed in the media. They may say that it will be almost impossible to find jurors who have never heard of him. But that doesn’t matter – more to the point is whether it will be possible to find jurors that are untainted by prejudicial knowledge about the allegations.The Crown will say Contempt of Court rules apply and no-one can now publish anything that might prejudice the trial. There is now signicant protection in place and the media can only really report on procedural aspects such as the fact he has been charged.Very senior people at the Crown Office will be involved in decisions about possible proceedings once they have seen all statements and reports.

If anything, it should be amplied.It turned into a trilogy. There was a Great Book of Skye Two in , and now we have the #Great Book of Skye Three#.That was perhaps predictable. In the first volume, Cailean Maclean commented that he had two problems in persuading Norman Macdonald to prepare the book. The first problem was to get him to start the second was to get him to stop.Three books and , pages later, the prof has stopped — or so he says.The three volumes comprise a Dictionary of Skye Biography. The lives of almost , people are profiled and illustrated inside their pages. They have all #been Skye born or bred or are people who have had an intimate connection with the island. They have all been noteworthy in one way or another… #There has never been more than , people living in Skye at any one time, and for much of history — particularly recent, recorded history — its population has been much smaller than that.Nobody, however, will be too surprised that Norman and Cailean uncovered and portrayed over a thousand eminent Sgiathanaich. Without wishing to kickstart Norman once again, the miracle is that they enumerated so few. The island, like almost all Hebridean islands, has been a breeding ground of talent and character.The only other qualication for entry in the Great Books of Skye is that you must be dead. You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/INDOOR-SHINTY-19-P4-7-FINAL-2.jpg","title":"skye schools indoor shinty competition all the action in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineYoung shinty players fromthroughout Skye gathered to take part in two indoor tournaments for primary school teams last weekend.Portree High’s Fingal Centre hosted competitions for P-P and for P-and-under teams.On a fast and furious day of excellent shinty action teams fromBun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Phort Rìgh won both competitions.Broadford were runners up in the P- competition, with North West taking second spot in the P-under tournament following an epic final."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/visitor-web.jpg","title":"skye charities work to be showcased at skeabost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA multi-charity event will be held in Skeabost on Saturdayto highlight the work of several good causes across Skye.The event will be held at Skeabost Memorial Hall from  am until  pm and will provide information on the work carried out by a iety of charities in the area, as well as insight into the costs and challenges they face.to raise awareness of the event, which will support Skye and Lochalsh Young Carers the Skye and Lochalsh Foodbank Crossroads Care # Skye and Lochalsh Macmillan Cancer Support Skye Dance Bloodwise, and Rotjanas Hands, which Mr Williams set up with his we nearly  years ago.He said: “I have been an independent fundraiser for many years – I am a trustee of Rotjanas Hands – formally known as Hands Across the Water – which I set up alongside my we following the Indonesian Tsunami .”He added: “For me, it has always been important to share particularly when we are so fortunate and others not so.

Our hard-won peace process and its political architecture have too often been taken for granted.We may have peace, but we have not seen enough progress.When over  Irish citizens from the north signed an open letter to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in December  it came at the end of a tumultuous and politically defining year.That January the Good Friday Agreement political institutions collapsed amidst the political and financial scandal of RHI.It served to confirm the growing view of northern nationalists that political unionism was not committed to proper power-sharing through the denial and refusal of equality, rights and respect towards the section of the community to which we belong, rights such as: access to justice marriage equality: language rights.It would seem that there can be no regulatory alignment on this island, and Bangor must be as British as Finchley, unless you are gay and want to be married or seek to live a le through the medium of Irish with statutory protection.This contempt mobilised the nationalist and republican electorate: in turn the unionist political majority in the Assembly was ended.Increased unionist belligerence continued, and then, the nationalist constituency sent a stark message during the subsequent Westminster election, that it was turning its back on Westminster.However, the political process in the north had already been seriously destabilised due to the result of the EU Referendum in , when a majority of people in the north voted to remain in the EU.The British government ignored that democratic result and the emerging negative implications of Brexit became major talking points across the island.Every report and expert assured us that there will never be a hard border in Ireland and that the Good Friday Agreement was constitutionally sacrosanct as an internationally binding agreement. Yet, within the past week, we have been told by Theresa May that the Good Friday Agreement is up for negotiation and the European Commission have confirmed that a no-deal Brexit will bring a hard border in Ireland and yesterday Leo Vardakar advised the World Economic Forum that there may be soldiers on the border.This culmination of events and concerns motivated me and others to make the first direct public appeal in late  to Leo Varadkar to stand up and speak out in defence of Irish citizens# rights in the north.We felt it was essential that Irish citizens in the north heard reassurance from the Irish Government that the reality of abandonment experienced by our parents and grandparents would not be visited upon our generation.The back page of your programme today carries an assurance from the Taoiseach that: “To the nationalist people in Northern Ireland, I want to assure you that we have protected your interests throughout these negotiations. Your birth right as Irish citizens, and therefore as EU citizens, will be protected.There will be no hard border on our island. You will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.”This assurance cannot simply be a historical quote.It must be a living commitment.It must mean that there can be no hard border on our island.That my children will not have to endure the ignominy of being stopped at Newry or Derry, when travelling to Croke Park for a match, or to Donegal for a holiday.One of the objectives of this conference today is to assert to the Irish Government that we are their citizens, bearing their passport and that we insist on our full access to citizenship, but rights, human rights are for all.No citizen in the north should endure a diminished sense of their citizenship as a result of Brexit. Everyone benefits when rights are protected, and all traditions and communities are respected and valued.Today’s conversation is about all of that. We seek to provide a space for a discussion to begin.It has to begin somewhere. And when we are told that now is not the right time, I ask then when is the right time. So,not now, when Nelson Mandela once observed that, “If you wait for textbook conditions they will never occur.”We believe this is the right time to have a conversation about the future. Failure to encourage and embrace that potential would be reckless and irresponsible.In the challenges which will immediately confront us in the coming weeks and months we will require a unied and coherent mobilisation of broad northern nationalist and progressive voices.Our children and new generations deserve a future better than the past which we endured. I wouldn’t have believed you, had you said a few short months ago that my small club [Naomh Éanna] would be in an All-Ireland final in two weeks time, but the unexpected can overtake events.I have seen how history and identity, timing and preparation and the taking of opportunity can reshape history and positively define and improve lives.Tapaidh an déis.

Written by Patricia Gormley and directed by Alan McKee, the play begins to a backdrop of Abba’s Money, Money, Money, as final demand letters are piling up at the business but Olive is keen to keep on trucking and put on a brave face for her staff and loyal customers. Christina Nelson plays a total of four characters in the production including enthusiastic but scatty trainee Jolene, nearby fold resident and ‘the road’ gossip Granny Eileen, Mrs Hughes with notions above her station and Cryin’ Air stewardess Cha Marie who has an imminent wedding to plan. Such is Christina’s talent to twist, turn, gurn and transform herself from a -year-old to a grouchy, rollator reliant octogenarian and back to the fur hat wearing, buttoned up Mrs Hughes had my companion asking: “Is that still the same actress ”What Patricia has created with her second offering is detailing just how much hair salons are part and parcel of community le. They are a haven for gossip, catch ups and for many of our elderly neighbours the place to go to for a hot cup of tea, their coat to be taken off and hung up and a weekly rinse and ‘set’ with the obligatory stacks of “lacquer”.Roisin and Christina work and bounce off each other brilliantly and there is a particularly heart felt and tender scene between Olive and Mrs Hughes that isn’t played for laughs as we reach the final, rousing act.Belly laughs, a few tears and rooting for the character of Olive made for a great night’s theatre and proved the perfect tonic as a standing ovation for all involved showed just how much the audience lapped up the story. We definitely haven’t seen the end of these characters.#Is That Too Hot# runs at The MAC theatre until February .

Within minutes of the vote SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the Conservatives had #effectively ripped apart the Good Friday Agreement#.DUP deuty leader Nigel Dodds reacted angrily to that claim, saying it was “utterly reckless to talk in those terms”.MPs earlier voted voted  to  in favour of rejecting a ‘No Deal’ Brexit.The vote outcome was met by a firm stance from EU leaders who insisted the Withdrawal Agreement would not be renegotiated. Tánaiste Simon Coveney said the backstop was “necessary” and “the developments at Westminster do nothing to change this”.European Council President Donald Tusk reaffirmed the EU position, adding: #The Withdrawal Agreement is and remains the best and only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the European Union. The backstop is part of the Withdrawal Agreement, and the Withdrawal Agreementis not open for re-negotiation.#The vote has received widespread reaction from local politiicans. Sinn Féin MP Chris Hazzard has said the British parliament needs to realise that it cannot push the people of Ireland around over Brexit.  “What is happening at Westminster is clearly not in the interests of Ireland,” he said.“Instead it is all about the right-wing Brextremists of the Tory party who have been allowed to set the agenda. “In its desperation, the British government is trying to threaten and intimidate the Irish people with a hard border and an economic clf edge. “They need to realise the days of the British government and British parliament threatening the people of Ireland and pushing them around are over and not coming back. “The Irish government and EU need to stand firm against attempts to sabotage what has already been agreed.#SDLP leader Colum Eastwood hit out at the British government#s decision to #allow the dissolution of the Irish backstop# over the heads of people in Northern Ireland.He said: #Tonight, London decided that the interests of the people in Northern Ireland were secondary to the needs of the Conservative Party. The rejection of the Irish backstop, the only viable mechanism to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland, is an affront to the Good Friday Agreement.#Let me be clear, the people of Northern Ireland did not consent to this. We will continue to engage with the Irish government to ensure that the backstop, as reiterated by Brussels, will not be undermined in the slightest.#Alliance Brexit spokesperson Stephen Farry MLA said Parliament has voted to send Brexit down “a dead-end” on the backstop.“Many people will be exasperated at a dysal Parliament unable to process and work through the real choices facing the UK around Brexit. Thirty-one months on from the referendum there is still no coherent way forward,” he added.“Those opposed to a no deal and alternative softer versions of Brexit are struggling to uny around an effective pathway. While there may be a majority for the principle of a no deal, there is no agreed means to stop it. By contrast, the Prime Minister has conducted a shameful u-turn on the backstop, and abandoned the deal she made with the EU only a few weeks ago.“Throughout the Brexit process, the Prime Minister and UK government have been clear they would avoid a hard border in Ireland at all costs. The need for the backstop only arises from the UK#s decision to leave the EU and the mutually incompatible red lines. At no stage has the UK government produced any viable alternative. And crucially, the Prime Minister did sign up to the backstop as part of the Withdrawal Agreement and defend its necessity. This abandonment of the backstop is an enormous act of bad faith and sends a terrible message to the people of Northern Ireland.“However, this is a pointless victory for the government. The EU is rightly clear the backstop and the Withdrawal Agreement are not up for renegotiation, and have indicated as such once again today. So this represents a dead-end. This amendment is therefore the ultimate unicorn, only serving to waste time and increase the risk of a catastrophic no deal crash-out.“There are consequences to constant delay and failure to face reality, as businesses and others cannot wait for certainty, and may choose to take proactive decisions which impact on investment and jobs.#"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37763950.ece/48b50/AUTOCROP/w65square/ohnston-_Read-Only_.jpg","title":"east belfast vigil for ian ogle photos","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Dodds has claimed the EU’s chief negotiator has “blown a hole” in the concept of the Irish backstop..pushThe DUP MP for Belfast North said Michel Barnier had said some checks and controls could be done away from the border and claimed that meant a backstop would not be necessary.Speaking at Prime Minister’s Questions, Mr Dodds also accused the Irish Government of “highly reckless” talk over the potential of a no-deal Brexit to cause trouble at the border.He said: “In recent days we’ve heard the Irish prime minister talk about bringing his troops up to the border in the event of no deal, we’ve heard the Irish deputy foreign minister talk of people jumping out of windows – isn’t this highly-reckless talk extremely dangerous in the present circumstances Isnt that the way forward, and it blows a hole in the entire concept of this backstop Nigel DoddsFacebookTwitter“That sort of rhetoric should be toned down and instead focused on what Michel Barnier said the other day – that even in the event of a no deal we would sit down and find operational ways to have checks and controls away from the border.“Isn’t that the way forward, and it blows a hole in the entire concept of this backstop ”Prime Minister Theresa May did not agree that Mr Barnier’s comments, which also included an insistence the current backstop was the only arrangement possible, meant she could do away with the backstop and instead reiterated her commitment to no hard border.She said: “I will be speaking to the Taoiseach later today and it’s important for us to work with the Government of Ireland on the arrangements that will be in place in the future.“We obviously have sent a clear message from this House about what needs to happen in relation to the backstop but we retain our commitment to no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.”Mrs May should rule out a no deal Brexit, Labour MP Jack Dromeysaid, because it would be contemptuous of Parliament and impoverish the country.“We’re  days away from a clf,” he said. “If we plunge into an abyss our country will be a poorer country in every sense of the word.“Last night this House voted that there can be no question of a no-deal Brexit.“Will the Prime Minister honour the will of Parliament and rule out a no-deal Brexit because to proceed with a no-deal Brexit would not only impoverish our country it would be contemptuous of Parliament.”Mrs May responded that MPs should focus on getting a deal to avoid leaving without a deal.She added: “What Parliament also voted for last night was to say that it wanted to leave the EU with a deal and it identied what was necessary to change in the deal in order to enable that to happen and for the support of this House to be given to a deal.”SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford accused Mrs May of misleading the House with her plan to seek an “alternative arrangement” on the backstop, because the EU had already ruled out renegotiating the Withdrawal Agreement.The MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber asked: “Has the Prime Minister inadvertently misled the House or is this Government’s incompetence reached a whole new level ”Mrs May said she was taking back to Brussels what was agreed by Parliament, and then criticised Mr Blackford for comments he made suggesting the Tories were “ripping up the Good Friday Agreement”, calling them “frankly irresponsible”.The SNP leader said that was a “disgraceful response” from a PM acting with “sheer irresponsibility”.Mr Blackford went on to accuse the Government of dragging Scotland out of the EU against its will.He said: “We are scunnered by this Government ignoring Scotland.“Prime Minister, do you accept that you have promised Scotland everything, you have delivered nothing ”Mrs May said a new report showed % of Scottish exports went to the rest of the UK, three times more than with the rest of the European Union.“Yet he represents a party that wants to erect a border between Scotland and England,” she said.“The biggest threat to the future of Scotland is sitting on those benches.”"},{"url":null,"title":"orange order launches newlook newspaper in belfast","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

to borrow hundreds of million of euro to fund pay increases for nurses.The INMO has scheduled five more -hour stoppages, while the Psychiatric Nurses Association is due to initiate an overtime ban on Thursday.The HSE said thousands of people have had appointments or services cancelled due to the strike.Those with intellectual disabilities, the elderly and the young were among those affected.Emergency and planned essential services were continuing while residential care was exempted from the trade union action over pay.Cancer surgeries have gone ahead.The health authority said it expected further disruption on Thursday because some who have stayed away from emergency departments on Wednesday may present then.On a normal day around , people are seen in the country’s emergency departments and  of those are admitted as inpatients.Liam Woods, deputy director general of operations in the HSE, said: “We are seeing delays and can expect further delays over the day.”Minor injury units are closed, which places extra pressure on emergency departments.Speaking in the Dail the Taoiseach said that while he could justy borrowing to save jobs post-Brexit or for capital projects, he could not for nurses.Leo Varadkar said: “We’re not in a position to borrow hundreds of millions of euros to fund pay increases.“I can justy borrowing hundreds of millions of euros for emergency measures to save jobs,it comes to that in the next couple of weeks.“I can justy borrowing that money for one off capital projects that will be with us for  or  years but I think borrowing money and funding pay increases with borrowed money is bad policy.”Mr Varadkar added that he profoundly regretted the action and he was sorry for the disruption inconvenience caused to patients.But the opposition accused the government of not making any genuine attempts to prevent the action.The belated th hour activity that we witnessed over the last number of days was far too little, far too late.Fianna Fail leader Micheal MartinFacebookTwitterFianna Fail leader Micheal Martin said: “There’s been no proactive engagement from government in relation to this dispute with the nursing representatives.“The belated th hour activity that we witnessed over the last number of days was far too little, far too late.”Mr Martin accused the government of being in denial about the recruitment and retention issues within the health service, adding that agency nursing was costing . million per week and that the country was “haemorrhaging” nurses.Mr Varadkar said he did not want to be put in a position where he would have to ert money that is earmarked for new medicines to pay for pay increases.Bur Mr Martin said there was “no limit to the budget of the children’s hospital” and that it was wrong of the Taoiseach to suggest thatthere was a deal reached with the nurses that it would be at the expense of medicines for patients.Sinn Fein leader said the nurses were on the picket lines because of the government’s “absolute failure”, not just in relation to the pay issue, but also the recruitment and retention crisis.Mary Lou McDonald said nurses did not want a strike but they had been forced into it.“They feel failed, they feel let down, they feel they haven’t been listened to and they’ve been backed into a corner,” she said.Ms McDonald added that Mr Varadkar had a duty as head of government to intervene in the matter rather than “pass the buck”."},{"url":null,"title":"coveney we need to work together dont just listen to dup listen to all in northern ireland","story":"

There is an obligation on people to actually have pragmatic solutions rather than wishful thinking.\"He said Ireland \"will insist\" the UK keeps its word to the people of Northern Ireland and the way to overcome the obstacles was through the future relations talks during the transition period.\"The backstop is already a compromise. It is a series of compromises. It was designed around British red lines,\" he said.\"Ireland has the same position as the European Union now, I think, when we say that the backstop as part of the withdrawal agreement is part of a balanced package that isnt going to change.\"However responding, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock said delaying Brexit would not resolve the issues. Although he said he \"emphatically\" did not want a no deal and the way to avoid that was by endorsing Theresa Mays withdrawal agreement.Read MoreBBCs Humphrys asks Dublin minister why Ireland doesnt dump EU and throw lot in with UKIrish deputy leader plays down Varadkar’s border soldiers warningAnimal waste export ‘could be threatened’ under no-deal BrexitCabinet tensions over no-deal Brexit spill into the openYvette Cooper’s Article  amendment takes us in right direction – SturgeonHe said Theresa May had agreed to the backstop based on her own red lines. He said it was \"entirely unreasonable\" to take out all the compromises made by Britain while including those compromises made by the EU.Speaking about the Taoiseachs comments on troops on the border in the event of a no deal. He said Mr Varadkar was reminding people of what the border once looked like.\"What I would ask people to think about is how far we have come in the last  years and what the peace agreement has done for relationships between our two island. Lets not go backwards and cause tension,\" He said.\"Lets not just listen to one political partys voice from Northern Ireland because they happen to sit in Westminster. Lets listen everybody in Northern Ireland is saying. What business is saying, farmers, unionist and nationalist.\"There is a strong view coming from Northern Ireland that says we have a withdrawal agreement which protects the peace process and good relations on the island of Ireland. Lets take that rather than risk a no deal Brexit.\"Ireland will insist on the UK keeping its word.FacebookTwitterOn Tuesday parliament will again vote on Theresa Mays deal with the EU. There have been more than a dozen amendments tabled including ensuring there can be no departure in a no deal, delaying Brexit and binning the backstop and looking for \"alternative arrangements\".\"There is no magic solution here for this problem,\" Mr Coveney continued.\"If there was it would have emerged by now and that is why Ireland will insist on the UK keeping its word to Ireland, the EU and the people of Northern Ireland in terms of protecting a fragile but hugely valuable peace process.\"Askedthe Commons voted on finding alternative arrangements to the backstop, would the withdrawal agreement be \"holy text\" and untouchable the TD said that would be like asking Ireland to renege on its commitments and instead replace them with a hope something would be found.Listen to what the people of Europe are saying.FacebookTwitterHe said the way to tackle the issues was in the future trade relations talks.\"That is the way I hope these negotiations will go rather than the British parliament deciding on something that may command a majority in Westminster but has no chance of getting agreement or ratication in the EU.\"Listen to what people are saying in Europe. This is not just about Britains future. This is about how we work together in the future.\"He added: \"People keep talking about games of chicken and the UK position being against the Irish or the EU position. We are all trying to work together here.\"Britain and Ireland are two islands next door to each other, we have an extraordinary history at times a very tragic history. But we have to work out these things together and stop talking about games of chicken.\"Mr Coveney said he did not believe the only reason for Theresa Mays crushing defeat in the Commons earlier this month was down to the backstop alone.\"If you look at the withdrawal agreement it is actually not that controversial. It is about protecting citizens rights.. about protecting British citizens rights in the EU .. its about a financial settlement.. its about creating the time and space for a transition period.. for preparing for new realities.\"And its about protecting a peace process which I believe the Prime Minister is deeply committed to.\"He added: \"The problem with the argument is that nobody has come up with a pragmatic, sensible and legally sound way of avoiding border infrastructure reemerging between the two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland. And that is why it took two years to get the backstop agreed and that is why I believe the Prime Minister is correct when she defends it.\""},{"url":null,"title":"boca juniors buy a player called kevin mac allister with inevitable consequences","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Secretary of State to address the present deficit.’It was seconded by his party colleague, Alderman Mary Hamilton.Cllr Hussey said what happened was ‘absolutely scandalous’ and an attack on ‘citizens

The resulting m scrum led to a succession of drives for the line and when the ball was recycled a loose pass missed its intended target, but Rory Campbell took the ball smartly on the bounce to score in the corner for an early Malone lead.After Paddy Wright missed a long-range penalty, Ballynahinch earned an excellent attacking position with a m line out following an excellent Ross Adair touch-finder. The line out was won, but Malone forced a crucial turnover and the chance went begging.Both sides continued to be careless in possession in a niggly match, which was low on quality.On  minutes a Malone breakdown penalty gave lsquoHinch a chance to drive for the line and as they progressed, Malone blatantly killed the ball and could count themselves lucky not to receive a yellow. Wright slotted the penalty to close the gap to two points.Following a Malone penalty miss, lsquoHinch botched their own line out allowing the home side to pile into the . Zack McCall was penalised for offside as Malone looked to sweep the ball wide and was given a yellow card. Malone then scored from a tap penalty to take a - half-time lead.The second half followed a similar pattern to the first with Ballynahinch going further behind to another try from the prolic Campbell after another lsquoHinch mistake on their own line out.Ross Adair reduced the arrears on  minutes with a converted try to put lsquoHinch in bonus point territory and the away side belatedly roused themselves to pile the pressure on Malone during the final ten minutes.However, the home defence held and lsquoHinch had to settle for a point, earned largely through the woes of the Malone place kicker, who failed to land any of his attempts on goal.A disappointing start to  for the locals and they will need to be more accurate this week as Ballymena come to Ballymacarn Park.Malone Ballynahinch AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballygowan’s Emma hoping to make waves at Abu Dhabi Special Olympics  ","story":"A BALLYGOWAN swimmer is hoping to make a big splash when she goes to the Middle East in March.Twenty three year-old Emma Carlisle will be going for gold when she swims for Ireland at the  Special Olympics World Summer Games in Abu Dhabi.Emma is one of seven athletes from Co Down included in the -strong Team Ireland squad for the Games which take place over March -.Newry is well represented with four athletes selected.

He was a royal physician and his lersquos work made up the greater part of the British Museum collection which opened in .If your surname is Savage, Martel, Ridal, Copeland or Jordan, yoursquoll be intrigued to know that your early Norman ancestors built strong castles to protect themselves against attacks from locals in the th century.John de Courcy, a prominent Anglo-Norman caused far-reaching change in Ireland around this time. He defeated the Irish at Downpatrick and gave these families who followed him large estates.Their strongholds were no match, however, for the energy and enthusiasm of the locals and eventually it was easier for them to adopt Irish manners and dress and conform to the customs of Down.According to Irish custom, land didnrsquot belong to the king mdash it belonged to the people and usually went to the strongest chieftain. The residents are reported to have disliked taxes, not much change there down the centuries.McBride dedicates a chapter to the United Irishman mdash immortalised as lsquoThe Man From God Knows Wherersquo mdash who was hanged outside Downpatrick Gaol .And where would society beit wasnrsquot for the humble rubber tyre, whose inventor, John Boyd Dunlop, worked for several years in his brotherrsquos veterinary practice in Downpatrick.Of course no book on the history of Co Down would be complete without a chapter on some of our ghosts and ghouls.McBride has included some of the most interesting. The book tells the story of Noel Killen, originally from Loughinisland, who rode his bike passed the old derelict Ballydugan Flour Mill, near Downpatrick, when he was a young lad and dreamt of restoring it.His dream came true. By virtue of his hard work he recaptured the millrsquos former glory and turned it into an award-winning wedding venue, complete with three happy ghosts who attend weddings and bring luck.Therersquos a Presbyterian minister who loiters around the basement and sometimes appears on the ground floor in the corner near the fire. Then there is Bobby, who danders across the first floor. He can be unpredictable as he is often said to slam the occasional door.Then there is the young girl dressed in sackcloth who loves to dance. She can sometimes be seen to be dancing to the music provided at the wedding breakfast.The book also notes the fable of Maggie who leapt across a deep chasm between the clfs near Newcastle in a bid to outrun a group of soldiers while carrying a basket of stolen birdrsquos eggs.Not an egg was broken in her successful attempt to clear the clf and she lived to see a ripe old age. Her ghost is said to loiter around the area know to locals as Maggiersquos Leap.Every quirky illustration that appears in the -page book has been drawn by the hand of the multi-talented Doreen.bull The Little Book of County Down can can be found on Amazon and in all good book stores..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Children and senior citizens  together in residential day  ","story":"ITrsquoS not often children have the opportunity to show others how to do something but thatrsquos exactly what happens when pupils from St Nicholasrsquo Primary School in Ardlgass Primary School visited a residential home for the elderly.P children from the school were chosen to work alongside residents of Ardview Residential Home in a cross-generational art project with local artist Fionnuala Duffin.The children began twice-weekly sessions before the Chrismas break and will continue until the mid term break.Funding for the project came from the Play Resource Centre.

Local people have sought a meeting with Department of Health officials on this matter and I will be happy to pursue and facilitate this.ldquoThere is a need for such a crucially important service for parents and indeed the wider family circle to be delivered regionally.Three weeks ago, local politicians called on the Permanent Secretary to reduce the ldquoalready enormous burden from parents suffering from bereavement and come up with a better solution than sending babies to Liverpool.Politicians said they were not averse to an all island service, insisting the reinstatement of the Belfast-based paediatric pathologist who retied is also vitally important moving forward..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New £217k play park welcome boost for Meadowlands estate  ","story":"MEADOWLANDS estate in Downpatrick is at last to get a new play park costing pound,.Work on the park should start within weeks and be ready by the end of March.A proposal to proceed with the scheme was approved by Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee on Monday night.The new park is a joint project with the council and Downpatrick Neighbourhood Renewal with % funding from the Department of the Communities.The council will be responsible for managing its construction and its maintenance.The new park is to be located in front of Drumcloon Walk and adjacent to the Quoile Crescent housing development.According to the Northern Ireland Neighbourhood Information Service statistics, Meadowlands is ranked th out of  areas of high health deprivation.The need for the park has also been supported by statistics from the Northern Ireland Research and Information Agency which show that there are  children under the age of  living in the Quoile Ward area who could avail of the park.It is also hoped that the park will help with the regeneration of the area and improve its overall look.The siting of the park was moved after some local concern was expressed that it would too close to pensionersrsquo homes in Drumcloon Park.Meadowlands Community Association, which was formed with help from local councillor Cadogan Enright, last week welcomed the move and the fact that the council listened to its representations.At Mondayrsquos meeting, Cllr Billy Walker proposed that the committee agree to go ahead with the park.He said: ldquoI really welcome this play park, as will the residents, he said. ldquoBeing the last chairman of the old district council, I know that a park for Meadowlands was a legacy issue.ldquoThere is real need for this as Meadowlands is one of the most deprived areas in the Downpatrick DEA and itrsquos to good see that that hard work is at last bearing fruit.Cllr Cadogan, who seconded the proposal, added: ldquoI am delighted that this play park can go ahead as I have been working with the residents for years and itrsquos at last getting over the line..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New amenity centre set for spring opening  ","story":"DOWNPATRICKrsquoS new ultra-modern civic amenity centre could open as early as the spring, council officials have confirmed.The new facility at Flying Horse Road will replace the existing centre at nearby Cloonagh Road, which continues to struggle with the increasing demands being placed upon it.Over the Christmas and New Year holiday period, the centre was forced to close early due to the volume of waste.The early closure annoyed many ratepayers with council officials confident the new centre mdash which is signicantly larger mdash will be able to handle more recyclable material.Over recent years, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has invested signicant sums building new civic amenity sites in Ballynahinch and Castlewellan, with the Flying Horse Road facility set to be one of the most modern of its kind.Confirmation that the new Downpatrick centre could open as early as the spring will be given at this eveningrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee.There was a delay in building the new facility as a suitable site could not be identied and when work did eventually get underway, progress was temporarily halted as equipment belonging to contractors was targeted by vandals.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed news then the new centre could open for business as early as the spring.The local authorityrsquos lease of the Cloonagh Road facility has been extended until the end of March but it has been recognised for some time that this facility has passed its sell-by-date.Cllr Curran said it was important Downpatrick had a recycling centre which was fit-for-purpose and could meet the needs of ratepayers across a wide area.He said the facility was not solely used by people in the town.

Best of the East Down contingent was Neil Curran, in ninth place, who is improving with every outing, followed by the ever-reliable Martin Willcox , Davy Foster , Gavin Hynds , Paul Lloyd , Gareth Reillyand Donal Smith .This was an excellent warm up race prior to the Intermediate and Masterrsquos Championships which take place on Saturday in Barnettrsquos Park, near Shawrsquos Bridge.Women do well tooThere were lots of positives too in the womenrsquos race, run in conjunction with the menrsquos. Catherine OrsquoConnor ran a strong race and was just outside a podium place by a handful of seconds.Niamh Kellett, still on the recovery after injury, was relieved to run unhampered and to finish pain free in eighth place.Joanne Foster ran her own race, as she always does, finishing strongly inth place, while Kelly Smith , far from being put off by the conditions at her debut at Mallusk last week, not only lined up again on Saturday, but has signed up for three in a row by putting her name down for the intermediate team at Barnettrsquos Demesne.Well done to all and good luck next weekend.Boys and girlsThere were a total of  races on the packed card, starting at .am with the girlsrsquo U- k race in which East Downrsquos All-Ireland silver medal winning team took part.

Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“It was reported to me through diplomats that there were voices to that effect,” he said.Mr McGinn said that, in contract to the UK government, Dublin was “completely unied” in its approach to the backstop.He put to Mr Raab: “You said a couple of weeks ago in the media that Simon Coveney had told you privately he was open to alternatives on the backstop, but that the taioseach had adopted a harder line. He said that is categorically untrue, so who are we to believe ”Mr Raab replied: “I met with Simon Coveney twice. The fact that we had a conversation which I was asked to keep confidential and then was made public by the taoiseach and was factually inaccurate I think answers your question.”try catch  TrendingDying single mother, , with motor neurone disease whose children have to dress her refused disability benefitsThese properties are just some of the least expensive currently up for sale in NISnow, ice and fallen debris could make your morning drive dficult - as Roads Service confirm salting of roads network underwayN.I. man headbutts police officer before spitting in nurses faceP.S.N.I. shutdown N.I. road after car crash - N.I.

Whatever the case, and despite making the gaffe twice, none of the MPs on the  chose to correct him – or maybe they didn’t notice.However, he was commended for being a “clear and concise” witness.Mr Raab was not the only person in the room to make a blunder, as DUP MP Jim Shannon referred to Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney as “Stephen Coveney”.Elsewhere, Mr Raab joked that the Belfast Agreement was not like a “cracking read” you would sit down with on your holidays.He was responding to a question by North Down MP Lady Sylvia Hermon, who askedhe had read the treaty in its entirety.He replied: “I haven’t sat down and started from the beginning and gone through it. “Of course at ious points of negotiations it was important to delve in and read dferent aspects. I have used it as a reference tool.“It’s not like a novel where you sit down and think ‘you know what, over the holidays this is a cracking read’. “But it is an absolutely vital constitutional document.”Jolene Bunting ‘mocked’ the Irish famine with ‘racist, sectarian’ tweet, court toldBrexit: Dominic Raab accuses Leo Varadkar of ‘leaking’ private conversation on backstop Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingDying single mother, , with motor neurone disease whose children have to dress her refused disability benefitsThese properties are just some of the least expensive currently up for sale in NISnow, ice and fallen debris could make your morning drive dficult - as Roads Service confirm salting of roads network underwayN.I. man headbutts police officer before spitting in nurses faceP.S.N.I. shutdown N.I. road after car crash - N.I.

Screengrab taken from Parliament.tv January , “This is the first positive vote as to what the Commons would support. Before it was negative votes that people would not support,” he said.“The backstop is now the only major stumbling block to the agreement and that is what the House of Commons said tonight.“The Commons has rallied behind the unionist position, which is very signicant. “The majority for that Graham Brady amendment is very, very signicant.“The way forward to a majority in Parliament is now clear.”Mr Dodds said that the size of the majorities against what were seen as anti-Brexit amendments from Labour’s Yvette Cooper and Conservative former attorney general Dominic Grieve “took those who want to extend Article  by surprise”.He added: “People have asked what will Parliament accept, and they got their answer tonight.“It is a good night for Northern Ireland. The main issue that would damage the integrity of the Union has been addressed.”When asked about the EU’s immediately dismissive response, the DUP deputy leader said: “That is entirely to be expected, no-one is in the least bit surprised.”Ditch the backstopIN FULL: N.I. school closures due to snow and ice Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingDying single mother, , with motor neurone disease whose children have to dress her refused disability benefitsThese properties are just some of the least expensive currently up for sale in NISnow, ice and fallen debris could make your morning drive dficult - as Roads Service confirm salting of roads network underwayN.I. man headbutts police officer before spitting in nurses faceP.S.N.I. shutdown N.I. road after car crash - N.I.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Then to handler Gerry Cosgrave to get the horse ready for his first point to point race.Thrills abounded when his black and red colours were chosen and on April , , Battleoverdoyen won his first race at Loughanmore with jockey Mark O’Hare.Michael recalls his phone never stopped on the way home and the next day the cream of racing were looking to buy the winner. He decided to go to the prestigious Tattersalls sales in Cheltenham the following week and the horse, was set at a reserve for £,.

He was born Rodney Isaac Pedlow on th July  and was one of three children. He was brought up in Hanover Street, Portadown, and at the age of  he unfortunately lost his mother. He and his other two siblings were brought up by their father, Moses, who ran a business as an egg exporter in Clonavon Avenue.Rodney was educated in Portadown College and later started his own business as a poultry farmer after meeting his late we Freda Abraham whom he affectionately called Winred. They met in Portrush in  and were married in . They began married le at Drumnagoon, Portadown, where they had two sons, Keith and Paul before building a home at Harcourts Hill where they had a further two daughters Amanda and Sylvia.Rodney developed his business realising there was a growing market for affordable brown eggs in Ireland, which were generally much more expensive than white eggs. He was the first person to introduce black chickens into Northern Ireland which were hybrid layers known as Arbor Acres, producing high quality brown eggs.He imported the chickens from a Dundalk Hatchery, rearing them to point of lay and then distributing them across Ireland. These journeys took his we and four children to many remote areas of Ireland often ing home in the small hours of the morning. These trips are fondly remembered as great adventures by his four children, where they met many interesting characters, dining in cafes and restaurants or picnicking along the way.Rodney’s business interests developed over the years through good times and bad where at one stage he owned , laying hens across three farms. During the s the egg market collapsed due to cheap French imports and, together with other farmers, the Government paid Rodney six pence per dozen to dump tens of thousands of eggs because there was no market for them.After the death of his father, Rodney took over the egg exporting business and continued for many years selling eggs until his late s. Despite his very busy le style Rodney had a great passion for helping and supporting others and played a huge role in the le of his church.He was a Sunday School Superintendent in Seagoe Parish Church during the s and a cub leader in Mullavilly Parish when he moved to Ballyworkan in the s and s.

He only retired from this role at the age of  because he didn’t feel physically fit enough to continue in this busy schedule, otherwise he would have kept going. It was dficult for him to retire from this role as he loved it so much but was delighted to receive a beautul wall clock from the vestry in gratitude for his service.Rodney lived le to the full and was totally devoted to his late we Winred, his four children,  grandchildren and  Great grandchildren. He is survived by his brother Derek who lives in London and his sister Gwenda who lives in Portadown.The funeral Service was conducted by the Curate of St Marks Parish Church, Lucy Burden, and he is interred at Milltown Parish Churchyard, Birches.His son Paul said the family are very touched by the many tributes to Rodney and wants everyone to know that they are extremely grateful for all the messages of sympathy. They also want to thank the staff at Craigavon Hospital for the exceptional care they provided in his final days and the many years of service provided by Anne’s Home care who treated him like a member of their own family.They also pay tribute to the clergy of St Mark’s church, William and Lucy, who provided huge support to the entire family circle during the recent dficult days. try catch  TrendingArrest after large stash of suspected drugs found in Portadown raidPolice concerned for safety of missing N.I. manDisgust at Tweet threatening Celtic superfan Jay BeattyWoman bullied by girl into buying knives at ASDA car parkLandscaper lsquoout of businessrsquo after theft          ..

He’s just taken over at the helm of the internationally renowned next generation science park which is home to  innovative knowledge based companies, who are employing more than , engineers, researchers, entrepreneurs and executives, across four locations – and has his sights firmly set on making Northern Ireland a leader in two key innovative areas of tech business.Taking on the role as chief executive of Catalyst from stalwart Professor Norman Apsley OBE, just two months ago, plans are under way to build on the foundations of an organisation which has an estate of , sq ft of agile workspace filled with innovative companies. Catalyst leads the way in innovation and entrepreneurship by supporting the creation and growth of innovation companies in Northern Ireland.“We have a rightful place in leading the world. We aren’t going to follow anybody. Let’s get back to leading the world,” Steve tells Ulster Business.“I am going to take the foundation that Norman left and look at how we leverage that by a signicant factor – in terms of economic activity and dynamism for Northern Ireland.“We need deeper, more strategic partnerships with key institutions. It is through collaboration we can do something to scale and put Northern Ireland on a world map.”Catalyst is the thriving, beating heart of Northern Ireland’s booming technology sector and leading the way in educating and preparing companies and young people for the changing world of work through the impact of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is seeing the impact of new technologies impacting on le, work and society.Formerly known as the Northern Ireland Science Park, Catalyst is an independent not-for-profit organisation operating across the region. It provides agile workspace across four locations – the main site in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the Innovation centres in Londonderry, and Ballymena and most recently opened Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, a co-working space dedicated to the fintech sector in Belfast city centre, which is a partnership with Danske Bank.“The business model we have had for the first  years was the perfect model for that period. We need a new model for the next. We are identying a simple, but ambitious strategy – building on the existing foundation.”Part of the strength of Catalyst is in attracting big international firms, such as Citi, in close proximity to businesses at the very birth of existence. Steve says as a result, “accidental encounters” lead to relationships and outcomes which otherwise, would not have happened.It also plays host to Queen’s University’s leading research body, ECITwhich itself is home to CSIT .Some of the leading thinkers based at the site include ECIT’s Professor Maire O’Neill – one of the youngest ever engineering professors at Queen’s, one-time UK Female Inventor of the Year and a leading researcher. “You have US companies looking at why would they want to move to Northern Ireland – they want to meet Professor O’Neill. She’s amazing,” Steve says.“Then there are cyber companies, like B-Secur. The firm specialises in technology which can read your ECG heartbeat as a unique biometric identy verication.“There are other indigenous companies, like Titan IC in cyber-security, Displaynote and ProAxsis. We have great companies that are now making a dent in the world.”And pushing forward with what his predecessor Norman Apsley built, plans are under way to expand and redevelop Catalyst further still.That includes another new building, Pierpont  – which will provide another , sq ft of space – and a revamp and refurbishment of Catalyst’s Innovation Centre, as part of an addition £m investment.“We want to make this the best place to work – improving the environment, the flow around the campus, the accessibility, and the experience, so that you love being here.“We want to refresh some of the buildings on the site. The Innovation Centre will be modernised by March and we will freshen-up our identity.”His big goal is to lead the way in two areas of technology and business at Catalyst – putting Northern Ireland front and centre.“We want to help to incubate two clusters where Northern Ireland leads the world.“How do we build on what ECIT is doing  We take the start-up capability, and ecosystem we have in Northern Ireland and leverage that further.“We want to make it easier for corporations to set up in Belfast and Northern Ireland in order to access amazing research talent. They want to define what the next big breakthrough is.“We can develop something for global companies that they can’t find where in the world. We want to create clusters, that will act as a magnet to attract hundreds of companies.”One of the unique elements of Catalyst is Connect – a network of experienced entrepreneurs, business professionals, top research talent and potential investors who provide their time and experience pro bono to help foster and develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.“It’s helping entrepreneurs to figure out how to build a company around their product idea and providing the support to validate and access the marketplace, capital, investment and or talent,” Steve says.“With the Connect network, we had  early stage companies or entrepreneurs engaged in our programmes last year. There is a lot of exciting and vibrant activity going on at the moment.”And it was Connect, which Steve founded and developed at Catalyst, which first drew him back home to his native Northern Ireland, following years of running and founding tech firms in the West Coast of the US.“I was an entrepreneur in Calornia for a number of years, in San Francisco and San Diego. I was there for the peak of the dot coms,” he said.That included his own start-up business, Kineticom, as well as other tech companies. It was his time in San Diego which resonated strongly with Steve.“Personally, I became obsessed with the San Diego story and the parallels to Northern Ireland. When they started on their journey in , San Diego had a population of . million people, % of their economy was dependent on the public sector. They have an ocean to one side, a mountain range around them and another country to the bottom of them.”San Diego went from the bottom of every league table to the top – with the collaboration of top universities, research and development and entrepreneurship, building the city into the tech stalwart it is now.The Connect  emanated from San Diego – a concept which help shaped the programme in Northern Ireland.“Meeting Norman Apsley at the Science Park was just the most beautul thing ever,” Steve says.The financial and economic impact and contribution that Catalyst has is hard to ignore. It’s estimated the businesses which operate there contribute around £m in GVA each year.“Everything we do is based on the simple belief that innovation has the power to transform our economy. People around the world are all innovating quickly, adapting new technologies, articial intelligence, for example. In Northern Ireland,people are producing goods and services, but are behind in adopting those new technologies, our economy is going to be in trouble as we will not be competitive.“The question is, how does innovation become the foundation on which everything is based ”And as a result of Catalyst’s research into the NI Knowledge Economy, an annual report published later this month, which acknowledges the huge changes to the workplace in the coming year, Catalyst is hosting their second Future of Work summit in May  – aimed at demystying how roles and traditional jobs are changing, right across the Knowledge Economy sectors.Of course, Brexit is still on the horizon. For Steve, the main concern is around the availability of talent. “The tech sector is hungry for talent, but with the uncertainty in the last couple of years, fewer people have been willing to consider moving to Northern Ireland. That places a lot of pressure on the existing employees in the sector.”“Long-term, we have to be optimistic and look at the opportunities which can come out of Brexit. The businesses within the Knowledge Economy are export driven, representing over % of all NI exports. With % of these exports outside the EU, the Knowledge Economy is the sector least dependent on Europe and should be the key for driving growth at this time of uncertainty.”So, for Steve, his level of optimism and dynamism is clear in his new role, one which he says he is “very fortunate” to have.“It’s a position which comes around so rarely, and whoever gets the opportunity is so blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity to lead. We have a talented team of people who are all passionate about what is possible. It’s so exciting. The opportunities and possibilities are endless.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/323433.jpg","title":"theresa mays brexit deal voted down business reaction","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by John Mulgrew Business groups have overwhelmingly raised concerns over crashing out of the EU without a deal after Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal plan with Brussels was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs. Ann McGregor, chief executive of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry “The business communities that we represent have always had a erse range of views on what form the UK’s future relationship with the EU should take, however they do agree on the need to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit. “To achieve this we therefore need an agreement that will secure the transition period and protect jobs. As businesses wait to see what happens next in Parliament, it is crucial that those at Westminster move beyond tactical manoeuvring and look at all the options in order to avoid a ‘no deal’s scenario. “Firms are in the dark on too many aspects of le after March . This has already led to many businesses taking action – pausing on recruitment and investment, stockpiling goods, and relocating factories in other parts of the EU. In fact, a third of NI Chamber members are currently putting growth and investment plans on hold in the absence of clarity from Westminster. There is however nothing to stop government acting decisively on areas within their control, such as migration and customs procedures.”  Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “The result this evening will be a cause for concern across the Northern Ireland business community. Northern Ireland businesses desperately need certainty about the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU and will be severely disadvantaged by a no deal. A no deal Brexit means that Northern Ireland households will face higher prices and less choice on the shelves something they can ill afford. “Se need politicians  to coalesce around a workable solution that protects consumers from the costs and disruptions due to the loss of tarf-free and frictionless trade we currently enjoy with partners in the EU. We are now closer than ever to the possibility of a no-deal that will be a disaster for Northern Ireland.” “  Angela McGowan, CBI Northern Ireland director “Every business will feel no deal is hurtling closer. A new plan is needed immediately. This is now a time for our politicians to make history as leaders. All MPs need to reflect on the need for compromise and to act at speed to protect the UKs economy. “No deal would immediately put Northern Irish jobs and businesses at risk and jeopardise years of positive economic development and integration across the island.  It must be avoided to protect our all-island economy.”  Glyn Roberts, Retail NI chief executive “This is a disappointing but not unexpected result. While the Prime Minister’s draft Withdrawal Bill was in no way perfect, it was definitely preferable to crashing out of the EU with no deal. “The Government now needs to work on a cross-party basis with Labour and other opposition parties to reach a broader agreement for a withdrawal deal and secure the transition period, protect jobs and a positive future relationship with the EU  Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster “Leaving the EU without a deal would damage the sustainability of the Hospitality industry and impact on the potential growth of Tourism in Northern Ireland. We appeal to our elected representatives to work together in a spirit of consensus government to ensure that a no deal scenario does not happen.”  Tina McKenzie, FSB NI policy chair “With the clock ticking down to Brexit Day in just  weeks, we are running out of time to avoid a clf-edge, no-deal outcome. “A disorderly exit from the EU would be deeply damaging for small businesses, causing disruption to supply chains, increasing costs and stling investment. “A no-deal is something which we simply cannot countenance, so it is imperative that political leaders sharpen their focus and do all they can to reach agreement in the short time available.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"no deal brexit could cost ni economy bn by ","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s economy could suffer a £bn drop in output by  in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, it’s been claimed.

The CBI calculates this could amount to an annual loss of output worth almost £bn by , based on today’s prices. It says “manufacturing activity is particularly important in Northern Ireland, and the agri-food sector, which employs thousands, is likely to be severely impacted as it is particularly exposed to the risk of higher tarfs and trade costs”. Angela McGowan, Northern Ireland director of the CBI, said: “CBI members across Northern Ireland are clear:the new approach to finding a Brexit deal continues to be a game of who blinks first, the Northern Irish economy will pay the price. “The deadlock will only be broken by a genuine attempt by all MPs to find consensus and compromise, not stick to rusting red lines and political conditions. Like the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland is not – and cannot be – ready for no deal. “The projected impact on our economy would be devastating and while business will do all it can to reduce some of the worst aspects, a no deal scenario is unmanageable. “The message from the CBI to our politicians is clear – we must see compromise or the whole country faces the unforgivable prospect of a disorderly Brexit which will affect jobs and livelihoods in Northern Ireland for decades to come.

The number of new developments probably aren’t servicing the needs of the demand. We still have an issue out there.“Slow, and modest growth is happening at the minute. But that’s good, and that’s sustainable.

There are some cases where deadlines don’t happen, things don’t go according to plans – for example, in a housing chain, someone can drop out.

But she believes it has normalised since then.“Things are picking up,” she says. “We have the experience here to keep going in a direction that suits the demographic that we serve.“We are here for the long-term, and factor that in. Ultimately, it has to be right for the consumer.“It’s also about the whole of Northern Ireland. It’s not just Belfast-centric, and we have to extend our reach. There’s good activity in dferent parts of Northern Ireland, and that’s where our roots are.”And after more than  years with the organisation, Darina says she has no plans to jump ship to another financial business.“I am totally bought in to the mutual ethos.
