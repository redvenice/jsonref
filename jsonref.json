(Insert eye roll) The one that is leaving early because day care has called…… again,’ wrote Adele on Facebook.‘The Mum that only talks about her kids in the lunch room. That Mum who is forever taking days off. And the one, that has a shorter working week and gets an extra day off?Adele explains that leaving work early for your kids isn’t a fun way to dodge the office. It comes with all kinds of stress.‘Let me assure you that they are on edge at work, hoping that daycare won’t call and their heart drops when the phone rings,’ writes Adele.‘They don’t want to leave again. They know how it looks. And if they leave, it’s because they have nobody else to cover them.‘And when the kids come along, life gets pretty busy. They are consumed with looking after the little one and won’t have much to talk about, other than them.‘At 3am, when they are rocking a baby with yet another illness they are dreading that they can’t go to work the next day, again. They are sick of missing work and do not want to fall behind.’With that, Adele shared a photo of herself with her new baby, to show exactly what her ‘time off’ work looks like.‘This is what they are up to when they are not at work,’ she explains. ‘There’s no coffee with friends or shopping sprees, beach trips or salon visits.‘It’s being rundown with hairy legs, mum buns and boogie filled snuggles. It’s selfless and can be bloody relentless.’Adele urges everyone to be a little kinder to working mums – to stop the judgement and understand that they’re not dossing about, but trying to juggle a bunch of overwhelming responsibilities.‘I’m very lucky to work in a workplace now that gets it,’ she writes. ‘But in previous roles I’ve felt the eye rolls and the guilt.‘Know that the new mum is finding her feet. The missed days at work are short lived.‘And behind the dark eyes is the same women that was first hired…. and she will be back. But she just needs a little understanding and a knowing smile.’Clearly the Facebook post struck a chord, as it’s since been shared more than 7,000 times and flooded with comments from mums thanking Adele for speaking up on their behalf.‘Parent guilt because you go to work, parent guilt because your little ones get sick, parent guilt because you enjoy going to work, parent guilt because you love being at home,’ wrote one commenter. ‘Double edge swords all over the bloody place but this too shall pass!’‘It was an internal struggle to “look good” and be reliable at work but also being the best mum I could be to my young son.‘Motherhood ain’t easy, and being a working mum definitely isn’t either. Less judgement and more understanding goes a long way in today’s day and age.’Hear that, everyone? Scale back the sighs and eye rolls and check in on the parents working in your office.

It’s a good name.’A town crier pictured reading a scroll outside the Lindo Wing (Picture: PA)The duke also remarked on how Sir Jerry Mateparae, New Zealand High Commissioner to the UK, had a ‘strong name’.William and Kate’s third child is a younger brother to Prince George and Princess Charlotte.Four-year-old George was christened George Alexander Louis in 2013, while Charlotte, who turns three next week, was named Charlotte Elizabeth Diana in 2015.Their names were announced when they were two days old.William joked on Monday that he had ‘thrice the worry’ now as he took the prince home to Kensington Palace, after the baby’s debut on the steps of the exclusive Lindo Wing maternity unit in London.The duchess is on maternity leave, but is expected to attend Harry and Ms Markle’s high-profile wedding in Windsor on May 19.Kate gave birth at the Lindo Wing of St Mary’s Hospital (Picture: Reuters) "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/09/4B9AC50C00000578-5659503-image-a-2_1524817387021.jpg","title":"Siblings nut allergies spend seven hour Emirates flight blankets heads%3Fito%3Dfacebook_share_article home","story":"    Shannen Sahota, 24, and her brother Sundeep, 33, were forced to spend a seven hour flight with blankets over their head and nostrilsThe siblings, from Wolverhampton, paid more than £5,000 on their holiday which was to Dubai and Singapore.They were treating their parents for their 60th birthdays.Ms Sahota claimed that she told Emirates staff three times about the nut allergies.  She said she told staff when booking, at check-in and then once more when boarding the flight.  But despite the repeated warnings, they were stunned when they discovered the chicken dinner main on the flight contained cashew nuts.      The siblings carry EpiPen jabs for emergencies and expressed their fury to the cabin crew at being exposed to nut residue carried through air vents.          The siblings were outraged after discovering nuts in the main meal on the flight, despite informing Emirates of their allergiesThey refused to move into the toilets after a staff member suggested it and spent the next seven hours sitting at the back of the plane with blankets covering their heads and nostrils.Ms Sahota, an analyst said: \u0027We felt so degraded and embarrassed - it was horrible and it was meant to be a happy occasion but the start of our holiday was ruined.\u0027We had contacted Emirates beforehand to make sure they were aware of our allergies, and when we arrived at the airport and checked our bags in, we let them know and they said it was all fine and that it was in the system.\u0027When we spoke to the people who greet you at the plane, the said it was fine and showed us to our seats.\u0027We had bought our own food and snacks with us as we just didn\u0027t want to take the risk as our allergies are so severe.\u0027When we realised what they were serving we were just completely panicked and started frantically buzzing for the staff to come over as it was too late to get off.\u0027We must have buzzed about 15 minutes before someone came - we told her the issue and how we had already informed them, multiple times about it.\u0027I told her that we could potentially die as we have got a severe nut allergy and she didn\u0027t seem to concerned.\u0027She asked if we had any medication for it and we always carry epi-pens, but they\u0027re only for emergencies and you need to go straight to hospital after.  They claimed that one staff member told them to move to the toilets, which the siblings (pictured holding their tickets) refused to do\u0027I said to her that we could potentially die, but she said there are 500 passengers on this plane and we can\u0027t stop them from having their dinner.\u0027She suggested that we sit at the back of the plane, but we explained that the nut particles would already be in the air.\u0027She said the only other option was for us to go and sit in the plane toilets - with cushions and blankets for the rest of the seven hours.\u0027  An Emirates spokesperson said: \u0027We are sorry to hear about Ms Sahota\u0027s complaint.\u0027Emirates tries to cater to all passenger specific needs by offering a number of special meals that cover as many medical, dietary and religious requirements as possible.

A long-planned trip, it involved the prime ministers of France and Australia.All the same, there was a sense of unease among courtiers this week as the prince found himself relegated behind William’s in-laws in the queue to see the latest addition to the House of Windsor.Despite the fact no other senior royals have called in to see the baby, the prince’s absence shines an uncomfortable light on the tricky and perplexing relationship between father and son.We have been here before, of course. Three years ago, Charles complained that he ‘almost never’ sees his first grandson, Prince George, and that he occupied a peripheral role in the little boy’s life.The dismay at seeing less than he expected of his first grandson was amplified because he hoped to become a mentor to the future king.Just a few days before George was born, Charles was happily asking a ladies’ circle for ‘any hints’ on being a grandfather.The anticipation was clear, and it was obvious to those ladies that Charles was determined to be the attentive and loving grandfather he never knew himself.The prince was only three when George VI died, and he never knew his paternal grandfather, Prince Philip’s playboy father Prince Andrew of Greece, who died in 1944.It is not difficult to see how this sparked his desire to be involved in the development of young George, particularly as Charles feels they have a special connection.For he knows that, like himself, George is probably going to have to wait almost a lifetime before he fulfils his destiny. But from the outset, according to insiders, William’s attitude was somewhat different. ‘Very strange,’ says one.On the day Kate’s labour began at St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, Charles was on a train en route to a day of engagements.He had offered to cancel his duties, but was assured it was not necessary because William did not want visitors to come to the hospital immediately, fearing they would be disruptive. Instead, George’s first visitors were the Middletons, which established a pattern that, tellingly, repeated itself this week.When Kate’s due date with Princess Charlotte emerged, the same instruction not to visit and not to cancel engagements followed. But as a royal aide noted: ‘The Middletons don’t do engagements, so it didn’t apply to them.’In the event, Charlotte was born at the weekend and Kate quickly went home to Kensington Palace. When it became clear to Charles that the Middletons would be visiting, he made an immediate decision to go, driving himself and Camilla from Highgrove.According to a friend, he felt it would ‘look awful’ if he didn’t visit his new granddaughter at the same time as the Middletons.He was said to have ‘hared’ down the motorway to London, and even radioed ahead to London for an aide to collect a gift from Clarence House which Camilla had chosen for the baby, to be sent over to Kensington Palace.In the event, Granny Carole and Grandpa Charles arrived at the palace almost at the same time.‘When it suits him, William can be friendly and welcoming, but he can also be aloof and icy,’ says a close figure. ‘With his father, he can be cordial or effusive, especially if he wants more money, as he did for work on Anmer Hall – his house in Norfolk. He dispenses niceties like he is the owner of a sweet shop to a small child.’Nothing illustrates this wilful approach better than William’s reaction after Charles included a picture on his desk of him with George – alongside photographs of William and Harry – for one of the regular in-house videos the Prince of Wales makes for his charities in Commonwealth countries.William complained bitterly, even though the picture was one that had been issued publicly.Nor, say friends, has he made any secret of the fact that he views the relationship that Carole and Mike Middleton enjoy with their children as being just what he covets for his own family.It doesn’t take a genius to work out that he doesn’t think he has had that kind of relationship with his father.For Charles, who wants only to be a mentor and sounding board for his sons and his grandchildren, it is not just a puzzling situation. It is also a sad one.

He played Obama like a fiddle...Trump warns countries who don’t support the combined 2026...Share this articleAware of the optics, anxious German diplomats pressed, in vain, for Merkel to enjoy a similarly meaty two days at the White House, betting the face time would help sweeten difficult relations, officials told AFP.When Merkel last came to Washington, the cautious dry-witted chancellor held several awkward joint appearances with her more impulsive host -- clashing publicly over defense spending, trade and migration.This time around, the tricolor French flags were only just removed in time for Merkel\u0027s arrival for a one day, run-of-the-mill \u0027working visit.\u0027The stylistic differences between the Macron and Merkel visits are \u0027very telling\u0027 according to Mona Krewel of Cornell University.It points, she said, \u0027to the much more difficult relationship Trump has with Merkel.\u0027          Unlike French President Emamanuel Macron, Merkel\u0027s visit is a one day, run-of-the-mill \u0027working visit\u0027That is a dramatic change in fortunes for the German leader who, for more than a decade, was seen by Washington not just as a sensible and pragmatic interlocutor, but the de facto leader of Europe.Her relationship with Barack Obama was particularly close, officials from that administration have said, so much so that he was a powerful voice encouraging her to run for a fourth term.Their partnership has proven, along with centrists claiming her as the new \u0027leader of the free world\u0027, to be a poisoned chalice for Berlin in the age of Trump.Just hours before the chancellor landed late Thursday, some 15 months after Trump was sworn into office, the Republican Congress finally got around to confirming an ambassador to Germany.Shortly after his nomination, Richard Grenell, who is known for his pugilistic conservatism and combative defense of Trump\u0027s \u0027America First\u0027 policies, told AFP it was \u0027humbling\u0027 to be chosen for a post once held by John Quincy Adams, and he vowed to work diligently.\u0027There is a special responsibility that all US officials have to reject partisan politics when they take government service jobs,\u0027 he said.Merkel this week stressed that, despite the differences, she wants to preserve the bedrock strategic partnership.\u0027The transatlantic alliance, given the many non-democratic developments in this world,\u0027 she said, \u0027is a great treasure that I certainly want to cherish and nurture.\u0027Despite her more sober style, she is unlikely to erge much from Macron on substance.She will be trying to persuade Trump to back off his dual threats of punitive metal tariffs that could spark a transatlantic trade war and his instinct to scrap the Iran nuclear deal.  Merke\u0027s trip to Washington comes on the heels of visit by French President Emmanuel Macron, who was given a lavish welcome by TrumpTrump last month announced tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, claiming foreign imports were harming US national security by undermining the domestic production needed for military readiness.After an outcry from US allies, he granted a temporary exemption to key partners including the European Union, but this expires on May 1.Trump\u0027s National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow told CNBC Thursday that Washington would continue to exempt allied economies, including the EU, if they make concessions, citing the example of \u0027equal treatment of automobiles.\u0027On the eve of Merkel\u0027s US visit, Berlin\u0027s hopes were dim.\u0027From today\u0027s perspective, we must assume that the tariffs will come on May 1,\u0027 said a German government source. \u0027And then we will see how we will handle it.\u0027The next looming deadline is May 12, the date by which Trump has threatened to tear up the landmark 2015 agreement to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons in return for relief from international sanctions.Trump has called the agreement, which Germany helped negotiate, \u0027insane\u0027 and the \u0027worst deal ever,\u0027 demanding that its \u0027disastrous flaws\u0027 be fixed.Macron came away from his meetings speculating that Trump would kill the deal, but debate continues to rage.US Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis on Thursday said Washington was yet to make \u0027any decision\u0027 on tearing up the deal, but stressed that some aspects needed to be improved.It is unclear how Mike Pompeo\u0027s confirmation as Secretary of State will tilt the debate.Despite his hawkish views on Iran, his criticism of the deal had been somewhat tempered in internal discussions, officials said.As head of the CIA, for instance, he had relayed the spy agency\u0027s institutional assessment that Iran was broadly complying with the terms of the agreement, despite Trump\u0027s public pronouncements.The German foreign ministry has insisted that \u0027the biggest priority is maintaining the existing nuclear accord,\u0027 while Merkel has also called Iran\u0027s ballistic missile program a \u0027cause for concern.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/05/4B98CC9E00000578-0-image-m-54_1524802115804.jpg","title":"Ann Curry says reported Lauer behalf woman 2012","story":"    Former Today co-host Ann Curry (pictured with Lauer) has claimed that she reported Matt Lauer as a sex pest on behalf of another woman in 2012, despite NBC Chairman Andy Lack saying last year\u0027s complaint against Lauer was the first of its kind  Curry said she approached two members of NBC\u0027s management team after a female staffer told her she was \u0027sexually harassed physically\u0027 by Lauer. \u0027A woman approached me and asked me tearfully if I could help her,\u0027 Curry said Though Curry did not tell NBC management the woman\u0027s name, she did point to Lauer as the person of concern.   \u0027I told management they had a problem and they needed to keep an eye on him and how he deals with women,\u0027 she said.The NBC staffer also confirmed to the Post that she went to Curry with her complaint.An NBC spokesman told the newspaper that there was no record of the report and no mention of it was in Lauer\u0027s personnel file. The network also noted that Lack was not with the company at the time.

The number has soared by one million in a year as parking firms become more aggressive in their pursuit of motorists (stock image)In February, a Bill called Parking (Code of Practice) had its second reading in the Commons.Former Tory minister Sir Greg Knight, who introduced the Bill, told the Mail: ‘These figures are further evidence that my bill is necessary to ensure that most are treated fairly when they park and are not treated as cash cows by cowboy car parking operators.\u0027A new code of practice will ensure fairness for both the car park operator and the motorist.\u0027At the moment the scales of justice are tilted in favour of car park operators, many of whom are using sharp practices with impunity.’The number of vehicle details requested has soared since legislation was introduced in 2012.The Protection of Freedoms Act meant parking firms had to establish only who the registered keeper of the vehicle was, not who had been driving – triggering a surge in details purchased from the DVLA.          Companies bought a record 5.65million sets of vehicle-keeper records from the DVLA in the year to April  to enable them to hound drivers for fines of up to £100 (stock image)The most prolific of the private firms is ParkingEye, owned by outsourcing firm Capita, which was exposed by the Daily Mail for using ruthless tactics to collect licence fees for the BBC.The firm runs thousands of car parks around the country.

What’s going wrong?\u0027Are Britain’s motorists really flouting the rules on such an industrial scale?’The British Parking Association did not respond to requests for comment. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/14/4B9D947C00000578-0-image-m-19_1524835440300.jpg","title":"Govan dog walker finds human bone high schools grounds","story":"    Officers investigating the death of Julie Reilly, 47, have arrested a 41-year-old man who is to appear at Glasgow Sheriff\u0027s Court today A human bone has been found at a school as police confirmed the discovery was linked other body parts scattered around a Scottish town.The latest grisly find was made by a dog walker at Govan High School in Glasgow, Scotland, with police revealing that it is connected to the death of grandmother Julie Reilly.In the past week, horrified neighbours described finding human body parts littered around the streets of Govan, including one man who saw a fox carrying away a human hand.Ms Reilly was missing for more than two months before police this week confirmed she was now dead, as they launched a murder probe.Andrew Wallace was arrested and appeared at Glasgow Sheriff Court on Wednesday charged with murder and attempting to defeat the ends of justice, the Crown Office said.The 41-year-old, of no fixed address, made no plea and was remanded in custody with the case continued for further examination.A neighbour of the high school told the Daily Record: \u0027My daughter is at the school and her pal’s mum found a bone when she was out with the dog.Pictured: Hit-and-run horror smash that left Russell Brand’s...Share this article\u0027It was within a fenced-off area which is locked as it’s where the electricity generator is.\u0027There was only one police officer there when I went out.

We don\u0027t play games,\u0027 Trump saidHe said that he does feel a personal responsibility to broker a deal with Kim, if he can, and not just because he promoted himself as a deal-maker when he ran for office but because he is the leader of the free world.\u0027I think the responsibility has fallen on the shoulders of the President of the United States, \u0027 he said. \u0027I think I have a responsibility to see if I can do it.\u0027He added: \u0027And if I can\u0027t do it, it\u0027ll be a very tough time for a lot of countries, and a lot of people. It\u0027s certainly something that I hope I can do for the world.\u0027In the Oval Office, Trump earlier in the day, Trump complained that the United States had been \u0027played beautifully, like a fiddle\u0027 in the past by \u0027because you had a different kind of a leader\u0027  — a slam on former President Bill Clinton.\u0027We\u0027re not going to be played, okay? We\u0027re going to hopefully make a deal. If we don\u0027t, that\u0027s fine,\u0027 he said. \u0027We will, I think, come up with a solution. And if we don\u0027t, we leave the room. With great respect, we leave the room and just keep it going.\u0027Trump was optimistic on Friday that a commitment to end the decades-long Korean War and an agreement to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula would pave the way for him to meet face-to-face with Kim Jong-un. Two or three sites are under consideration, he revealed.Trump and Kim, the North Korean dictator, have spent the last year trading threats and insults as Pyongyang made rapid advances in pursuit of nuclear-armed missiles capable of hitting America.But amid a softening of relations between Pyongyang and Seoul, the two men have reached an agreement to discuss nuclear disarmament in person.Trump affirmed said he would be meeting with Kim \u0027in the coming weeks\u0027 during a White House celebration on Friday for Olympic athletes.\u0027I want to express my hope that all of the people of Korea, North Korea and South, can someday live in harmony, prosperity and peace,\u0027 he said. \u0027And it looks like it could happen.\u0027           Their dramatic meeting that resulted in an end to the decades long Korean War comes weeks before Kim Jong-un (left) is due to meet U.S. President Donald Trump          North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (centre, right, next to his suster Kim Yo Jong) and South Korean President Moon Jae-in (centre, left) had \u0027serious, frank\u0027 discussions on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and a permanent peace in their first summit session on Friday   Trump cautiously praised today\u0027s historic Korea meeting in a tweet this morning then spoke about it at a ceremony for Olympians at the White House.Trump said that people claimed that denuclearization was an \u0027impossibility\u0027 when he began his campaign to force North Korea to its break point.\u0027And now we have a much better alternative than anybody thought even possible,\u0027 he said.This year\u0027s Winter Olympics, held in South Korea, were instrumental to bringing the North and South together. They walked under one flag in Pyeongchang at the Opening Ceremony. \u0027Hopefully the day will come when Olympic athletes can compete on a Korean Peninsula that is free of nuclear weapons and where all Koreans can live together and care share their dreams,\u0027 Trump today observed.Kim became the first North Korean leader since the 1950-53 Korean War to set foot in the South this morning during talks in which he and South Korean President Moon Jae-in agreed to a \u0027complete denuclearization\u0027 during the talks.  In tweets on Friday morning Trump acknowledged the progress even as he cast doubt over how long positive diplomacy may last.\u0027After a furious year of missile launches and Nuclear testing, a historic meeting between North and South Korea is now taking place. Good things are happening, but only time will tell!\u0027 Trump wrote this morning.In a second message, he added: \u0027KOREAN WAR TO END! The United States, and all of its GREAT people, should be very proud of what is now taking place in Korea!\u0027 Trump gave his blessing last week to South Korea, an important American ally, to end the Korean War.The U.S. president has said in recent days that he will meet with Kim \u0027very soon\u0027 and probably by the beginning of June.\u0027It could be that I walk out quickly, with respect,\u0027 he said in a Thursday morning update. \u0027But it could be that the meeting doesn\u0027t even take place, who knows.\u0027           The White House released photos of outgoing CIA director Mike Pompeo meeting North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un on Thursday after Trump revealed their existence          The White House released photos yesterday of former CIA director Mike Pompeo —now Trump\u0027s secretary of state — meeting with Kim during a clandestine visit to Pyongyang earlier this month.\u0027He wasn\u0027t supposed to meet with Kim Jong-un, but he did,\u0027 Trump revealed on Fox \u0026amp Friends. \u0027We have incredible pictures of the two talking and meeting, which I\u0027d love to release if we can, I\u0027ll do that,\u0027 the president had said.Eight hours later, the White House published photos of Pompeo and Kim shaking hands, their countenance pleasant without extending into a grin. On Tuesday Trump said that North Korea\u0027s tyrant \u0027has been very open, and I think very honorable\u0027 in the lead-up to nuclear talks.He clarified later, after he came under scrutiny for the remark, that he meant, \u0027I hope that we will be able to deal in a very open and honorable fashion with North Korea. A lot is happening. And I think it\u0027s going to be very positive.\u0027Trump said Tuesday, as he met with France\u0027s Emmanuel Macron, that \u0027a lot of promises have been made by North Korea over the years,\u0027 however he has reason to believe that Kim, a 33-year-old dictator who took over from is father in 2011, is serious about wanting to make a deal.\u0027We have been very, very tough on maximum pressure. We have been very tough on, as you know, trade. We\u0027ve been very, very tough at the border. Sanctions have been the toughest we\u0027ve ever imposed on any country,\u0027 he said. \u0027And we think it will be a great thing for North Korea and it will be a great thing for the world.

However, his finish time was never recorded.According to Peter Mowbray, 51, a fellow runner who publicised the incident on Facebook, Mr Halliday was prevented from completing the race by two marshals who saw that he wasn\u0027t wearing a number and escorted him from the course.\u0027It takes a lot of work to run a marathon. It\u0027s not a matter of eating a bowl of pasta and having a go, it\u0027s 12 months worth of training,\u0027 Mr Mowbray said.\u0027Jake had his once-in-a-lifetime experience stolen from him by an imposter.

That man needs to go viral and be named and shamed.\u0027The London Marathon has seen a number of allegations of cheating in its 37-year history.In 2016, TOWIE star James Argent\u0027s sister Natasha had her results removed from the official race website and agreed to return her medal after she ‘ducked under a barrier’ during the race.She was found to have missed 11 out of 24 checkpoints and miraculously finishing the final 20km in just 39mins, quicker than Olympian Sir Mo Farah.In 2014, 34-year-old model Jason Scotland-Williams denied skipping nine miles of the course to achieve a \u0027miracle’ time, the second half of which fell just three minutes shy of the world record – and three minutes faster than Sir Mo.Four years before that, a runner thought to have recorded the quickest-ever time for a pensioner was stripped of his ‘fastest OAP’ title after admitting he took a 10 mile shortcut at Tower Bridge. He claimed he had altered his route due to injury.          The alleged imposter was photographed (pictured) by the friend of a fellow race-goer who said he took his t-shirt off and threw it into the grandstand and said he was behaving strangelyIn 2011, another competitor was disqualified from the Great North Run after it was revealed that he had travelled most of the final six miles on a bus.The following year, father-of-two Rob Sloan tried to get round his ban by entering the race again under a fake name while disguised in sunglasses. Runner Louise Rooney, 41, was coming towards the end of the race when she noticed the imposter behaving strangely.\u0027I was just running to the finish line past the grandstand when the imposter caught my eye,\u0027 she told MailOnline.\u0027He had a very distinctive haircut shaved all over apart from a stripe of hair at the back.\u0027He was walking with a woman I think towards the finish line and I saw him take off his t-shirt and throw it into the grandstand. It was a brightly coloured T-shirt, yellow or green.\u0027I thought that was strange as he hadn\u0027t even finished the race yet. Then he stopped and seemed to have second thoughts and he turned round walked back against the flow of the race. I assumed he was going back to get his shirt.\u0027The receptionist from Middlesex, who was running in support of Phab Kids, a charity for disabled children, added:\u0027He wasn\u0027t running at any point.

An emotional Tom Evans asked Alfie\u0027s Army to stand down last night as the family try to build bridges with Alder Hey and get their son home  Alfie Evans, pictured with his parents Tom and Kate, is fighting for life in Alder Hey hospital, LiverpoolConnie said: \u0027Since Charlie\u0027s passing in July last year, we have been working with paediatric consultants, medical ethicists, senior lawyers, U.K. politicians and other parents who have suffered through similar situations as us, to try and propose a law that will prevent parents experiencing painful and prolonged conflicts with medical professionals.\u0027This involves addressing problems around the \u0027best interests\u0027 test as well as creating a platform for transparency and openness so that cases like these can be dealt with before they ever reach the courts. We were calling this \u0027Charlie\u0027s Law\u0027 whilst also working on the foundation set up in his memory.\u0027Once cases are public it is difficult for people to be fully aware of the complexities and this often leads to illinformed judgements on both sides and creates unnecessary conflicts.\u0027We have something that is better for everybody - hospitals, healthcare professionals, families with sick children, the NHS, and the reputation of our own government. We would ask those pushing for law change to take account of the careful work already done, and join us as we continue to push for a solution that is best for all involved\u0027.Alfie Evans\u0027 \u0027Army\u0027 of supporters have abandoned protests outside Alder Hey - but left their banners, flags and balloons - as his family said today they want to take him home in the next day or two to live, not die.  The much-loved little boy is still alive inside the Liverpool hospital more than 72 hours after his life support was withdrawn.The toddler\u0027s parents Tom Evans, 21, and Kate James, 20, insist their son could survive for \u0027months or years\u0027 as they dramatically abandoned their fight to take him abroad for treatment and pledged to work with doctors in a bid to take him home.But Alfie\u0027s family have reacted with fury to claims that their attempt to \u0027build bridges\u0027 with Alder Hey meant they were accepting he is about to pass away.Mr Evans\u0027 brother Daniel said last night: \u0027Thomas and Kate are not preparing themselves for their son\u0027s death in no way shape or form, to get him home is their priority and that’s what they plan to do with the help of Alder Hey\u0027.He added: \u0027Alfie is doing good, 72 hours independent breathing!!\u0027  Alfie\u0027s supporters have spent weeks outside Alder Hey but they have heeded the warning and stayed away today, but their balloons and flags remain            Tom\u0027s brother Daniel has said Alfie\u0027s parents believe their don is coming home to live, not dieTom Evans also had a message for the tens of thousands in \u0027Alfie\u0027s Army\u0027 as he asked them to stand down \u0027if this is what it takes to get our son home\u0027.He said: \u0027Please respect this. You have all been the most crucial part of our fight and we love you all\u0027. Until last night, Mr Evans and Miss James were desperate to fly him to a hospital in the Vatican - but now accept their best hope of leaving Alder Hey is getting him home. Mr Evans said the \u0027warrior\u0027 toddler\u0027s mother has been keeping him alive with cuddles.He said: \u0027Alfie\u0027s fought through the night the last two nights because he\u0027s been lying on Kate\u0027s chest non-stop. And him and his mum have become closer now more than ever before\u0027.  A military helicopter had been put on standby at the request of the Pope, who met Mr Evans last week. But on Tuesday a High Court judge again refused the couple permission to take Alfie to Rome and his decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal the following day.  After a meeting with doctors, Mr Evans said he and Kate James, 20, and the hospital in Liverpool wanted privacy in order to ‘form a relationship, build a bridge and walk across it’.‘In Alfie’s interests we will work with his treating team on a plan that provides our boy with the dignity and comfort he needs,’ he said. The comments marked a huge sea change in the couple’s attitude to medics, whom Mr Evans had previously threatened to prosecute for conspiring to murder his 23-month-old son.Earlier yesterday he had said doctors were treating him and Miss James like criminals. Mr Evans, who wants three of his doctors prosecuted for conspiracy to murder, said: \u0027They hate us. They don\u0027t like us because I\u0027ve fought against them for so long and I\u0027m right\u0027.He added: \u0027We\u0027re not like them. We walk around the corridors and they pop into other cubicles to avoid us. They give us some horrible smug look as if we\u0027re in the wrong. It\u0027s like we\u0027re criminals and we\u0027re being looked down on\u0027.             Alfie, with his father sleeping in the background, is still fighting, his family say, despite a lack of a ventilator            Mr Evans made a plea for supporters to stop their protests in the hope it will convince doctors to let Alfie leave But by 6pm the couple had apparently decided to work with medics, thanking both supporters and hospital staff – many of whom have been the targets of abuse – and said they would not be making any more public comments.‘Our lives have been turned upside down by the intense focus on Alfie and his situation,’ Mr Evans said. ‘Our little family, along with Alder Hey, has become the centre of attention for many people around the world and it has meant we have not been able to live our lives as we would like.‘We are very grateful and we appreciate all the support we have received from around the world... (but) we would now ask you to return back to your everyday lives and allow myself, Kate and Alder Hey to form a relationship, build a bridge and walk across it.‘We also wish to thank Alder Hey staff at every level for their dignity and professionalism during what must be an incredibly difficult time for them too.’ Mr Evans’s comments came as protests and vigils were held in Poland, Ireland and the Vatican for Alfie, who was taken off life-support on Monday following a drawn-out legal battle.Doctors say he has a degenerative, incurable neurological condition, is in a deep coma and it is in his best interests to let him die.High Court judge Mr Justice Hayden urged the parents to disregard the advice of ‘pro-life’ campaigners who he accused of manipulating them and to spend what precious time they had left with their son.           People hold candles as they gather to attend a prayer vigil for terminally ill toddler Alfie Evans           Another candlelit vigil in support of Alfie Evans took place in front of the Great Britain embassy building in Warsaw          Alfie\u0027s Army have also gathered outside Liverpool including here at Belfast city Hall to voice their support for the childHe slammed the \u0027malign hand\u0027 of Pavel Stroilov, who works for the Christian Legal Centre (CLC), and called him a \u0027fanatical and deluded\u0027 man whose advice had come \u0027perilously close\u0027 to contempt of court.The couple apparently agreed with the judge, who said their only option was to work with medics to try to move Alfie from intensive care – either onto a normal ward, a hospice or home – for his final days. It came as health chiefs warned hospital staff to hide their uniforms due to threats directed at them after Alfie’s case. It came after a \u0027sick\u0027 and \u0027psychotic\u0027 minority of Alfie Evans\u0027 supporters threatened to \u0027burn down\u0027 Alder Hey and wished harm on doctors as it was revealed police are ready to arrest the trolls. For more information on the Charlie Gard Foundation click HERE "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/09/4B9B3A3300000578-0-image-m-10_1524818909412.jpg","title":"Im doing Ethan Simon Thomas leave Sky Sports","story":"    Simon Thomas\u0027 wife Gemma passed away last December, just three days after being diagnosed with acute myloid leukaemia\u0027I\u0027m doing it for Ethan,\u0027 he wrote. \u0027On that first morning after she went I remember Ethan coming up to me in the lounge and through his tears he said these words: Daddy, you know every weekend you go away and do the football, and I spend the weekend with Mummy, what do I do now?

We would talk on the phone from time to time, but every time I would ask to talk to her kids, she wouldn\u0027t let me.Flores, a mother of seven, says their parents had even flown out to visit the family but the Turpins would not give them an address.\u0027She never let us talk to her kids. She wouldn\u0027t even accept my Facebook request. We all wondered what was going on. My parents booked several flights to go see them but when they got there they wouldn\u0027t tell them where to go and my parents left crying every time. \u0027They died before they got to see them again. It\u0027s just heartbreaking and I\u0027m so embarrassed about all of this.\u0027          The 13 siblings lived at this property in Perris, California after moving from Texas David Turpin, 57, and Louise, 49, have pleaded not guilty to multiple counts of torture, child abuse, dependent adult abuse and false imprisonment dating. It has emerged the 13 siblings rescued will not live together again, despite pleading with the authorities to stay as a family.The six Turpin children among the 13 found shackled at their home in Perris have been told that they will be split up into two foster homes, unless they are adopted by their aunt.Meanwhile the seven adults, who have developmental issues, will be sent to an assisted living facility, CBS News reported. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/17/4B889F0200000578-0-Legoland_will_provide_free_entry_to_their_Windsor_Resort_park_fo-a-28_1524846725236.jpg","title":"Legoland free entry called Louis Royal baby naming","story":"    Legoland will provide free entry to their Windsor Resort park for a limited time to anyone who shares the same name as the Royal baby, His Royal Highness Louis Arthur Charles      Who is Janelle Monae? \u0026#8216Pansexual\u0026#8217 singer and actor revealed after Rolling Stone interview SNL\u0026#8217s Colin Jost and Michael Che to host the Emmys 2018Legoland to give free entry to anyone called Louis after Royal baby namingMarvel films get Unnecessary Censorship during Jimmy Kimmel\u0027s Avengers: Infinity War weekKanye West to launch DONDA Social to help City of ChicagoStephen Colbert says Melania Trump deserves $130K shopping spree for her birthdayWho is Maya Jama?

He tweeted this around 9.30am PST  West was spotted walking out of his Calabasas studio with a smoothie in one hand and his cell phone in the otherChance, whose father is a Democratic operative in Chicago who worked for future president Barack Obama, also shared a lengthy statement explaining he only wanted to support West, whom he called such a mentor that he felt like family.\u0027Anyone who knows me knows how passionate I am about my city and my loved ones,\u0027 began Chance. \u0027Kanye West in just a mentor or big brother to me. He\u0027s my family. No matter how much I may disagree with him, it\u0027s hard to watch people talk about someone I love-- even if they were justified in doing so. I didn\u0027t speak up because I agreed with what Kanye had to say or cause I fuck with Trump, I did it because I wanted to help my friend and cause I felt like I was being used to attack him.\u0027\u0027I\u0027d never support anyone who has made a career out of hatred, racism and discrimination,\u0027 Chance tweeted in reference to Trump.Chance said his comments were ill-timed but that Chicago has had \u0027generations of Democratic officials with no investment or regard for black schools, neighborhood(s) or black lives.\u0027          Several fans have tweeted that West may be experiencing a mental breakdown, but Chance cleared the air on that assumption as well          That tweet was followed by another that read: \u0027Next President gon be independent\u0027          Kanye West fans and supporters have been left ided after he traded adoring tweets with President Donald Trump, but Chance the Rapper has come to his defense          West and Chance the Rapper at the Magnificent Coloring Day Festival at Comiskey Park in Chicago in 2016\u0027We have to talk honestly about what is happening and has been happening in this country and we have to challenge those who are responsible, as well as those who are giving them a pass,\u0027 said Chance, whose charity last year pledged $2.2 million for arts programs in Chicago public schools.West met Trump in 2016 after the rapper cut short a tour following a breakdown. But West has said little about why he admires the real estate tycoon, who came to political prominence promoting unfounded conspiracy theories about Obama\u0027s place of birth.West tweeted on Friday: \u0027I haven\u0027t done enough research on conservatives to call myself or be called one. I\u0027m just refusing to be enslaved by monolithic thought.\u0027Chance was joined by Kanye\u0027s wife Kim Kardashian who also rushed to his defense after he blasted former president Barack Obama.\u0027He\u0027s a free thinker, is that not allowed in America? Because some of his ideas differ from yours you have to throw in the mental health card?\u0027 Kim tweeted. \u0027That\u0027s just not fair.

He is my brother. I love everyone. I don\u0027t agree with everything anyone does. That\u0027s what makes us iniduals.\u0027 He later revealed that his MAGA hat is signed by the President himself, posting a picture of the accessory, which itself prompted another reply from Trump which simply read: \u0027MAGA!\u0027 Trump later retweeted the message and wrote: \u0027Thank you Kanye, very cool!\u0027           Chance the Rapper and Kim Kardashian were both quick to rush to West\u0027s defense on Wednesday after he blasted former president Barack Obama.          But Kardashian later took to her own Twitter to defend her husband, tweeting around 12.30pm PST that her husband was \u0027years ahead of his time\u0027          Less than an hour later at 10.30 PST, West tweeted that his wife Kim Kardashian had called him about the Trump tweet          Kardashian (pictured with West in a recent family photo) was a vocal supporter of Clinton during the 2016 presidential election campaign Later on Wednesday evening, West turned his attention to former president Barack Obama, tweeting: \u0027Obama was in office for eight years and nothing in Chicago changed.\u0027 However, he declared his respect for Hillary Clinton, writing \u0027I love Hillary too\u0027.Kanye then retweeted a post in which President Trump was expressing his excitement about meeting Apple CEO Tim Cook with the caption: \u0027Can\u0027t wait to meet\u0027.Next he posted a photo of Trump and Cook speaking together and said \u0027caption this photo\u0027.  Seconds later he wrote: \u00272 of my favorite people\u0027 before retweeting Trump\u0027s \u0027MAGA\u0027 tweet again. After that he posted messages which had apparently been sent by popular New York radio host Ebro Darden that seemed to discuss the rapper\u0027s support for Trump.          Trump later retweeted the message on his page and wrote: \u0027Thank you Kanye, very cool!\u0027           The president then tweeted the photo of the hat with \u0027MAGA!\u0027          West even tweeted a picture of himself in a Make America Great Again hat (pictured here with music mogul Lyor Cohen in center and an unidentified man)          Around 12.30pm PST West posted a picture of his MAGA hat to show that it had been signed by Trump himself          Chance\u0027s tweet also caught the attention of the president\u0027s son, Donald Trump Jr, who retweeted it           At 1pm PST he tweeted a screen grab of Trump\u0027s retweet - posted half an hour earlier - which he had seen from mediatkd, a Kanye West Twitter fan page\u0027And in a few years when someone else says the same exact thing but they aren\u0027t labeled the way he is and you will all praise them! Kanye is years ahead of his time.\u0027  Kardashian also hit back at the media, which she said was trying to \u0027demonize\u0027 West.  \u0027Your commentary on Kanye being erratic \u0026amp his tweets being disturbing is actually scary,\u0027 she wrote. \u0027So quick to label him as having mental health issues for just being himself when he has always been expressive is not fair.\u0027 Don Jr jumped in to show his support for Kardashian, retweeting her defense of West and adding #ImWithHer - the hashtag originally used to show support for Clinton during the 2016 presidential election.West\u0027s public support for Trump even made its way into the discussion at the White House press briefing on Wednesday. A reporter asked Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders if Trump had reached out to West following the rapper\u0027s recent praise. \u0027I don\u0027t know of any conversation that they\u0027ve had over the last week or so, I\u0027ll keep you posted if that changes,\u0027 Sanders said, breaking into a smile.  \u0027I know they met during the transition, that\u0027s the only meeting I\u0027m aware of that\u0027s taken place, or conversation.\u0027   West first revealed his support for Trump shortly after the November 2016 election, when he told a California concert audience he would have voted for the Republican.\u0027I told y\u0027all I didn\u0027t vote, right? But if I would\u0027ve voted, I would\u0027ve voted for Trump,\u0027 he said. \u0027We live in a racist country. That is a fact. This world is racist, OK?

So what tangible measures have agreed at the meeting?Inter-Korean Exchanges  Chung Gum Hwang and Yunjong Won lead out North Korean and South Korean athletes during the opening ceremony of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympic Games (Mike EgertonPA Images)Following the Winter Olympics, when the two Koreas marched together at the opening ceremony and had a joint ice-hockey team, the two countries have agreed to send joint teams to future events such as the 2018 Asian Games.The leaders also agreed to address the highly emotive issue of reunions between families ided by the war and the border, and to resurrect family visits, which were ended in 2015 as relations on the Korean peninsula deteriorated.The two sides agreed to hold \u0027reunion programmes\u0027 on August 15, the day both Koreas celebrate their independence from Japanese colonisation.After Moon took office last May, his administration quickly asked that the visits resume, but North Korea never officially responded.          South Korean Min Ho-Sik, centre,  84, hugs his North Korean relative Min Eun-Sik, right, 81, during a family reunion meetingNorth Korean state media implied that the programme could be resumed if South Korea sent back a dozen North Korean waitresses who defected to the South after working at a restaurant in China, but that demand appears to have been dropped.In order to build on the breakthrough in relations achieved at Panmunjon, the two sides have agree to establish joint liaison office with resident representatives of both sides in the Kaesong industrial zone on their border.Currently, the two Koreas have respective liaison offices on each side of the border and use phones and fax machines for communication.Officials will from both sides will be based at the office, located in an area where North Korean workers are employed by South Korean companies, with the aim of smoothing communications between the two countries.De-escalating tension in the Demilitarized ZoneAs well as agreeing to begin moves to formally end the Korean War, the two leaders also agreed measures to east tension the Demilitarised Zone.The DMZ, which is 2.5 miles wide and snakes for 150 miles along the 38th parallel, was drawn in the 1953 armistice that ended three years of bitter fighting.Over the years, it has not just been a physical frontier but a potent symbol of the tensions between the two Koreas, who blare out propaganda messages across their borders using enormous loudspeakers.

North Korean has been working towards acquiring nuclear weapons since the early 1990s and many analysts are sceptical about its conversion to denucleasizationChristopher Hill, who was the lead U.S. negotiator with North Korea under the George W. Bush administration, said the onus would be on the Trump administration to work out the details of a deal.Key hurdles would be to establish a timetable for denuclearization and to overcome North Korean reluctance to allow a verification process.\u0027I\u0027m guided by my experience which was they said all the right things but they gave us a declaration that was not complete and not entirely accurate, and they also failed to give us any kind of verification protocol,\u0027 Hill said. As for unification, the idea remains a distant dream, though one brought a small step nearer by the agreement to end the war, a precondition for talks both sides have long held.The first priority, according to South Korea\u0027s Unification Ministry, is to develop a sustainable relationship and resolve the issue of North Korea\u0027s development of nuclear weapons.South Korea wants to then develop trust and cooperation to the point where a sort of national consensus has been achieved.After a transitional commonwealth period, the next step would be the formation of a single market on the Korean Peninsula \u0027to create new growth engines and create an inter-Korean economic community of coexistence and co-prosperity.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/09/4B9AC50C00000578-5659503-image-a-2_1524817387021.jpg","title":"Siblings nut allergies spend seven hour Emirates flight blankets heads","story":"    Shannen Sahota, 24, and her brother Sundeep, 33, were forced to spend a seven hour flight with blankets over their head and nostrilsThe siblings, from Wolverhampton, paid more than £5,000 on their holiday which was to Dubai and Singapore.They were treating their parents for their 60th birthdays.Ms Sahota claimed that she told Emirates staff three times about the nut allergies.  She said she told staff when booking, at check-in and then once more when boarding the flight.  But despite the repeated warnings, they were stunned when they discovered the chicken dinner main on the flight contained cashew nuts.      The siblings carry EpiPen jabs for emergencies and expressed their fury to the cabin crew at being exposed to nut residue carried through air vents.          The siblings were outraged after discovering nuts in the main meal on the flight, despite informing Emirates of their allergiesThey refused to move into the toilets after a staff member suggested it and spent the next seven hours sitting at the back of the plane with blankets covering their heads and nostrils.Ms Sahota, an analyst said: \u0027We felt so degraded and embarrassed - it was horrible and it was meant to be a happy occasion but the start of our holiday was ruined.\u0027We had contacted Emirates beforehand to make sure they were aware of our allergies, and when we arrived at the airport and checked our bags in, we let them know and they said it was all fine and that it was in the system.\u0027When we spoke to the people who greet you at the plane, the said it was fine and showed us to our seats.\u0027We had bought our own food and snacks with us as we just didn\u0027t want to take the risk as our allergies are so severe.\u0027When we realised what they were serving we were just completely panicked and started frantically buzzing for the staff to come over as it was too late to get off.\u0027We must have buzzed about 15 minutes before someone came - we told her the issue and how we had already informed them, multiple times about it.\u0027I told her that we could potentially die as we have got a severe nut allergy and she didn\u0027t seem to concerned.\u0027She asked if we had any medication for it and we always carry epi-pens, but they\u0027re only for emergencies and you need to go straight to hospital after.  They claimed that one staff member told them to move to the toilets, which the siblings (pictured holding their tickets) refused to do\u0027I said to her that we could potentially die, but she said there are 500 passengers on this plane and we can\u0027t stop them from having their dinner.\u0027She suggested that we sit at the back of the plane, but we explained that the nut particles would already be in the air.\u0027She said the only other option was for us to go and sit in the plane toilets - with cushions and blankets for the rest of the seven hours.\u0027  An Emirates spokesperson said: \u0027We are sorry to hear about Ms Sahota\u0027s complaint.\u0027Emirates tries to cater to all passenger specific needs by offering a number of special meals that cover as many medical, dietary and religious requirements as possible. However, Emirates cannot guarantee completely nut-free flights.\u0027We\u0027ve looked into Ms Sahota\u0027s booking and our records do not reflect any mention of a nut allergy. All passengers who alert us of a nut allergy prior to travel are informed of our policy and it is also outlined on our website\u0027When alerted during the flight, our crew tried their best to offer Ms Sahota and her brother alternative locations in an open space in back of the aircraft cabin to minimise their proximity to other passengers who may be consuming meals with nuts.\u0027We apologise for any inconvenience caused and our customer care team will be in touch with Miss Sahota directly.\u0027  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/23/08/04AC68ED00000514-0-image-a-2_1524469795473.jpg","title":"Prince Louis Cambridge takes place royal order succession","story":"Here is how the line of succession looks now that Kate and William\u0027s new royal baby has been bornFollowing the baby\u0027s arrival, Prince Harry  shifts down the line of succession to sixth place.The Duke of York, who was born second in line, has moved to seventh and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie to eighth and ninth.Andrew falling out of the top six means he will no longer have to ask the Queen for permission to marry - unlike Charles, William, George, Charlotte and Harry. Kate Middleton royal baby LIVE: First pictures as Duchess of...Kate\u0027s in Labour!

He played Obama like a fiddle...Trump warns countries who don’t support the combined 2026...Share this articleAware of the optics, anxious German diplomats pressed, in vain, for Merkel to enjoy a similarly meaty two days at the White House, betting the face time would help sweeten difficult relations, officials told AFP.When Merkel last came to Washington, the cautious dry-witted chancellor held several awkward joint appearances with her more impulsive host -- clashing publicly over defense spending, trade and migration.This time around, the tricolor French flags were only just removed in time for Merkel\u0027s arrival for a one day, run-of-the-mill \u0027working visit.\u0027The stylistic differences between the Macron and Merkel visits are \u0027very telling\u0027 according to Mona Krewel of Cornell University.It points, she said, \u0027to the much more difficult relationship Trump has with Merkel.\u0027          Unlike French President Emamanuel Macron, Merkel\u0027s visit is a one day, run-of-the-mill \u0027working visit\u0027That is a dramatic change in fortunes for the German leader who, for more than a decade, was seen by Washington not just as a sensible and pragmatic interlocutor, but the de facto leader of Europe.Her relationship with Barack Obama was particularly close, officials from that administration have said, so much so that he was a powerful voice encouraging her to run for a fourth term.Their partnership has proven, along with centrists claiming her as the new \u0027leader of the free world\u0027, to be a poisoned chalice for Berlin in the age of Trump.Just hours before the chancellor landed late Thursday, some 15 months after Trump was sworn into office, the Republican Congress finally got around to confirming an ambassador to Germany.Shortly after his nomination, Richard Grenell, who is known for his pugilistic conservatism and combative defense of Trump\u0027s \u0027America First\u0027 policies, told AFP it was \u0027humbling\u0027 to be chosen for a post once held by John Quincy Adams, and he vowed to work diligently.\u0027There is a special responsibility that all US officials have to reject partisan politics when they take government service jobs,\u0027 he said.Merkel this week stressed that, despite the differences, she wants to preserve the bedrock strategic partnership.\u0027The transatlantic alliance, given the many non-democratic developments in this world,\u0027 she said, \u0027is a great treasure that I certainly want to cherish and nurture.\u0027Despite her more sober style, she is unlikely to erge much from Macron on substance.She will be trying to persuade Trump to back off his dual threats of punitive metal tariffs that could spark a transatlantic trade war and his instinct to scrap the Iran nuclear deal.  Merke\u0027s trip to Washington comes on the heels of visit by French President Emmanuel Macron, who was given a lavish welcome by TrumpTrump last month announced tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, claiming foreign imports were harming US national security by undermining the domestic production needed for military readiness.After an outcry from US allies, he granted a temporary exemption to key partners including the European Union, but this expires on May 1.Trump\u0027s National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow told CNBC Thursday that Washington would continue to exempt allied economies, including the EU, if they make concessions, citing the example of \u0027equal treatment of automobiles.\u0027On the eve of Merkel\u0027s US visit, Berlin\u0027s hopes were dim.\u0027From today\u0027s perspective, we must assume that the tariffs will come on May 1,\u0027 said a German government source. \u0027And then we will see how we will handle it.\u0027The next looming deadline is May 12, the date by which Trump has threatened to tear up the landmark 2015 agreement to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons in return for relief from international sanctions.Trump has called the agreement, which Germany helped negotiate, \u0027insane\u0027 and the \u0027worst deal ever,\u0027 demanding that its \u0027disastrous flaws\u0027 be fixed.Macron came away from his meetings speculating that Trump would kill the deal, but debate continues to rage.US Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis on Thursday said Washington was yet to make \u0027any decision\u0027 on tearing up the deal, but stressed that some aspects needed to be improved.It is unclear how Mike Pompeo\u0027s confirmation as Secretary of State will tilt the debate.Despite his hawkish views on Iran, his criticism of the deal had been somewhat tempered in internal discussions, officials said.As head of the CIA, for instance, he had relayed the spy agency\u0027s institutional assessment that Iran was broadly complying with the terms of the agreement, despite Trump\u0027s public pronouncements.The German foreign ministry has insisted that \u0027the biggest priority is maintaining the existing nuclear accord,\u0027 while Merkel has also called Iran\u0027s ballistic missile program a \u0027cause for concern.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/06/4B98B2C800000578-5663467-image-m-12_1524806884888.jpg","title":"A dozen jogging guards surround Kim Jong uns Mercedes limo","story":"The crack team is believed to have been chosen from the Supreme Guard Command which overseen the Kim family for three generations          Television showed the bodyguards in a ring-shaped formation around the vehicle as it rolled back to the northern side of the Panmunjom truce village           The guards deftly altered their formation to avoid being hit as the car turned a slight bend in the roadKim was seen stepping into the limo outside the Peace House, where his talks with Moon had taken place. As the vehicle began to pull off the bodyguards immediately leapt into action, peeling off one by one to ensure it was covered on all sides. A bromance blossoms as Kim and Moon hold hands during...Otto Warmbier\u0027s family sue North Korea for the brutal...Share this articleThe guards deftly altered their formation to avoid being hit as the car turned a slight bend before crossing a patch of dead grass over to its destination. Twitter users poked fun at the bizarre video after it emerged online.           The Mercedes limo then crossed a patch of dead grass on the way to the dictator\u0027s lunch destination          The all male team of suited guards followed the North Korean dictator throughout the day   The bodyguards first appeared as Kim descended steps towards the demilitarized zone and President Moon          Later they reappeared to run next to Kim\u0027s car.

We don\u0027t play games,\u0027 Trump saidHe said that he does feel a personal responsibility to broker a deal with Kim, if he can, and not just because he promoted himself as a deal-maker when he ran for office but because he is the leader of the free world.\u0027I think the responsibility has fallen on the shoulders of the President of the United States, \u0027 he said. \u0027I think I have a responsibility to see if I can do it.\u0027He added: \u0027And if I can\u0027t do it, it\u0027ll be a very tough time for a lot of countries, and a lot of people. It\u0027s certainly something that I hope I can do for the world.\u0027In the Oval Office, Trump earlier in the day, Trump complained that the United States had been \u0027played beautifully, like a fiddle\u0027 in the past by \u0027because you had a different kind of a leader\u0027  — a slam on former President Bill Clinton.\u0027We\u0027re not going to be played, okay? We\u0027re going to hopefully make a deal. If we don\u0027t, that\u0027s fine,\u0027 he said. \u0027We will, I think, come up with a solution. And if we don\u0027t, we leave the room. With great respect, we leave the room and just keep it going.\u0027Trump was optimistic on Friday that a commitment to end the decades-long Korean War and an agreement to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula would pave the way for him to meet face-to-face with Kim Jong-un. Two or three sites are under consideration, he revealed.Trump and Kim, the North Korean dictator, have spent the last year trading threats and insults as Pyongyang made rapid advances in pursuit of nuclear-armed missiles capable of hitting America.But amid a softening of relations between Pyongyang and Seoul, the two men have reached an agreement to discuss nuclear disarmament in person.Trump affirmed said he would be meeting with Kim \u0027in the coming weeks\u0027 during a White House celebration on Friday for Olympic athletes.\u0027I want to express my hope that all of the people of Korea, North Korea and South, can someday live in harmony, prosperity and peace,\u0027 he said. \u0027And it looks like it could happen.\u0027           Their dramatic meeting that resulted in an end to the decades long Korean War comes weeks before Kim Jong-un (left) is due to meet U.S. President Donald Trump          North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (centre, right, next to his suster Kim Yo Jong) and South Korean President Moon Jae-in (centre, left) had \u0027serious, frank\u0027 discussions on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and a permanent peace in their first summit session on Friday   Trump cautiously praised today\u0027s historic Korea meeting in a tweet this morning then spoke about it at a ceremony for Olympians at the White House.Trump said that people claimed that denuclearization was an \u0027impossibility\u0027 when he began his campaign to force North Korea to its break point.\u0027And now we have a much better alternative than anybody thought even possible,\u0027 he said.This year\u0027s Winter Olympics, held in South Korea, were instrumental to bringing the North and South together. They walked under one flag in Pyeongchang at the Opening Ceremony. \u0027Hopefully the day will come when Olympic athletes can compete on a Korean Peninsula that is free of nuclear weapons and where all Koreans can live together and care share their dreams,\u0027 Trump today observed.Kim became the first North Korean leader since the 1950-53 Korean War to set foot in the South this morning during talks in which he and South Korean President Moon Jae-in agreed to a \u0027complete denuclearization\u0027 during the talks.  In tweets on Friday morning Trump acknowledged the progress even as he cast doubt over how long positive diplomacy may last.\u0027After a furious year of missile launches and Nuclear testing, a historic meeting between North and South Korea is now taking place. Good things are happening, but only time will tell!\u0027 Trump wrote this morning.In a second message, he added: \u0027KOREAN WAR TO END! The United States, and all of its GREAT people, should be very proud of what is now taking place in Korea!\u0027 Trump gave his blessing last week to South Korea, an important American ally, to end the Korean War.The U.S. president has said in recent days that he will meet with Kim \u0027very soon\u0027 and probably by the beginning of June.\u0027It could be that I walk out quickly, with respect,\u0027 he said in a Thursday morning update. \u0027But it could be that the meeting doesn\u0027t even take place, who knows.\u0027           The White House released photos of outgoing CIA director Mike Pompeo meeting North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un on Thursday after Trump revealed their existence          The White House released photos yesterday of former CIA director Mike Pompeo —now Trump\u0027s secretary of state — meeting with Kim during a clandestine visit to Pyongyang earlier this month.\u0027He wasn\u0027t supposed to meet with Kim Jong-un, but he did,\u0027 Trump revealed on Fox \u0026amp Friends. \u0027We have incredible pictures of the two talking and meeting, which I\u0027d love to release if we can, I\u0027ll do that,\u0027 the president had said.Eight hours later, the White House published photos of Pompeo and Kim shaking hands, their countenance pleasant without extending into a grin. On Tuesday Trump said that North Korea\u0027s tyrant \u0027has been very open, and I think very honorable\u0027 in the lead-up to nuclear talks.He clarified later, after he came under scrutiny for the remark, that he meant, \u0027I hope that we will be able to deal in a very open and honorable fashion with North Korea. A lot is happening. And I think it\u0027s going to be very positive.\u0027Trump said Tuesday, as he met with France\u0027s Emmanuel Macron, that \u0027a lot of promises have been made by North Korea over the years,\u0027 however he has reason to believe that Kim, a 33-year-old dictator who took over from is father in 2011, is serious about wanting to make a deal.\u0027We have been very, very tough on maximum pressure. We have been very tough on, as you know, trade. We\u0027ve been very, very tough at the border. Sanctions have been the toughest we\u0027ve ever imposed on any country,\u0027 he said. \u0027And we think it will be a great thing for North Korea and it will be a great thing for the world. So we\u0027ll see where that all goes.\u0027Trump reiterated that he would \u0027leave the table\u0027 if the discussions with Kim are not productive — a threat he first made during a summit with Japan\u0027s prime minister in Florida last week. \u0027Maybe it will be wonderful and maybe it won\u0027t. And if it\u0027s not going to be fair and reasonable and good, I will, unlike past administrations, I will leave the table,\u0027 he stated. \u0027But I think we have a chance of doing something very special with respect to North Korea. Good for them, good for us, good for everybody.\u0027           Kim and his South Korean counterpart embraced warmly on Friday after signing a statement in which they declared \u0027there will be no more war on the Korean Peninsula\u0027          Kim Jong-un has become the first North Korean leader to step into the South for 65 years as he met with President Moon Jae-in for a historic peace summit on FridayTrump said in a tweet on Friday morning that Chinese leader Xi Jinping deserved credit for the actions he took that helped to bring North Korea to the negotiating table.\u0027Please do not forget the great help that my good friend, President Xi of China, has given to the United States, particularly at the Border of North Korea. Without him it would have been a much longer, tougher, process!\u0027 he stated.China led global reaction to the historic Korean summit today with a quote from a poem that reads \u0027smiling, we meet again\u0027. North Korea\u0027s sole major ally, Beijing said it hoped for a \u0027journey of long-term stability on the peninsula\u0027.China\u0027s foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said, \u0027We applaud the Korean leaders\u0027 historic step and appreciate their political decisions and courage.\u0027We hope and look forward to them taking this opportunity to further open a new journey of long-term stability on the peninsula.\u0027She also cited a poem that reads: \u0027We remain brothers after all the vicissitudes let\u0027s forgo our old grudges, smiling we meet again.\u0027China is a North Korean ally but it has supported a series of United Nations sanctions to punish Pyongyang over its nuclear and missile tests. Beijing has pressed for dialogue to peacefully resolve the nuclear crisis.  Russia has also supported the sanctions and said Friday that the direct dialogue taking place on the ided peninsula is promising.\u0027This is very positive news,\u0027 President Vladimir Putin\u0027s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. \u0027Today we see that this direct dialogue has taken place (and) it has certain prospects,\u0027 he said.   The dictator, wearing his trademark black Mao suit, and President Moon, in a navy jacket, hold hands as they walk side-by-side across the demarcation line inside the truce village of Panmunjom at the start of Friday\u0027s summit           Kim and Moon strode past an honor guard and military band, before Moon introduced Kim to South Korean government officials          The two sides were writing up a joint statement and the two leaders would announce it together when it was finished, the official, Yoon Young-chan, told a briefingDonald Tusk, President of the European Council said the messages coming from the talks could serve as a \u0027positive memento to all\u0027, and \u0027that the impossible can become possible, and that it depends entirely on the good will and courage of inidual people.\u0027The White House said in a statement as the conversation was commencing that it was \u0027hopeful that talks will achieve progress toward a future of peace and prosperity for the entire Korean Peninsula\u0027 and \u0027looks forward to continuing robust discussions in preparation for the planned meeting between President Donald J. Trump and Kim Jong Un in the coming weeks.\u0027 Just months ago, Trump and Kim were trading threats and insults as the North made rapid advances in pursuit of nuclear-armed missiles capable of hitting the United States. But Kim is now due to meet the U.S. President to discuss denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.The White House at its allies credit the \u0027maximum pressure campaign\u0027 that Trump implemented that included robust international and unilateral economic sanctions.British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson says that he still does not expect a great breakthrough that would curb North Korea\u0027s nuclear ambitions.Johnson told reporters at NATO headquarters Friday, \u0027I am very encouraged by what\u0027s happening.\u0027He said, \u0027I don\u0027t think that anybody looking at the history of North Korea\u0027s plans to develop a nuclear weapon would want to be over-optimistic at this point. But it is clearly good news that the two leaders are meeting.

Five of them returned to Japan in 2002. Pyongyang says the eight others have died, but Japan believes they could be alive. Impoverished North Korea and the rich, democratic South are technically still at war because the Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.The United States stations 28,500 troops in South Korea as a legacy of the Cold War conflict, which pitted the South, the United States and United Nations forces against the communist North, backed by China and Russia.Kim and Trump are expected to meet in late May or June, with Trump saying on Thursday he was considering several possible dates and venues.The latest Korean summit has particular significance not least because of its venue: the Demilitarized Zone, a 160-mile (260-km) long, 2.5-mile (4-km) wide strip of land created in the 1953 armistice to serve as a buffer between the South and North."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/10/4B9AC19900000578-5664157-image-a-26_1524821497118.jpg","title":"Never seen pictures Meghan Markle larking set Suits","story":"    Extraordinary photographs have emerged of Meghan Markle, showing her messing around behind the scenes of US TV hit Suits          Taken by her co-star Patrick J Adams and published on his Instagram, they show the princess-in-waiting as you’ve never seen her before: slumped in a chair, wearing curlers and filing her nails           In other pictures, we see her learning her lines and lying on the ground with her legs in the air while on a break from filming      Get Meghan\u0026#39s on-screen bridal style in an Anne Barge dressClick to explore the brand!As soon as Prince Harry announced his engagement to Meghan Markle our attention here at Fashion Finder naturally turned to what Meghan will wear on the big day!

The prize has now been withdrawn after judges noticed a problem: the anteater pictured is almost certainly a stuffed animal kept outside a visitor centre.The Natural History Museum, which administers the awards, has disqualified the Brazilian wildlife photographer Marcio Cabral for attempting to deceive judges by submitting a picture of a taxidermy specimen in the “animals in their environment” category.After a “thorough investigation” involving two mammal experts and a taxidermy specialist from the museum, in addition to two South American experts, it was concluded that the photograph features the dead anteater that greets visitors at the entrance to Brazil’s Emas National Park.“The five scientists, working independently of each other, all concluded that there are elements of the animal’s posture, morphology, raised tufts of fur and patterns on the neck and head that are too similar for the images to show two different animals,” said a spokesperson for the museum.The investigation followed a tip-off from a third party that the photograph, entitled The Night Raider, broke competition rules, which demand that “entries must not deceive the viewer or attempt to misrepresent the reality of nature”.Cabral, who strongly denies using a stuffed animal in the image, claimed in his original submission that he had spent three years waiting for the right conditions to capture the glowing termite mounds. According to his original caption, the photographer spent days frustrated by rain in Emas National Park before a “giant anteater ambled out of the darkness” and stayed “just long enough” for him to take a single photo.The museum said Cabral co-operated with the investigation and supplied image files taken before and after the winning shot. None of them included the anteater.According to the museum, Cabral also offered a witness who claims he also saw the animal alive, but the investigators were unconvinced.Roz Kidman Cox, a member of the 2017 judging panel, issued a stern warning to others who submit dubious images in an attempt to win awards: “I find it disheartening and surprising that a photographer would go to such lengths to deceive the competition and its worldwide following.”“The competition places great store on honesty and integrity, and such a breach of the rules is disrespectful to the wildlife photography community, which is at the heart of the competition.”The image had been on display at the Natural History Museum since October as part of a paid exhibition. On Friday morning it was removed from the gallery wall and replaced with a notice explaining the alleged falsification.Fellow photographers were baffled by Cabral’s apparent attempt to dupe judges. “If that’s true, he’s just done himself so much more harm than is necessary,” said Brent Stirton, who won the overall Wildlife Photographer of the Year prize in the same awards ceremony. “There are plenty of experts in our field and sooner or later, if you do that kind of thing, it catches up with you.”Stirton said winning such an award can make a “huge difference for people who on their way up”. “For the wildlife world, this is their Oscars. This is a big deal. Guys spend their whole career trying to win one of these ones. It’s one that counts.“I’m just a bit sorry for this guy. I’m not sure if he did fake this, but if he did it’s a sign of desperation. I don’t want to be that guy because that kind of stain will follow you around. Even if you take the greatest wildlife picture ever taken, people are going to doubt it.”Stirton said fake images would usually be detected: “A great deal of us are just photographers and we rely on genuine experts to know how animals behave. Those people spend their whole life looking at those animals. If you think you can slip one past those guys, it’s optimistic at best and arrogant at worst.“Why take that kind of risk? Because surely if you do that and collect an award, in the back of your mind you’re waiting to be uncovered?”This is not the first time the competition has been hit by accusations of fakery. In 2010, the overall winner lost his award following claims that he hired a tame wolf to feature in the winning photo."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66b1e2da2ae6736c0cd7a2f8ef648835a117751c/0_0_5989_4236/master/5989.jpg?w=1010\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac6d256849292bfb157ae184318e83c0 1010w","title":"theresa may faces cross party push company public registers overseas territories amendment tory","story":"Amendment has enough Tory backers to implement measure Cameron and Osborne proposed in 2013A group of Tory and Labour backbenchers are increasingly confident they can force Theresa May to introduce public ownership registers in Britain’s overseas territories in an attempt to prevent them from being used to hide “dirty money”.Nineteen Conservative MPs have signed an amendment scheduled for debate in the Commons on Tuesday – theoretically a sufficient number to defeat the government, which has halted plans to implement a transparency measure originally proposed by David Cameron and George Osborne in 2013.The Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who is one of the two principal backers of the amendment, said: “There is a spectrum of activity that starts with tax avoidance and then quickly goes on to money laundering and organised crime. Britain and its overseas territories have become the jurisdiction of choice for dirty money because of the secrecy of our offshore ownership laws.”More than half of the offshore companies referred to in the Panama Papers were set up in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), according to Transparency International. The jurisdiction allows people to register companies in secret, prompting accusations that it is easy to hide cash and assets without external scrutiny.Conservative supporters of the amendment to the sanctions and anti-money laundering bill are led by Andrew Mitchell and include the former cabinet ministers Nicky Morgan, Dominic Grieve, Stephen Crabb and Ken Clarke. The SNP’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, and the Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, are also backers.Mitchell said he was hopeful the government would recognise the strength of parliamentary opinion on the subject and find a way of “elegantly getting off the hook”.He said: “The argument that the registers are available in private to UK authorities is insufficient. Public registers allow reporting and discussion of these matters by the media and civil society, as was demonstrated by debate that followed the leak of the Panama Papers.”No 10 said on Friday it was studying the amendment carefully, prompting speculation that ministers may attempt to broker a compromise. “We want to analyse its effectiveness. This is an important issue and one we want to get right,” the prime minister’s spokesman said. There are 14 British overseas territories, with a combined population of 350,000. Several have become major offshore financial centres, including Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Gibraltar and the BVI.The overseas territories have introduced private central registers of ownership, which are accessible to UK law enforcement and tax authorities. The amendment calls on them to make those publicly available by December 2020, or have UK ministers impose that requirement upon them via orders in council.Some of the territories have expressed opposition to the imposition of public registers, with one leading offshore centre saying it would cost its public purse $100m (£72m) a year.In March, in a previously unreported submission, the BVI government told British MPs debating the bill that such a move “without consultation or consensus effectively disenfranchises the BVI legislature and its electorate creating resentment and damaging the historically strong relationship between the BVI and the UK”.It said the territory was still recovering from the impact of Hurricane Irma and could not afford to deal with the effects from lost revenue. The BVI called on the UK government “to foot the bill or see a crisis in the BVI’s public services. Over the next 10 years this could result in an additional funding gap of $1bn.”Proponents of the amendment have lobbied government ministers. In an attempt to allay Foreign Office concerns about introducing the disclosure measure so soon after the hurricane, the backbenchers agreed to leave the timing for implementation until 2020.The sanctions and anti-money laundering bill is nearing the end of the parliamentary approval process, with its report and third reading in the Commons scheduled for Tuesday, having passed through the Lords."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f66a12845628109a56b2e39d44c91c9837c4b622/0_1_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a0dba8c96f539c990f2f170b3e0a603","title":"david davis brexit tory government talentless","story":"It’s long been traditional to describe a lazy performance by an actor as phoned in. In the case of DExEu’s David Davis, however, he doesn’t even text it in. The secretary of state’s performance in front of the Brexit select committee this week basically amounted to a series of emoticons. He\u0026nbspcan’t do you an explanation of how in the name of magical thinking the government can square its promises on the Irish border with promises on leaving the customs union – but he can do you the shrug. ¯\\_(ツ)_¯ Did you miss it? Don’t worry. Just ask him another question and he’ll do it again.At such a late stage of the game, it is unclear quite how many civil service lectures on the problem Davis has failed to pay attention to. But on this evidence, he urgently needs to be bored harder over the hard border. Or perhaps the looming crisis point is what he wants. Perhaps Britain has had enough of exports.Since before the referendum was even a twinkle in\u0026nbspDavid Cameron’s eye, leavers have been immeasurably helped by the fact that many of us – most\u0026nbspof us? – don’t understand the simplicities of Brexit, let alone its complexities. I recently watched an ITV news dispatch from Norway’s border with Sweden during which I discovered that either Davis did not know what the word “frictionless” meant, or was hoping no one else did. On this basis, Joan Crawford and Bette\u0026nbspDavis had a frictionless relationship.I can only recall one hard lesson from Theresa May in the past year, when she said to the nation: “If we don’t get the negotiation right, your economic security and prosperity will be put at risk and the opportunities you seek for your families will simply not happen. If we do not stand up and get this negotiation right, we risk the secure and well-paid jobs we want for our children and our children’s children too.” And yet, in context, even this is not the moment of brutal candour it appears. May made these comments outside Downing Street in the course of a ludicrously aggressive diatribe against the EU, immediately after returning from Buckingham Palace to call her Darwin award-winning election.Last August, it emerged that some on the EU side of negotiations thought it impossible that the UK side should be as under-prepared and aimless as they seemed, and that it must all be a clever ploy. Pretty sure no one’s floating that theory any more. What’s somehow more unsettling, though, is the look on the faces of Brexiteers outside the inner circle as they realise we really are winging this. This week even such allies appeared concerned by Davis’s shallows.Elsewhere in the government of all the talentless, Amber Rudd’s eye-catching decision to make her terrible week worse is drawing conspiracy theories of its own. On Thursday, the home secretary popped to the Commons to apologise for misleading them over Windrush again, then told journalists she “was not going to be drawn” as to whether Britain would stay in the customs union, despite May saying it wouldn’t. It’s a mark of the government’s baroque dysfunction that the embattled Rudd’s gaffe was regarded by some as a cunning ruse. “I think a lot of people in government are willing us on,” judged one Tory customs union rebel.Underpinning all this is the government’s own structural problem – namely, the impossibility of even the sympathetic half of the audience being able to suspend their disbelief. These people might back them,\u0026nbspbut do they really believe them? We all know what they did two summers ago.The cabinet is now cobbled together from two sides of the referendum ide, each of whom accused the other of the most despicable lies during the campaign. Ever since, preposterously, they have expected the public to accept they are telling the truth when they act together. How is this supposed to work?It is difficult to overstate the absurdity of the home secretary presenting any sort of united front with the foreign secretary, for instance, given that she explained to a TV audience of millions: “Boris? Well, he’s the life and soul of the party but he’s not the man you want driving you home at the end of the evening.” This is a date-rape joke with a drink-drive cover story – a memorable attempt by Amber to cast herself as the Iceman to Boris’s Maverick. I’m not precisely sure where that metaphor leaves us after the past fortnight, but it’s fair to say that if world war three does threaten to break out, you don’t want Amber within two continents of a fighter jet cockpit. It feels more as if we’ve reached the point in a movie where Theresa May is using Rudd’s political corpse as a bullet shield.Or have we? In the sort of masterstroke of comic timing many have come to expect from this outfit, we learned on Thursday of the “war chests” that have been built up this year by cabinet ministers thought to be eyeing leadership bids. As the Sun revealed, those big beasts are: Gavin Williamson (who no longer sells fireplaces), Michael Gove and Amber Rudd. But of course. Reflecting on her abject and shameful Windrush failures this week, Rudd said: “I look back with hindsight and I’m surprised I did not see the shape of it sooner.”The same might be said of the government’s quarter-arsed handling of negotiations with the EU. What will eventually unite many leave and remain voters, one suspects, is the enraged conviction that the politicians should have known what they were doing with Brexit, and rather sooner than this."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58bc279af1e9ac86b7e8c2f2ee37b5eabf9d9a41/0_0_3500_2327/master/3500.jpg?w=1010\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9f83f71abc83ac6ed46efe1ce06210f0 2020w","title":"peter rabbit hereditary trailer years scariest film australia perth","story":"‘Parents were yelling at the projectionist to stop,’ says audience member as teaser for horror film Hereditary is mistakenly aired before Peter Rabbit screeningFamilies were forced to flee an Australian cinema when a trailer for a horror film dubbed “the year’s scariest film” was accidentally shown before a school holidays showing of Peter Rabbit.WAtoday reports that the incident occurred an Anzac Day holiday screening of the Beatrix Potter adaptation at Event Cinemas in Innaloo, Perth. As audience members settled down for the film, a trailer for Hereditary began to play. The film, which stars Toni Colette, has received an MA15+ rating in Australia for “themes of strong horror”. Its trailer features a number of unsettling scenes, including one in which a child appears to cut the head off a dead pigeon with a pair of scissors.“It was dreadful. Very quickly you could tell this was not a kid’s film,” an audience member told the newspaper. “Parents were yelling at the projectionist to stop, covering their kids’ eyes and ears. Some parents fled the cinema with their kids in tow.”The cinema eventually switched off the screen, and later offered audience members complimentary tickets as a gesture of goodwill. A spokesperson for Event Cinema’s parent company, Event Hospitality and Entertainment, said that the issue was being “investigated internally to ensure situations like this do not occur again”.This is far from the first time a screening for a family-friendly film has been preceded by an unsuitable trailer. In 2012, a cinema in south London accidentally screened trailers for horror film The Devil Inside and Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance, which stars a flaming skeleton on a motorbike, ahead of a showing of Puss in Boots, while in 2013 a teaser for Lars von Trier’s sexually explicit arthouse drama Nymphomaniac appeared in advance of a screening of Frozen in Florida. Three years later, the trailer for profane animated comedy Sausage Party was shown before a California cinema’s screening of Pixar’s Finding Dory."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2de9c90653476aa200e3d768c7b156aa94d3e053/0_63_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c00616fdd249c058c2d0c32a5fc8aa45","title":"fulham sunderland championship match report","story":"For Fulham, overcoming a team condemned to playing in League One next season was supposed to be the easy part. Nothing felt straightforward on a night of tension, however, and if Neil Warnock was watching this game on television, he will no doubt have taken note of some generous refereeing decisions. It was only when the marginally offside Aleksandar Mitrovic scored the decisive goal with 17 minutes left that Fulham could be sure of hauling themselves back into the Championship’s top two with one match left.For all the late drama, however, the real challenge for Slavisa Jokanovic’s players will be finding a way to enjoy their Saturday. It seems preposterous that a team on a 23-match unbeaten run could yet be forced to endure the torture of the play-offs. But there is no escape from the unforgiving nature of this race to win automatic promotion, with Fulham all too aware that they will be a point below Cardiff City if Warnock’s team win at 18th-placed Hull City this afternoon.With the margins at the top so slender, Fulham’s job was to maintain their focus against opponents who had had only a week to digest the ignominy of suffering successive relegations. For much of the first half, however, they played with the weight of expectations on their shoulders and their inhibition allowed Sunderland to settle, string a few passes together and prey on the home side’s nerves.Roared on by a handful of good-humoured visiting supporters, Sunderland were playing for nothing more than fleeting pride. Yet Chris Coleman’s team were determined not to roll over and they had already given Fulham fair warning before taking a shock lead in the 28th minute. Ashley Fletcher had whistled a volley narrowly over and the striker’s selfless work in his lone role paid off when he helped to create the opening goal with a flick to Joel Asoro, who celebrated turning 19 by spinning away from Matt Targett and angling an accurate low shot past Marcus Bettinelli from 20 yards.The home fans fell silent, as though they could not quite believe what was happening, not that Fulham could complain about Sunderland tearing up the script. Loose touches, sloppy passing and misunderstandings had blighted their performance, Tom Cairney was struggling to find his passing range in midfield and Aleksandar Mitrovic was feeding off scraps up front.Fulham’s choked display was provoking alarmed cries in the stands and there was further cause for concern when Targett limped off. But luck was on their side. Sunderland had continued to press and they should have been awarded a penalty on the stroke of half-time when Tim Ream caught Ovie Ajaria. Peter Bankes waved their appeals away, however, and Fulham equalised with their next attack.Champions: Manchester CityChampions League:\u0026nbspManchester United,\u0026nbspLiverpool and Tottenham are favourites for the top four with Chelsea five points behind Spurs in fifth. Europa League: Arsenal\u0026nbspare guaranteed a top-seven finish\u0026nbspbut could still reach the Champions League by winning the Europa League. Burnley are one win away from their first European campaign since 1967.Relegation: West Brom\u0026nbspare still eight points from safety after their draw with Liverpool. Stoke\u0026nbspand Southampton\u0026nbspboth still have games against\u0026nbspSwansea, five points clear of the bottom three. One more win should be enough for\u0026nbspCrystal Palace, West Ham, Huddersfield\u0026nbspand Brighton to avoid relegation.Champions: WolvesAutomatic promotion: Fulham moved up to second after coming from behind to beat Sunderland, but Cardiff\u0026nbspwill be back in the Premier League if they beat both Hull and Reading in their last two games.Play-offs:\u0026nbspAston Villa\u0026nbspare heading for the play-offs with\u0026nbspMiddlesbrough and Derby\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspleading the race to join them. Below them,\u0026nbspMillwall, Brentford,\u0026nbspPreston,\u0026nbspBristol City and\u0026nbspSheffield United\u0026nbspare\u0026nbspall still in with a chance.Relegation: Sunderland are down after their defeat to\u0026nbspBurton, who could leapfrog\u0026nbspBolton\u0026nbspwith victory on Saturday.\u0026nbspBarnsley\u0026nbspare sandwiched between those two and host Brentford this weekend. will look to take advantage whatever the result there as they host Brentford.Automatic promotion: Wigan and Blackburn (pictured)\u0026nbsphave sealed automatic promotion and will now battle for the title.Play-offs: Shrewsbury and\u0026nbspRotherham, plus two from Charlton,\u0026nbspScunthorpe, Plymouth,\u0026nbspPortsmouth and Bradford City.Relegation: Bury are down while\u0026nbspMK Dons have only a mathematical chance of survival.\u0026nbspNorthampton\u0026nbspand Oldham\u0026nbspare in the bottom two with Walsall,\u0026nbspRochdale\u0026nbspand Wimbledon\u0026nbspstill in trouble.Automatic promotion: Accrington Stanley and Luton Town are going up, with Stanley needing one more point to secure the title.\u0026nbspWycombe\u0026nbspare third with\u0026nbspExeter City,\u0026nbspNotts County and\u0026nbspLincoln fighting to overtake them.\u0026nbspPlay-offs: The three who miss out will be joined by either\u0026nbspCoventry\u0026nbspor\u0026nbspMansfield the Sky Blues have a three-point cushion.Relegation: Chesterfield\u0027s 97-year Football League stay is over. Barnet\u0026nbspare five points behind\u0026nbspGrimsby\u0026nbspand Morecambe and play the latter on Saturday.National League: Macclesfield Town\u0026nbsphave secured the only automatic promotion spot, with one other team set to come up via the six-team play-offs. Tranmere, Sutton and Aldershot have all sealed their places.Aboubakar Kamara, who had replaced Targett, released Ryan Fredericks and, although Jason Steele erted the right-back’s cutback away from Mitrovic, the Sunderland goalkeeper’s intervention only presented Lucas Piazon with an open goal.Piazon’s simple finish lifted the mood and Fulham strove to assert themselves at the start of the second half, even though Sunderland were still defending with dogged determination. Kamara, impressing on the right, was a thorn in Marc Wilson’s side and the substitute almost found a way through with a powerful shot, only for Steele to react sharply at his near post.But it was clear that Coleman, a former Fulham captain and manager, wanted to leave a good impression at the place he once called home. Mitrovic went close from the edge of the area and Steele was booked for taking too long over a goal-kick shortly after the hour, but Sunderland were restricting Fulham to few clear chances.The frustration was building. It felt as if Fulham’s hopes were slipping away. But when Stefan Johansen lifted a free-kick to the far post and the flag stayed down, Mitrovic was free to guide his header past Steele."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b89af54c3602ff88689ae03514ce3d9cba93263/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af482cb06594ef2abcc1fa2388a5d13a","title":"the premier league teams ineptitude index 2017 18","story":"It’s once again time to appreciate the most incompetent teams in the Premier League, from those who throw the ball straight to opposition to goalkeepers who can’t keep goalWelcome to the ’s fourth annual index of ineptitude, its directory of disappointment and catalogue of clumsiness.Towards the end of the season, it is traditional to pick out the best the league has had to offer. But the reason those screamers, outrageous assists, and crunching tackles stand out is because, well, how to put this … the rest of the Premier League matchday experience can be rubbish.The statisticians at Opta have provided exhaustive lists of numbers and we have abused them. So while the stats are right, there is no guarantee our interpretation passes muster – but it’s not called the ineptitude index for nothing. For each act of Premier League incompetence, we have awarded a number of penalty points (reasonably arbitrarily, if we are honest – best look elsewhere for the serious analysis) which we have tallied into a rolling league table. Who will join 2014-15 champions QPR, 2015-16 title winners Aston Villa and last season’s supremos Hull City as the year’s most incompetent side? There are multiple reasons football is complex but chiefly it is because you play it with your feet, which are not the most dextrous part of the body. It stands to reason then, that the bits you play with your hands are simpler – which brings us to throw-ins. Clearly, some are long, high-risk lobs into the box, or low-percentage balls designed to aid a quick attack. But the majority should be a simple chuck to a team-mate. Somehow Watford have managed to get that wrong 256 times this season, or over seven times a game. Stoke City are nearly as bad – they have conceded possession from a throw-in 214 times – with Leicester (199 times), Brighton (197) and West Ham (193) the next worst offenders. Arsenal are the best, losing possession just 57 times and, given what is coming up later on in this exercise, that is something for their fans to cling on to.We have penalised Watford 10 points, Stoke eight, Leicester six, Brighton four and West Ham two for their incompetence.Rightly or wrongly, it has been a law of the game since 1 July 2004 that it is an offence for a player to remove their shirt during a game – so it is a high level of ineptitude to earn yourself a booking for something so entirely unnecessary. Hats off to Stoke City, and particularly Ramadan Sobhi who picked up bookings in consecutive matches for taking his shirt off and then over celebrating, whose players have earned three bookings this season for whipping off their tops. West Ham have managed the feat twice, so we will punish Stoke 10 points for crass stupidity, West Ham five, and let any team who have done it once off the hook because, idiotic though it is to transgress, it is a silly law. There is often five, possibly six minutes, of added time? Frequently it’s less than that. And yet 11 Premier League teams have conceded goals on or past the 90-minute mark to lose a game. Watford have done it four times! Had all 11 players simply lined up across the goal for added time, they could be battling for Europe. Burnley and Swansea were the next worst, doing it twice, with eight clubs doing it once. We will hand out five penalty points for each time a team have blown it in added time.Nine teams have been two goals up at some stage in the match, only to lose or draw. Take a bow Liverpool, Southampton and West Bromwich Albion, who have all managed it twice. Those three get a 10-point penalty, everyone else (Burnley, Crystal Palace, Manchester City, Newcastle, Watford and West Ham – who each did it once) get five.Mistakes happen at the back – it’s a high-pressure environment – but a goalkeeper’s job-title makes it pretty clear what he should be doing, so we are going to punish goalkeeper errors that lead to an opposition goal. We’ll allow some leeway – any club whose keeper(s) made no more than two errors get a free pass – but sides whose keeper(s) made more than that get a draconian five penalty points for each mistake that led to a goal. It would perhaps seem likely Joe Hart would clean up here, however it is Arsenal’s Petr Cech who tops the list with six howlers (30 penalty points). Asmir Begovic and Hugo Lloris are joint second on five (25 points) and Hart earns West Ham 20 points for four catastrophic errors. A combination of Heurelho Gomes and Orestis Karnezis earn Watford 15 points and Jonas Lössl gets Huddersfield on the board with another 15.There are few greater hallmarks of ineptitude than actually scoring for the opposition – and so we will award five points for each own goal scored, but give a free pass to those that only did it once because, well, accidents happen. Brighton are the worst offenders (five) with Newcastle (three) in second. Only Southampton, Everton, Liverpool, West Ham and Arsenal have not conceded any. Incidentally, the worst solo performer? Brighton’s Lewis Dunk, who has singlehandedly scored four.By the same measure, conceding a penalty is textbook incompetence. It’s not as bad as scoring for the opposition, however, so we will award three points to any team who has done it more than once. West Ham, Watford, Huddersfield and Liverpool have conceded six penalties, so are given 18 points each, but West Brom and Manchester United have only done it once so get away scot-free.Granit Xhaka and Shkodran Mustafi have combined beautifully for Arsenal to be joint top of the outfield errors that lead to goals chart. Alongside Southampton (top work Wesley Hoedt and Cédric Soares!), they have committed nine howlers that have led to the opposition scoring. We’ll award two points per mistake, per team (more lenient than the same offence for goalkeepers because it’s almost the goalkeeper’s sole job not to do it, whereas outfield players have other responsibilities). Incidentally, Burnley, Leicester and West Brom are the most mistake-free, which gives an idea of their organisation but perhaps also their ambition.So far, we have largely dealt with defensive incompetence, so it’s worth throwing it up the other end. The very simplest marker for crass inability is failing to put the ball into a 17.8 square metre target from 12 yards, with only one person to beat. Five points are awarded per penalty miss to each team. Everton are the worst offenders (Wayne Rooney has missed three) with Brighton (Glenn Murray, twice), Manchester City (Jesus, twice) and various others on two or one.At its heart, there is only one key aim in football: to put the ball in the net. A failure to do so ranks as top bodging. We will issue a one-point fine for each time a team failed to score in a match. So it’s bad news for Huddersfield (18 times), Brighton and Swansea (15), and Crystal Palace (14), but good news for Manchester City (once), Tottenham (three times) and Liverpool (five).A catch-all category for simulation, dissent and red cards. There is a two-point penalty for simulation, and Bournemouth and Manchester United top that list with three yellow cards for the offence (the single worst offenders, however, are Tottenham’s Dele Alli and Swansea’s Martin Olsson, who have both been booked for ing twice).We will award one penalty point for each yellow card given to a club’s player for dissent, with Manchester City leading on 12 (Arsenal and Southampton are not far behind on 11). Incidentally, Brighton, Everton and Huddersfield are the most polite teams, only picking up four bookings each for dissent.Getting yourself sent off hands the opposition a distinct advantage, so ranks high in the ineptitude stakes – it also gives us a chance to stick it to two clubs who might have thought they were bobbing along pretty competently thus far. There is a strict five-point penalty per red card which is bad news for Chelsea, Leicester and Watford (four each, so a 20-point fine), but good news for Palace and Burnley, who have had none.And finally, a category to mop up some indefinables not covered by Opta stats. Any club to have hired and fired a manager in the same season get a 10-point fine (Alan Pardew at West Brom) but only a five-point fine for hiring someone in pre-season then giving him the chop before the season is out (Watford, Southampton and Crystal Palace).Opta does not carry stats on foul throws, however we are going to give Tottenham a five-point penalty for Serge Aurier’s spectacular hat-trick at Crystal Palace in February.Pep Guardiola escapes an incompetence penalty, because though he was fined for a breach of clothing rules (yellow ribbon-gate), it did not lead to a touchline ban so cannot be said to have harmed his side. Yet, West Ham do get a clothing-related five-point penalty for spelling Marco Arnautovic’s name wrong on his shirt against Bournemouth on Boxing Day.So three cheers to Watford! Championes, championes etc. A spectacular effort. They set out their stall for ineptitude early and saw it home across the season. What’s curious is they are well clear of the relegation battle since, in the past three seasons, the team who topped the ineptitude index went down to the Championship. It takes an impressive kind of incompetence to be that bad and still not go down. Well played.That Stoke are up there is perhaps no real surprise given their season, but oh, Arsenal! Poor Arsène Wenger, that’s no way to see out his career at the Emirates, is it?One thing the ineptitude index has tended to get relatively correct, is the team at the bottom of the table – in this case, Manchester United – have tended to play some efficient, purposeful football without ever setting the pulses racing. That Burnley are up there ties into that, though Liverpool and Manchester City’s presence suggests it is possible to combine efficiency with flair.But is the real story West Brom? How come a team who, by this measure, appear to have had a decent season are about to go down? For that new level of ineptitude, let’s just give thanks to Tony Pulis and Alan Pardew. Top work, chaps.

The walls were slimy and cold, and the water smelled like a toilet. I thought I was going to dieEarlier this month, I was having a family picnic on Easter Sunday in Griffith Park, Los Angeles, with my auntie and cousins. While the little kids did an Easter egg hunt (I’m 13), me and my three cousins went off to play soccer. After kicking the ball around for a bit, we found an abandoned building on the edge of the park, so we climbed over the fence and started playing tag. I wasn’t looking where I was going when I felt a piece of wood underneath me break, and I fell 25ft into a pipe.I landed into water and it was running pretty fast. It felt like being on a waterslide, but the water smelled nasty, like a toilet. It was dark, so I grabbed my phone from my pocket to use as a flashlight, but the water knocked it out of my hand and I lost it. In those first few moments I panicked – I thought I was going to die.After a few minutes of sliding, I found I could put my hands against the wall of the pipe and stand up. The walls were slimy and cold, the water was up to my knees and the pipe was about 4ft wide. I shouted for help but I could just hear my own voice echoing back to me and the sound of rushing water. I started crying a little because I was so scared. I was in the dark, alone, thinking, “Where am I?” and, “Will I ever get to see my family again?” I kept seeing the face of my little sister, who is 18 months old, and my Mom, who’s pregnant. I wondered if I’d ever get to meet my baby brother.I thought about trying to carry on walking through the pipe to find a way out, but it looked scary so I decided it was better to stay put and hope that someone would find me. I was praying to God, “Please, please get me out of here safe.” We pray a lot at home, but that day I was really praying.Not too long after that, I heard helicopters and I knew people were looking for me. I started relaxing and thinking I was OK, I was going to be rescued. But when nobody came after what felt like hours, I went back to thinking I was going to die. I wasn’t really hungry or thirsty or tired, I just knew I had to wait. Over 12 hours after I’d first fallen in – around 5am – I saw a light above me and I heard someone shout, “Here’s the kid!” I started calling for help, and a rope got lowered down with a platform at the bottom of it, so I just held on and they pulled me out through a manhole. I felt disoriented when I came to the surface. I was by a freeway with all these flashing lights. They gave me a phone and I called my mom. I said, “Mom, I’m good. Where you at? You need to come pick me up.” She was crying and saying, “Oh my God, where are you?” over and over again.The firefighters took my T-shirt off, hosed me down and wrapped me in a plastic sheet. Someone gave me a Gatorade, but I only drank a little bit because I don’t really like it and I didn’t feel thirsty. At the hospital I took a hot shower and they gave me a change of clothes and put me on an IV drip. After a couple of hours the doctor told me I was fine – I just had grazes on my knees and knuckles from the fall – and my mom and stepdad took me home. All my family were waiting for me, and I hugged them and went to sleep for a few hours. When I woke up, there were news reporters outside waiting to interview me, which was weird.I found out that when I fell into the pipe my cousins ran back to my family and the adults phoned 911, but it took a long time to find me because I’d travelled about a mile from where I fell. They’d sent cameras down to look for me. They only found me because a camera picked up my handprints in a pipe. Over 100 people were involved in the search, so I felt bad I’d caused all that drama, but happy that they hadn’t given up on me. I heard there were toxic gases down there, so I was lucky.Three days later, I went back to school – I just wanted to get back to normal. Everyone in my class was asking if I was OK.Sometimes in my mind I go back to the moment when I fell and think about what would have happened if they had never found me. Thank God I got another chance.• As told to Kate Wills.Do you have an experience to share?

Or the wasted time anxiously wondering if the invitation to play Trivia Crack from an ex is actually a message.Hours are lost poring over the ins and outs of lives you barely recall meeting. That’s the thing about having an account for over a decade, as I have: people who’d usually be relegated to the crevices of memory are kept in full view, as you are to them. Supposedly, that’s keeping in touch, but in reality it’s keeping score.And then, of course, there’s the family. You can’t deny your mum’s friend request, or her right to share your holiday photos to her profile, while mistagging all your relatives – so instead of flagging your pic to Uncle Abbas, she’s let everyone in the ABBA fan page know you ate a pizza in Italy.(Side story: a few years ago, a friend told her mum that “FML” – internet slang for “F*** my life”, a sign of exasperation – stood for “From Mum with Love”. That really livened up her Facebook statuses. “Nan came over for dinner, FML.”)Ergh… that little red notification box, the little red box of horror. It has controlled me for too long, especially with its most vicious feature: event invitations. “You have been invited,” reads Facebook, in its distinctly chipper Californian voice, “to the engagement party of your ex. Good job!” Or it’s an acquaintance’s uninspiring birthday bash involving a long journey, when the sofa is calling. My finger hovers over the “not attending” button when, lo and behold, I see it, the invite list, full of familiar faces.“Perhaps this will be the party to end all parties,” I\u0026nbspthink. “I can’t miss out… Maybe this party will fortify the friendship of my friends between each other, and I will be left in the cold. I can’t miss out.”But no more. If being an adult is about not giving a damn about what people think, then sign me up. No more attending events on the off-chance they might be OK. No more fretting about missing things. No more RSVPing “maybe” when you really mean no, lest you stop getting invited to things you don’t actually want to go to.It’s time to end the cycle.

Adjoining it was a bakery where, every afternoon, chef Angus would make puff pastry for the following day’s croissants, some filled with gruyere cheese, others homemade almond paste or Valhrona chocolate. Sadly, I have neither Angus’s giant roller nor his patience, but there are enough really good ready-made all-butter pastries in shops that it need not stop you making a deliciously flaky, homemade tart.For a really fast tart, omit the cream, eggs and blind-baking – just strew it with the onions, cheese, thyme and some olive oil. You will need a 28cm springform tart tin.About 320g all-butter puff pastry, in a sheet or block – enough to to cover a 28cm tart caseFlour, for dusting30g butter, plus more for greasing5 medium red onions, or a mix of red and white (about 600g)2 tbsp olive oil3 eggs, whisked1 tbsp good-quality balsamic vinegar½ tsp caster sugar1 small bunch fresh thyme leaves, roughly chopped200g mild blue cheese, such as Oxford Blue or Stichelton160g double cream160g creme fraicheSalt and black pepperHeat the oven to 200C390Fgas 6.Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface until it is wide enough to cover the tart tin comfortably, with at least a 1cm overhang (or use a ready-rolled sheet). Grease the tart tin and then line with the pastry, pricking it all over with a fork. Chill in the fridge for at least 15 minutes.Meanwhile, prepare the onions. Do not cut off the root: just peel them like an orange and cut away any straggling strands from the base. Cut each onion into five to six even wedges. Heat the oil and butter in a wide, deep frying pan on a medium-high heat and, when hot, add the onionwedge wedges, season well, and saute for 12-15 minutes.Now remove the pastry from the fridge, line with greaseproof paper and fill to the brim with baking beans. Bake the tart shell for 20 minutes, then remove the beans and paper and lightly brush the pastry shell all over with a little beaten egg. Put the tin back in the oven and bake for eight to 10 minutes, until golden.The onions should now be caramelised beautifully. Drizzle with balsamic, sugar, half the thyme and two tablespoons of water, and cook for a further eight to 10 minutes, until the onions are soft and dark. Taste and adjust the seasoning, if necessary.Beat the creams together, add the remaining eggs, whisk with the rest of the thyme and season well with salt and pepper. Arrange the onion wedges on the base of the tart shell, crumble over nuggets of the blue cheese, pour over the cream mix and bake for 25-30 minutes.When cooked, remove from the oven and leave to cool for five to 10 minutes. Serve still warm with a crisp chicory and toasted walnut salad, or a simple green salad.This tart is very good eaten at room temperature and lasts several days. Whizz any leftover blue cheese with sherry vinegar and extra-virgin olive oil – a wonderful dressing for the last of the year’s bitter leaves.

In among the glowing testimonies to his talent and humility from colleagues, old schoolfriends and – an unexpected move, this – a man who doesn’t seem to know who Post Malone is, there is much talk of his resilience to criticism, his bird-flipping attitude to those who “talk shit” about him.You can see why a thick skin might be an essential character trait for Austin Richard Post. The reviews of his debut, 2016’s Stoney, weren’t so much vicious as dismissive: it was held to be the work of a one-hit wonder who never should have been allowed to make an album in the first place. It went on to sell 2m copies in the US alone, and spawn a succession of hit singles. He has weathered accusations of cultural appropriation and the opprobrium of other rappers, who possibly remember the last time a long-haired white guy with a liking for both rap and down-home American rock got big – Kid Rock – and how well that turned out for everybody. The press, meanwhile, can’t seem to work out whether they think that, with his belief in chemtrails, obsession with firearms and I’ve-suffered-racism-too response to Black Lives Matter, he’s just an idiot – a conclusion you might jump to, based on the haircut he sported last year, a mid-forehead fringe that left him looking like Jim Carrey in Dumb and Dumber – or something more cynical and calculating. Suspicious eyebrows were raised regarding the veracity of the recent viral story about him giving a postal worker a copy of his forthcoming album in lieu of a tip. His 2017 hit Rockstar was helped to the US No 1 spot by a YouTube video that featured not the song, but just its chorus repeated five times, which, depending on your perspective, is either cheating your way into the charts, a brilliant marketing ploy aimed at the Musical.ly generation who consume not songs but sections of songs, or the kind of incisive editing by which a lot of chart singles could be vastly improved.Throughout it all, Post Malone has got bigger and bigger: he’s as impregnable as barbed wire, which, in another curious fashion decision, he has tattooed across his forehead. Which brings us to his second album, pretty much a guaranteed smash. If you cleave to the just-an-idiot theory regarding Post Malone you might note that, well, it’s called Beerbongs \u0026amp Bentleys, that its lyrical rendering of the current vogue for moaning about the emptiness and misery of wealth and success tends to the thumpingly prosaic – it contains a song called Rich and Sad – and that he writes about sex in such a dummkopf way, it makes you feel like taking up a lifelong vow of chastity: “I ain’t even seen the face but she got beautiful boobies – wow!”If you think he’s more calculating, you could point to its bet-spreading sound, which melds a host of current big pop memes, from warm, post-tropical house synthesisers to icily Auto-Tuned R\u0026ampB, from earnest acoustic balladry to mumble-rap. “Barf on me,” he pleads repeatedly at one point, which feels a bit alarming until you realise he’s actually saying “ball for me”. There are references to classic rock – Same Bitches swipes a lyric from the Zombies’ Time of the Season, Over Now concludes with a thrilling, distorted explosion of John Bonham-esque drumming – and a great deal of that weird latter-day lyrical trope whereby you spend half your time boasting about how many drugs you take and how much you drink in party-hearty style, and the other half trying to elicit sympathy from the listener because of how many drugs you take and how much you drink.It would be churlish indeed to deny that a lot of the songs on Beerbongs \u0026amp Bentleys are exceptionally well-turned, stuffed with hooks and powerful choruses: Rockstar’s global success had less to do with shenanigans involving YouTube than the fact that it’s a maddeningly catchy song, and there’s plenty more where that came from. Furthermore, while no great shakes as a rapper, Post Malone’s singing voice is impressive and the production is regularly tricked out with beautiful touches: the lovely Mellotron intro to Rich and Sad the eerie, feedback-and-echo-heavy guitar that runs through Takin’ Shots. However, over a protracted period of time – and Beerbongs \u0026amp Bentleys goes on and on like a charity telethon – there’s a paucity of original ideas, the sense that he has virtually nothing to say for himself, and that whatever he has, has already been said umpteen times before with considerably more skill, wit and impact. Meanwhile, the guest appearances are a mixed blessing. An impressive array of supporting talent has been assembled, seemingly with the express intention of showing Post Malone up: the gulf between what he does and the sparky power of Nicki Minaj’s guest verse on Ball for Me – “could have been a seamstress, still wouldn’t cut him slack” – feels immense.Of course, Beerbongs \u0026amp Bentleys’ defects might be less evident in smaller doses, if you consider it less as an album than a collection of songs made for picking and choosing, for filleting on to playlists, then the aforementioned hooks, choruses and production touches might well outweigh the repetitiousness and predictability. Listening to it, you understand both the charges against him and the reasons for Post Malone’s success, and you wonder how long his apparent impenetrability will last. Whether he can move with the times when the trends collated here change remains to be seen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ad6647499c75e99ca19c3f957abce69f495a3db/0_0_3500_2334/master/3500.jpg?w=740\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43cfa8f883677b1b72ce8518ee0629a3 740w","title":"more than 120 homeopaths trying to cure autism in uk","story":"Exclusive: the ‘cure’ involves detoxing children of vaccines and antibiotics held responsible for the conditionMore than 120 homeopaths in the UK are offering a “cure” for autism that involves supposedly detoxing children of the vaccines and antibiotics held responsible for the condition, the  has learned.The homeopaths are accredited practitioners of CEASE “therapy”, which stands for Complete Elimination of Autistic Spectrum Expression. CEASE was invented by a Dutch doctor called Tinus Smits, who died of cancer in 2010. His book and website, which lists therapists around the world, describe a method of ridding children of toxins – predominantly vaccines and medication – that are said to cause autism. It involves homeopathic remedies and high doses of vitamin C in excess of those recommended by national guidelines.Diarrhoea, which could be a result of excessive vitamin C, and fever in children should not necessarily be cause for concern, say CEASE therapists, because it is the child’s body purging itself of toxins.“It’s absolutely appalling,” said Carol Povey, director of the centre for autism at the National Autistic Society (NAS), which helps develop best practice. “As healthcare practitioners, homeopaths should still be working on evidence-based practice and looking at national guidelines.”The NAS is concerned by the suggestion that autism, a developmental disorder, could be cured. It is also disturbed by the claim that autism is linked to vaccines, as proposed by Andrew Wakefield – a theory that has been comprehensively discredited. Wakefield, a former gastroenterologist, was struck off the medical register over his claims.Homeopathic cures, like other bogus therapies on the internet, “hoodwink new parents when they are vulnerable” and can cause harm, said Povey.A minority of CEASE therapists in the UK are members of the Society of Homeopaths. Its regulatory body, the Professional Standards Authority (PSA), has said the Society of Homeopaths must state by the middle of next month what action it will take to ensure children are safe as a condition of its re-accreditation.The PSA told the Society of Homeopaths that “CEASE therapy contravenes medical advice by apparently advising against vaccination of children, avoiding antibiotics in the case of infection and advocates high doses of vitamins not recommended for children. We are also concerned that the full name of CEASE (Complete Elimination of Autistic Spectrum Expression) strongly implies the ability to cure autism through this therapy,” it said in a statement.While the society had responded that its members “should not be practising the aspects of CEASE that defy medical advice”, this was not clear on its website, said the PSA.Mark Taylor, chief executive of the Society of Homeopaths, said it was looking into how many of its members practised CEASE therapy and whether they complied with advice on respecting medical evidence. “We are looking at the advice we will offer over the next few weeks so there is nothing more to say at the moment,” he told the .Many other homeopaths who are also CEASE therapists are not members of the society. The PSA urges the public to choose only those on its accredited register.Jennifer Hautman, a homeopath who is not a Society of Homeopaths member, says she has used CEASE therapy if parents have requested it. Smits’s book, she says, is written for lay people, who then look for a therapist. “I would never promise to cure anything. I do think autism can be treated. It can be improved,” she said. Children often had gut disorders, she said, adding: “I’m not a gut specialist. That’s what Andrew Wakefield was working on. She claimed: “There are a lot of scientists finding similar results to his.”While the causes of autistic spectrum disorder are unclear, she says on her website that “ASD is often linked to vaccine damage” and asks parents to fill in a questionnaire “if you feel you or your children have been damaged by vaccines”.Asked about the CEASE theory that fever and diarrhoea help expel toxins, she said: “Generally speaking in homeopathy, discharge can be a good thing. If you have infected wounds, you want the pus to come out. If you have diarrhoea you want it to come out rather than be constipated.” A child must not be allowed to become dehydrated, however.Smits, the creator of CEASE therapy, wrote in his book that “all kinds of detoxification reactions may occur” as a result of the treatment. Most common is fever, he said, which “should not be treated with medication, as it is a healthy reaction of the organism and not a disease! ... Eliminations like diarrhea, flu, expectoration, and bad-smelling and cloudy urine should also be left alone, because they are a part of the healing process.”One child he treated had diarrhoea that “relieved his system so much that his autism almost disappeared instantly”. After 10 days, however, his mother was so concerned that she took him to the doctor, who gave him immodium to stop the diarrhoea. “Almost immediately the child had a setback and became autistic as before. The diarrhea was a perfect detoxification for his bowels and brain. Neither the doctor not the mother understood this, and the medication interfered with the progress of the cure,” claimed Smits.Ursula Kraus-Harper, a member of the Society of Homeopaths, told the  she has used CEASE therapy since attending a seminar with Smits in 2010 but that she uses it in conjunction with classical homeopathy. Children started improving after a certain set of detoxes, she said. She did not believe homeopathy was a cure, however.She said she was not against vaccination, but said “vaccines can be a problem and so can medical drugs. That is more and more accepted by everybody who is not blinded by drug-driven medicine.” She denied CEASE put children at risk. “Tell me of one child, one person that has died from high doses of vitamin C,” she said. “When the body has had too much of it, it will produce diarrhoea then you lower the dose and the diarrhoea will stop.”The Labour MP Barry Sheerman, who chaired the cross-party Westminster Commission on Autism, condemned the claims of CEASE therapists to cure the disorder. “There is support and much we can do but there are no cures and if someone says so, show me the evidence,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75d89b7fcd6d486e02766bb787f3db19528be593/0_93_3100_1860/master/3100.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=212449e47de83db7e0527a1c583e3fc6","title":"elliot daly wasps england lions rugby union interview","story":"By this stage of a post-Lions season there are usually only two sorts of professional rugby players: the ones already lying in a knackered heap and those about to join them. Rare to the point of invisibility are Englishmen who trekked all the way around New Zealand last summer, finished fifth in the recent Six Nations and still have a glint in their eye. Elliot Daly is either a brilliant actor or a serious glutton for punishment.Nor will there be much respite in the next two months. First there is the challenge of banishing the question marks hovering over Wasps and atoning for last year’s Premiership final disappointment against Exeter. Then there is England’s tour to South Africa which Daly, far from sidestepping, is massively keen to be involved in. Given he is also poised to open a cafe in Leamington Spa – complete with baristas tutored by the UK’s five-time latte art champion – the beachside hammock will have to wait.Nail all those goals successfully and the 25-year-old really will have had a special 12 months. Without his long-range kicking and all-round assurance on the wing, the Lions might not have earned their famous series draw against the All Blacks. In his last four Tests for England he has contributed five tries. As a cricketer talented enough to have represented England at under-15 level, he is the nearest thing British sport possesses to a modern-day Wilson of the Wizard.All of which raises a question: how much more influential could he be if he saw the ball more often? England have generally employed Daly in a roving wing role but he initially broke into the national side as an outside-centre and reckons he could also prosper – “There’s more space and you get the ball a bit earlier than you do on the wing” – at full-back. With Bath’s Jonathan Joseph and Anthony Watson both set to miss the South African tour through injury and Manu Tuilagi’s participation still up in the air, the odds on the Croydon-born flier wearing either 13 or 15 in June must be shortening.How fortunate, then, that the multitalented all-rounder – in his cricket days he used to bowl right-arm quick despite being left-footed and writing left-handed – feels fresher than many of his contemporaries. Injuries, most recently an open finger dislocation which pierced the skin, have allowed him to recharge slightly and rediscover the zest for life currently eluding one of two of his weary colleagues.“You’re still training and trying to get fit but a couple of little niggles does allow you time to get yourself right and get back to firing on all cylinders. I’m ready and raring to go for whatever the end of season holds for us.”Daly, in short, is no poster boy for those insisting future Lions tours from 2021 onwards must be trimmed from 10 to eight games to safeguard player welfare. “I really enjoyed the Lions tour. The length of it wasn’t an issue for me personally. I was involved in eight of the 10 games having played in the Premiership final the weekend before departure. For me it was quite good to keep focused on rugby.”He is smart enough, nevertheless, to sense that even his buzzing energy levels will be impossible to sustain if the switching of summer Tests from June to July from 2020 is not satisfactorily dovetailed with the domestic fixture list. “I don’t think you can play more. We’re kind of playing all year round at the moment. It just needs to be clear because then we can plan for the future.”Even his new caffeine-oriented sideline, it seems, is not going to ert Daly from his primary addiction. One day he fancies playing abroad, possibly in Super Rugby – “I would like to try and play in that kind of rugby but it would have to be at the right time” – but given he signed a new Wasps contract only last September it really would require a major implosion for him to abandon the team he has represented since he was a schoolboy. For all the current frustration caused by Wasps’ continuing lack of a permanent training base, the players’ desire for silverware remains undimmed. As Daly puts it: “This is where we said we wanted to be at the start of the season: in the top four chasing a semi-final.”A free-flowing home victory over the Saints on Sunday would also honour the clutch of established players – James Haskell, Danny Cipriani, Guy Thompson and Sam Jones – bidding farewell to the club this season. “There are a lot of characters leaving so giving them as good a send-off as possible is a big one for us,” says Daly.What will he miss most about Haskell? “It’s a constant case of: ‘He’s not going to say that, is he? Oh, he’s just said it.’ He just doesn’t have an off-button. He says exactly what he thinks but says it with a smile. He’ll be a big loss for the squad.”And Cipriani? At their best, Wasps attack with more thrilling verve than any other side in the country, with Daly’s acceleration complementing his fly-half’s rare vision. “The mindset he brings to attack is something we’ll keep when he leaves,” says Daly. “He’s very gifted in what he does and he knows what he wants to do to defenders. It’s definitely been helpful for me.”Another of his fleet-footed partners in crime, the quicksilver Willie le Roux, could soon be among the opposition when England fly south in June for a three-Test examination of their stamina and recently shaken confidence.Daly is one of many who sense a Springbok side licking their lips at the prospect of piling into their visitors on home soil. “I reckon they’re going to be a handful in the summer,” he says.On the flip side, with two Tests being staged at altitude, his bazooka of a left boot could do the Boks plenty of damage from distance. Assuming Eddie Jones’s side can shake off their Six Nations torpor, the trip would also help erase the memory of his only previous tour to South Africa with England Under-18s.“We lost 2-1 in a best-of-three series which was very annoying. I think we had a kick to win it at the end and missed.” If anyone can help England and Wasps finish their endless winter in style, it is the inexhaustible Daly.Elliot Daly was speaking on behalf of Land Rover, main club partner of Wasps.

The Falcons need one more victory to secure a place in the semi-finals for the first time, but the Tigers will finish outside the top four if Wasps defeat Northampton on Sunday.Newcastle had never appeared in the play-offs and their only Premiership victory here was in 1997, the year they won the title. Their director of rugby, Dean Richards, played for the Tigers then and it was the final match in his long and successful career.No club has a better away record in the league this season than the Falcons and a former Leicester player, Vereniki Goneva, gave them the lead after 74 seconds. The wing played scrum-half at a ruck, dummied Dan Cole and sprinted 40 metres to the line, shrugging off Telusa Veainu’s high and weak challenge. Leicester’s response was immediate. Brendan O’Connor played inside-centre from a lineout and charged through Scott Lawson’s challenge on a 30-metre break. The Tigers moved the defence right and left before manoeuvring space that was filled by Jonny May coming off his wing to score the 50th Premiership try of his career.Newcastle lost their tighthead prop Scott Wilson with a head injury after 10 minutes and were soon struggling up front where Ellis Genge, after conceding an early penalty, was again immovable. He was also prominent in the loose. One run and deft offload was followed by a sloppy knock-on that reflected his side, a mixture of the slick and the slack.Newcastle regained the lead after 11 minutes when Luke Hamilton contested the ball at a ruck while off his feet and Joel Hodgson converted the penalty from 40 metres but the outside-half, playing in place of the injured former Tiger Toby Flood, suffered a knee injury after 24 minutes.He became the third Newcastle player to be replaced with the second-row Sean Robinson lasting 14 minutes. Leicester looked to wear them down, dominating in terms of territory, and as the Falcons started to creak under relentless pressure, they conceded penalties and George Ford kicked two to give his side the lead.Newcastle went from the second to the 35th-minute without entering Leicester’s 22, but they ended the opening half with a flurry of driving mauls after kicking two penalties to touch. When they were awarded a third child close to the posts, after O’Connor had been harshly penalised for hands in a ruck in another example of how the attacking side is favoured at the breakdown, Juan Pablo Socino made it 13-13 at the break.Leicester were struggling to make their set-piece superiority tell, but they regained the lead after 53 minutes in trademark fashion: a driving maul from a lineout was followed by two more phases before the second-row Mike Fitzgerald thumped down the ball on the line.Newcastle were dining off scraps, forcing them to take risks at the breakdown. Ford’s third penalty on the hour left the Falcons needing to score again to secure at least a bonus point, but they were struggling to get out of their own half.Newcastle had to find something and did, Goneva swatting Ford aside for his 13th Premiership try of the campaign to set up the final 10 minutes. Leicester, having made a number of changes, looked to hang on to what they had but when they lost Sione Kalamafoni to the sin-bin three minutes from time, the Falcons kicked the penalty to touch, worked 17 phases and got over the line.It took five minutes of reviewing before the try was awarded."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bd8a2ce3a77b0afa6318d83720be597803fd67a/0_126_5054_3032/master/5054.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8630b849be34ceb03a9ce2c0460b001","title":"lewis hamilton azerbaijan grand prix baku mercedes ferrari","story":"• Mercedes and Ferrari struggle for grip on Baku street circuit• “If we get on top of tyres we can show the true performance”Baku was the street circuit that hosted a street fight last season, the moment Sebastian Vettel lost the plot and barged Lewis Hamilton, a flashpoint that reflected their tight battle for the\u0026nbsptitle.They return with the tension already increasing, the margins and competition even closer. The protagonists, who must now include Red Bull alongside Ferrari and Mercedes, will doubtless want to keep it clean on Sunday but none can afford to give any quarter at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix.For Hamilton and Mercedes this is a vital race and one they will want to win clinically without a slugging match. They have not won this season and Hamilton trails Vettel by nine points but this is the first grand prix where power can be decisive. This has been a key Mercedes strength but it will also be another technical examination of their car. They have struggled to find the correct tyre temperature operating window and qualifying will be indicative of whether they are nearer to discovering the solution.Hamilton has struggled, particularly over the single lap where he has been beaten in two of three races by his team-mate Valtteri Bottas.“We believe the car is sound,” Hamilton said. “That’s not the biggest issue – tyres is something we are still learning about. One weekend we’ve got it, the next we haven’t. If we get on top of tyres we can show the true performance.”The team’s technical director, James Allison, also acknowledged their target. “We have not always got it right in qualifying – to make the tyre wake up and play on the single lap – that’s our job to do,” he said.The Mercedes does not appear to run as well in turbulent air as the Ferrari and claiming front-row spots is the simplest way of addressing it. With temperatures expected to drop as the weekend progresses, it will represent a major step forward if they can find the sweet spot.Ferrari show every indication of having a stable platform on which to build. They secured two front-row lockouts in Bahrain and China and Vettel has two wins. Their car is finding the operating window more easily and there is a quiet, calm confidence in the team.“We know we’ve built a good car,” Vettel said. “We know we have a lot of potential to make it faster and that’s what we are working on. It depends on a lot of things, conditions, tyres, track. We have three cars that are a match, and whoever does the best job bringing all these little things and details together is up front.”The triumvirate is completed by Red Bull and their charge is being led by Daniel Ricciardo. The Australian won in Baku last year and drove magnificently to take the third race of the season in China. He was quickest in second practice on Friday and only three-hundredths down on Bottas in the first session.Hamilton and Vettel could not put in clean quick runs and were fifth and 11th respectively in the afternoon. Max Verstappen crashed early in the first session but recovered to be only 0.116sec slower than his team-mate, Ricciardo.Red Bull struggled on the straights but looked to be making great time through the tight second sector and did not share Mercedes’ problems with the tyres. Their car appears to be going from strength to strength.Mercedes are far from panicking. In China they would have expected Bottas to win if not for the intervention of the safety car but Hamilton recognised that, while the fight may be fair in Baku this year, no one is going to find it easy.“We have Red Bull close to their best and Ferrari at their best,” he said. “If we can pull through and deliver, it will be the biggest achievement this team have accomplished.”Jenson Button, Hamilton’s former McLaren team-mate and the 2009 world champion, will race in the Le Mans 24 Hours in June. Button will drive for the Russian SMP team in the top LMP1 class. Fernando Alonso will drive for Toyota.“It’s always been a dream of mine to race at Le Mans,” Button said. “I think it’s every driver’s dream to take part and hopefully go on to clinch that win at Le Mans, and I’m definitely no different.”Button will compete in the full world endurance championship season, which concludes next year at Le Mans again, with the exception of the first round next Saturday at Spa."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9eaa96c022547dd8ea4d687dc7cb2ea7d28b5d0/0_115_1792_1075/master/1792.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=553e2bd854cff66d603b48f512e51a37","title":"london marathon impostor accused of claiming runners medal","story":"Man pictured at finish with lost race number of charity runner who was removed from courseLondon Marathon organisers are investigating after it emerged that an apparent impostor may have used a genuine runner’s lost race number to collect a medal.Jake Halliday, 28, an investment manager from Edinburgh, reportedly lost his race number and was removed from the course three and a half hours into his run and about 15 minutes from the finish. Halliday was running with his friend Andrew Keiller for the blood cancer research charity Bloodwise, in support of Keiller’s girlfriend who was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in October 2016. The pair – along with their friend Chris Chisholm who is due to run the Stirling marathon this weekend – have raised more than £48,500, smashing their £20,000 target. According to race tracking data, Halliday crossed the start line at 10.05am and reached the 40km mark in a little over three and a half hours, but did not record a finish time.Pictures have emerged apparently showing an alleged impostor posing at the finish line with Halliday’s race number, 35179, and a finisher’s medal.Officials said they were aware of the claims and were investigating but would make “no further comment at the moment”. According to Peter Mowbray, 51, a runner who publicised the incident on Facebook, Halliday was prevented from completing the race by two marshals who saw that he was not wearing a number, the Daily Mail reported. “It takes a lot of work to run a marathon. It’s not a matter of eating a bowl of pasta and having a go, it’s 12 months’ worth of training,” Mowbray wrote. “Jake had his once-in-a-lifetime experience stolen from him by an impostor. The running world is very close-knit and when I saw the photograph of that man taking Jake’s medal I cried.”It is not the first time in the London Marathon’s 37-year-history that allegations of cheating have surfaced. In 2016, Natasha Argent, 26, agreed to return her finisher’s medal after she was found to have missed 11 of the 24 checkpoints. She was recorded as having completed the final 20km in 39mins – quicker than Sir Mo Farah. She later said she had had a panic attack and got lost.In 2010, a runner who was initially thought to have recorded the fastest London Marathon time by someone aged over 65 was found to have taken a 10-mile shortcut at Tower Bridge. He said he had done so because of an injury.Donations to a fundraising page set up by a former MasterChef contestant who died after collapsing during this year’s marathon have topped £220,000. Matt Campbell, 29, from Kendal, collapsed at the 22.5-mile mark during Sunday’s event, which took place in record 24.1C (73.3F) temperatures.Campbell was running to raise a target of £2,500 for the Brathay Trust, which was where his father had worked before he died suddenly in 2016. By Friday afternoon, £217,500 had been raised through Campbell’s JustGiving page for the Cumbria-based charity, which works with vulnerable young people."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94a6f3091e6a2a1f60eb966efc005ee4b6b50a9d/247_133_761_456/master/761.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c1777aefce93ac00f8dbb8080c82711","title":"nothing like a dame judi dench maggie smith eileen atkins joan plowright","story":"Roger Michell’s film Nothing Like a Dame brings four legends together – and evokes decades of brilliant performancesSometimes the best ideas are the simplest.

It also reminds me of the truth of David Hare’s observation that acting is ultimately “a judgment of character”.The four dames have known each other a long time and have much in common. Between them they have played all the great roles: Cleopatra, Lady Macbeth, Saint Joan, the Duchess of Malfi. They have lived through radical changes in the approach to verse-speaking. And they have experienced the humdrum delights of theatrical digs: one legendary story involves an actor returning unexpectedly to pick up a script and discovering his landlady spreadeagled on the kitchen table with the milkman, only for her to shyly declare: “You must think me a terrible flirt.”Looking at the personalities, as well as the careers, of the four actors, what strikes me is their quirky iniduality: each has some essential, defining quality that makes for stardom. In the case of Maggie Smith, it is an acutely developed sense of irony that she has applied to the great high comedy roles such as Beatrice in Much Ado, Millamant in The Way of the World and Amanda in Private Lives. Her forte has always been a faint scepticism built on a fastidious use of language. You see it in the film when, as they discuss what it’s like to be a dame, Plowright observes that, as Lady Olivier, she has the difficulty of possessing a double title. “You’ll just have to grapple with it, Joan,” remarks Smith with wry coolness. But she can also pierce to the heart of a character. I’ve never forgotten how, when she played Titania at Stratford, Ontario, she made something inexpressibly moving out of the fairy queen’s grief at the death of her votaress in childbirth.Judi Dench is no less famous for conveying the contradictions within a character. Over the course of a long career, she has played just about everyone from the anguished heroine of John Hopkins’ TV drama Talking to a Stranger to Elizabeth I and Queen Victoria on the big screen. But although she was a magnificent Lady Macbeth and Cleopatra, what I admire most is her ability to catch the silvery contrasts of Shakespeare’s comic heroines. When Beatrice in Much Ado denies that she was born in a merry hour, Dench’s voice seemed to crack as she claimed: “No, sure, my lord, my mother cried, but then there was a star danced, and under that was I born.” All of Dench’s capacity to mix bubbling mischief and plangent melancholy was caught in that line.For all her dual titles, Joan Plowright strikes me as the earthiest of the four dames. You see that in the film when she recalls someone telling her: “You’re no oil painting, but you’ve got the spark.” That spark was evident from the start in her sensational Beatie Bryant in Arnold Wesker’s Roots and her unforgettable Sonya in Olivier’s production of Uncle Vanya: her climactic speech to the broken-hearted Vanya, full of a defiant endurance, was one of the most moving things I’ve ever heard in a theatre.Eileen Atkins’s career encompasses everything from the classics to TS Eliot, Marguerite Duras and Samuel Beckett, and she is soon to return to the West End in Florian Zeller’s The Height of the Storm. If I had to single out any one performance, it would be her astonishing recent incarnation of Ellen Terry at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, in which she transported us in a second from Juliet’s terror to Lear’s thunder and from Rosalind’s lyrical ardour to Portia’s practical compassion. But Atkins’s defining gift is a no-bullshit emotional directness that, to borrow the words of James Agate on Jean Forbes-Robertson, I would describe as her “steel-true and blade-straight quality”.Watching Michell’s film is like eavesdropping on the freewheeling conversation of four old friends. At the same time, it unlocks our personal memories of past performances by four great actors and reminds us of their cherishable uniqueness.

Chris Bush and Matt Winkworth’s musical is definitely not a call for the murder of a self-styled hate figure. Rather, it’s an intelligent, thoughtful and often wryly enjoyable look at the polarisation of public debate in the age of social media, and what happens when it ceases to be a discourse and becomes a mere echo chamber. Lucy Osborne’s design of stairs, platforms and movable screens features the lights of thousands of endlessly winking mobile phones. Yes, Katie Hopkins is dead, cut down in public by an unknown assailant. But while some celebrate her passing by taking to the streets to sing Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead, the police search for her killer without success. Kayleigh (an impressive debut from Bethzienna Williams), an intern at an Amnesty-style charity is asked to compile a dossier explaining Katie’s appeal. What she finds confounds her expectations, appals her boss (“I asked for a dossier, not a love letter”) and leads to her setting up a group called Justice4Katie. Soon the hashtag #JeSuisKatie is trending. Justice is also on the mind of trainee soliciter Shayma Hussaini (Maimuna Memon) who is returning to work after she rocked the boat by making a sexual harassment allegation against her superior. She tries patience further when she takes up the cause of office cleaner Elena (Amy Booth-Steel) whose cousin is one of 12 people killed in a caravan fire on a fruit-picking farm. Their deaths have passed almost unnoticed in the hysteria surrounding Hopkins’ demise. The two stories never quite meet, but offer a series of reverberating reflections on free speech, confirmation bias, our obsession with celebrity, who gets justice, and how humanity and truth are casualties in a world of instant messaging, unchecked news reports and videos that go viral at the click of a button. Both Kayleigh and Shayma are, like Katie, women who refuse to be silenced and pay a price for not conforming to expectations. There is a particularly striking moment when Shayma responds to racial harassment on a train, to startling effect. Bush and director James Grieve set out their stall early by pointing to the inability of theatre, or indeed any medium, to tell the whole truth, while slyly suggesting that what we are watching is a verbatim play based on real interviews and news reports. But, of course, it is a fiction. It’s very neatly done, as is Winkworth’s deliciously inventive score, which pulsates and bleeps like a mobile device and yet still has a lyrical underscoring, and plenty of earworms. Music and words are sometimes in harmony, but often cleverly used in counterpoint to each other. Most importantly, the score offers an emotional hook that Bush’s clever, inquiring script sometimes lacks. The show has pitched itself in the realm of Jerry Springer: The Opera, and there are similarities. But it is less outrageously satirical and eager to shock, and more reflective. There are moments when it feels a little dry, and it’s definitely overlong and repetitive. But with tightening and cuts, it should shine, thanks to its brilliant cast and willingness to grapple intelligently with how technology is changing us.

The most vulnerable to the damage and suffering would be poor and older Americans, infants and children, and African Americans, who live in large numbers in urban areas where the heat island effect intensifies rising climactic temperatures.Almost eight out of 10 African Americans live within 30 miles of a coal-burning plant, are three times more likely to die of airborne pollution than the overall population of the US, and black children suffer twice the levels of asthma with 10 times the level of asthmatic deaths, Gore said.The former vice-president to Bill Clinton, who famously won the popular vote in the 2000 presidential election but was defeated by George Bush on the electoral college count, launched an attack Scott Pruitt, the beleaguered administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), for whittling down safeguards and regulations on air pollution. Pruitt is fighting to save his job having become engulfed in a raft of ethical controversies.Gore said of Pruitt: “I don’t know why he’s still in office, though I kind of do know.”He went on to accuse big business of leaning on Donald Trump to preserve Pruitt’s job. “The big grifters depend on the little grifter, and the big grifters have contacted the head grifter and said ‘Keep him in there’,” Gore said.The climate change advocate was speaking at a two-day summit organized by the Equal Justice Initiative, a civil rights legal group in Montgomery. Under its director Bryan Stevenson, EJI has created a new museum and memorial that commemorates the victims of racial violence in the US and looks at the roots in slavery and segregation of the modern epidemic of mass incarceration.Gore called on his audience to remain hopeful that something could still be done to combat climate change in the US and beyond. He pointed out that the first occasion in which the US could legally withdraw from the Paris agreement on climate change would be 4 November 2020 – a day after the 2020 US presidential election.“If there is a new president, there is a 30-day notice period to rejoin the agreement,” he said.Gore added that maybe it wouldn’t be that long before Trump left office. “We’re only a little over a year into this experiment and in science and medicine some experiments are terminated early for ethical reasons.”In his assessment, Trump had proved to be less capable of inflicting damage on the environment than he had feared, Gore said. “In the rush to do what the big polluters wanted him to do as quickly as possible they have made a lot of mistakes and the courts are striking down some of their actions. We have a lot of resilience built into the American system. They are doing damage for sure, but I believe much of it can be overturned.”Gore finished with an impassioned call for reforms to protect the US democratic system from the caustic influence of rich iniduals and corporations. “Out democracy was hacked long before Vladimir Putin hacked it, by big money and big lobbying. In order to solve the climate crisis we’ve got to fix the democracy crisis.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9fa7d20bd0609567ab76a8e41ae4b3319cbd19b4/0_188_2988_1793/master/2988.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af5c26098ff6c130e898df23c4f479e2","title":"bobby kennedy netflix documentary shines a light on his relevance","story":"Makers of Bobby Kennedy for President discuss the importance of reflecting on the politician’s legacy at this time in the USAs they drove through California in 1968, Bobby and Ethel Kennedy radiated warmth and cool, a young, hip image far removed from the tumultuous, politically charged era they lived in.That contrast returns again and again in the new Netflix documentary series Bobby Kennedy for President, which surveys the Democratic presidential nominee’s political and personal development.Kennedy was assassinated at 42 – shortly after one newscaster said of him, “No American in this century has ever been so likely to be president as Robert Francis Kennedy” – but the series does not emphasize the tragedy.Instead, the four-parter feels fresh as it ricochets between rarely seen archival footage and interviews with Kennedy contemporaries, who to this day are working to address the civil rights issues the Democrat sought to improve.Dawn Porter, the director and executive producer, told the  that “it’s not only fair, it’s imperative” to draw comparisons to now.“We are living at a time when people are questioning not just the actions of the current occupant of the White House, but they are also questioning the institutions: is the presidency that important?” Porter said. “Seeing the history, seeing what so many people have sacrificed to be good leaders, to do their best as leaders – we need to remember that, to remember that the office of the presidency, the national government is bigger than any one inidual.”Even without today’s parallels to the politically charged climate of 1968, the film would have a sense of now because of the film-makers’ stunning archival footage collection. The documentary team poured over 2,000 reels of film and digitized 240 hours of archive footage from news stations and personal collections to create the film.“You are so afraid you are going to miss something,” Porter said. “And you are going to miss things. There is no way to completely cover this rich period of history but we wanted to give it our best shot.”Amid depictions of the Democratic party in turmoil and the continued US involvement in Vietnam, the final episode offers a surprise with the questions it raises about the rushed case to prosecute Sirhan Sirhan, who is eventually charged with Kennedy’s murder.Witnesses to the attack are featured in archive footage and in the present to reiterate their skepticism about the investigation into Kennedy’s assassination and Sirhan’s trial. One of those witnesses is Sandra Serrano, who then and now said a woman in a white polka dot dress shot Kennedy.“They didn’t want to follow up on anything,” Serrano said in the documentary. “They wanted to wrap it up.”The film-makers also spoke extensively with Paul Schrade, Kennedy’s friend who was wounded in the shooting. He has spent decades trying to prove Sirhan’s innocence in Kennedy’s murder, but believes Sirhan shot him.This skepticism could rankle those frustrated by the conspiracies that still shadow John F Kennedy’s assassination, but ultimately the controversy takes a back seat to the legacy Kennedy left behind and the wounds left open by his death.Juan Romero, who had gone to shake Kennedy’s hand when the senator was shot, speaks in a rare, sobering interview towards the end of the series.Then a 17-year-old busboy, Romero attracted worldwide fame moments later when he cradled the dying president, a moment captured in Bill Eppridge’s famous photo of the assassination at the Ambassador hotel.Romeo rarely speaks about the incident, which demonstrably pains him to this day. He said in the moment Kennedy was shot “hope seemed to be dying with him. It just felt like nobody was there for us any more.”From the dozens of Kennedy associates who came forward to speak about the president, 50 years after his death, it’s clear his message resonated well past his death.Michalchyshyn was born in Canada a year before Kennedy’s assassination. Though her home country had its own glamorous legacy family with the Trudeaus, Michalchyshyn was well aware of the Kennedys. Her surface knowledge did not, however, prepare for the vigorous course in Bobby Kennedy and the 1960s.“It motivated me to get my American citizenship,” said Michalchyshyn. “The idea of public service, being involved, being part of the democracy. I am a fervent believer now in being a part of the democracy in this country. Working on this project has helped that for sure and motivated a lot of it.”Porter hopes that with this footage digitized, other film-makers will be able to explore the time period and perhaps create new works. “I don’t think we could ever have too much examination of our political history,” Porter said. “Kennedy was not an early enthusiastic civil rights advocate but he becomes that. Once that issue took hold of his heart, it didn’t die. We are all the better for that work, for that legacy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52386a1d0ca67812c02951afc3c3713d23b19ccf/0_78_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38e0309ba619051ee1bfadfd17442472","title":"north south korea summit leaders promise lasting peace denuclearisation kim jong un moon jae in","story":"Kim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in pledge denuclearisation and end to decades of hostility after summitThe leaders of North and South Korea have promised after a landmark summit to bring “lasting peace” to the peninsula with a commitment to denuclearisation and to ending decades of hostilities.Speaking at the end of an extraordinary day that began with a lingering handshake across the demarcation line separating their countries, the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, and the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, issued a joint statement that was short on detail but offered cause for optimism as the world looks ahead to a summit between Kim and Donald Trump.The US president, in his first comments on the declaration, tweeted: “Good things are happening, but only time will tell!” He later added: “KOREAN WAR TO END!”Speaking at the White House, Trump warned that the US was “not going to be played” by North Korea, later the US president said he was getting close to choosing a venue for talks with Kim. “We’re setting up meetings now,” he said. “We’re down to two countries... and we’ll let you know what that site is.”At a joint press conference with Angela Merkel, Trump said: “Maximum pressure will continue until denuclearisation occurs. I look forward to our meeting, which will be quite something.”The Panmunjom declaration, named after the truce village that hosted the talks on Friday, committed the two Koreas to seek the “complete denuclearisation” of the peninsula.“South and North Korea confirmed the common goal of realising, through complete denuclearisation, a nuclear-free Korean peninsula,” it said. “South and North Korea shared the view that the measures being initiated by North Korea are very meaningful and crucial for the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, and agreed to carry out their respective roles and responsibilities in this regard.”The statement did not specify what Pyongyang expected in return for abandoning its nuclear weapons – the regime’s best deterrent against what it regards as a hostile US.Speaking outside the peace house on the southern side of the border that has ided the Korean peninsula for 65 years, the leaders also pledged to push for talks with the US, and possibly China, to formally end the 1950-53 Korean war with a peace treaty to replace the uneasy truce that stopped hostilities.North and South Korea have been ided since the end of the Korean War (1950-53), and except for about a decade ending in 2008, relations between the two have remained frosty. The two nations technically remain in a state of war, since a peace treaty was never signed.\u0026nbspThere have been occasional outbreaks of violence, most recently in 2010 when 50 people were killed when a South Korean navy corvette was sunk and several islands close to the border were attacked.This meeting\u0026nbspcould touch on a formal truce\u0026nbspbut this is also not the first time North Korea has expressed a willingness to abandon its nuclear ambitions. A deal with the US, Japan and South Korea in the 1990s was meant to give the North civilian nuclear power without the ability to build a weapon, but the reactor was never finished.North Korea\u0026nbsppledged to relinquish its nuclear programme\u0026nbspin 2007 in exchange for sanctions relief and fuel, but later pulled out of that agreement and expelled inspectors in 2009.Read a full explainer on the Korea summit hereNoting that more than a decade had passed since the countries’ leaders last met, Kim and Moon agreed to talk regularly by phone and meet more often, starting with a summit in Pyongyang in autumn.They vowed to work more closely on a host of bilateral issues, including reuniting families ided by the Korean war and improving cross-border transport links.Months after relations between the two countries sank to their lowest level following North Korean missile launches and its sixth nuclear test, Moon said he and Kim were aware that the hopes of 80 million North and South Koreans rested on their shoulders.“We were able to stand together today and agree that we should denuclearise the Korean peninsula,” Moon said, according to a translation provided by South Korea’s Arirang TV.With Kim standing nearby behind a separate podium, he said. “To completely denuclearise, we declare that we will cooperate to bring about an everlasting peace on the peninsula.”Moon applauded Kim’s “courage and determination” and vowed that “there will be no going back” to an era of tension and provocation that has occasionally brought the neighbours to the brink of conflict. “We are giving a great present to the citizens of the two Koreas,” he said.The goodwill measures would begin with a halt to “all forms of hostility” on land, at sea and in the air, the declaration said. The demilitarised zone – the heavily armed border separating the two countries – and the western maritime border will be turned into “peace zones”.From Tuesday, both countries will suspend all loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts and dismantle broadcasting equipment. They will also stop sending propaganda leaflets across the border.Kim said: “We hope we will not repeat the mistake of the past. I hope this will be an opportunity for the Korean people to move freely from North to South. We need to take responsibility for our own history.“We have waited for this day for a very long time. We are tied by blood and cannot be separated – we are the same country, the same people, and should not be separated by hostility.“We hope we can open a new road towards a new future, and that is why I crossed the demarcation line today. We hope for a new era of peace, and we have reaffirmed our commitment to that.”Duyeon Kim, a senior fellow at the Korean Peninsula Future Forum, said the wording of the statement was encouraging, as Kim prepares for his summit with Trump in late May or early June.“It’s good that the nuclear language is in there, and including ‘complete denuclearisation’ is a win for Moon,” she said. “It’s really aimed at setting up the meeting with Trump.”But she said it would have been easy for Kim to agree to the statement since “it reiterates what their position has been all along”, and from Pyongyang’s perspective, denuclearisation would include significant concessions from the US on its military presence in South Korea.“In the grand scheme of things, this declaration is continuing the spirit of the 2007 agreement, and much of what we see in this declaration has been agreed to before,” she said. “But it’s still a long and complicated road ahead.”Earlier, the two leaders signed the joint statement before standing to shake hands. At Moon’s instigation, they joined hands and raised their arms aloft, ending the exchange with an embrace and more of the broad smiles that were a feature of their joint public appearances throughout the day.International reaction to the summit was largely positive. China, the North’s main ally and its biggest economic partner, described the leaders’ handshake as a historic moment.“We applaud the Korean leaders’ historic step and appreciate their political decisions and courage,” Hua Chunying, a foreign ministry spokeswoman, told reporters. “We hope and look forward to them taking this opportunity to further open a new journey of long-term stability on the peninsula.”The UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, sounded a more cautious note. While “very encouraged” by the summit, he said: “I don’t think that anybody looking at the history of North Korea’s plans to develop a nuclear weapon would want to be over-optimistic at this point. But it is clearly good news that the two leaders are meeting. Absolutely.”Virginie Grzelczyk, a senior lecturer at Aston University, said: “This is a very long game, and confidence-building will take a lot of time. I am not sure a meeting between Kim Jong-un and President Trump would add anything to this particularly good development in inter-Korean relations today, and it might be that this would blur the line.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0351c3e8a91f801a2c9309388d6d528fe287bc2/449_115_2718_1631/master/2718.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5671d6fbedda07b7a5ab7666e453742e","title":"racism british society minority ethnic people dying excessive force","story":"Experts cite police data showing disproportionate number of minority ethnic people died due to excessive use of force by stateThe disproportionate number of deaths of black and brown people in incidents with the police shows that structural racism remains rooted in the fabric of British society, a panel of UN human rights experts has said.The panel cited data from the politan police showing a disproportionate number of minority ethnic people – particularly those of African or Caribbean descent – dying due to excessive use of force by the state.Noting that there had never been a successful prosecution of a police officer for a death in police custody, the panel said: “This points to the lack of accountability and the impunity with which law enforcement and state agencies operate.”The warning from members of the UN human rights council comes before a 12-day visit to the UK by E Tendayi Achiume, the special rapporteur on racism, beginning on Monday. “The deaths reinforce the experiences of structural racism, over-policing and criminalisation of people of African descent and other minorities in the UK,” they said.“Failure to properly investigate and prosecute such deaths results in a lack of accountability for those iniduals and state agencies responsible, as well as in the denial of adequate remedies and reparation for the families of the victims.” The panel pointed particularly to the disproportionate use of stun guns. People from black and minority ethnic backgrounds were three times more likely to be subjected to the use of such weapons by police, they said.The members added: “People of African descent with psychosocial disabilities and those experiencing severe mental or emotional distress reportedly face multiple forms of discrimination and are particularly affected by excessive use of force.”A report last year by David Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham, found racial disparities across the criminal justice system. He has consistently said that young black men feel as though they are living in a police state and that a different standard of policing is applied to black youths, compared with whites. At least five black men died in the UK after restraint by police last year: Edson Da Costa, 25, in Newham, east London Darren Cumberbatch, 32, in Nuneaton, Warwickshire Shane Bryant, 29, in Leicestershire Rashan Charles, 20, in Hackney, east London and Nuno Cardoso, 25, in Oxford. Deborah Coles, director of Inquest, which supports the families of people who die in police custody, and which gave evidence to the UN panel, said: “The racial stereotype of the black man as ‘big, black and dangerous’, ‘violent’ and ‘volatile’, when woven into police culture and practice, can lead to the disproportionate and fatal use of force. “There is a double-discrimination experienced by black people with mental ill health, with the stereotype of ‘mad, bad and dangerous’ too often informing treatment.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “The government takes allegations of police racism very seriously and expects all allegations to be investigated thoroughly and perpetrators dealt with robustly. We are also clear that any use of force by the police must be necessary, reasonable and proportionate.“Every death in police custody is a tragedy. In October 2017, we published a major independent review into deaths and serious incidents in police custody alongside our response, setting out the steps we are taking to address the recommendations and the progress made to date.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31ba7b111cd68566eae50c6e6ebeaca305cbd7f5/0_0_6366_4244/master/6366.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c20edef4b0627b2ac1dec7b106aa1eb8 700w","title":"my financial future can i have my brunch and eat it too","story":"The options appear to be: never socialise and stay in to save for a house, or live a normal, modern urban life and spiral into debt. But is there a third way?Sitting firmly in the middle of the millennial generation (those born 1981-2000) and I’m told I could easily afford to buy my first home in London if I just give up: coffee, my gym membership, an annual weekend away, takeaway food, and a mobile upgrade, or one night out a week, for five years – or avocados.Sure, London living is afforded by renting the equivalent of a dodgy hostel dorm, nights out revolving around two-for-one deals, and “side-hustles”, which is a glorified term for my three jobs. So, should I accept that I can’t have my brunch and eat it too? Living paycheck to paycheck isn’t the dream and maybe neither is owning a home, but there must be a way I could at least consider the option.I’m certainly not alone, but maybe we’re placing too much value on “Yolo” – apparently a typical habit of young people today – so I’ve asked Paul Bridgwater, head of commercial and proposition at financial services provider OneFamily, and millennial lifestyle and personal finance expert Lisa Rowan from The Penny Hoarder what they think – and luckily neither suggested a five-year period where I give up all that I hold dear.Is it really that hard to save in a big city or am I being led astray?Rowan suggests that, unfortunately, it’s not all in my head. “Affordable, low-amenity units are being replaced with luxury buildings that are simply out of reach for many people, especially young people in the early stages of their careers,” she says. “This competitive housing environment means more workers in their 20s and 30s are enduring long commutes from the suburbs or are living with several roommates in order to make the most of their budgets.” But, Bridgwater says, while it can feel unattainable without the help from “the bank of mum and dad” we do have the benefit of living in a connected, digital age that can help us achieve our financial goals.I really value my social life – do I have to give up a chunk of it for five years?No, says Rowan, but there are some hacks to help make sure you don’t spend most of your monthly wages during the excitement of payday. In short, be at least a bit prepared. “Knowing the type of activity upfront can help you determine whether an event is a social and financial priority for you – then, it’s easier to make compromises. You may skip on the 12-person birthday dinner at a fancy restaurant, but you can still meet the group for drinks or dessert afterward. You can still go on a bar crawl with your friends, but perhaps eat a hearty meal before you leave the house,” she says.Bridgwater agrees, and says it’s safe to assume that most of your friends are in the same boat, so be straight up with them. “Money is a bit of a taboo subject for any age group, especially in the UK. On a practical level, earnings, savings and debts are not really discussed and perhaps they should be,” he says. “Like anything else in life, by talking and sharing issues, interesting solutions will come to light.”OK, so maybe I should be budgeting. What are some handy guidelines?Bridgwater says that budgeting isn’t the same for everyone, but taking away the temptation to spend is often the easiest way to save. “Create different accounts for your big expenses (housing, bills and savings) and then set up a standing order into these accounts one to two days after your wages go in from your main account. You’ll then know the money you have left in your main account is money you can spend,” he says.So, can I think about saving for a big purchase and still keep seeing my friends?Yes, says Rowan: “You can have your instant and delayed gratification at the same time.” A product like OneFamily’s stocks and shares Lifetime Isa is a good start when considering your options.

Photograph: Mauro FermarielloScience Photo LibraryGettyThe treatment of Vicky Phelan and at least 14 other women by CervicalCheck, the national cervical-cancer screening service, falls far short of accepted practice. Two issues must be addressed: is the standard for interpreting smears used by the three laboratories contracted to do so in line with international norms? And why did it take three years to tell these women that they were subjects of a look-back audit that found abnormalities in their smears, contradicting the results they had originally been given?CervicalCheck has screened more than a million women between the ages of 25 and 60 in the 10 years since the free service began. It has reached its target of 80 per cent coverage. Unlike BreastCheck, which uses specialist mammography facilities to screen for breast cancer, it outsources the taking of smears to general practitioners and well-woman clinics. But, crucially, it invites women to be screened and has overall responsibility for the service.Although the doctor who takes the smear is sent the result by the laboratory, and the woman gets a letter from CervicalCheck to say her result is available from her doctor or practice nurse, both the laboratory and the smear-taker act as subcontractors to the screening agency. As such CervicalCheck sets the standards and protocols that dictate how quality issues such as look-backs are dealt with. In other words, although the women’s doctors will be involved in the ongoing management of cases such as Ms Phelan’s, they have no role in decisions to withhold information.It is absolutely unacceptable for doctors treating women who were wrongly given the all-clear from cancer to be told to exercise their “judgment” about whether to tell them about the misdiagnoses, as documents before the High Court in Vicky Phelan’s case show. In fact inidual doctors have an ethical duty to keep their patients fully informed of test results, including of any doubt about the quality or accuracy of an investigation.Sadly, this is not the first time in recent years that the health service has ignored patients’ rights to information about their health, and the need for candour has been acknowledged in previous instances of cancer misdiagnosis. So the time has come for the Republic to emulate the UK and introduce a duty of candour.Although the quality of laboratory services used to read smears must be part of a review, it is worth remembering that, even in the most accomplished hands, the process can never be totally accurate. As with all medical tests, cervical-cancer screening produces false-positive and false-negative results. The key question is one of quality: do laboratories used by CervicalCheck follow best practice, and are their false-positive and -negative rates within internationally accepted parameters?Minister for Health Simon Harris must ensure there is a thorough, top-down external review of the screening agency. This must be carried out by the Health Information and Quality Authority, which has a strong record of impartially reviewing problem areas in the health service.Yet again the public is indebted to a brave woman who pursued answers and refused to be fobbed off by a monolithic health service. It is a timely reminder that information about our health belongs, in the first instance, to each and everyone of us."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"President, who returns from visit to US on Saturday, says \u0026lsquoultimately\u0026rsquo the people will decideDirector general says sorry to Vicky Phelan for delay in being told about incorrect testParty will support Government\u0026rsquos proposition for abortion within first trimester\u0026lsquoI suspect getting away with crime isn\u0026rsquot one of his abilities,\u0026rsquo says judge\u0026lsquoLast thing I expected, God knows.

Let’s devote all our energies to that: no hard border on the island of Ireland, no customs border on the Irish Sea,” he told reporters after meeting businesspeople from the local chamber of commerce in Newry. Differences of opinion have emerged between the EU and the UK on the pace of progress on the unresolved issue of how to avoid a hard border after the UK leaves the EU and around deadlines in Brexit talks.The UK’s Brexit secretary, David Davis, said on Wednesday he regarded June as an “artificial deadline” for agreement on the so-called backstop, the emergency default position effectively keeping Northern Ireland under EU economic rules post-Brexit in the absence of another option. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said on Thursday it was essential that there be “real and solid progress by June” on a solution to the Border question and that, without it, there can be no overall Brexit deal.Mr Lidington sounded a more conciliatory and constructive note on his visit to Co Down saying that all parties needed “to keep our eyes on the strategic prize”.“It is really important that we focus all our energies on ensuring no hard border on the island of Ireland and no border, no customs border to trade in the Irish Sea,” he said.Asked about Mr Varadkar’s remarks that the biggest barrier to a deal was the UK’s “very, very hard red lines”, the Conservative MP said that London had put forward “a number of ideas for negotiation” and that officials were working every week “to go through the nitty-gritty of those proposals issue by issue”.Mr Lidington, a former shadow Northern Ireland secretary of state from 2003 to 2007, said “good progress” had been made on maintaining the Common Travel Area covering freedom of travel between the UK and Ireland after Brexit, on equalities and human rights, and on the single energy market."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3477000.1524861779!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hse head apologises to limerick woman for false smear test","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tVicky Phelan  speaking to the media outside the Four Courts on Tuesday.

She received a settlement of €2.5 million.She only learned that a 2014 audit showed that the test was incorrect in September 2017, six years after the test was carried out.Her case against the HSE was struck out with no order. “While this apology will never undo the harm and distress suffered by you it is important that I emphasise the sincerity with which it is offered,” said Mr O’Brien in his letter to her.“I apologise to you for the failure to detect an abnormality in the original smear test that you underwent back in 2011. I also apologise to you for the failure to communicate in a timely and appropriate way the results of an audit that indicated a change in the interpretation of your original smear test.”The HSE director general provided details to Ms Phelan of actions being taken in light of her high-profile case to improve processes in the Cervical Check national screening programme and “to avoid, in as much as is feasibly possible, a recurrence of the unacceptable sequence of events that you experienced.”He told her that he met Minister for Health Simon Harris and also informed her about the review of the programme announced by Mr Harris on Thursday.“I have directed that preparations to establish this review begin immediate.

Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3475713.1524770096!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"conservatives can hide from customs union debate but can they run","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLabour Brexiteer Kate Hoey: “I feel a little alone today,” she said to a nearly deserted House, as MPs stayed away from a debate on the customs union. Photograph: Andy RainEPAIt is acknowledged on all sides as the crunch question surrounding Brexit right now, but when MPs held a debate about the customs union on Thursday, most of them didn’t show up. The government benches were almost deserted, with empty rows of green leather where the loudest Conservative Brexiteers usually sit, and junior treasury minister Mel Stride manning the front bench.None of the DUP’s 10 MPs were present, leaving North Down’s Sylvia Hermon to represent Northern Ireland – and unionism – alone. Antrim-born Kate Hoey, a Labour Brexiteer, referred to her absent friends as she spoke in favour of leaving the customs union.“I feel a little alone today,” she said.Instead of risking defeat on a non-binding motion, government whips told their MPs to abstain on the vote and to feel free to take the afternoon off. It’s a technique they have used a number of times in response to opposition motions since Theresa May lost her parliamentary majority last year, and it annoys the Speaker but saves the government’s blushes.On its own, Thursday’s vote changed nothing, but the debate will have alarmed the whips as they watched hitherto shy Tory rebels speak up in favour of the customs union. Ten Conservatives have already put their names to a pro-customs union amendment to a Bill next month, and Thursday’s debate suggested that more could join them – possibly enough to ensure the government’s defeat.May reassured Eurosceptic backbenchers this week that she remains committed to leaving the customs union, a red line she laid down in her first Conservative conference speech as leader in October 2016. She repeated the pledge in her Lancaster House speech in January 2017 and it has survived each major iteration of her government’s Brexit policy. The backbenchers said they were reassured by the prime minister’s latest renewal of the vow, and Jacob Rees-Mogg said this week that it would be political suicide for a Conservative government to agree to remain in a customs union.\u0026nbspMay’s problem is that she has promised to keep trade as frictionless as possible, partly because of the impact on British industry of any friction in the EU-wide supply chains used by big manufacturers. She has also promised to avoid a hard border in Ireland and ruled out any new trade barrier between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.The EU has rejected both of May’s customs proposals, and many in her own government are contemptuous of the option she is believed to favour – a customs partnership that would mean Britain collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU on imports destined for the European market.The second option, a customs arrangement now known as maximum facilitation or “maxfac”, would use technology and trusted trader schemes to make customs controls less intrusive and time-consuming.Brexiteers are suspicious of the customs partnership, which they fear could be adapted into a customs union in all but name. Under one scenario, Britain could agree to adopt a common external tariff with the EU for manufactured goods only. Services, which account for 80 per cent of the British economy, are not covered by the customs union, but new potential trade partners would probably want access to the British market for their agricultural exports.The island of Ireland is already treated as a single territory for phytosanitary standards, and passengers flying into Belfast from London often remark on agricultural hygiene notices at the airport. The DUP insists that Northern Ireland must not be treated differently from the rest of the UK in matters of trade after Brexit.But could they be persuaded to accept an arrangement that is close to the status quo on agriculture? And if not, how plausible is their threat to topple the Conservative government?Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, it is difficult to trigger a general election if the government doesn’t want one – and it is safe to assume that May is in no rush to reacquaint herself with the electorate. If May loses a confidence vote in Parliament, Jeremy Corbyn would have a chance to try to form a government before an election is called.Next week’s local elections could be almost as important as events in Parliament in determining the behaviour of Conservative MPs over Brexit. If Labour has its biggest victory in London for almost half a century, as polls predict, Conservative backbenchers may find unpalatable compromises on Brexit a little easier to swallow.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph launches next phase words chosen brand campaign","story":"The  has launched the second phase of the Words Chosen Well brand campaign which aims to showcase its award-winning quality journalism and raise brand awareness.The campaign started with a new television advert debuted during the commercial break of Channel 4’s Gogglebox on Friday 20th April. Created by adam\u0026ampeveDDB  in collaboration with The ’s in-house marketing and creative teams, it builds on the success of last year’s campaign with a bigger and bolder creative that utilises important cultural references and leans on some of the most emotive and impactful events of our times, highlighting iconic moments when words have been considered and chosen well.The ’s new campaign seeks to demonstrate the influence and importance of the spoken and written word, and the role that quality journalism plays in providing news, insight and analysis.

In practice, this means the infection is resistant to all commonly used antibiotics.The figures have emerged as Lord O\u0027Neill, the former Goldman Sachs banker who led a government-commissioned review into superbugs, accuses senior ministers of a lack of leadership on the issue. Lord O’Neill, former commercial secretary to the Treasury, said the Prime Minister, Theresa May, had allowed the issue to fade and that actions promised had not been taken.Lord O\u0026#39Neill has urged senior ministers to do more to tackle the threat of superbugs“It is disappointing to see that the UK government’s global and national efforts to fight AMR seem to have faded, he saidWriting exclusively for the  Lord O’Neill said that the UK was once seen as a leader in the field but that May had allowed the issue to slide.“The government should put this part of \u0027global Britain\u0027 back at the top of its priorities,” he writes. “There has been a lot of talk, but no action.Lord O’Neill’s review warned that if left unchecked antibiotic resistance would kill 10 million people and the world economy could lose up to $100 trillion by 2050.Antibiotic resistance | The true cost in Britain and around the worldOfficial figures suggest antimicrobial resistance claims the lives of 5,000 people a year in the UK, though experts have argued the real figure is at least double that. Getting global figures on the problem is difficult but reliable estimates suggest 700,000 are already dying each year – one person a minute.Lord O’Neill also attacked the major pharmaceutical companies for doing little to counter the problem, despite signing up to the Davos Declaration in 2015, where they pledged to combat the threat.He wrote: “Since then, no major pharmaceutical company has taken any fresh action.”Lord O’Neill said that since investigating the issue the number of reports of antibiotic resistance was rising faster and “in more places than we ever dreamt of.”.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}There has been a lot of talk, but no action.Lord O\u0026#x27NeillIn addition to the ‘super gonorrhoea’ case the PHE figures, obtained under a Freedom of Information request, show 29 people suffered from pan-drug-resistant-infections from Pseudomonas bacteria.Pseudomonas is a bug often found in soil or water (hospital sinks are tested for it) that usually affects people with a weaker immune system such as cancer patients, newborn babies, people with diabetes or patients with severe burns.Up to 11 per cent of Pseudomonas bacteria are now resistant to ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic commonly used in combination with others.A further six patients suffered pan-drug-resistant Klebsiella infections. New antibiotics to treat multi-drug-resistant Klebsiella infections were introduced last year in light of rising resistance, said Professor Peter Hawkey, a public health and bacteriology expert at the University of Birmingham. But they don’t work against every strain, he said.Antibiotic resistance | Global consumption fuels spread of superbugsProf Hawkey added that the cases show antimicrobial resistance is not a hypothetical or future threat but a real one currently affecting patients in British hospitals.These are organisms which are resistant to most antibiotics and then you’re in a tricky place, he said. The threat is very real. These figures are a wake up call,” he said.The pan-resistant infections recorded by PHE were from gram negative bacteria: rod-shaped bugs with thinner cell walls than their gram positive counterparts.Gram negative bacteria, some of which live in the human gut, are fast becoming resistant to antibiotics and are known as an emerging global threat. The government aims to halve the number of healthcare-associated gram-negative bloodstream infections by 2021.Prof Hawkey said pan-drug-resistant-infections are much more common in other areas of the world with lax surveillance and poor infection control, and these will spread to Britain.He said: With huge movement in populations people are coming back to the UK with these bugs in their guts. If you get it and you’re given the wrong antibiotic, you will die.Dr Susan Hopkins, deputy director for AMR and healthcare acquired infections at Public Health England, said: “While there is only a small number of bacteria identified that were resistant to a number of treatments in recent years, they serve as an example of the threat antibiotic resistance poses to public health.Madlen Davies is a reporter with the Bureau of Investigative JournalismProtect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security The end of the 68 year conflict between North and South Korea?Lawyer at Trump Tower meeting reportedly worked with Russian government Donald Trump says Germany must pay more for defence amid Nato spending tensionsComment: Virtual reality is escapism with no way outLondon theatre: the 26 best plays and shows on nowDonald Trump claims credit for Korean summit while world leaders express cautious optimismPlan to rescue UK high streets from decline successfully trialled in BelgiumRBS urged to reverse branch closures after profits trebleAmber Rudd under fire about migrant removal targetsOn this day in 1984: The Libyan embassy siege, triggered by the murder of Yvonne Fletcher, endsComment: This Korean breakthrough shows the time is right for Donald Trump\u0026#39s crass diplomacyTwo men struck by a car outside Birmingham mosqueBill Gates launches hunt for holy grail in flu fightKhalifa Haftar makes triumphant return to Libya after rumours of his deathTeenager Natalie Cormack falls to her death from Magaluf balconyBarn conversions pushing bats into churches, bishop says Prince Louis is named after his grandfather and great-grandfather\u0026#39s mentor, Lord Louis MountbattenWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"nature highlights national geographic travel photographer year","story":"A leaping leopard and a crowd of crocodiles are among the stunning photos released from the Nature section of the 2018 National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year contest.

Two young men have been injured quite badly and it\u0027s caused a lot of tension within the local community at present.Clearly there is a need for calm.The police need to be allowed to conduct their investigations and personally I would urge anyone who knows anything about what has happened to contact the police.Law and orderThe end of the 68 year conflict between North and South Korea?Lawyer at Trump Tower meeting reportedly worked with Russian government Donald Trump says Germany must pay more for defence amid Nato spending tensionsComment: Virtual reality is escapism with no way outLondon theatre: the 26 best plays and shows on nowDonald Trump claims credit for Korean summit while world leaders express cautious optimismPlan to rescue UK high streets from decline successfully trialled in BelgiumRBS urged to reverse branch closures after profits trebleAmber Rudd under fire about migrant removal targetsOn this day in 1984: The Libyan embassy siege, triggered by the murder of Yvonne Fletcher, endsComment: This Korean breakthrough shows the time is right for Donald Trump\u0026#39s crass diplomacyBill Gates launches hunt for holy grail in flu fightKhalifa Haftar makes triumphant return to Libya after rumours of his deathTeenager Natalie Cormack falls to her death from Magaluf balconyBarn conversions pushing bats into churches, bishop says Prince Louis is named after his grandfather and great-grandfather\u0026#39s mentor, Lord Louis MountbattenGrim down south: Southern England could become wetter than the North and Scotland, Met Office saysWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"virtual reality escapism no way","story":"Virtual reality: the possibility of getting lost in imagined worlds is now a realityI’m standing in a snowy gorge.

Parents were yelling at the projectionist to stop, covering their kids’ eyes and ears. A few went out to get a staff member but she was overwhelmed and didn’t really know what to do.

Possibly complicating matters was the fact that Denzel Washington was sitting next to him at the table.“When someone says you’re like your idol,” Jordan said, “It’s like: ‘Really? You see that in me?’ I’d only done that one movie. But then I started using it as motivation,” he said. “I wanted to pop up on Denzel’s radar. He’s the OG. If I could get recognition from him, I know I’m going down the right path, you know?”Denzel: We’re only getting further apart in this technological ageFinally, Washington broke in with a booming laugh: “And here we are, Mike! Looks like it’s working out already,” he said.In truth, it would be hard for an actor to choose a better role model than Washington. In a career ning more than 40 years and 50 films – and kicked off by the hit TV drama St Elsewhere – Washington, 63, has been nominated for nine Academy Awards. He won twice: for best actor as a terrifying rogue cop in Training Day and for best supporting actor as a Union soldier in an African-American army unit in Glory. And he was nominated for best actor Oscars in both of the past two years.Jordan (left, with Kevin Durand) in the 2013’s ‘Fruitvale Station’ (Weinstein Company)In the past decade, Washington has ruled the stage, too. He won a Tony Award for best actor in the revival of August Wilson’s Fences in 2010, later directing and starring in an Oscar-nominated film version. He led the acclaimed revival of A Raisin in the Sun in 2014. And today (26 April), he will open again on Broadway in a revival of Eugene O’Neill’s play The Iceman Cometh, a searing and (at four hours long) monumental drama about the lies we tell ourselves to get through life.Like Washington, Jordan, 31, got his big break on television: on HBO’s The Wire, when he was just 15. After his heartbreaking performance in Fruitvale Station, about the last day in the life of a transit-police shooting victim, he starred in the popular Rocky reboot Creed. And this year, he played the villain, Erik Killmonger, in the Marvel juggernaut Black Panther, winning perhaps the best reviews of anyone in the extremely well-reviewed cast.Next month, he stars in Fahrenheit 451 on HBO, a dystopian film based on the novel by Ray Bradbury. Jordan plays a “fireman,” part of a state-sanctioned brigade that hunts down readers and burns books. His company, Outlier Society Productions, is one of the film’s producers and also among the first to adopt inclusion riders, requiring ersity among cast and crew, as called for by Frances McDormand from the stage of this year’s Academy Awards.Over a cocktail hour at the Lambs Club in Manhattan (a Diet Coke for Washington, a sauvignon blanc for Jordan), the actors traded notes about creating characters and the socially minded work that really matters to them. These are excerpts from the conversation.Galanes: If Mike reminds people of a young Denzel, who did young Denzel remind people of?Washington: I never saw it that way. I never even thought about movie stars. My goal was to be on Broadway, to earn $650 a week. My hero was James Earl Jones. And I came to acting green. I was taking pre-law courses, then journalism courses. Then I took an acting class and got bit by the bug. So I came down to Lincoln Centre and saw plays and stage actors.Galanes: But all those things you did – law, journalism, acting – they’re all about getting to the bottom of a story, right?Washington: I like that part: building a character. You start with the material that gives you clues. If you’re playing a boxer, you want to throw out punches. If you’re playing a conductor, you want to get on a train.Galanes: And the script?Washington: Sure, but you don’t know who the character is just by reading the script. I don’t read a script and go, “Now, I get it!” That’s just the beginning. The first thread you pull.Jordan: The script tells you what’s going up on screen. But the biggest part, the fun part, is figuring out what happened to that character before page one of the script. What kind of food does he like? Did he get into fights going to school? That back story determines the choices you make within the confines of the script. And going through that process with the director is a big part of the collaboration. Now I’ve got notebooks and notebooks of back stories. Some directors may want you to add something or change your version. That’s when you try to find common ground.Washington won an Oscar for his role as rogue cop Alonzo in 2001’s ‘Training Day’ (Warner Bros)Galanes: Is that why you’ve both worked with directors repeatedly? Mike with Ryan Coogler Denzel with Spike Lee and Antoine Fuqua. Your common ground?Washington (laughing): Maybe they’re the ones who called. What you’re saying is part of it, but I don’t think it’s just one way.Jordan: Those are the roles I was lucky enough to get. Ryan and I have worked together three times, and I have a really close relationship with him. But I said no to lots of other things with other people in between. They weren’t right. Personally, I think you’re defined by what you say no to.Washington: I say yes to everything!Galanes: Why do I doubt that? Managing a career as big as yours must take a lot of work.Washington: Not now. Maybe early on. Now, I just do what I want to do. And you don’t want to walk down the same road twice. I’m sure after doing Iceman Cometh, I won’t be looking to do another play.Washington: Yeah, not for a while.Galanes: You’re too young to remember this, Mike. But early in his career, Denzel was so beloved for playing good guys – in Glory and Cry Freedom – that we all freaked out when he started playing villains: in Training Day, American Gangster. And he was even better at bad guys! Was that about walking down different roads?Playing Killmonger (right) in ‘Black Panther’ brought rave reviews for Jordan (MarvelDisney)Jordan: So much trickles down from the director. That’s why I try to choose the ones who make the best environments to work in, so we can maybe make something as good as Training Day. You don’t want to go into a project with somebody who won’t be helpful to your process – or vice versa.Galanes: I read this funny thing about you, Mike: you started choosing projects where you wouldn’t die in the end?Jordan: It started with my mom, who’s super emotional. When I shot my death scene in The Wire, she was on set. And the PAs kept coming to me and saying: ‘You may want to check on your mom.’ I go see her, and she’s sitting there bawling. I’m just a kid. I’m going, ‘Come on, Ma. You’re embarrassing me.’ And after Fruitvale Station, I was like, ‘Man, this is really affecting her.’ But there was another thing, too. Look at Denzel’s career. I want people to see me win. I want audiences to see me ending up on top – not dying. I want to be the leading man.Washington: Man, I got underwear older than that.Jordan: That was the real thought process: How do I become a leading man? I know phenomenal actors who can’t open movies overseas. How do you become the guy who can carry a film?Washington: So, you study the game?Galanes Is that why you went down the superhero route?Galanes You probably made up for it with Black Panther. Why no superheroes for you, Denzel?Galanes: Superheroes have changed. When Denzel might have played one, they were dull. The villains were interesting: Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger. Like you in Black Panther, Mike.Washington: When I was a teenager, Shaft and Super Fly, those were our superheroes. I remember watching Super Fly with my boy Carl, and when we got back to the projects, he carved the character’s name – Priest – on the elevator door. And Richard Roundtree in those long leather coats in Shaft.Galanes: Both of your new projects are dark. Iceman Cometh is brutal. And in Fahrenheit 451, competing ideas are so scary that people decide to burn all the books and kill the readers. Why choose them now?27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 Galanes: It’s powerful to watch a black man in your role.Jordan: But it wasn’t all there on the page. I needed to make sure that he was willing to collaborate, to change some things to help me, as a black man, feel more comfortable in that role. And my company’s co-producing it alongside HBO was important to me too. This is my first time working with the director and the network, giving my opinion and hoping that it’s taken seriously.Washington (laughing): Getting your big boy voice.Galanes Like coming back to the stage, Denzel?Washington: Yeah. Then we boiled it down to Iceman and King Lear. And he said: ‘Let’s do Lear five years from now.’ I said: “OK, we’ll do that next – God willing.”Washington: Eugene O’Neill. That simple. The chance to interpret his brilliant material. You know, my first role on stage, when I was a student at Fordham, was in The Emperor Jones. I’ve always loved O’Neill. And here I am, 40 years later, coming back to him in Iceman.Galanes: Your character, Hickey, seems like the life of the party at first, but what a tortured soul he turns out to be. What drew you to him?Washington: His desire to see people happy. Even when he knows he can’t make that happen, that desire is still there in him.Galanes: It’s a mountain of a play – four hours long. Is it hard to maintain that intensity every night?‘Fahrenheit 451’ sees Jordan plays a ‘fireman’, part of a state-sanctioned brigade that hunts down readers and burns books (HBO)Washington: Listen, this is what I love: acting on stage. And I don’t have to do anything else. Just be in this play. So, don’t feel sorry for me compared to most workers in America.Galanes: Is theatre on your radar, Mike?Jordan: Down the line. But right now, I want to take care of my family financially and grow my production company. That’s the big thing I want to do: set my family up.Jordan: As a kid, you don’t see your circumstances. I didn’t. It’s not until you look back and think, ‘Man, we were poor!’ My parents really hid that from me. They kept me safe.Washington: It wasn’t that tough. I was having a good time. A lot of my boys went to prison.Jordan: That’s why I want to take care of my family now. Then let me go and work on my craft, do something to fulfil me on the inside. That’s what I think theatre is going to be for me – when I’m older. What do you love about it, Denzel?Washington: The energy from the audience is immediate. And you get to develop a full life. See, in film, you might shoot the end first, then the middle. But on stage, it’s the full score of the character’s life. And you always get another night.Washington: In film, you don’t get another night to shoot a scene. You can try to fix it in other scenes. But film is a director’s medium. Theatre is for actors. We’re directed, but once the curtain goes up, it belongs to us. And every night’s as different as the audience. Some nights, they cheer the whole way through others, they don’t cheer at all.Galanes: Let me shift gears. We’re living through a time right now where men in power who’ve done ugly things –Washington: No. We’re not ‘living through a time right now’. It’s always been this way, from the beginning of time. Pick one: from Caesar to Caligula. Now, it’s just on the news cycle every 15 seconds.Jordan: And opinion is now fact – because anyone with a Twitter handle can say it.Washington: It doesn’t even have to be true it just has to be first.Galanes: Hang on, I’m asking something different: Based on your years as a powerful figure, why do you think some guys turn to ugly behaviour, and others don’t?Washington: Nobody’s perfect, man. Don’t put me on a pedestal, if that’s what you’re trying to do. I’m just a human being. I made mistakes I’ll make some more. Hopefully, you learn from them. My mother always said, ‘Keep it simple.’ The older I get, the more I understand her: cut away the fat. When you’re younger, you want to see, taste, touch.Washington (laughing): There you have it. But when you get to be my age, you learn you don’t have to. I have a beautiful wife, beautiful children, a great job. What more do I need?Jordan: And people like us, actors of colour, we don’t get a lot of second chances. It’s a different type of scrutiny. Knowing it’s not all fair and equal, you’ve got to make smart decisions in the moment.Washington: I remember going home one time and saying to my mother, ‘Hey, Ma, did you ever think that I...’ And she said: ‘Stop right there! Do you know all the people who’ve been praying for your raggedy butt?’ You don’t get there by yourself.Jordan: That’s crazy! I was just thinking: I’m going to church in the morning – because I know the people there have always prayed for me. Their blessings have protected me from terrible situations. That’s how I think about keeping it simple: remembering where it started – that village, that tribe that kept you safe.Galanes: And it was 38 years between Sidney Poitier’s Oscar for best actor and yours.Galanes: How about opportunities for people of colour?Washington: That’s why I’m here! That’s why I’m still in the race. And I’m passing the baton. What a lot of people don’t know is: when you pass the baton, you keep running behind the other runner, you don’t just stop. I’m like, ‘Make the turn, bring it home!’ I like helping people. I want to see them do well.Black Panther star reveals Denzel Washington paid for his acting classDenzel schools journalist with response to \u0027fake news\u0027 questionHow to stop Denzel Washington stealing your sceneJordan: That’s why I want to produce so much. I like creating opportunities for people.Galanes: You were right out of the gate on inclusion riders, Mike.

The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship“We are going after the money,” Boris Johnson promised after being questioned on the absence of specific measures to impose sanctions and financial penalties on the UK assets of Russian oligarchs closely aligned to President Putin. But when pressed by MPs on why decisive action was not being taken, the foreign secretary replied: “This is not a country where we in the government can say ‘Oi! We think this so-and-so deserves to have his or her collar felt’. This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Potentially, millions of customers could be affected by uncertainty and disruption.“It simply isn’t good enough to expose customers to IT failures, including delays in paying bills and an inability to access their own money.”A spokesperson for the Financial Conduct Authority said on Tuesday that the watchdog was “aware of the issue and liaising with the firm”. A spokesperson for the Information Commissioner’s Office said: “We are aware of a potential data breach in relation to the TSB and are making enquiries.”Mr Pester said on Tuesday that he was “truly sorry” about the problems caused. “We’re still seeing issues with access to our digital services,” he added. “One of the steps we need to take to resolve this is to take our mobile app and online banking down for a few hours.“We did this at around 10.30 this morning and we hope to be back up later this afternoon.”The problems stemmed from a switch to a new online banking system.

But this will not work. The UK has decided to withdraw from the Union. It wants to be sovereign and be able to set its own rulebook, to have its own supervision and enforcement system.“In doing so, the UK will move away from EU rules. It will not accept common EU supervision and enforcement tools. These are precisely the essential building blocks of our post-crisis financial regulation. They ensure that the internal market can exist and function correctly.‘Everything must change so that everything can stay the same’, to paraphrase Lampedusa. But this will not work.“The EU understands that the UK does not want to become a \u0027rule-taker\u0027. But the UK also needs to understand that the EU cannot accept mutual market access without the common safeguards that underpin it.”Mr Barnier added that relying on Britain to regulate services sold into EU markets was “not something that any country in the world would accept”. He described Brexit as “a lose-lose situation”, telling his audience: “I do not see added value in Brexit and so far, nobody has shown us any.”“Outside of the customs union and the single market, there can be no frictionless trade. Businesses will be faced with non-tariff barriers and border checks that do not exist today,” the chief negotiator warned.Allowing British firms to sell services into the EU is crucial for the UK because around 80 per cent of the British economy comes from providing services, with about 43 per cent of British exports heading to the EU in 2016. The Government has said it want any trade deal with the EU to cover services.Speaking at the same event Mr Barnier said the cost of Brexit “will be substantially higher for the UK than for the EU”, noting that in terms of “trade dependency” the EU27 accounts for around 50 per cent of UK export and imports, while the UK market accounts for 7 per cent of EU exports and 4 per cent of imports. Theresa May has asked for the EU and UK to mutually recognise each others\u0027 rules and regulations as adequate (AP)The Brussels Brexit chief also brushed away claims by British commentators that European businesses desperately needs the City of London for finance. He cited research by the European Central Bank that any problem caused by losing access to London\u0027s banks appears limited and said the claim was not what we hear from market participants, and is not the analysis that we have made ourselves.In her Mansion House speech last month Ms May called for a “comprehensive system of mutual recognition” where both blocs pledged to keep their regulations equivalent to one another to facilitate trade.

Both the president and Mr Pompeo have heaped disdain on the agreement, and Mr Trump said in January that he was agreeing to waive some sanctions “only in order to secure our European allies’ agreement to fix the terrible flaws of the Iran nuclear deal”.“This is a last chance. In the absence of such an agreement, the United States will not again waive sanctions in order to stay in the Iran nuclear deal”, Mr Trump said at the time.During a visit to Washington this week, French president Emmanuel Macron worked to persuade Donald Trump to preserve the deal. But Mr Macron conceded he faced slim odds of succeeding.“My view – I don’t know what your president will decide – is that he will get rid of this deal on his own, for domestic reasons,” Mr Macron told reporters.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

People will then rightly ask in what way we have left the EU. This debate is simply an attempt to frustrate Brexit and undermine the referendum result.\u0026ldquoIf we do not leave the Customs Union, there is no point in leaving the EU. Being \u0026lsquoout\u0026rsquo of the EU but having to abide by its tariffs and being unable to strike new trade deals with the rest of the world defies logic.\u0026ldquoThe North of England economy is worth over \u0026pound300bn and makes up 19 per cent of total UK output, but it has the potential to be so much more after Brexit, as long as we leave the Customs Union.\u0026ldquoWith 90 per cent of global growth over the next 10-15 years set to be from non-EU countries, it makes no sense to lock ourselves out of these lucrative markets.\u0026ldquoPolicy North has proposed establishing free ports in the North post Brexit.

the UK economy \u0026pound24 billion by 2033.Sir Keir said: Over the past few weeks it has become abundantly clear that Theresa May is unwilling and unable to put the country\u0027s interests first during the Brexit negotiations.She has wasted 12 weeks of the Brexit negotiations delaying a Commons vote on the UK negotiating a customs union with the EU for fear of a defeat.In light of the Government\u0027s own impact assessments and the lack of progress on any new trade deals, any economic case for ruling out a customs union has collapsed.The Prime Minister is now solely focused on internal party management and masking the isions within her government.But Brexit minister Suella Braverman said Labour\u0027s support for a customs union would leave the UK shackled to Brussels, taking rules set by the EU and unable to strike trade deals.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has backed a customs union but only if the UK had a say in future EU trade deals.Mrs Braverman said: The supposed safeguards that Corbyn talks about are impossible to achieve and will get laughed out of town.She said Labour was more interested in frustrating the process and playing politics than they are in delivering a successful Brexit.Labour Home Affairs Committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper and Treasury select committee chairwoman Ms Morgan said in a joint statement: We both believe the case for a

It said there were 12,503 enforced returns in 2016-17, which was considered a \u0026ldquosuccess given the particularly damaging impact from the number of late claims for asylum.The memo goes on: \u0026ldquoIE has set a target of achieving 12,800 enforced returns in 2017-18, aided by the redistribution of resources towards this area.\u0026nbspThe memo then turns to \u0026ldquoassisted returns which covers cases such as those where an inidual has left the country voluntarily on a flight paid for by the British Government.\u0026ldquoTypically these will be our most vulnerable returnees.

By 9am on April 29, Scotland will have seen a sprinkling of the white stuff after it moves down from the north coast.By the next day, snow is predicted to hit the North Pennines in northern England and southern Scotland.And by Monday temperatures will drop far enough for snow to fall on high ground over the North and South Downs.The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for Eastern and Southeastern England for heavy rain and flooding on April 29.Meteorologists are forecasting downpours of up to 70mm in places accompanied by strong to gale force Northerly winds, while homes and businesses have been put on guard for risk of flooding.But the sunny weather is expected to return later in May bringing the temperatures back above average for the time of year.Thursday April 19 was the hottest day in April since 1949.It was the warmest day of 2018 so far with highs of 29C.Forecasters are predicting a hotter than average June, July and August.The Weather Channel’s Leon Brown said: Glorious blue skies and 30C are expected by June thanks to warm air flowing from the continent.Last weeks heatwave saw the 2018 London Marathon as the hottest on record with 40,000 runners battling 24C temperatures.Bookmaker Coral has even slashed the odds on this month to be the hottest April ever.Another mini-heatwave is sweeping across with 23C forecast just in time for the May Bank Holiday.In contrast to the loathed Beast from the East, the Beauty from the East will see a high pressure front, bringing warmer air from the east to the west.Brian Gaze from Weather Outlook said: We could see temperatures picking back up from the Bank Holiday weekend, in the second week of May.Theres a chance of high pressure blowing over continental Europe, that could lead to warm air settling in the South East of England.My view is that its possible that we could see temperatures of up to 23C, with the warmer spell lasting between three to five days.The World Meteorological Organisation definition of a heatwave is when the daily maximum temperature of more than five consecutive days exceeds the average maximum temperature by 5 °C, the normal period being 1961-1990.They are most common in summer when high pressure develops across an area.High pressure systems are slow moving and can persist over an area for a prolonged period of time such as days or weeks.They can occur in the UK due to the location of the jet stream, which is usually to the north of the UK in the summer.This can allow high pressure to develop over the UK resulting in persistent dry and settled weather.The scorching summer of 1976 was the hottest summer since records began.It led to a severe drought owing to the exceptionally dry conditions, although it is thought that 1995 was drier.In the summer of 1976, Heathrow had 16 consecutive days over 30C from June 23 to July 8, and for 15 consecutive days from June 23 to July 7 temperatures reached 32.2C somewhere in England.But the single hottest temperature of 38.5C was set on August 10, 2003.When the mercury shoots up there are several obvious precautions to take.It is advised to make sure you drink a lot of water to make sure you stay hydrated during the hot spell.Keeping a bottle of sunscreen with you to soak up those UV rays is also highly advisable as is ensuring you have a hat to prevent sunstroke.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Creative types, often, who need to express their admiration through the medium of song and dance and an Asian drumming accompaniment.So you end up, on Saturday night, with Tom Jones doing a bhangra version of It’s Not Unusual, which, if you didn’t see it, is about as easy on the ear as the next fight in a Cardiff balti house.If you did, then seriously well done. You made it through the first ten minutes of The Queen’s Birthday Party live from the Albert Hall. A Zoe Ball-hosted event which, straight off the bat, I have to say, was far from being the worst royal entertainment show ever. How could it be when the diamond jubilee flotilla is still so fresh in the memory?It’s still the oddest thing I’ve watched this year, though, and has been top of my to-do list ever since I saw the line-up featured Shawn Mendes, Anne-Marie, Craig David and Kylie Minogue.Names that should strike you (if we dismiss the vague Commonwealth theme) as the most random bookings of all time, considering this was meant to be a 92-year-old woman’s birthday party.The strange thing is, though, they’re not. Someone actually planned it that way, because they’ve all got a new product to flog and were therefore considered entirely appropriate for the occasion.If this sort of brainless commercialism is one of the great enemies of light entertainment, then the other is definitely excessive political correctness, and both probably explain the presence of Jamaican rapper Shaggy, alongside Sting, singing at the Queen: “Don’t make me wait, don’t make me wait. To love you, to love, to love you. A wah mi say.”There was a lot of audience participation involved here as well and it would, in the normal run of things, have been the weirdest combination you’d expect to see in a good many months.Here, though, it was only five minutes before I saw something much weirder. Frank Skinner, Harry Hill and former Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls joining in a mass banjolele thrash to When I’m Cleaning Windows, by George Formby. Contrary to what some might think, it went down a royal storm as well and should probably have ended the night right there and then.It’s the way of these things, though, that there was still another 71 minutes to fill with more song and dance and the most ethnically diverse primary school children the BBC’s child catcher could find, whose understanding of the Queen was meant to be engagingly nutty but was actually a lot less cuckoo than the production team’s.Only two moments are really worth recording for posterity, though.The first was an out-of-control Tom Chambers nearly skidding into row F during his Fred Astaire routine. The second was the reappearance of Shaggy performing Mr Boombastic. I’d have killed, at that point, for a cutaway shot of Meghan Markle, Camilla and the royal party, who spent most of the night wearing painfully awkward smiles, but the BBC had wisely abandoned them by then and, anyway, the Queen was already making her way down to greet the ensemble cast.You or I, in that situation, might have asked them: “What the f***?” Or suggested “Just renew the Racing Post subscription next year.”CERTAIN things happened during the latest episode of ITV’s Last Laugh In Vegas that I don’t wish to dwell upon, mainly involving Bobby Crush and a drag act called Larry, who impersonates Tina Turner, in the cruiser-weight division.A mercifully brief coupling that wasn’t helped by Bobby’s assurance he has a more specific type – “think Dermot O’Leary” – or Su Pollard adding: “He’s called Crush for a reason, you know.”The great thing about this series, though, is that other stuff keeps happening to distract you, whether it’s goat yoga in the mansion’s back yard, Kenny Lynch hitting the bottle on board the High Roller ferris wheel, or Anita Harris admitting, out loud: “I never thought I’d come to Las Vegas and Bernie Clifton would pull my knickers down.” Which was due to the weather, rather than any ostrich-bothering nonsense.You still fear for the showbiz veterans, of course, at their forthcoming Vegas gig (ITV 9pm, tonight). If there’s one member of the troupe who can come out of all this madness with his reputation enhanced, though, it’s comedian Mick Miller who was thrown into a local comedy club bear pit last week.Full of young and drunk millennials, he could quite easily have been eaten alive, but ever the pro, Mick had them in his grasp from the moment he greeted them with: “I know what you’re thinking.“Hulk Hogan’s let himself go.”He is, as Vegas comedy legend Frankie Scinta so eloquently observed: “One funny bastard.”It’s just a shame Mick doesn’t rant aimlessly about Brexit and Donald Trump, or he could have a real future in British TV comedy.THIS week’s winner is Danniella Westbrook at the Grand National and Quark the Ferengi from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.Sent in by David Hope of Darlington. Picture research: Alfie Snelling.BACK in 2009, John Prescott proudly exclaimed: “I was born in Wales, I went to school in Wales, my mother’s Welsh, I’m Welsh. It’s my country.”Nine years, though, is a long time in politics.So these days you’ll find him, above, parping round Yorkshire, to the sound of a brass band, declaring: “I love Yorkshire, it’s the place that made me.”Which is just as well, really, as Channel 5 has hired him to visit some of the county’s most famous food-processing plants on Made In Yorkshire, where he makes a gigantic bollocks of everything. Pies, sausages, chocolates, small talk, a lot of his sentences and quite a few of his questions.“Dried pea crumb. Is it actual dried peas?”“Yes it is.”Given his age and the relative safety of retirement, there should by now be a certain Magooish charm about Prezza, but there’s nothing of the sort evident on this show.Part of this is down to the fact he remains such a disagreeable, insecure, chippy old sod. The thing that really gets me about him, though, is for all his socialist man-of-the-people routine, no one loves pulling establishment rank more than Prezza.As His Lordship took just 6.37 seconds to remind us, on Tuesday’s Made In Yorkshire: “My official title is Baron Prescott of Kingston-upon-Hull . . . but you can call me John.” I can?Well that’s one hell of a gesture, I think you’ll all agree. But I still stick with Baron Bone Brain, if it’s OK with you, John.Ben: “San? . . . Francisco?”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Commonly associated with the popular image of cowboys, a ten-gallon is a style of what?”Aine: “Whisky.”Bradley Walsh: “On a regular clock what number lies directly opposite four?”June: “Eight.”And Bradley Walsh: “The name of what custard and sponge dessert is a word for a small amount?”Emily: “The little finger.”Harry Hill’s brilliant Alien Fun Capsule, featuring “the motorised, sideways Garry Hobbs”.BBC1’s epic Stephen Lawrence: The Murder That Changed A Nation highlighting the work of DCI Clive Driscoll, who deserves a drama made in his honour.Mick Miller on Last Laugh In Vegas. The opening ten minutes of GMB, every Monday to Wednesday, with Susanna and Piers.And Have I Got News For You actually daring to poke fun at Diane Abbott, without the BBC’s entire world collapsing.Though, I’m pleased to say, the biggest laugh of Friday night’s show was reserved for The Sun’s headline on Amber Rudd’s handling of the Windrush scandal: “Ship for brains.”This Morning, Eamonn Holmes on the pressures of international mega-stardom: “I always get this when I go to the fish and chip shop. People say ‘What are you doing here?’ Chips, that’s what I’m doing here.”Yeah, but for the third time since lunch?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some are invisible.It is true there are booths in places, but these are mainly concerned with ensuring foreign vehicles have purchased Swiss road discs. The customs posts date from a time when exporters couldn’t file their declarations online.The Swiss border is crossed by around 2.4million people every day — a colossal figure for a country with a population of just 8.4million.And 440,000 Swiss citizens live in the EU — a much higher proportion than the 1.2million Brits who do so.Switzerland also manages to sell more than five times as much per head to the EU as Britain does.But here is the thing. Switzerland is outside the EU’s customs union — and almost no one there wants to join it.Switzerland is the answer to those who say the customs union is the best way of preventing an intrusive border in Ireland.Or rather, it is half the answer. The other half is Turkey.Turkey is the only country, apart from microstates like Monaco, that is in the customs union while remaining outside the EU. Yet its frontier is far more heavily policed than the Swiss one.In other words, being in the customs union does not make borders vanish.But if we are looking to make the frontier as unobtrusive as possible, Switzerland is the best place to start.Its free-movement agreement with its neighbours is similar to the one that exists between the UK and Ireland.Indeed, things should be easier in Ireland. Every day, 23,000 lorries carry a million euros’ worth of goods across the Swiss-EU border.By contrast, more than 90 per cent of trade between the UK and Ireland is East-West rather than North-South.Of course, the way to avoid checks in Ireland is to have a comprehensive trade agreement between Britain and the EU that provides for mutual recognition. This is what Theresa May has been after from the beginning.So why are Europhiles here working with Brussels to turn Ireland into an obstacle to such a deal?Surely both Remainers and Leavers should want the fullest trade deal possible with our neighbours?There are different motives at work, some of them ugly. Eurocrats evidently believe that if Brexit is made hard enough, we will somehow drop the whole idea.Failing that, they want to keep us locked into their trade arrangements because, as the BBC’s Katya Adler put it, they are “terrified” of having a “super-competitive country” next door.Some Remainers in Parliament intend to reverse the referendum. “Look,” they aim to say, “the trade deal Leavers promised isn’t on offer. It’s time to think again.”Of course, it is their own behaviour making Brussels hang back. Why sign a comprehensive free-trade agreement when the British Parliament might give them something far better — permanent British subjugation to EU rules?Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is reported to have said privately that unless we leave the customs union and recover our right to make independent trade deals, Brexit isn’t worth doing.He is dead right. Some people see staying in the customs union as a kind of halfway house. If that were true, it might make sense.The vote, after all, was a narrow one. We should be looking for compromises — remaining in some EU programmes, allowing EU nationals to take up job offers, maybe rejoining the European Free Trade Association.But staying in the customs union is not a compromise, like eating a medium-cooked burger when half the country wanted it well-done and the other half wanted it rare. It is more like tossing the burger into a bin and eating the napkin.As Lord Hill, our staunchly Remain former European Commissioner, points out, it would mean letting Brussels dictate our trade deals with non-EU countries without any say over those deals. In fact, it is worse even than that.If the EU agreed a trade deal with, say, the US, Britain would have to match whatever steps the EU 27 took — but the US would not be required to reciprocate.Labour knows this perfectly well. As its trade spokesman Barry Gardiner put it: “The EU could do a deal with another country — let’s say America — which we would be bound by in the UK.“We would have to accept the liberalisation of our markets. Why would America give us that access when it’s got all the liberalisation of our markets it wants?”Quite so, Barry.He said that, of course, before Labour saw an opportunity to embarrass the Government — or even trigger an early election — by switching its position.He now wants to keep an arrangement Jeremy Corbyn opposed as recently as January on the impeccable socialist grounds that the customs union “is protectionist against developing countries”.Indeed, Labour is bizarrely backing the one aspect of the EU it disliked all along, going right back to the 1950s.It wants to keep in place tariffs that not only harm many poor countries but also drive up the cost of food, clothing and footwear here, so hitting the low-income families Labour claims to champion.No other neighbouring country would accept such terms. Not the Swiss nor the Norwegians nor the Serbs nor the Albanians. Even Turkey’s membership of the customs union is only partial and was intended as a stepping stone to full membership.Ankara has been moaning about how it works for 20 years — and with justice.Labour, along with the Lib Dems, the SNP and some Tory rebels, is demanding a worse deal than any other country bordering the EU.We can’t blame eurocrats for taking advantage of our weakness. We should blame the British MPs and peers creating it.They have every right to try to soften Brexit. Instead, they are backing what they know to be a dud outcome in the hope of overturning the people’s vote.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Just look around you. We’ve had one for a while.And now the Government is trying to do something about it.Trouble is, it’s doing completely the WRONG thing.Acting on the advice of campaigners such as Jamie Oliver it plans to start clamping down on what it calls junk food.Under the proposals, buy one, get one free deals will be outlawed.That will make food a lot dearer for the poorest of us.Officials   may also extend the levy on sugary drinks. That will do the same thing.Another name for junk food is: “stuff middle class people don’t like very much”.And that’s the point. These nanny state initiatives always hurt the working class, not the middle classes.When they tried to stop us getting drunk all the time, they whacked a levy on cheap cider — not a bottle of Chablis.And yet alcoholism is just as bad within the better-off classes — just not as heavily reported.And now they’ve turned their attention to supposed junk food.But putting up the prices simply makes it harder for poor people to make ends meet.They are already suffering through low wages, partly the consequence of uncontrolled immigration.People, no matter how poor they are, know that it is not good to eat pizza every night of the week.Not many people do so. But the truth is that the food we eat today is no more fattening than the food we ate back in the 1970s, when everybody was as thin as a dieting whippet on Benzedrine.The real problem is a lack of exercise.People don’t get out any more. They don’t walk.They stay in their homes or drive their cars.Not so long ago the health lobbyists announced that everyone should do 40 minutes of walking per day because the results are so beneficial.But they had to reduce it to 20 minutes because everyone thought 40 minutes was way too onerous.A bit more education in our schools about the benefits of exercise wouldn’t go amiss.“Start Walking Or You’ll Die” would be a decent slogan.Might capture the interest.At the same time the health lobbyists also oppose what they call “fat-shaming”. And yet “fat-shaming” is a free, non-governmental means of persuading fat people not to be fat.I put on weight a few years back and it was only when my teenage son, in an argument, called me “a fat lardy-faced tosser” that I thought I ought to do something about it.Fat-shaming, you see — it works. If ­people think it’s OK to be fat they will stay fat.But leave our food alone. Don’t price the poorest of us out of the treats we all enjoy once in a while. And now I’m off for a walk because some of that weight has come back.How do I know? I told my wife I had a cut on my chin.And she looked at me and said: “Which one?”A GOVERNMENT ­scientist has been sacked for insulting his ­colleagues. He called one of them a “lardarse” and another a “f**kwit”.One bloke was the “Monster From Zagreb” while he was accused of calling another ­simply a “c**ksucker”. Top abuse! And I bet he had a point. The authorities wittered on about how he contravened their policies on bullying.Oh, spare us. If you can’t abuse your work ­colleagues, what fun is there in life?Another alleged insult was “vinegar t*ts”. I don’t know what it means, but I’m going to use it at every available opportunity.THERE are people out there who can show you racism in a handful of dust. They can ­conjure it up out of the air.They are usually idiots. Take the singer Raye, (nope, me neither) for example. She’s claimed a restaurant in London was “racist”.Her male friend, who is black, was refused entrance because of what he was wearing. Shorts and trainers.Listen love, that isn’t racism. That’s called a dress code. You want to eat in a posh restaurant? Then don’t dress like a toddler on his first trip to a paddling pool.Then there’s the BBC Proms. It’s in trouble for ­having cast a white woman to play the part of Maria in West Side Story.Maria is usually ­Hispanic. But if it’s OK to have a black actor playing ­Hamlet, why isn’t it OK to have a white woman ­playing Maria?The poor bloody actress, Sierra Boggess, has even been forced to apologise for having taken the part.And she’s pulled out.This shrieking obsession with race is divisive and stupid.This is to reflect the state’s “cultural ­identity”.If only the same thing would happen here . . . but don’t hold yer breath.THE Windrush fiasco has been hurtful to a generation of Caribbean people who came here, at our invitation, back between the 1940s and 1970s.It’s a genuine scandal. But look how the Lefties are trying to turn it into an assault on our immigration policies.Saying we must be less “hostile” to immigrants coming here now. Opening the borders.But the British public – including a majority of immigrants – still think there is far too much immigration to this country.And we are right to try to impose controls.As ever, never listen to the liberals.BRITISH students taking A levels were deeply confused by a mysterious object in the examination hall.It was circular, with numbers around the outside, and three hands pointing at the numbers. Teachers tried to explain to them: “It’s called a clock. You can tell the time by it. It will show you how long you have to go on your paper.”No use. The kids couldn’t make head nor tail of it.

If it is not received by 10/11/81 which is nearly two months, I shall increase it to £36.“If it is not received within 10 days I shall take legal advice. I hope it does not come to that for I have no desire to prosecute the BBC.”The newspaper article added that it appeared to work, saying that perhaps mindful of the fact his father Sir William was vice-chairman of the BBC, despatched a cheque.Asked about the incident by The Sun, Mr Rees-Mogg said: “The errors of my misspent youth…”Pressed on what he spent the money on when it finally arrived, he said unlike most teenagers: “I think I would have saved it rather than spent it.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000004307741.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"cop romp cell london","story":"The incident is said to have occurred at top security Charing Cross nick in London’s West End.The constable allegedly texted two PCs boasting of the romp.

We share the same blood.We are living with each other. We are brothers.”The Koreas said they hope the parties will be able to declare an official end to the war by the end of this year.Whats happened so far:He made history as he met with rival South Korean President Moon Jae-in for face-to-face talks on the southern side of the border.President Moon said that the two countries would work to re-unite families who had been separated by the decades long conflict as Kim did what his father and grandfather never managed.The dictator said his heart was throbbing as he became the first North Korean leader to cross the 38th parallel since the Korean War ended 65 years ago.The two heads of state had serious, frank discussions on the topic of denuclearising the peninsula during the first meeting on southern soil in more than six decades.Kim even quipped about his missile tests saying he wouldnt disturb the Souths early morning sleep anymore.Both parties are drawing up a joint statement due to be announced together at the close of the discussions which will be followed by a dinner, which would also be attended by Kims wife, Ri Sol Ju. When they met the smiling leaders, who seemed on the brink of war months ago, shook hands as each stood either side of the military demarcation line that bisects the rivals.As the sworn enemies came face-to-face for the first time in the border truce village of Panmunjom, Moon thanked him for making a very courageous decision to come to the South.In an unplanned move, the dictator then invited Moon to cross briefly north with him before they returned to the southern side - an incredible symbol of peace and unity between the warring nations.Moon then took Kims hand in his and led him along a red carpet into South Korean territory, where they were handed flowers by a boy and girl who live in the village.The pictures of them smiling and holding hands struck a stark contrast to the posturing and aggression of past decades.The two heads of state were then met by a South Korean honour guard in historical costumes, who performed an arirang - a traditional Korean folk song.Kim wore glasses and his trademark black Mao suit, while the rest of the North Korean delegation appeared in military uniforms or Western attire.He stopped to write in a guest book in the Souths Peace House before the two leaders met for a private discussion - aimed at ending their decades-long conflict.Signing and dating the entry, he said: A new history starts now. An age of peace, from the starting point of history.Kim: Im glad to meet you. Im so glad.Moon: Was there any difficulty coming here?Kim: Not at all.Moon: Its a pleasure to meet you.Kim: Indeed, Im so filled with excitement because of the meeting at this historic site. And I was truly moved that you have come all the way to receive me at the Military Demarcation Line at Panmunjom.Moon: It was your bold and courageous decision that has allowed us to come this far.Kim: No, no, not at all.Moon: We have made a historic moment.Kim: I am pleased to meet you.Moon: Would you please stand on this side.Kim steps across the Southern borderMoon: You have come to the south side, when will I be able to come to the North?Kim: Maybe this is the right time for you to enter the North Korean territory.Moon steps into the North before both re-enter South KoreaThe summit is the first between the two countries in over a decade and only third-ever between the sworn enemies - who are separated by a conflict that ended with a truce, not a treaty, meaning they are still technically at war.Minutes before Kim entered Peace House, a North Korean security team conducted a sweep for explosives and listening devices, and sprayed apparent disinfectant in the air, on the chairs, and on the guest book.During the discussion, Jong-un told his southern rival he was ready for heartfelt, sincere and honest talks, adding that he doesnt want repeat of past where we were unable to fulfill our agreements. As the talks began on Friday, the North Korean leader said: “As I walked over here, I thought, why was it so difficult to get here?“The separating line wasn’t even that high to cross. It was too easy to walk over that line and it took us 11 years to get here.”According to the official translation provided by the South Korean government, Jong-un also said during opening remarks, with the media present in the room:The expectations are high and we have learned a lesson from previous times and even if we have good agreements and implementations don’t follow they will disappoint people who had high expectations.I hope the 11 years have lost in the past until this time don’t go to waste, and we can meet more often and put our minds together and the 11 years will not be wasted.I hope to write a new chapter between us.I believe that we are able to make a new beginning, and it is with such commitment I come to this meeting.Moon is reported to have said in opening remarks:Spring (is) spreading in South Korea.I believe our encounter is extremely important for all of us. That of course means there is a huge burden on our shoulders.Comrade Kim, for the first time in our history you crossed the military demarcation line. It is no longer a symbol of division but a symbol of peace.I would like to pay tribute to the courageous and bold decision made by you, Chairman Kim.In parts shown on live TV, Kim joked that he hoped Moon would be able to enjoy North Koreas famous cold noodles, which were being brought to a banquet after the summit.But he could be heard turning to his sister - who was sitting to his left - and saying maybe I shouldnt have said (Pyongyang) was far.His younger sister Kim Yo Jong was the first member of the ruling North Korean family to travel to the South in early February for the Olympics.The Foreign Secretary told reporters at NATO headquarters Friday, I am very encouraged by whats happening.I dont think that anybody looking at the history of North Koreas plans to develop a nuclear weapon would want to be over-optimistic at this point.“But it is clearly good news that the two leaders are meeting.  Absolutely.USAThe White House said in a statement that it is hopeful that talks will achieve progress toward a future of peace and prosperity for the entire Korean Peninsula. ... (and) looks forward to continuing robust discussions in preparation for the planned meeting between President Donald J. Trump and Kim Jong Un in the coming weeks.ChinaForeign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters Beijing wishes that the meeting between the Norths leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in will achieve a positive result.JapanKatsunobu Kato, Japans minister for the abduction issue, says he hopes progress will be made at an upcoming summit that Kim is expected to hold with President Donald Trump.RussiaThe Kremlin on Friday hailed a historic summit between the leaders of North and South Korea as very positive news and said President Vladimir Putin had long advocated direct talks between the two countries.When asked about the prospect of U.S. President Donald Trump also meeting the North Korean leader, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call that Moscow welcomed any steps that would ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula.The only other North Korean official present was former intelligence chief Kim Yong Chol, the top official in charge of relations with the South.Moon in response said there were high expectations surrounding the summit and hoped they produce an agreement that would please the people of Koreas and also every peace-loving person in the world.The discussions also touched on the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong which was targeted by a North Korean artillery attack in 2010, killing four, according to Moon Jae-ins senior spokesman Moon told Kim he wished to travel in North Korea to visit Mount Paektu, near the countrys border with China, but Kim said under current conditions it would be uncomfortable due to the transport network.The pair then discussed high-speed train services, with Kim informing his rival his delegates had been impressed by the Souths bullet trains during their visit for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in February.A delighted Moon suggested the possibility of connecting the rail networks across borders if relations improve.The discussion went so well that by the time the pair broke for lunch, they had agreed to hold more meetings - with Kim offering to visit Seouls presidential Blue House.In a further show of peace, pine is said to symbolise strength and mindfulness in the Korean martial art of Tae Kwon Do as it grows strong roots below ground and a high above it.The United States is hopeful talks between Kim and Moon will make progress on achieving peace and prosperity, the White House said in a statement as the two men began their summit.The White House also said it looks forward to continuing discussions with South Korea in preparation for the planned meeting of Trump and Kim in the coming weeks.Just months ago, Trump and Kim were trading threats and insults as North Koreas rapid advances in pursuit of nuclear-armed missiles capable of hitting the United States raised fears of a fresh conflict on the Korean peninsula.Earlier on Friday, North Koreas official KCNA news agency said Kim would open-heartedly discuss with Moon Jae-in all the issues arising in improving inter-Korean relations and achieving peace, prosperity and reunification of the Korean peninsula.Just days before the summit, Kim said North Korea would suspend nuclear and long-range missile tests and dismantle its only known nuclear test site.Moon travelled to the meeting in a large motorcade, stopping briefly to greet dozens of summit supporters waving South Korean flags near the Blue House.Hundreds of demonstrators were seen gathering in downtown Seoul from early morning to protest or support the summit.Scepticism has been rampant about whether Kim is ready to abandon the hard-earned nuclear arsenal his country has defended and developed for decades as what it says is a necessary deterrent against US invasion.The two neighbours expect to release a joint statement late on Friday - possibly called the Panmunjom Declaration - that could address denuclearisation and peace, and an improvement in relations, South Korean officials said."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000401986482.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"kim jong un embarrassed about north korea","story":"This frank admission came as the communist dictator became the first leader to step into the capitalist South for 65 years in a bid to prevent war in the peninsula.Details of the historic talks have been emerging after Kim arrived at the truce village of Panmunjom to shake hands with his arch-rival President Moon Jae-in.Moons spokesman Yoon Young-chan says Kims comments over the state of his country came after the South Korean leader expressed a desire to travel North to visit Mount Paektu, which touches the countrys border with China.According Al Jazeera, Kim said: “I’d be honestly worried if you come, it might be embarrassing, the transportation is not good.”The dictator then referred to the South Korean KTX bullet train and said they didn’t have anything like that in North Korea.Kim then suggested if he visited he should probably come by air because the roads were “inconvenient”.But the comments about his countrys duff transport services are unlikely to be reported in North Korea.Citizens cannot view outside media and are bombarded with propaganda trumpeting how life in the hermit kingdom is better than any other on earth.But Moon said in response that North Koreans would be able to enjoy the Souths high-speed trains if the rivals improve relations and reconnect their rail networks across the border.North Korean roads are often bumpy and poorly maintained. Its train network is also way out of date compared to his neighbours state-of-the-art high-speed bullet trains. Kim earlier this month met with Chinas ambassador and visited a hospital where Chinese tourists were being treated after a deadly bus crash killed 32 in North Korea."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict0003203808611.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"madeleine mccann kidnap suspect slipped dad grab another girl","story":"The father, known only as Andres, says the alleged kidnapper sneaked into the room where his daughters aged five and 13 were sleeping during a holiday in 2001 - but escaped like an eel after a brief confrontation.He said he instantly recognised the man in the 2013 e-fit as the person who had gone into his daughters hotel room 12 years earlier.He told La Voz de Galicia: I dont know if the man kidnapped Madeleine, but for me his is the man who tried to take my daughter.Madeleine McCann was four-years-old when she disappeared from a hotel room in Praia da Luz, Portugal, while her parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, were out having dinner in May 2007.Madeleine, who would now be 14-years-old, nor her alleged kidnapper have been found despite an 11-year international search.Andres, 45, from Galicia, an autonomous region of Spain, told a local newspaper that the incident six years before still affects him.His family were driving through Portugal and ended up having to stay the night as a small hotel in Abrantes.He told the local paper that he and his wife were complimented on their beautiful girls as they arrived at the hotel by a man in his mid-40s.The dad claims the man was the only other guest at the hotel that night and that his family were split between two rooms.He says his oldest daughter called him in the middle of the night and asked him if he had just been in their room.The father hadnt but he went into his daughters room and stayed in there in case the man returned - which he did a few minutes later.He confronted the man who said he had come to check on the children.The dad added: Even today I dont know how he managed to escape me, he slipped like an eel.He claimed when he complained to the reception about the man he was told he was a regular guest who likes children but doesnt hurt them according to The Local.Andres was interviewed by both Spanish police and Scotland Yard, but says he never heard anything back from either.Maddies parents have been warned by cops not to discuss the disappearance of their daughter ahead of the 11th anniversary next week.Madeleine vanished on May 3, 2007.Her parents Gerry and Kate left their three children – including toddler twins Sean and Amelie – sleeping in their apartment while they dined at a tapas bar - 120 metres away.When Kate returned to check on the kids at around 10pm that evening, she discovered that Maddie was not in her bed and was missing.Police have spent more than £12million in the search for Madeleine."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict0004017757091.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"alfie evans tribute girl sings this is me","story":"Eleven-year-old Feefi Bennetts rendition of This Is Me from The Greatest Showman soundtrack has been viewed over half a million times since it was uploaded yesterday.During the performance Feefi says: “Alfie Evans we fight we fight for you.

Lead author Prof Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede from Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, said: “Parvalbumin collects up the ‘Parkinson’s protein’ and prevents it from aggregating, simply by aggregating itself first.”This prevents the protein, called alpha-synuclein, from forming harmful amyloid structures which can damage brain cells.Fish-rich diets have long been associated with fewer cases of degenerative brain conditions.
