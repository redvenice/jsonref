In 2017, after a  and ITV News undercover investigation raised questions about food standards, the company suspended production at its West Bromwich chicken plant for five weeks in order to deal with the problems. The company said at the time the closure would cost it up to £500,000 a week.United welcomed the move to close the Anglesey facility and predicted similar problems could arise throughout the meat processing sector.Bev Clarkson, Unite’s national officer for food, drink and agriculture, said: “The relaxation of social distancing has been brought in too soon we predicted a spike in the meat industry. You only have to look at what has happened in America and Germany to know that it would happen here.

The group’s Peter Jones shop in Chelsea, London, will also open on the same day. It will take the total number of its stores open to 22, nearly half of the group’s 50 outlets.Bérangère Michel, the director of customer service at John Lewis’s parent group, said: “The overwhelmingly positive feedback from both customers and partners on our first 13 department store reopenings this week has given us confidence to open in more locations.“We found that in some shops we were able to increase the number of customers and still maintain robust social distancing.”The company will provide hand sanitiser and limit the number of shoppers in store, in line with government guidelines for the reopening of non-essential retail in England during the coronavirus pandemic.Changing rooms will remain closed and beauty services are suspended but John Lewis said shoppers would be able to lie on beds and try on and test wipeable products such as sunglasses, prams and tech products.“Although we are not able to offer every single experience that we used to, we are still managing to offer customers a really varied shopping experience that is as close to normal and as enjoyable as we can possibly make it,” Michel said.The latest reopenings come as retailers hope shoppers will snap up summer stock that has been languishing in stores and warehouses throughout the sunny spring season after clothing and footwear retailers were forced to close their doors when the UK went into lockdown in March.While shoppers queued up at chains such as Primark, Zara and Sports Direct when stores reopened on Monday, it is clear that there has not been a sustained surge back to shopping centres and high streets this week.Department stores are expected to be among the slowest to recover from the downturn because their large shops rely on services including cafes and beauty treatments – which are still closed – to draw in the crowds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c0b5ee7f8f8123812a8015d386ebf89ca7ab391/0_71_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84d05535bdbf915cb7ac63831a4d3321","title":"three meat factories in england and wales closed over coronavirus","story":"More than 100 staff test positive in West Yorkshire, Anglesey and WrexhamThree large meat factories have closed in England and Wales after more than 100 workers tested positive for coronavirus.Mobile testing tents have been set up outside an Asda-owned meat processing site in Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire, after several workers fell ill with Covid-19.The Kober plant, which supplies bacon to Asda supermarkets, has closed until next week and around 100 contacts of workers have been traced. It was unclear on Friday how many workers had tested positive for the coronavirus.On Thursday the UK’s main supplier of supermarket chicken, 2 Sisters Food Group, said it was closing its huge Anglesey plant for 14 days after 58 people tested positive for coronavirus.In Wrexham, 38 staff have tested positive at Rowan Foods, which makes food for supermarkets across the UK. Bosses said the cases reflected an increase in the local area rather than a spread within the site.The cluster of new cases in meat processing plants will raise concerns about a potential outbreak similar to those seen in France and the US. In the latter, as many as 5,000 meat and poultry workers have contracted Covid-19, according to an estimate last month by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The confined working conditions and long periods spent by workers in close proximity – often 10 to 12 hours per shift – mean meat factories are at substantially heightened risk of spreading the coronavirus through human-to-human transmission, the CDC has said.Unions have said the living conditions of many low-paid workers in the factories is another contributing factor, as is time spent by colleagues in communal spaces such as locker rooms and shuttle buses.In the UK, four meat factories are reported to have been affected to date. Three workers died from coronavirus after a small outbreak at a meat processing plant in South Yorkshire last month.The family member of one of those who died accused Cranswick, the company that owns the plant, of failing to adequately protect workers, citing a lack of face masks, lack of physical distancing, and the provision of only the statutory sick pay of £95.85 a week for those too ill to work. Cranswick said it had rigorous cleaning procedures, that distancing had been in place in the plant since the middle of March, and that visors were now available for anyone who wanted to use them.A  analysis last month found that almost half of the Covid-19 hotspots in the US were linked to plants where poultry, pigs and cattle are slaughtered and packaged. The outbreaks led to calls for urgent reforms to an industry beset by health and safety issues.The United Food and Commercial Workers union said recently that at least 44 slaughterhouse workers in the US had died from the virus and another 3,000 had tested positive, lower than the CDC estimate.Public health officials in Germany are grappling with an outbreak among hundreds of workers at a meatpacking plant in Rheda-Wiedenbrueck. At least 730 workers have tested positive at the Toennies Group plant, it emerged on Thursday. Germany’s agriculture minister called for an official investigation into the outbreak."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdebc0aff7a9fb21747eafb0f09960b57587326f/0_118_3737_2242/master/3737.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8114be12987a0691aafa300787e45ec8","title":"labour report ed miliband","story":"People want fundamental change. Yet our new report shows they must believe we can deliver it• Ed Miliband is a former leader of the Labour partyThis is a moment of profound economic and social distress for the country. Bold action is desperately required to cope with the crisis. Yet we are six months on from another election that Labour lost badly.This is the backdrop for the Labour Together report on the 2019 defeat, which we are publishing tomorrow. Our report is clear that the party cannot abandon its commitment to bold economic transformation – indeed we believe there is a winning coalition to be built for it. To deliver that transformation, Labour must learn the deep lessons about why the public did not believe in the change we offered in 2019 and the deep roots of our defeat.There is a broad consensus about the immediate reasons for our defeat. Just like when I lost in 2015, issues of leadership mattered so, too, did the dramatic wedge that Brexit drove through our coalition and a sense that, whatever the popularity of inidual policies, our manifesto package as a whole was not seen as credible.However, our report concludes that these issues conceal much deeper forces. In 2019, the so-called red wall crumbled but the bricks had been gradually loosening over a long period through a combination of industrial change and alienation from the Westminster party. In the seats we lost in 2019, such as North West Durham and Rother Valley, the gap between the Tories and us had been closing for two decades.At the same time as we have lost our old heartlands, we have a new core vote, of younger graduates, mostly in our big cities. But they are not enough on their own to win us the election. Every leftwing party across Europe is facing a similar challenge, often recording historically low vote shares.The deeper forces that have led us to this point require deep thinking to lead us out, as Keir Starmer has said. Our task is to build a new coalition of younger, metropolitan voters, along with those in our former core vote who deserted us over time, as well as swing voters, including those in the south of England.Listening to voters does not lead to abandoning a belief in economic transformation. We are clear that people want real, profound change and Labour must be the agent of it.The party conducted detailed polling analysis of hundreds of thousands of people and organised a citizens’ jury, bringing together town-dwelling leave voters who had left us and urban remainers who had stayed. The shared concerns included investing in public services such as the NHS and education building social housing and creating decent jobs and fair taxation and redistribution.This sentiment for big economic change was seen in the Brexit referendum, among millions of leavers who felt neglected by politics and wanted an economic transformation that spoke to their community and town. This desire is still evident among leave and remain voters.Since my defeat in 2015, I have learned lessons about the appetite for greater boldness compared to what I offered. Today, the lessons from 2019 are that we must have change that people can believe in. People simply did not buy into the idea that the transformation we were promising last December would be delivered. Whatever our good intentions, if people think change won’t happen, they won’t vote for us.Winning the case for change is also about the work done in the years between elections, not the months before. Our report recommends that we use every part of our movement to rebuild the bonds that link us to voters. Unless we make our politics more relational, less transactional, we will be deeply vulnerable to simplistic, populist arguments from the other side.Our organisation and campaigning is not fit for purpose: our methods still owe more to the 1990s than the 2020s. And while we prided ourselves on digital innovation in 2017, the Conservatives were miles ahead of us last year. A top-to-bottom transformation is required.To make the most of our wider movement, we must put aside the factionalism and ision of recent years. We owe it to the people whom we represent to look outwards to the country rather than inwards.There is no consolation in defeat – only a country that has grown more unequal, more unfair and more ided. The Herculean task of winning the next election will require vision, imagination, discipline and unity. Every part of our movement must be part of it. We hope our report can be a starting point not just for winning an election but what really matters: a radical transformation of our country.• Ed Miliband is shadow business secretary and former leader of the Labour party"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5ddea272531837a8e45b090245d4ce4e9d92ea2/0_37_5470_3282/master/5470.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ef7613d21eaaf01027dd9bc5a77a69b","title":"proud scientist sage secretive advice","story":"The group has published much of its advice - but it’s not there to make political judgments about how this advice gets used• Ian Boyd is a contributor to the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies Some of my earliest memories are of wanting to study science. It has been a privilege to have had the opportunity to make this my career, and it has been a pursuit in search of making the world a better place.Scientific research is built on the idea of learning from mistakes in order to come closer to the truth. It involves a combination of ambitious conjectures, blunt criticism and humble admissions of error. Misunderstandings arise when the scientific method meets social and political intolerances uncertainty and doubt can be interpreted as a sign of weakness or vacillation.Right now, during one of the most serious pandemics in recorded history, this mismatch has serious implications. Those who have looked to science for answers may be confused: rather than asserting facts, science is about understanding and narrowing down uncertainty. There have been mischaracterisations of the scientific advice informing the government’s coronavirus response, and of the researchers involved.The scientists involved in this endeavour are legitimate subjects of critique and scrutiny, but it’s worrying to see the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) – a largely voluntary group of scientists who have spent the last few months crunching data and giving free, frank, politically neutral and objective advice – described in increasingly sinister terms, from “opaque” to “secretive” – and even “like a virtual black box”. These are unjustified descriptions.In past emergencies, such as the Ebola and Zika viruses, evidence from Sage has been published when the group finally stood down. At the time, this was a reasonable approach. Coronavirus is different, so Sage has published its workings and advice, albeit with a time lag between its production and publication. As the group exists to inform government, it’s right that the government should be the first to receive its advice. Some have suggested that publication could be quicker, but we’ve learned during this fast-moving situation that hindsight is the cheapest commodity for critics.The scientists involved in Sage are sensitive to this criticism, but it will not ert them from providing their best advice with as much transparency as can be mustered in the time available, so long as this doesn’t undermine the very purpose of the group. Aside from serving public interest, transparency sharpens and improves scientific thinking.In the past four weeks, more than 300 pieces of evidence have been published from the efforts of hundreds of scientists who make contributions to Sage in some form. The people who produce this material, and who attend Sage meetings, are doing this out of a sense of duty rather than pleasure. They value their independence from the political process and want to solve pressing problems.Sage is not a monolithic body. Nor is it the arbiter of truth. None of those who attend its meetings would see it that way. The group and its members aren’t there to make judgments about how the government uses its advice. There are plenty of other mechanisms for holding the government to account. Inidual contributors are free to hold their own opinions and to talk openly about them, but Sage works by consensus, recording where necessary when there are disagreements.A small army of scientists has been helping us navigate this crisis. Many have nothing to do with Sage, but the vast majority will be acutely aware of the responsibility and trust invested in them. In the years to come, when this awful disease is no longer shaping all of our lives, they will probably once again merge into the background, but I hope they will not be forgotten.• Ian Boyd is a professor of biology at the University of St Andrews and a contributor to Sage"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/904b4aad2e77d1c0fc5868c960de4c11909a087a/0_347_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63f14c2d5b3bf434e244d03003c9c541","title":"its a basic equality issue home learning gap between state and private schools","story":"Lessons continue online at Manchester grammar school while nearby St Ambrose buys textbooks for disadvantaged pupilsIt is 9.30am in the staff room at Manchester grammar school (MGS) and the head of chemistry, Fay Roberts, is settled in the windowless cupboard where she now does much of her teaching. All of her year 12s have turned up online to learn about the acid-catalysed elimination of an alcohol. “They’re pretty good at getting out of bed, but they’re 17-year-old boys,” she says. “If one is missing, I get one of their friends to text them and they soon turn up.”Like all teachers at the UK’s biggest independent boys’ school, Roberts has been offering a full timetable since the school closed on 20 March – up to 49 lessons a fortnight.All 1,600 pupils, aged seven to 18, have been expected online for their usual six daily classes, with everything from PE to organic chemistry taught over the internet instead of in the warren of buildings that sprawl across a large chunk of Rusholme, one of the most deprived and erse wards in central Manchester.Five days before Boris Johnson announced the closure of English schools, Martin Boulton, the high master, decided he needed to make sure all his students were online, fast. Around 120 pupils did not have access to their own computer. Many, but not all, were among the 200 boys on full bursaries at the school, which otherwise charges fees of £12,930 a year.Staff rounded up all spare laptops, dismantled a bunch of desktop computers and dropped them off at pupils’ homes. Boulton’s ambitious plan to transfer the entire curriculum online could only work if every boy could log on to Microsoft Teams.The fact that most state schools could not follow suit is the main reason, Boulton believes, that an estimated 2 million children in the UK – one in five of the total – have done little or no work since lockdown.“The one thing the government needed to get right – and still needs to get right –\u0026nbspis ensuring that every child has access to a computer and the internet. The government announced its centralised scheme offering laptops to disadvantaged children on 19 April. I had a couple of state school heads come in to share ideas yesterday and I know one of those hasn’t received a single laptop,” he said as he gave the  a tour of his almost empty school.He believes the government should have announced a national drive to get computers to all children, like it did with ventilators for hospitals. “Think of how many offices will have laptops lying around surplus to requirements.” Ten miles away in Salford, in a modern complex next to the M60 ringroad, Ben Davis, the head at St Ambrose Barlow Roman Catholic high school, has yet to receive any of the laptops he applied for via the government scheme. Only 10 children qualified, despite more than half of his 1,000 pupils not having their own computer. Many have been sharing with siblings or home-working parents, and a small number – fewer than 20, he thinks – have no suitable device at all.The school quickly gave out all its spares but there were not nearly enough to go round. This is partly why the school has not been offering regular lessons live online in most subjects (“it’s a basic equality issue”), and why at Easter it decided to go analogue, buying hundreds of textbooks to deliver to families where internet and computer access was “compromised”.Live teaching is not the holy grail, insists Davis, who has been head for almost five years. “I do think it’s perfectly possible for kids to have a really valuable experience of learning without live teaching.”He decided early on that the wellbeing of his students had to come first. “Lost learning is serious but it’s not as serious in the long-run as damaged wellbeing, which is fundamentally a real problem for children and families. We were very concerned about the effects of isolation and the likelihood of domestic violence increasing, of families coming under strain.” Though teachers are not marking work, as advised by the National Education Union, the main teachers’ union, they phone every pupil at least once a week and give feedback whenever they can.On Monday this week, Davis’s newly sterile school – water fountains taped off, yellow footprints in the corridors to mark out 2-metre spacings – reopened for year 10s to come in with a parent or carer for a pastoral chat with their form teacher. Half an hour each was allocated, “but some have taken an hour and a half. People have a lot to say. It all comes pouring out.”The year 10s won’t be taught anything in school until 29 June, when they will return for one day a week in bubbles of eight pupils for private study and support with wellbeing and home learning, which will remain the predominant form of education for all St Ambrose pupils.At MGS, which normally has 233 pupils in its Swiss chalet-like wooden junior school, year 6 pupils have been back for three weeks. Those children at home shielding themselves or a family member log in from home to a classroom rigged up with a camera so they can see their teacher and friends, chipping in when they know the answer and asking for help in real time.The sophisticated set-up has not cost much, Boulton says. “We’ve not thrown a lot of money at this issue to make it work. We’ve asked an immense amount of our teachers.” Regardless of their own caring commitments, teachers have had to work full time, though those with children at home have been allowed to encourage more independent learning, which they mark when their own offspring are in bed.The results, he says, have exceeded expectations. “Because we have stuck to our normal timetable, lessons have gone on as normal, but we haven’t been doing cricket fixtures, athletic meets, all of those things that would take children out of school. The focus of pace and teaching is different using the technology. Everybody has come to me and said we’ve got through the syllabus and are doing a lot of extension work.Davis and his team decided that three hours a day was a realistic target for their pupils to learn during lockdown, down from the five they would have normally. “Fairly quickly we realised – and I realise this as a parent as well – that a lot of kids can do the work quicker – though not necessarily better – at home than they can in school, for the simple reason that they are not having a teacher stand and take a register and explain things. If you say to all the kids: ‘You must be working from 8.40 until just after 3pm,’ that’s going to create huge pressure in families. How is that practical if everyone else is working from home?”Could St Ambrose offer a full timetable like MGS? “If we took the step of saying everything is going online, we would risk cutting out quite a large proportion of our catchment area – and we are not a school with a disproportionate level of disadvantage,” says Davis.“If I knew all children had access to a computer and broadband, you would still need to manage the workload and the expectations on the teacher and also how you do period after period with 30 kids. In theory I can see it would have some merits. My concern is that I can’t see everyone having that provision. It’s a lovely aspiration.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b17e0029fd49d882db07997b37bd61ddf65cfea8/8_104_1272_763/master/1272.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=855e4070722b3fe4b502d0ad9beef611","title":"tiny plankton tell the oceans story this vast marine mission has been listening","story":"Since 1931 ‘citizen scientists’ on ships have enabled data collection on the tiny building blocks of the sea. Now this research could shape how we tackle the climate crisisOn a clear day, from their small, unassuming warehouse on the south Devon coast, Lance Gregory and Dave Wilson can see right across Plymouth Sound to the Eddystone lighthouse. Today, they’re watching a ferry from Brittany, the Armorique, pull into dock.Behind it, the ferry is towing a one-metre-long device shaped like a torpedo. It doesn’t look like much, but it’s part of the planet’s longest-running global marine survey.The device is called a continuous plankton recorder (CPR), and it’s one of 53 such devices that Gregory and Wilson manoeuvre using forklifts in their warehouse, surrounded by racks of distinctive yellow boxes and clipboards covered in spreadsheets.They dispatch these CPRs in bright yellow boxes to “ships of opportunity” – ferries, cargo or container vessels that have agreed to volunteer for the mission. Once a ship leaves port, the crew attach the device to the stern using steel wire, then toss it overboard.Trailing along behind the ship, it collects data for the CPR survey. The mission is vast but the subject is minuscule: plankton, the tiny organisms that drift in the ocean. Every marine ecosystem relies on plankton for its basic food source, and it generates half the oxygen we breathe. Perhaps more than any other organism, it is crucial to all life on our planet.The CPR survey is the longest-running marine science project of its kind. It began in 1931 when the scientist Sir Alister Hardy investigated how herring were influenced by plankton in the North Sea. By July 2020, the distance surveyed will have reached an impressive 7m nautical miles, equivalent to 320 circumnavigations of the Earth.Since that first tow from Hull to Germany 89 years ago, the equipment has hardly changed. So far a quarter of a million samples have been analysed, representing a vast geographical spread over the course of the past century. The immense scope has allowed scientists to see dramatic patterns in ocean health, across both time and space, building a much clearer picture of how our marine environments are changing.It is also, says Gregory, “one of the oldest citizen science projects in the world”. Although it is coordinated by the Marine Biological Association in Plymouth, which houses the world’s largest biological library of microscopic plankton, the survey relies on the goodwill of the merchant ships who agree to take the recorders with them as they cross the world’s oceans.“We have a navy of volunteers,” Wilson says, “from the crane operators to the ship’s agents and terminal managers in ports, right through to the boatswains and captains on the ships that tow our equipment.”He’s known as the “Milk Tray man” in British ports, because he often takes chocolates as gifts for the sailors to thank them for their help.“Because most crews and port staff remember us, a glitch at sea or tricky courier logistics are much easier to resolve,” he says. “We also realise that while it’s mission critical for us, for these guys in ports, it’s an add-on –\u0026nbspand they’re under more pressure than ever right now.”Covid-19 has posed the biggest threat to this research in 90 years – even more so than the second world war, organisers say – because the logistics of getting the CPRs to and from ports is very difficult with current travel restrictions.\u0026nbspBut while the pandemic has scuttled much biological research, the plankton survey has been able to continue on essential shipping routes, because no special scientific knowledge is required of the crew volunteers. CPRs are designed to be robust, failsafe and very easy to use. And because this low-tech piece of kit is mechanically driven by a small propeller that spins while being towed, it’s low maintenance.Seawater flows in through a small aperture at the front for every 10 nautical miles towed, it filters three cubic metres of water. Inside, plankton are collected between two layers of silk on a “cassette” that moves constantly onto a collection spool, which sits in formaldehyde to preserve the sample.\u0026nbspTried and tested for decades, the little torpedoes can be towed for up to 500 nautical miles at a time, with each 10cm of silk representing one 10-nautical mile sample.“We’ve recorded more than 200m biological records of inidual species from the samples we’ve analysed,” says David Johns, head of the CPR survey. “This resource is freely available online to everyone, from schoolchildren all the way up to top-flight scientists, who use our data for a myriad of different reasons.”Plankton are defined as organisms that drift in the ocean, unable to swim against the current. Because they are so dependent on ocean patterns, studying them can teach us about the health of not just the seas, but of the planet itself. The longer the research continues, the greater its value for predicting future trends – and confronted with a climate crisis, that predictive power has never been more valuable.\u0026nbspDr Clare Ostle, one of the CPR research scientists, has analysed more than 800 different types of plankton, from plant-like phytoplankton – which photosynthesise to produce oxygen – to the animals known collectively as zooplankton, which include fish larvae and jellyfish.“With the spring plankton bloom kicking off right now, it’s a critical time for collecting samples,” she says. “A lot of people will be relying on this data, as their own monitoring programmes aren’t able to continue during the pandemic. So it’s a big deal for us.”\u0026nbspThe scope of the survey has evolved over time. Since 2017, tows have included shipping routes along the north-west passage, as a result of ice melt in the Arctic. Meanwhile, as research questions change and new technologies come into play, fresh data can be collected from old samples. “We’ve had people come to us wanting to look back in time, to study plastic pollution, for example,” Ostle says. The first complete plastic bag caught by the records was recorded in 1965, and studies since then show an increasing amount of plastic fishing debris getting caught up in the recording equipment.Indeed, in collaboration with the University of Plymouth’s Prof Richard Thompson, Ostle’s studies of plankton dating back to the 50s were able to confirm the significant increase in plastics in the open ocean since the 80s. As a result of this pioneering study in 2004, Thompson coined the phrase “microplastics”, for fragments smaller than 5mm (and which are now so ubiquitous that some plankton have been found to ingest them).The study also provides insight into the spread of disease. After a form of cholera was contracted by people eating contaminated fish eggs on the west coast of Canada, scientists used the plankton survey to map the spread of cholera bacteria, which they found clinging to the surface of some plankton such as fish eggs.The most crucial thing plankton can help us understand, however, is likely to be how the climate crisis is affecting our oceans. The shifting distribution of plankton is a measurable effect of rising sea temperatures. By studying samples over 30 years, Ostle has found that plankton living in colder waters have significantly smaller areas where they can thrive. Meanwhile, plankton living in warmer waters are moving towards cooler conditions in the poles.“This has major impacts on fish stocks, seabird populations and so many other marine animals that feed on plankton,” says Ostle. “Plankton also absorb CO2 emissions, so they are a massive natural carbon sink that we need to protect.“It’s so important that we maintain this unusual dataset, because there are still so many discoveries to be made, and stories that haven’t yet been told.”Wilson and Gregory, for their part, are working hard to make sure the “golden thread of volunteers in ports around the world” know they’re more appreciated than ever. During the pandemic he has been packing goody bags, including sweets and ing or football magazines, to send off to the crews as a special thanks.“Everyone involved knows the value of the health of our oceans, because this is their livelihood,” he says of the citizen-scientist sailors who’ve been crucial to the mission since 1931. “They have the sea in their heart. And they really appreciate the chocolates.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b66387f580eb0154d8074e0f2c43d364c7cc26c5/3_0_9490_5696/master/9490.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67c2f7be4eede3b92fcebe42d091d48a","title":"why you should go animal free arguments in favour of meat eating debunked plant based","story":"Unpalatable as it may be for those wedded to producing and eating meat, the environmental and health evidence for a plant-based diet is clearWhether you are concerned about your health, the environment or animal welfare, scientific evidence is piling up that meat-free diets are best. Millions of people in wealthy nations are already cutting back on animal products.But livestock farmers and meat lovers are unsurprisingly fighting back and it can get confusing. Are avocados worse than beef? What about bee-massacring almond production?The coronavirus pandemic has added another ingredient to that mix. The rampant destruction of the natural world is seen as the root cause of diseases leaping into humans and is largely driven by farming expansion. The world’s top bioersity scientists say even more deadly pandemics will follow unless the ecological devastation is rapidly halted.Food is also a vital part of our culture, while the affordability of food is an issue of justice. So there isn’t a single perfect diet. But the evidence is clear: whichever healthy and sustainable diet you choose, it is going to have much less red meat and dairy than today’s western diets and quite possibly none. That’s for two basic reasons.So what about all those arguments in favour of meat-eating and against vegan diets? Let’s start with the big beef about red meat.This is true only when compared to intensively-reared beef linked to forest destruction. The UK’s National Farmers Union says UK beef has only half the emissions compared to the world average. But a lot of research shows grass-fed beef uses more land and produces more – or at best similar – emissions because grain is easier to digest and intensively reared cows live shorter lives. Both factors mean less methane. Either way, the emissions from even the best beef are still many times that from beans and pulses.Claim: Cattle are actually neutral for climate, because methane is relatively short-lived greenhouse gasMethane is a very powerful greenhouse gas and ruminants produce a lot of it. But it only remains in the atmosphere for a relatively short time: half is broken down in nine years. This leads some to argue that maintaining the global cattle herd at current levels – about 1 billion animals – is not heating the planet. The burping cows are just replacing the methane that breaks down as time goes by.But this is simply “creative accounting”, according to Pete Smith at the University of Aberdeen and Andrew Balmford at the University of Cambridge. We shouldn’t argue that cattle farmers can continue to pollute just because they have done so in the past, they say: “We need to do more than just stand still.” In fact, the short-lived nature of methane actually makes reducing livestock numbers a “particularly attractive target”, given that we desperately need to cut greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis.In any case, just focusing on methane doesn’t make the rampant deforestation by cattle ranchers in South America go away. Even if you ignore methane completely, says Poore, animal products still produce more CO2 than plants. Even one proponent of the methane claim says: “I agree that intensive livestock farming is unsustainable”.Claim: In many places the only thing you can grow is grass for cattle and sheep“But if everybody were to make the argument that ‘our pastures are the best and should be used for grazing’, then there would be no way to limit global warming,” says Marco Springmann at the University of Oxford. His work shows that a transition to a predominantly plant-based flexitarian diet would free up both pasture and cropland.The pasture could instead be used to grow trees and lock up carbon, provide land for rewilding and the restoration of nature, and growing bio-energy crops to displace fossil fuels. The crops no longer being fed to animals could instead become food for people, increasing a nation’s self-sufficiency in grains.Claim: Grazing cattle help store carbon from the atmosphere in the soilFurthermore, research shows this carbon storage reaches its limit in a few decades, while the problem of methane emissions continue. The stored carbon is also vulnerable - a change in land use or even a drought can see it released again. Proponents of “holistic grazing” to trap carbon are also criticised for unrealistic extrapolation of local results to global levels.Claim: There is much more wildlife in pasture than in monoculture croplandThat is probably true but misses the real point. A huge driver of the global wildlife crisis is the past and continuing destruction of natural habitat to create pasture for livestock. Herbivores do have an important role in ecosystems, but the high density of farmed herds means pasture is worse for wildlife than natural land. Eating less meat means less destruction of wild places and cutting meat significantly would also free up pasture and cropland that could be returned to nature. Furthermore, a third of all cropland is used to grow animal feed.Claim: We need animals to convert feed into protein humans can eatBut animals can play a role in some parts of Africa and Asia where, in India for example, waste from grain production can feed cattle that produce milk. In the rest of the world, where much of cropland that could be used to feed people is actually used to feed animals, a cut in meat eating is still needed for agriculture to be sustainable.Claim: What about soya milk and tofu that is destroying the Amazon?Soya milk also has much smaller emissions and land and water use than cow’s milk. If you are worried about the Amazon, not eating meat remains your best bet.Claim: Almond milk production is massacring bees and turning land into desertSome almond production may well cause environmental problems. But that is because rising demand has driven rapid intensification in specific places, like California, which could be addressed with proper regulation. It is nothing to do with what almonds need to grow. Traditional almond production in Southern Europe uses no irrigation at all. It is also perhaps worth noting that the bees that die in California are not wild, but raised by farmers like six-legged livestock.Like soya milk, almond milk still has lower carbon emissions and land and water use than cow’s milk. But if you are still worried, there are plenty of alternatives, with oat milk usually coming out with the lowest environmental footprint.Claim: Avocados are causing droughts in placesAgain, the problem here is the rapid growth of production in specific regions that lack prudent controls on water use, like Peru and Chile. Avocados generate three times less emissions than chicken, four times less than pork, and 20 times less than beef.If you are still worried about avocados, you can of course choose not to eat them. But it’s not a reason to eat meat instead, which has a much bigger water and deforestation footprint.The market is likely to solve the problem, as the high demand from consumers for avocados and almonds incentivises farmers elsewhere to grow the crops, thereby alleviating the pressure on current production hotspots.Claim: Quinoa boom is harming poor farmers in Peru and BoliviaQuinoa is an amazing food and has seen a boom. But the idea that this took food from the mouths of poor farmers is wrong. “The claim that rising quinoa prices were hurting those who had traditionally produced and consumed it is patently false,” said researchers who studied the issue.Quinoa was never a staple food, representing just a few percent of the food budget for these people. The quinoa boom has had no effect on their nutrition. The boom also significantly boosted the farmers’ income.There is an issue with falling soil quality, as the land is worked harder. But quinoa is now planted in China, India and Nepal, as well as in the US and Canada, easing the burden. The researchers are more worried now about the loss of income for South American farmers as the quinoa supply rises and the price falls.Claim: What about palm oil destroying rainforests and orangutans?Palm oil plantations have indeed led to terrible deforestation. But that is an issue for everybody, not only vegans: it’s in about half of all products on supermarket shelves, both food and toiletries. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature argues that choosing sustainably produced palm oil is actually positive, because other oil crops take up more land.But Poore says: “We are abandoning millions of acres a year of oilseed land around the world, including rapeseed and sunflower fields in the former Soviet regions, and traditional olive plantations.” Making better use of this land would be preferable to using palm oil, he says.Claim: Vegans don’t get enough B12, making them stupidA vegan diet is generally very healthy, but doctors have warned about the potential lack of B12, an important vitamin for brain function that is found in meat, eggs and cows’ milk. This is easily remedied by taking a supplement.Claim: Plant-based alternatives to meat are really unhealthyThe rapid rise of the plant-based burger has prompted some to criticise them as ultra-processed junk food. A plant-based burger could be unhealthier if the salt levels are very high, says Springmann, but it is most likely to still be healthier than a meat burger when all nutritional factors are considered, particularly fibre. Furthermore, replacing a beef burger with a plant-based alternative is certain to be less damaging to the environment.There is certainly a strong argument to be made that overall we eat far too much processed food, but that applies just as much to meat eaters as to vegetarians and vegans. And given that most people are unlikely to give up their burgers and sausages any time, the plant-based options are a useful alternative.Claim: Fruit and vegetables aren’t vegan because they rely on animal manure as fertiliserMost vegans would say it’s just silly to say fruit and veg are animal products and plenty are produced without animal dung. In any case there is no reason for horticulture to rely on manure at all. Synthetic fertiliser is easily made from the nitrogen in the air and there is plenty of organic fertiliser available if we chose to use it more widely in the form of human faeces. Over application of fertiliser does cause water pollution problems in many parts of the world. But that applies to both synthetic fertiliser and manure and results from bad management.Claim: Vegan diets kill millions of insectsPiers Morgan is among those railing against “hypocrite” vegans because commercially kept bees die while pollinating almonds and avocados and combine harvesters “create mass murder of bugs” and small mammals while bringing in the grain harvest. But almost everyone eats these foods, not just vegans.It is true that insects are in a terrible decline across the planet. But the biggest drivers of this are the destruction of wild habitat, largely for meat production, and widespread pesticide use. If it is insects that you are really worried about, then eating a plant-based organic diet is the option to choose.Claim: Telling people to eat less meat and dairy is denying vital nutrition to the world’s poorestA “planetary health diet” published by scientists to meet both global health and environmental needs was criticised by journalist Joanna Blythman: “When ideologues living in affluent countries pressurise poor countries to eschew animal foods and go plant-based, they are displaying crass insensitivity, and a colonial White Saviour mindset.”In fact, says Springmann, who was part of the team behind the planetary health diet, it would improve nutritional intake in all regions, including poorer regions where starchy foods currently dominate diets. The big cuts in meat and dairy are needed in rich nations. In other parts of the world, many healthy, traditional diets are already low in animal products.Claim: Transport emissions mean that eating plants from all over the world is much worse than local meat and dairyClaim: All the farmers who raise livestock would be unemployed if the world goes meat-freeLivestock farming is massively subsidised with taxpayers money around the world – unlike vegetables and fruit. That money could be used instead to support more sustainable foods such as beans and nuts instead, and to pay for other valuable services, such as capturing carbon in woodlands and wetlands, restoring wildlife, cleaning water and reducing flood risks. Shouldn’t your taxes be used to provide public goods rather than harms?So, food is complicated. But however much we might wish to continue farming and eating as we do today, the evidence is crystal clear that consuming less meat and more plants is very good for both our health and the planet. The fact that some plant crops have problems is not a reason to eat meat instead.In the end, you will choose what you eat. If you want to eat healthily and sustainably, you don’t have to stop eating meat and dairy altogether. The planetary health diet allows for a beef burger, some fish and an egg each week, and a glass of milk or some cheese each day.Food writer Michael Pollan foreshadowed the planetary health diet in 2008 with a simple seven-word rule: “Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.” But if you want to have the maximum impact on fighting the climate and wildlife crisis, then it is going to be all plants."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b49548517d4c8d9072a6ebe0e4f5847bd47fdbfc/0_49_3616_2168/master/3616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcbdca5aeb011e7dfda5ad88e4ef4b1b","title":"from pressure to the last tree 10 of the best black british films","story":"A celebration of the pioneering films reflecting black life in Britain over the last 40 years As UK Black Lives Matter protests roar, and the foulness of the Windrush scandal festers, it is a crucial time to e into black British history. “Historic” certainly describes the first ever black British feature film: Horace Ové’s Pressure, an absorbing 1976 drama about the everyday struggles of a London-born son (Herbert Norville) of Trinidadian parents.

Looking after number one is the priority with nine games remaining, even if they are clinging on to their second-tier status by a thread and so, at the end of the month, Wilks will return to Barnsley, ineligible to join their fight for survival.That is not even the worst bit as far as Hull are concerned given their captain, Eric Lichaj, and vice-captain, Jackson Irvine, will play no part in the run-in after failing to agree short-term extensions. Hull were in freefall when the season was paused in March – they hover a place above the relegation zone after taking two points from the past available 33 – and, despite welcoming back a handful of players from injury, they resume in an arguably bigger pickle.Saturday’s match at home to Charlton is seismic. Win for the first time since New Year’s Day and they earn some respite lose and they are in the mire. But Charlton badly need a pick-me-up, too Lee Bowyer rallied his squad after Lyle Taylor opted out of playing for fear of jeopardising a “life-changing move” and the club recently changed hands for the third time this season, though the takeover is yet to be approved by the English Football League.Last week mid-table Queens Park Rangers allowed Marc Pugh to depart because they could not afford for him to trigger a 12-month contract extension, and Gary Sweet, the Luton chief executive, has warned his club could face “financial oblivion” if Nathan Jones, reappointed as manager last month, fails to steer them clear of relegation. Dropping into the third tier would be catastrophic for Stoke, Huddersfield or Middlesbrough, all of whom had designs of competing at the other end of the table but are dangling precariously above the bottom three. The outlook looks particularly bleak for Jonathan Woodgate, whose Boro side have won one of their past 13 matches and are the ision’s lowest scorers.Leeds on the other hand appear to be crisis-free at the top of the table after racking up five wins (and five clean sheets) on the bounce following a winter wobble and boast the best defence. In Kalvin Phillips and Ben White, both of whom are on the radar of the England manager, Gareth Southgate, they possess two of the most exciting players outside the top flight, and the spine of the side is another year wiser.This time last season Leeds ran out of puff and, even though Marcelo Bielsa has been working his players hard during lockdown, the prolonged break could prove a blessing in disguise. Leeds supporters may be unable to attend stadiums to watch their team attempt to get over the line but more than 15,000 fan cutouts will have a seat at Elland Road as the drama unfolds.At West Bromwich Albion, who sit a point behind Leeds, Slaven Bilic has been referring to the run-in as a “small World Cup” and, given his experience at major tournaments with Croatia, that bodes well. West Brom, too, are more than capable of going the distance, with Grady Diangana’s return a major boon for the ision’s joint-highest scorers.There is a good chance the top two could be out of sight within eight days of the restart but much hinges on a sometimes-erratic Fulham, who have the ammunition to make life interesting. Brentford, for whom Pontus Jansson is back fit, need to rediscover some rhythm to make sure of a top-six berth, while Nottingham Forest are fifth but have work to do having won one of their past six matches.And then there is the Championship’s pièce de résistance: a tantalising play-off race encompassing at least nine teams stretching as far down as 13th-placed QPR. Preston are primed, Bristol City can go close after Benik Afobe’s return from injury and, across the Severn Bridge, Cardiff, who have been steady if not spectacular since Neil Harris took charge, are confident of mounting a challenge.Meanwhile Millwall are free of expectation and have a kind run-in a youthful Swansea side including the talented Conor Gallagher could yet click it would be foolish to discount Derby, whose captain, Wayne Rooney, craves a fairytale finish and Blackburn being overlooked for the initial round of televised matches suggests they are strangely unfancied. Predicting how the final table will look on 22 July is anyone’s guess."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7c17bc1a12ad7300614b87a684125e18197d7a7/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b49f4c2e4d8c57236b5a76442457a0b","title":"experience i built the first skatepark in syria","story":"When we built the bowl, I put the kids on a board one by one – they were amazed by the feeling of rolling alongSkateboarding has been my life since I was eight years old. Before I knew how to stand up, I would sit on my cousin’s old board and roll down the hills of Cáceres, my home town in Spain. My mum always worried I’d break a bone.When I was at university, I heard about Skate-Aid, an organisation that builds skateparks for children in disadvantaged communities. I’ve always wanted to make a positive impact on the world, and if there was a way to do that through skateboarding, then I was in. Every project is different. In Rwanda and Kenya, I worked with orphans and children from very poor backgrounds. In Namibia, I taught kids who were visually impaired. Part of the reason skating is good for kids psychologically is that it is challenging. If you want to learn a new trick you have to practise, and if you persevere, you’ll get there. The philosophy is simple: get up and try again. It’s an amazing form of self-development.I got a call in early 2019 to say the next project would be in Syria. I was apprehensive. While I was living in Africa, I got used to walking past soldiers with guns slung over their shoulders, but Syria was a different story. When I told my family I was considering going, they thought I was crazy, but I wanted to see the country with my own eyes.We flew to Lebanon and drove the rest of the way, taking a half-destroyed road from Beirut to Damascus. We stopped at military checkpoints every few minutes. I was anxious – I didn’t understand Arabic, and all the men I could see were armed. But our driver would hand over water or cigarettes, and we’d be allowed through.Our destination was Qudsaya, a city 7km west of Damascus that was held by rebels until 2016. As we drove through the centre, the scars from the fighting were everywhere: roads were puckered with cracks buildings covered in bullet holes, in which birds had built nests.I was immediately touched by people’s generosity. The area where we were building the skatepark had been largely destroyed, except for a small concrete structure where a family of four were living. They’d had to flee their home in the north. The mother was so welcoming, bringing us tea and coffee every morning before she even knew why we were there.It took our group 28 days to build the park. We’d get up early and spend all day working. Most people didn’t understand what we were doing at first – this was going to be Syria’s first skatepark – but once we showed them videos of our other projects, they wanted to help.We stayed in a house close to the site, and on the walk home from work we would buy falafels and fruit from nearby shops. Someone would always start speaking to us in French, Italian or German, because many locals had family abroad. The first time we went in, they wouldn’t let us pay. No tourists had been to the city in years and they were grateful we were there.We only had power once a day, so there wasn’t much electricity or hot water, but everyone in the area was in the same situation. We didn’t need luxury our days were so exhausting we’d just come home and sleep.There were moments I’ll never forget. One night I was woken by a huge blast and told there had been a missile strike on a military store 50km away. You fear for your life in those situations, but then you look at the children and realise this is what they face every day.The kids would watch us skating down the street and were so excited. When we finished the bowl, I put them on a board one by one and they were amazed by the feeling of rolling along.

But for an ever-increasing number of people, that naysayer is being drowned out by someone else. He’s called Beefy.Beefy – or Cory Wharton-Malcolm, as he’s also known – is a real live running coach who lives in Sydenham, Kent but he’s also a disembodied voice, travelling with millions of people at once, telling more times than the talking clock. This version of Beefy lives in your phone, and as you plod your way up that hill and think fondly of the sofa, he says things like “thank you” and “run easy” and “continue to run easy”. And, for some reason, you keep going.Wharton-Malcolm, 41, is one of a myriad of pre-recorded coaches who have become a staple of lockdown exercise for adherents all over the planet. Fitness apps were huge business before solitary exercise became our only hope of leaving the house – but now they are bigger still, one of the winners of the pandemic, and the super-enthusiastic voice in your ear is the breakout star of the genre.The thinking behind the apps is simple enough. You pick a distance or a time, from a few minutes to a marathon. When you hit certain waypoints, the music fades, and up pops Beefy, or one of his colleagues or competitors, to tell you you’re amazing.“It’s amazing how many people have found the app, and then found my voice and connected with it,” said the real Wharton-Malcolm, on the phone shortly after his digital analogue in the Nike Run Club app ignored my complaints and drove me through some particularly brutal interval runs.He estimates he’s getting about three times as many messages from listeners each day as he did before the pandemic struck. This week he signed up with a talent management agency, and there has been talk of a book.“People say they didn’t touch running with a bargepole prior to the pandemic, but because they’ve been locked inside, they’re up for it,” he said. “They say since finding your voice and a little bit of calm, they’ve started to enjoy it. I think people are in search of human connection.”The Nike app has risen from 41st most popular to 4th in the UK. Rivals such as Fitbit Coach and Peloton also seeing substantial rises.“We saw a lot of fitness apps spike early on,” said Lexi Sydow, enior insights manager at App Annie. “It’s one of the standout categories – people maybe being optimistic about their quarantine period. And these apps that do have a coaching element, they are ranking highly.” Unsurprisingly, the combination of relentless compliments, self-improvement, and a real-world version of the AI played by Scarlett Johannson in the film Her leads to some disproportionate levels of enthusiasm. “@Bitbeefy you are a frikkin legend!” Laura wrote on Instagram. “Such a great run - thanks for “being” with me!” Shelly Mittal told his colleague, Nike’s guru-like global head coach Chris Bennett. And @Eleniid summarised what a lot of people seem to feel: “I VERY MUCH NEED COACH CORY TO TELL ME JOB WELL DONE IN HIS HOT ACCENT FOR ME TO CONTINUE RUNNING!!!”Wharton-Malcolm, who describes himself as a “recovering fat kid”, is amused, but bashful. “I definitely have received some expressions of love,” he said. “I am definitely flattered by it. But I have a missus.”So familiar have his honeyed tones become to devotees that he gets recognised – and, presumably, fancied – on the basis of his voice alone. “I was stopped in Victoria station and this person was like … I know that voice!” he said. “And in Amsterdam, I was coaching a group of runners, and I said, ‘Come on, let’s go’, the kind of thing I say in the app – and someone said, ‘Wait, it’s coach Cory!’ That was weird.”Since the death of George Floyd, Wharton-Malcolm has used his substantial social media following to promote Black Lives Matter, posting videos such as a guided run through his neighbourhood talking about local businesses run by black people. More broadly, he sees a profound social benefit to exercise and coaching in an era of isolation.“Some people are just doing it for performance, yes,” he said. “But there’s a search for camaraderie, for partnership. We’re part of a community. And we all want someone to talk to.” Or listen to, at least."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61d3bda743f8c9e4ef7d26f0eaeb4dd621ff639c/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7156ab73460f847cf0e5747351c14e9","title":"my pandemic epiphany half marathon alone incredible covid family friends health","story":"With forty-four loved ones on the phone, Caitlin Curran realized she didn’t need the crowd for this race to be specialI often feel choked up walking to the start line of a race. It feels silly to be overcome by emotion, but it’s beautiful to be part of a large group of people doing the same simple activity. I usually love running because it is solitary, for me at least – I don’t run with a buddy or a running club. But race days are special.When lockdowns first began in New York in March and everyone started to cancel – well, everything – the fate of the NYRR Brooklyn Half Marathon, which I usually run each year, seemed up in the air. As it increasingly became evident there would be no treatment or vaccine for months or years, it was obvious the race would need to be called off. It would have been the 40th running of the Brooklyn Half, which claims to be the largest half in the US. Usually close to 30,000 people run the route each May, from Prospect Park to the Coney Island boardwalk.I felt sad about it, but also guilty for feeling sad. I know I am fortunate to still have a job which can be done from home, and to like the people I’m in lockdown with (my husband, Will, and 20-month-old son, Marvin).So I decided to run a half marathon alone. But it wasn’t really on my own. Forty-four people were there with me, in my ears at least. In lieu of an in-person cheering squad, Will organized a spreadsheet of five-minute windows for friends and family to call me while I ran.The day of the race, rain was forecast – which in these times is a positive, because it means fewer people to maintain distance from on the sidewalks. The streets weren’t totally empty, but empty enough that I could pull down my face mask for a breath of fresh air during several stretches.The logistics were tricky – answering a phone call every five minutes via Bluetooth while keeping a decent pace in the rain wasn’t easy. My fingers became slippery – once I rudely hung up on a friend by accident and scrambled to call back before his allotted time was up.Several people spoke without stopping, as though leaving me a live voice message, insisting that I not waste my breath by responding. Others played me songs to keep up my stamina – I was serenaded with Robyn, Gang of Four and 90s-era Jock Jams staples. My parents walked in solidarity while on the call, others were in a different time zone and still in bed. I gave a lot of live weather reports – not raining now, a few drops coming down, now it’s a heavy downpour!Two very creative friends booked two time slots so that they could perform impossibly bad dialogue from a scene in Showgirls (“I used to love doggie chow, too!”), and I laughed so much I drew confused looks from the few people I passed on the wide running path by the water.My pace was slower than usual, but I didn’t mind – the distance was my goal, which felt more possible as the time flew by in five-minute bursts of conversation. The hardest part was ending conversations when I wanted to keep talking.At the end of the Brooklyn half, thousands of runners are forced to funnel onto a slim wooden ramp that leads to the boardwalk in Coney Island. It’s joyously chaotic. The finish line is a crowded assemblage of sweaty runners, boardwalk eateries, volunteers handing out water, and bystanders. It’s staggering to even picture such a scene in these times.Meanwhile during my solo half, as I approached the New York Harbor, the rain held off for a moment while a spectral fog made the Verrazzano Bridge barely visible. It was quietly striking – a moment to absorb the solitude before my phone rang again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/724a3dbff4aacde0bf1f84a541470acc25179ce1/0_19_2160_1297/master/2160.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ccfae668842f587c7b830b83d9d5c6f","title":"uk extends payments freeze for consumers struggling with debt","story":"People in financial difficulty can defer payments on credit cards and loans until 31 OctoberThe UK’s financial watchdog has extended emergency measures to allow consumers struggling financially because of the coronavirus outbreak to freeze loan and credit card payments until 31 October.The measures, which were announced by the Financial Conduct Authority in April for an initial period of three months, also includes overdrafts, store cards and catalogue credit.Customers who have yet to request a payment freeze, or an arranged interest-free overdraft up to £500, can apply for one until 31 October.For consumers who have already taken one and are still experiencing temporary payment difficulties because of the health emergency, the FCA said firms must continue to offer support including further payment deferral, or reducing payment amounts to a manageable level, for a further three months.“We have been working closely with other authorities, lenders and debt charities to support consumers in the current emergency,” said Christopher Woolard, the interim chief executive at the FCA. “The proposals we’ve announced today would provide an expected minimum level of financial support for consumers who remain in, or enter, temporary financial difficulty due to coronavirus.”At the end of a first payment freeze, firms are expected to contact customers to see if they an afford to resume payments and, if so, how they can repay missed payments.“Where consumers can afford to make payments, it is in their best long-term interest to do so but for those who need help, it will be there,” Woolard said.Customers who have already arranged an interest-free overdraft and are still struggling can request another one of up to £500. They will also be able to request a reduced interest rate on any additional borrowing in excess of £500.The FCA’s new guidance does not apply to other consumer credit products such as motor finance, payday loans and buy now, pay later.

We’ve lived here for three years and before that Berlin for 10 so I’ve been away from home since 2008. It’s beginning to wear on me now. I miss the British way of handling stuff and the banter. The other night I chatted on Twitter with Johnny Lynch from the Pictish Trail, who lives on the Isle of Eigg. There’s something quite alluring about living on an island, away from the vacuous aspects of modern life.During lockdown I’ve mostly been working really hard. I’ve had a creative explosion, doing videos, artwork and finishing our new album. Our animated video for A Ghost taps into lockdown. Drawing it on my iPad helped me detach from the news and not get too stressed out. It captures LA’s empty streets. I’d had this secret wish that the traffic would be like the 1960s, and suddenly it is … although I hadn’t bargained on a pandemic.For the last two weeks, the Black Lives Matter protests have touched everywhere. The protests have brought together kids, grannies, club 18-30. On the very early ones there were a lot of families, but the fucking police were firing rubber bullets at them. Lately, the millennials have been bringing a sound system along and turning things into a massive street party. That’s great, but there has to be a balance between partying and protest or the message will be lost.Jo Whiley asked me to suggest a song for her radio show, so I chose this. It’s one of my wake-up things every morning that gets me going. It’s really upbeat but not cheesy.I’ve been checking to see how our video’s doing and every time I type our name into YouTube I get Travis Scott. Travis are the opposite of Travis Scott, but I watched a documentary about him to understand his music and it’s amazing. Rap music is almost the sound of broken nightmares. It’s the barometer of our country and these young men are telling it like it is. Thirty years ago this would have sounded like it was from another planet.Just before lockdown a German friend wanted to go to Highgate cemetery with me to see Karl Marx’s grave, and we saw Bert Jansch’s before we got to Marx’s. He’s my go-to chillout guy. His guitar playing is impeccable and a lot of big players ripped off his licks. Songwriters are like birdwatchers. Songs float by, they draw a picture of them and they fly off, and you’ve got a wee representation of this elusive thing that you can share with everyone. I love that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5bd079178d76cda8ba53e12f0a5d85d9d93c2192/0_0_7952_4770/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f21ae59e96582ae2e42c8779b98b0a6d","title":"norah jones i worried about being swallowed up by success","story":"The singer-songwriter reflects on her eclectic back catalogue, from a breakthrough mellow jazz smash to collaborations with Danger Mouse and Jeff Tweedy To this day, it is hard to reconcile the supernatural success of Norah Jones’s debut album with the shy 22-year-old at its centre. Released in 2002, Come Away With Me went many times platinum around the world, and remains one of the biggest-selling records of all time. Jones did not enjoy the frenzy that emerged around her, particularly the media’s fixation with her relationship with the sitar great Ravi Shankar, the once-estranged father with whom she had only recently been reacquainted. “I was trying to have fun with the success, but at the same time, I was a little too worried about getting swallowed up by it all,” she says.Today, she is calling from her Brooklyn bedroom around the start of lockdown, stealing an hour away from homeschooling her two young children to discuss the musical highlights of her career. There is a parallel there with the song she selects from Come Away With Me. Jones wrote only a few songs on her debut album, and Seven Years was not one of them her then-boyfriend, the bassist Lee Alexander, wrote it after seeing a home video of Jones dancing as a child. “It was just a very sweet sentiment,” she says. “A child in her own world, being happy and content.”As breezy as Come Away With Me sounded, recording it took two attempts. Jones’s voice got lost on the first recordings, although Seven Years survived those sessions. “I was in the studio with a bunch of musicians that I respected so much but just didn’t know that well,” she says. “Because I wasn’t super comfortable, maybe that’s why I didn’t come through.” A second go, aided by the renowned producer Arif Mardin, provided the goods, and made Jones the seminal jazz label Blue Note’s first pop icon.While only a fraction older than the likes of Britney and Christina, Jones existed in an another universe, although she thinks she attended one MTV video music awards ceremony. “I felt like I was crashing a lot of parties, I’ll put it that way.” Some critics theorised that listeners were drawn to the album’s comforting vibe in the aftermath of 911. She disagreed at the time, “but looking back, I definitely think that could have been part of it”.The only way to follow such a smash was to let go, says Jones. The dreamy Sunrise is a testament to the easy feeling she got from playing with the guitarists Kevin Breit and Adam Levy, recording her second album on a mountain in upstate New York and channelling the her love of Dolly Parton, who guested on Feels Like Home. Contradicting critics who dismissed it as bland, the New Yorker described Jones’s second album as “one big booty call” and claimed her music was all about sex. “I definitely don’t agree!” she laughs. “Though people relate to music how they relate to it, so I don’t disagree, either. In college, I had an album I liked to listen to with my boyfriend at the time. Everybody has that album, right? Fine with me if it’s one of mine.”The more pointed criticisms sometimes got to her. “But whatever, should I crawl in a hole and not release music because of some other person?” The music industry, however, couldn’t get enough, and the “Norah effect” precipitated the signing of Amy Winehouse, Katie Melua, Joss Stone and numerous other soulful young women. Jones didn’t mind their music but was less keen on the association. “It wasn’t stuff I wanted to listen to, and when people would put me in the same category as someone else, I wouldn’t agree,” she says. “But I had to separate myself from it all. The truth is some great artists came out of that and that’s awesome.”Jones wrote Rosie’s Lullaby while touring Australia, about a friend who was going through a hard time. But it is not hard to interpret the lyrics about a woman “feelin’ so small  At the bottom of the world” as self-reflection. “It was probably about both of us,” she admits. Jones felt “kinda depressed” when making her third album, Not Too Late. “I was lonely and sad and the world was kinda falling apart.” Touring the second album had been crazier still than the first. “I was just trying to keep together, to be honest,” she says. “I was drinking on tour, and I was never a super-destructive drinker, which is good, but I was still just drinking a lot, which is not great.” There were fun times, she recalls, and good meals, but touring for the best part of a year, “you get a little delirious”.Looseness became a release valve. Not Too Late came together from off-the-cuff recording sessions that Jones hid from her label. She started various side projects: the countrified Little Willies, the rockier El Madmo. “We were playing sports arenas in France, which was insane,” she says of her day job. “We set up our instruments backstage in some men’s locker room and would write silly pop songs that became the El Madmo record, trying to find ways to stay sane.”Jones’s “mind’s racing” on this song from The Fall, as a message from a lover leaves her “mixed up”. The sentiment could be anxious or anticipatory. “I was probably feeling both things, to be honest,” says Jones. She and Alexander had broken up, prompting her to seek an entirely new band and a different sound.The Fall is darker and smokier than her previous albums, intermingling the spirits of Dusty Springfield and Massive Attack. It was also her first album primarily comprised of her own writing: she credits Ryan Adams, who plays on the album, with encouraging her when she felt insecure about her abilities. “It lifted me up as a songwriter and made me feel validated.” She says she doesn’t know much about the allegations against him. “It just wasn’t my experience with him. I feel bad for everybody involved.”You can hear Jones coming into her own on The Fall, her dramatic vocals standing out instead of following the flow as she had on previous records. Performing covers, she says, “you’re listening to the sound of your voice a little more instead of delivering the lyrics”. But writing original material, “I was delivering the lyrics a little more”. Coming out of a relationship that she had been in for most of her 20s was jarring. “We had been together since before my first album came out, so then it became navigating who I was post-success, without that partner who was with me through it all,” she says. “It was a very strange time. But I had a lot of good friends who I knew from before, and in New York, there’s always some good music to go and hear.”Jones’s fifth album, Little Broken Hearts, reinvented her process even more starkly. After collaborating with Danger Mouse, AKA Brian Burton, on his 2011 album Rome, she asked if he would work with her on a new set of songs that she had written. But Burton likes to start with a blank slate. “At the time I was a little confused, but once we started, I completely understood,” say Jones.All a Dream was one of the first songs they made together: a noir meditation on the lingering effects of a bad love affair. They worked on the fly, prompting Jones to embrace roughness, using recordings that she had intended as scratch demos. It was a transformative experience. “Before, I was terrified of having to finish songs before I went into the studio,” she says. “Now, with the new album that I’m putting out, a lot of these songs were not finished. I went in having faith in the process and the lightning bolt of inspiration that comes with making music. I learned a lot of that from working with Brian.”Day Breaks was hailed as Jones’s return to jazz, although there is a sly maturity to the album, and especially Wonderful Time, that Jones says would have eluded her at 22. This song, she says, is the rare example of “something that happens when you capture exactly what you want, what you’re hearing in your head plus what other musicians play and bring to the table that you couldn’t even have imagined”.One of those musicians was the jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter, whose solo albums – and work on Joni Mitchell’s early 90s records – are among Jones’s favourites. “He’s an incredible human,” she says. “My favourite thing about him is that he doesn’t play unless he’s feeling it. He’s not just gonna noodle around and find the tune, he’s gonna sit there and listen until he feels something and it moves him, and then he plays the most incredible thing. That’s different from anyone I’ve ever worked with.”Wonderful Time scans as a love song, but it’s “more of a romantic humanity song”, says Jones. It was written as the US lurched towards Trumpism. “It’s more about: let’s lift each other up and send love to each other in a hard time,” she says. “Instead of saying: let’s get together romantically. It’s more than that.”On her seventh record, Jones applied the lessons she learned from Danger Mouse with such commitment that it is hard to call Begin Again an album. It is a collection of seven songs, made off the cuff in the studio with collaborators including Wilco’s Jeff Tweedy and the pianist Thomas Bartlett. She released them one by one and compiled them later.The title track, written with Emily Fiskio and produced by Jones, was a true bolt from the blue. “I didn’t know what it was about until after we recorded it.” She is shy about saying what it meant to her: “It feels a little bit like it’s about God to me.” There was no literal, spiritual shift in her life, “but I was definitely feeling a lot of things at the time, maybe a little sad about certain things in my life. I think as we get older, that comes in and out more and more: we think about our humanity and happiness and our family and our loved ones.”Despite the heavy themes, the making of Begin Again only continued to lift any burden of expectation from Jones’s career. Releasing one track at a time, she was excited to embrace the possibilities offered by streaming services, “and also give myself a break”, she says. “To get inspired to make music without having a huge album arc. It really freed me up and made me more inspired than ever.”For her eighth album, Jones took some inspiration from an unlikely source. “Reading Dr Seuss stories to my children every night, I feel rhymes in my head constantly,” she says. That, plus the encouragement of a poet friend, led Jones to start writing her own poetry, which she turned into three of the songs on her new record. “I’m certainly not going to release a book of poetry at this point in my life,” she says emphatically.Once again, Jones hadn’t intended to make an album – until she realised this group of songs “all matched”. The ad hoc assembly reminded her of a photograph her husband took of her on the ground, so she called the record Pick Me Up Off the Floor. It has a heavy mood, dramatic vocals, songs about ision and irreconcilable differences. Jones has previously said: “If there’s a darkness to this album, it’s not meant to be an impending sense of doom. It feels more like a human longing for connection.”It is an eerie sentiment for an album that is ultimately being released into social isolation. “It feels kind of silly to talk about my music when people are sick, but at the same time, music lifts people up and I hope that they connect to it,” says Jones. She and her husband have been listening to John Prine (this interview was done before his death from the virus), Townes Van Zandt and Guns N’ Roses. “It’s certainly been making me feel better in this weird time,” she says. “What are you gonna do except what you do, right?”• Pick Me Up Off the Floor is out now on EMI"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6d2c685a77f9a5fbeadd9f1495a702a28be245e/0_178_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae5f39001657bc78c5795f057a4b3fc2","title":"shygirl this weeks best new track","story":"This week we’ve got Auto-Tuned art pop, a timely blast of hardcore punk, and a welcome slice of jolly, jangling guitarNothing else out this month sounds quite so hypnotically otherworldly as Shygirl’s team-up with the sonic polymath Arca.

While most cruise ship passengers have now made it back to land, many crew workers are trapped, quarantined in tiny cabins, some without pay. Crew members have said the experience has taken its toll on their mental health. Cruise companies have blamed strict rules from health authorities for not letting crew disembark.

However, it was also the product of two decades of demographic and political change that hit the party’s traditional base, and could endanger more Labour seats in 2024.“Labour’s electoral coalition had been fracturing for a long time and was broken in 2019. We were rejected by many of the communities we were founded to represent,” says the report, seen by the . “We lost all types of voters everywhere compared with 2017, except in London.”Using interviews with senior party figures, as well as previously unpublished polling and new analysis, the report identifies significant shortcomings in the election campaign, which followed 18 months of debilitating parliamentary wrangles over Brexit.• Labour “went into the 2019 election without a clear strategy of which voters we needed to persuade or how”, and failed to settle on a coherent message with the power of 2017’s “For the many, not the few”.• “It was unclear who was in charge” of the election campaign, and relationships were soured by years of infighting which had created a “toxic culture” and “significant strategic and operational dysfunction”.• Labour was outgunned by the Tories in the digital war, with messages poorly coordinated and most of them failing to reach beyond the party’s base.• Helped by their clear “Get Brexit done” message, the Conservatives succeeded in turning out 2 million previous non-voters, accounting for two thirds of the increase in their vote share.• Labour’s seat targeting was “unrealistic” and “not evidence-based”, and many candidates felt they did not receive enough support from the national party.Labour Together was set up to unite MPs and activists from different traditions, a number of whom – including the former leader Ed Miliband, Steve Reed, Lisa Nandy and Jim McMahon – have been given prominent roles in the shadow cabinet of Corbyn’s successor, Keir Starmer.The 2019 Election Review was prepared by a 15-strong panel of commissioners, including Miliband, the Manchester Central MP, Lucy Powell, James Meadway, who advised the former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, and the Birmingham Ladywood MP, Shabana Mahmood.They find that Corbyn’s leadership was a “significant factor” in the 2019 result. His public approval ratings collapsed at around the time a group of Labour MPs including Luciana Berger and Chuka Umunna left to found the Independent Group, citing antisemitism within Labour and its Brexit policy.The report says: “‘Stop Jeremy Corbyn’ was a major driver of the Conservatives’ success across all their key groups including previous non-voters, and among all the swing voters Labour lost to the Tories.”Had Corbyn been as popular in December as he was two years earlier, Labour’s vote share could have been 6 percentage points higher, the analysis finds.When it came to Labour’s radical manifesto, launched at an upbeat rally in Birmingham, the analysis found that inidual policies were popular, but doubts about the leadership stoked a perception that the package as a whole was not deliverable.A Datapraxis analysis of YouGov data found that “many came to the conclusion that the manifesto as a whole was unrealistic, risky and unlikely to be delivered. This undermined the positive response to inidual policies, making them seem less credible.”It shows that 2017’s better-than-expected performance masked the fact that Labour’s vote share had continued to decline in a string of heartland seats – many of which the party went on to lose to the Conservatives two years later.“Despite now representing fewer constituencies than at any time since 1935, Labour cannot afford to be complacent about the seats it currently holds,” the report says.And if Labour fails to “reverse its fortunes in Scotland in a significant way” it will have to win a swath of English seats, right up to Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg’s in North East Somerset, to secure a majority.Starmer, who became Labour leader in April, has so far announced few new policies, instead focusing on strongly criticising aspects of the government’s coronavirus pandemic response.The forward-looking section of the Labour Together review is based partly on a “coalition-building” workshop, bringing together “urban remainers” from London and Manchester, and leavers from towns in Lancashire and Yorkshire.Carried out by the consultancy firm Britain Thinks, the exercise identified common ground, including a “strong and unifying desire for economic transformation of their lives”.“This was particularly notable in relation to issues which affect their personal security and lives issues ranging from social housing and rent controls, to decent pay and living standards, as well as significant investment in their local infrastructure and amenities, like high streets, town centres and decent employers,” the report says.It recommends that Labour focus on trying to build a coalition around the idea of transformational economic change rooted in voters’ own lives and problems, and combine this with rebuilding “trust and credibility” in the party.“We believe there is a way ahead for Labour to win the next election, but the road is hard and the journey will not be easy,” it concludes. Starmer and Labour’s new general secretary, David Evans, are expected to pay close attention to the report.Allies of Corbyn insist Brexit – not his leadership – was the overriding factor behind the election result, and lay some of the blame at Starmer’s door for pushing the party towards a pro-referendum position. They are irked that the report’s authors did not interview several key figures, including party directors Karie Murphy and Seumas Milne, the former general secretary Jenny Formby, and Corbyn himself.Jon Trickett and Ian Lavery, the two most outspoken proponents of Brexit in Corbyn’s deeply ided top team, said: “Let’s be clear, people lost trust in Labour after failing to deliver change after 13 years in government. This was brought to a head when the party ignored the democratic vote for Brexit it was the excuse that allowed loyal Labour voters to finally break with a party they felt had been ignoring them for far too long.“Time and time again we warned the shadow cabinet that yielding to the pressures for the party to become more pro-remain and supportive of a second referendum would inflict damage on Labour’s election chances.”A Labour spokesperson said: “We thank everyone who contributed to this independent report. Its attempt to understand the challenges and opportunities facing the Labour party is welcome and we will read it carefully. By harnessing our collective skills and energy we will build a party and a movement that wins again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f36a8b4ece836161a7672b3ce57b666d539e142/785_808_5879_3528/master/5879.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=aac66ceb943694be7b863d408f6fe3e1","title":"cern poised to back plan for 20bn successor to large hadron collider","story":"Proposed 100km circular tunnel would be four times as big and six times as powerful as LHCAs the largest scientific instrument on the planet enters its twilight years, Cern scientists have been facing the question of what next after the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Following extensive debate, they appear to have landed on an answer: go bigger or go home.Cern’s council is expected to announce its backing on Friday for a proposed new collider with a 100km circular tunnel, four times the size and six times as powerful as the LHC. A formal vote on the plan is due to go ahead on Friday.The proposed particle-smashing machine, referred to as the Future Circular Collider (FCC), would allow scientists to hunt for particles and other new phenomena at higher energies, study the Higgs boson with greater precision, and may offer insights into dark matter.Speaking before Cern’s council meeting, Prof Jon Butterworth, of University College London, said a scaled-up collider would allow scientists to make unprecedented measurements of nature at the subatomic scale. “It’s probing nature at the shortest distances and looking for the smallest things we can see … it’s a real exploratory mission,” he said. “Everyone agrees that’s what we need to do. The question has been: what’s the best machine to do it?”But some question whether the scientific promise of the gigantic machine justifies the anticipated €20bn price tag for construction.If approved in Friday’s vote, Cern is expected to assess the technical and financial feasibility of the FCC, with initial efforts going into a geological survey to check there are no underground lakes or other show-stopping features beneath Geneva that would require the plan to be reconsidered. Research and development efforts into high-field superconducting magnets and other technologies required for the proposed collider will also be ramped up.There is no guarantee the machine will be built. Capital investment from EU member states and other Cern participants such as the UK will be required for construction to go ahead – and a commitment to continue funding operations into the 2050s. If the financial backing is secured, construction could begin within a decade and it would take 10 years to build, meaning it would not be operational until the 2040s.The FCC proposal won out against alternative visions of what to do when the LHC winds down around a decade from now. Competing plans included a large linear collider, which some viewed as a safer option because it could have been extended in stages, whereas the size of a circular collider must be decided at the outset. A circular collider has the advantage of being able to house more experiments along the same tunnel.The planned machine would be built up in stages. For the first phase, the FCC would collide electrons and their positive counterparts, positrons. Then it would collide electrons with much heavier nuclei of lead atoms. By the 2050s, it could be smashing protons together with an energy of 100 teraelectronvolts (TeV), around six times higher than the LHC’s maximum capability.The new machine would act as a “Higgs factory”, allowing scientists to target the production of large numbers of Higgs bosons and study more precisely how they decay, which has not been possible with the LHC. Some theories suggest the Higgs particle may decay into dark matter particles, the nature of which remains one of the central mysteries in modern physics. “If there’s any missing, you know there’s something weird going on,” said Butterworth.Moving to higher energy regimes could also uncover new phenomena yet to be predicted. However, there is not the same guaranteed win that the LHC offered before it was built, when scientists knew the collider would sweep through the predicted energy range for the Higgs and either confirm its existence or prove that theoretical physics needed a complete overhaul.“With the LHC, we knew we’d either find the Higgs or break the Standard Model, and that’s a very luxurious position to be in,” said Butterworth. “There is no equivalent scenario now, it’s much more exploratory. It’s definitely higher risk.”The LHC itself has highlighted the uncertain nature of progress. Many hoped that after finding the Higgs, further questions in fundamental physics would be resolved, such as a hypothesis called supersymmetry, which predicts that subatomic particles that make up normal matter possess mirror, or supersymmetrical, versions of themselves. However, the LHC is yet to observe any supersymmetric entities, or any dark matter particles, which had also been in scientists’ sights.Sabine Hossenfelder, a theoretical physicist at the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies in Germany, said open-ended exploration and the refining of existing knowledge was not enough to justify the enormous cost of the proposed machine. “On some level I find it irresponsible,” she said. “Why don’t we put the money into an international centre for climate models or pandemic models?”The LHC is currently being upgraded and is due to restart in May 2021 and run until the end of 2024, with a final run expected to begin at the end of 2027."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2908be29f02f8bd5e839bbf6ecea690c41e66aa4/2_0_2595_1558/master/2595.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3df43c3196a94b903fe78d8b6a21ff73","title":"from bricks to clicks how local high street shops have turned digital during coronavirus","story":"Across the country, many independent retailers have had to switch to digital almost overnight in order to continue trading through the coronavirus lockdown. But as stores begin to reopen, will consumers now be as likely to shop online as in person?The coronavirus lockdown turned the lives of many high street merchants upside down overnight. For those who had little experience of online trading, or had business models that relied entirely on face-to-face sales, the challenge was sudden and daunting. But it was a challenge they knew they had to face.Before the pandemic, Georgina Black, who runs Pretty Shiny Shop, a small independent gift store in Finsbury Park, north London, did very little trade online. “I got maybe three sales a month through my website,” she says. “I didn’t regularly update it and I didn’t even list all my products. I can tell you that had to change fast when the lockdown started.”Since March, she has been painstakingly adding all her products, taking images of them, writing descriptions and listing measurements. “It’s time-consuming because I have no team, but I am starting to see the results. From an average of three sales per month I am now getting on average four or five a day.”After problems with couriers – one package she sent took 10 days to arrive – Black has experimented with different delivery options. She even bought an electric scooter so she could deliver local orders herself. “I’ve enjoyed zipping around the streets,” she says.While it is not clear exactly when trading will go back to normal, Black says that she will continue to push the online side of her business alongside reopening her doors. “It was never a priority before but now I need it to survive because, realistically, footfall is going to drop – people just aren’t going to be as comfortable going into shops. So shop owners need to adapt.”Once lockdown hit, owners of small businesses had to become digitally savvy – and fast. With high street stores having to turn bricks into clicks, Visa has teamed up with industry partners to offer support to them. It hopes to help small businesses across the UK find new and different ways to serve the local people and communities that rely on them.One of Visa’s partners is Shopify, a leading e-commerce platform that powers more than 1m businesses worldwide. With the backing of Visa, Shopify has offered a 14-day free trial for all new small businesses and provided support from experts who can guide, advise, and get small businesses online.Black, who built her website using Shopify, is very much a fan of the platform. “I love Shopify,” she says. “I find it incredibly easy to deal with at the back end. I’m not a very technical person but making changes and adding products really is a breeze.”Visa has also joined forces with Deliveroo. The delivery service has waived the £50 sign-up fee for up to 1,000 small and medium-sized restaurants until 30 June – or on whichever date before then all 1,000 waivers have been taken up – it has also provided a cash payment of £500 to 200 existing small and medium-sized restaurant partners so they could continue operating during coronavirus.More than ever, the platform is helping businesses continue to reconnect with their local communities. The social psychologist and founder of ShopAppy, Jackie Mulligan, says the “resilience and determination” of local businesses during the crisis has been “inspiring”.Independent businesses are the heartbeat of our high streets and local communities, and the backbone of the UK economy. “We keep the local high street looking good and lively,” says Black. “I’ve been so impressed by how the local community has supported local shops. It’s so heartening.”When small, local businesses succeed, everyone in the community reaps the rewards. Recent months have been enormously challenging for them, but with the right support from local customers, online platforms and Visa alike, they can survive and thrive.Shop local.

Many have opted to support local retailers, but can that trend last?Like other shops throughout the UK, the Edward Street Bakery in the West Yorkshire village of Saltaire has been closed throughout lockdown. But as it told its followers on social media “bakers gotta bake (and cook)”, so it has been running bake-a-longs via its Instagram account. From brownies to a peanut butter cornflake tart, fans have been able to join bakery staff in creating their own goodies at home. And as well as keeping customers happy it’s also inadvertently supporting other local businesses as the ingredients for the bake-a-longs can be bought from Mr Whetstone – a local refill shop.Although this might stand out for sounding particularly delicious, it’s far from an isolated instance of an independent retailer finding innovative ways to connect with customers while its doors are closed. Across the country, store owners have shown ingenuity – and the public has been falling back in love with their local high streets as a result.For many years, the fate of the British high street has been a staple of magazine features and newspaper business page reports alike. Yet, in what is perhaps one of the biggest surprises of 2020 – and there have been many – rather than being the death knell for the local shopping scene, coronavirus appears to have sparked a renaissance. Although some stores will not be lifting their shutters when regular trading resumes, others have seen a spike in business.A witness to this shift in shopping habits is Jackie Mulligan, founder of the digital platform ShopAppy, which allows consumers to connect with their local high street online. She says this shift towards shopping locally was initially driven by practicalities.“The sea change that we saw at the beginning of lockdown was a result of the big superstores being unable to give people delivery slots and people didn’t feel safe going into those stores,” says Mulligan. As a result, there was a sudden discovery of local shops, she says.ShopAppy itself experienced a huge growth in customer registrations as people looked for new ways to shop for groceries and essential goods. Over time, these same customers have begun to look for other products too, with gifts and even art becoming more popular. Mulligan says that two-thirds of artists who participated in this year’s online version of a local Makers’ Fair made sales.Furthermore, these new customers are discovering that the local stores have a lot to offer. “They’re reporting that they couldn’t believe how good the fruit and veg was,” says Mulligan, adding that customers have also been wowed by the prices and lack of packaging.Ensuring new habits stickThe challenge for local shop owners is to ensure that this shift in consumer spending habits continues longer term. How can they capitalise on this current upsurge?Retailers need to act now, says Mulligan. “You can close your shop but still trade. You can close your cafe but still offer something. The key is to make it easy for customers to support local.”The Edward Street Bakery offers one example of how to do this other examples include allowing customers to ring up with orders or book appointments to visit the store.Another option is to take advantage of the special offer to join ShopAppy for free until the end of July and connect with local consumers through that platform. “However ambitious you are, it’s difficult to save the high street on your own,” says Mulligan.“People have turned to corner shops and local shops and we don’t want them to go back to old habits. We want them to have a bit more of a local choice when doing their shopping – supporting local is for life, not just for lockdown.”Shop local.

It prosecuted 661 people for animal abuses and gave out more than 48,000 advice and welfare notices to help owners improve how they care for their animals.“We know this is a really difficult time for our staff and the proposals we are putting forward have not been taken lightly. This is an incredibly challenging time for charities – the current crisis has exacerbated an already difficult financial situation our organisation faces,” the chief executive, Chris Sherwood, said.“We are a large animal charity offering many welfare services for pets, wildlife, farm animals and research animals both here and abroad. We are the only charity with a team of inspectors across England and Wales going out 365 days a year, rescuing animals and then caring for, treating and rehabilitating those animals, sometimes for many months on end, which is incredibly costly.”Charities in the UK lost almost a third of their expected income during the first two months of lockdown, according to the Institute of Fundraising (IoF) and Charity Finance Group (CFG), with donation levels over the year expected to plunge by nearly half as the recession takes hold.Caron Bradshaw, the chief executive of the CFG, said: “This isn’t about the survival of the institution of charity, or inidual charities, but the devastating impact that this will have on those who rely on the services charities provide.”Peter Lewis, the chief executive of the IoF, said: “The government urgently needs to review and enhance its emergency support for charities, with a further bespoke package of support, an extension to the job retention scheme specifically supporting those charitable activities which are still unable to take place, or both.”The survey is broadly in line with an analysis published last week by the charity Pro Bono Economics that estimated a £10bn shortfall for the sector by Christmas.In April, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced £750m of extra funding for frontline charities across the UK, a move that was criticised as not going far enough to save many third-sector organisations from collapse."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a583b76bf0dab70cbc6a77b9d69b32fb57cf6f8/0_168_4362_2618/master/4362.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7da833cb101d72ec4e40d62b62d049fe","title":"rfu may urge england fans against singing swing low slavery","story":"The Rugby Football Union is conducting a review into the singing of Swing Low, Sweet Chariot by England supporters, admitting that many of them are unaware of its origins as a song about slavery.England fans have previously been criticised for “cross-cultural appropriation of a US slave song” by academics, and the Black Lives Matter movement has brought renewed focus on its airing at Twickenham and matches abroad.Maro Itoje recently described the background of the song as “complicated” and the RFU – aware that the lyrics are plastered all over Twickenham – is set to take action. The union told the  it is reviewing the song’s “historical context” and acknowledged the need to educate supporters.The RFU did not rule out urging supporters not to sing the song altogether at a time when institutions in England with historical links to slavery are coming under increasing pressure to act.Sell-out crowds will not return to Twickenham in the short term but the RFU’s chief executive, Bill Sweeney, is optimistic England could host up to 40,000 fans this autumn if the government relaxes its physical distancing rule to one metre.An RFU spokesperson said: “The RFU has stated we need to do more to achieve ersity and we are determined to accelerate change and grow awareness. The Swing Low, Sweet Chariot song has long been part of the culture of rugby and is sung by many who have no awareness of its origins or sensitivities. We are reviewing its historical context and our role in educating fans to make informed decisions.”It is believed the song was first sung at Twickenham when Martin “Chariots” Offiah was playing in the 1987 Middlesex Sevens tournament. The following year it became a popular refrain among England supporters when Chris Oti scored a hat-trick against Ireland. The song’s origins are rooted in US slavery however and it is believed to have been written by the American slave Wallace Willis around the 1860s.England players have often spoken of the lift they get from the crowd when Swing Low, Sweet Chariot echoes around the stadium and supporters were urged to sing it during the haka when England last hosted New Zealand in November 2018. During his time as national captain, however, Dylan Hartley admitted he was unaware of the song’s origins and a number of other England players have said the same.This week Sweeney vowed to increase ersity within the RFU following the appointment of Genevieve Glover as chair of the union’s ersity and inclusion implementation working group. There has never been a black member of the RFU’s 14-strong board and of the 55 council members only Maggie Alphonsi is black. “We have undertaken some very good initiatives at the grassroots level to encourage more erse participation however, that in itself is not enough,” said Sweeney. “We need to do more to achieve ersity across all areas of the game including administration.”The RFU was also one of a number of sporting bodies to sign a statement pledging a commitment to tackling inequality within sport. “The appalling death of George Floyd, the global protests that have followed and the powerful message of the Black Lives Matter movement has made every section of society take notice and confront an ugly truth,” said the statement.“Systemic change must be made at all levels so that we can become truly reflective of our wonderfully erse society. We can no longer rely on black role models at the elite level speaking out, we must join together to become better and to support every member of the sport and recreation community.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e260632eaf9aa75cc45679bb2ec9b1bd8a597837/0_312_4687_2813/master/4687.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58073b80e02213d9411f5a600b62a2fe","title":"mlb restart standoff owners players","story":"Not only has baseball squandered a golden opportunity to have the stage to itself, but the damage of a self-destructive standoff between millionaires and billionaires could prove irreparableThe perennial hand-wringing over Major League Baseball’s waning popularity and relevancy amid the hastening pace of American life, a tradition dating back more than a century, is not entirely without merit. Average attendance at major league ballparks hit a 16-year low in 2019. Little League participation is down. A Gallup poll shows baseball, which ceded the practical if not symbolic mantle of national pastime to the NFL decades ago, is falling behind basketball in popularity among fans in the United States. The median age for last year’s World Series inched upward yet again from the year before to 56.9.Anecdotally, I’d venture to guess the average person on the street couldn’t name 10 current players.And yet MLB’s gross revenues, which include league-wide multimedia contracts worth guaranteed billions and often lucrative broadcasting deals at the local level that leverage the sport’s robust regional audiences, have enjoyed steady growth over the past decade and a half, climbing to a record $10.7bn last year. Only last week, MLB agreed to a cable TV rights deal with Turner worth $3.2bn.It’s against this curious backdrop – a short-term bull market under a long-term bearish trend – that MLB finds itself mired in a wildly self-destructive stalemate between the owners and the players that threatens to drag it toward the margins for good.Baseball had a golden opportunity to become the first major American sport to return from the coronavirus pandemic, offering a sense of normalcy amid the national trauma of the last three months. And that’s putting aside the obvious self-interest of having the stage to itself before a captive audience, reconnecting with lapsed fans and getting in front of the younger eyeballs it’s desperate to attract while ESPN has resorted to airing marble racing and cherry-pit spitting.The players claim they’re being shortchanged with their pro-rated salaries, being made to subsidize the owners’ anticipated losses with increased health risk after years of not tasting the profits, and have made no secret of their willingness to take their ball and go home. The owners claim it’s necessary given the smaller-than-expected revenues with ticket sales out of the equation. But as both sides have dug in and spent months trading offers and counter-proposals, the NBA, NHL and MLS have put together plans to restart in July with a fraction of the hassle, while boxing, mixed martial arts, the PGA Tour and Nascar have all adapted on the fly and found ways to resume activity without fans.Baseball has been here before, done in from within by ego and greed. The infamous work stoppage during the homestretch of the 1994 season led to the cancellation of the World Series for the first time in 90 years, an unforced error it took the sport a decade to recover from. Yet there’s every reason to believe it would face a steeper uphill climb in today’s climate if that doomsday scenario were to repeat itself. Baseball games are longer and slower than ever before at a time when young people are growing up on the commercial-less experiences served up by MLS and the Premier League, which airs matches on free-to-air NBC. The gravity of these existential problems is almost enough to make us forget the sport is fresh off a sign-stealing scandal that shook the public trust in the game.A year without baseball will drive home a point that no one involved should want: that we can live without it. Both sides made it clear they’re taking its place in the American consciousness for granted. After punting on an unprecedented opportunity to bring in new fans, baseball can only shift its focusing on holding on to the ones it’s got."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a8c224ef28313a5be652cadf9dd48b149e53053/0_351_5260_3156/master/5260.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81402a6a4879a0ab4c500c47cfc3e782","title":"royal ascot day four horse racing commonwealth cup live updates","story":"Once again, we kick off with a fiendish new handicap ... well, not that new as there used to be a three-year-old sprint handicap at the Royal meeting, called the Balmoral, but it disappeared some years ago.

Never Dark is from a zippy family and his mum won the Wokingham 13 years back. He made all at Kempton on his handicap debut but this is his first turf start. Maystar won in Qatar in December and went close in a French Listed race in March, so he won’t wilt for lack of experience.Hayley Turner has tweeted her thanks for all the congratulations following her success at Royal Ascot yesterdayA traditional flutter for racegoers in the build up to the action is the colour of the Queen’s hat, and I’ve been told that in the absence of the Royal Procession, Bettingexpert have started putting together a fun set of odds for ITV Racing’s Francesca Cumani’s headpiece.

After all, his career total at the Royal meeting was five but three of those came last year and perhaps that should have been the sign that he’s going to be a perennial contender now. O’Brien has four seconds, more than the top two put together, so he’ll be in pole position if he can get to the same winner total as them, and he has plenty of bullets yet to fire. William Haggas, Charlie Appleby and Saeed bin Suroor are among the big names yet to get on the board.Top trainer best odds:1-2 O’Brien, 7-2 Gosden, Varian.Jim Crowley 6 winsRyan Moore 3James Doyle 2Frankie Dettori 2Andrea Atzeni 1Oisin Murphy 1Martin Dwyer 1Thore Hammer Hansen 1Rossa Ryan 1Hayley Turner 1Crowley came here with a career total of five Royal Ascot wins, spread over the previous nine years. He has had an amazing week and it would be cruel if he did not now end it as top jockey, but, looking at the bookings for the next two days, Moore is still a live runner. Dettori got his second winner of the week in the Gold Cup and has plenty to be satisfied about but it seems we are not going to get a repeat of last year’s heroics. Rossa Ryan got his first winner at the Royal meeting, while Hayley Turner has now won the Sandringham two years in a row and both times at 33-1. Tom Marquand is still waiting for his first winner here he’s had a couple of seconds this week and gets four more chances today, including on Born With Pride, the likely favourite for the Queen’s Vase.Top jockey best odds:4-6 Crowley, 9-4 Moore, 12-1 Doyle, 20-1 Dettori.Ascot clerk of the course Chris Stickels has been out on the track and has the latest update on the going and conditions1.15pm Palace Of Holyroodhouse HandicapArt Power 2-11.50pm Albany StakesMahale 10-1 (14s in places)2.25pm Norfolk StakesImperial Force 9-13.00pm Hardwicke StakesElarqam 5-23.35pm Commonwealth CupPierre Lapin 4-14.10pm Queen’s VaseBerkshire Rocco (nap) 4-14.40pm Duke Of Edinburgh HandicapGood Birthday (nb) 8-1Most of these are proving fairly popular, with the exception of Pierre Lapin. It’s odds to see some opposition to him, given how hot Roger Varian has been this week.After what was basically a dry night at Ascot, the official going for day four of the Royal meeting has been changed to good-to-soft on the straight course and soft, good-to-soft in place on the round, which is, by my count at least, the fifth change since Tuesday morning (and please don’t write to the editor if I’ve managed to miss a couple, it’s been that kind of week).The TurfTrax map on the Ascot going hub shows the contrast between the rate of drainage on the straight – which was relaid when the course was rebuilt from scratch 15 years ago – and the loop for the longer races, which wasn’t. The difference between the two is likely to increase over the next couple of days if, as expected, further rain is sporadic, but that does not matter quite so much today as the feature event – the Group One Commonwealth Cup – is a six-furlong sprint for three-year-olds.This is the youngest of the Group One races at the meeting, having been introduced – and, a little controversially, immediately awarded the coveted Group One status – in 2015. It has since fully justified that decision, however, rapidly becoming one of the highlights of the week.This year’s renewal is another cracker, bringing together horses that have been aimed at this race for many months (Pierre Lapin, Golden Horde) alongside others that tried their luck in a Guineas at Newmarket or the Curragh and did not quite get home. With Kimari, from Wesley Ward’s stable in the States, adding a transatlantic interest with Frankie Dettori up, it promises to be some spectacle.It really is now or never for any jockey hoping to overhaul Jim Crowley’s total of six winners so far and claim the prize for the leading rider of the week, as Crowley has just two rides today – including Elarqam, the favourite for the Hardwicke Stakes – while James Doyle has five mounts, and Ryan Moore and Frankie Dettori have six apiece.Crowley is a 4-7 chance to become the jockey other than Moore, Dettori and Johnny Murtagh to win the prize since 2007, while Moore – who rides Anthony Van Dyck, last year’s Derby winner and the second-favourite, in Elarqam’s race – is 9-4, with Doyle at 12-1 and Dettori on 20-1. If Elarqam wins, it is probably game over.Chris Cook’s selections for the fourth day are here, and the action is underway at 1.15."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/062bc6080733b47702b23be89a3e67e08afe9aba/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58350efe3c2cbc2a56c747f84e5856c9","title":"dancers lockdown new york coronavirus","story":"Performers used to gracing the world’s stages are now in confinement. But, as one says, ‘When you restrict your options, sometimes creativity is born’by  Alexandra Villarreal in New York“Dance, even if you have nowhere to do it but your living room.”Mary Schmich, a Chicago Tribune columnist, shared that off-the-cuff advice in a 1997 dispatch to graduating seniors. Decades later, as the coronavirus pandemic continues to wreak havoc across the US, her suggestion reads eerily prescient: dancers have suddenly lost the luxury of studios and stages, where they could stretch, travel and fly across space.But artists are not always good at sitting still, and dancers of all stripes have found ways to stay active, even as their profession entered hibernation in the city that never sleeps. And, thanks to both wifi and social media, the world has been watching.Fans of HBO Max’s new reality series Legendary may recognize the name: Sydney Baloue. It’s appeared on their screens for weeks now, next to a producer credit.As the show – which pits voguing houses against one another for a $100,000 prize – marked its first season, the energized crowds who were taped inside a Stamford, Connecticut, venue seem from a distant, bygone age. They’re packed together and cheering, expressing themselves in ways that feel familiar, jarring and enviable all at once.Baloue commuted between Connecticut and New York City for two months to produce Legendary on the last day of filming in March, that booming, warm audience was no longer there as the pandemic took hold of the east coast.“If anything, I feel like now is kind of the most disappointing time because it’s pride month, and this is usually when everything is happening,” Baloue said.“I feel like there’s always been sort of multiple parts to my dance practice, just because ballroom is multiple things,” Baloue said. “It’s music, it’s dance, it’s fashion, it’s all this stuff. And then for me, my big thing is writing and documenting, and making sure those stories don’t get lost.”Baloue is doing yoga, push-ups and dance classes from his room in Brooklyn, confined to an area roughly the size of two yoga mats. He misses being able to book a studio and have the room to try cool tricks. But ballroom has “always been something that was born out of scarcity”.“You know, life gives us lemons, and we will make lemon meringue pie,” Baloue said.Tap dancers need a specific surface to practice, but the 2ft-by-4ft wooden board Vikas Arun has in his home in Harlem, New York City, doesn’t provide much space. That’s both “a blessing and a curse”, he thinks.“When you restrict your options sometimes is when the creativity is born,” he said.Arun has had to negotiate with his neighbors to agree on times when he can loudly shuffle and clank in his tap shoes. When he records his classes, he knows his makeshift set-up is laughable: a phone on the ground, in a dryer sheet bag, tilted forward to at least show his feet.It’s a stark contrast with his life pre-pandemic. In early 2020, he closed out a tour with Mystic India, a Bollywood show that took him across the US and abroad. He had started gearing up for a busy summer season with Project Convergence – the company he co-founded to combine bharatanatyam, a classical Indian dance form, with tap – and was finalizing summer tour contracts and lining up gigs at weddings.Then came Covid-19, and a mass wave of cancellations. The sudden income loss has been scary for Arun, both as a freelancer and a business owner who feels responsible for his dancers.But instead of retreating into his Ivy League engineering degree, he’s pushing full steam ahead with a three-act show, overcoming audio-video sync issues to casually set choreography for willing dancers over Zoom and Google Meet. Much like Project Convergence itself, the new repertoire will explore how “there’s no one definition of what it means to be multicultural”, but “you can still do it without losing part of your identity”.“People feel like they have to wait for something to come their way before they create,” he said. “And I think the biggest thing I’ve learned from this is … there’s no reason for you to wait. Just do it. And then, you know, the rest will come.”Camille A Brown lives five minutes from her mother in Queens, New York City. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, they still sometimes meet for walks, at a distance.“There are days that I just want to hug my mom, but I’m so scared,” she said. “And I just think, wow, what is it gonna feel like when I actually do get to hug my mom? I probably won’t let go.”Brown’s artistic calendar is filled with postponed gigs and on-hold theater projects, including her Broadway directorial debut. But “right now, it’s not necessarily about being a choreographer”, she said.“I don’t want to go back and be the same person that I was. I want to have evolved and want to have learned from this situation.”Nor is she itching for the performing arts to return to “normal” – because “what was normal?”“I am a woman, and I’m black. And sexism and racism are things that I have to deal with on a daily basis,” Brown said. “I know that I have to work 20 times harder than other people. And that’s tough, and it’s frustrating. And I would like to see the playing field leveled.”Brown was recently contacted by someone who wanted to apologize for what’s happening in the US right now, where black Americans are disproportionately affected by coronavirus and and police violence. But people have to understand that this isn’t a new phenomenon it’s a manifestation of “centuries of oppression”, Brown said.“It has to go beyond saying I’m sorry,” she said. “There has to be action.”Calvin Royal III was on tour when he crash-landed with a sprained ankle during his final dress rehearsal for a premiere. Then, the American Ballet Theatre’s calendar went suddenly blank because of a pandemic, and it felt like falling all over again. A soloist with ABT, Royal was slated for three principal debuts at Lincoln Center during the company’s stacked performance schedule. Now, he’s doing physical therapy over FaceTime and training inside a 500 sq ft home.“It’s almost like in one week’s time, we went from having everything to having nothing. And so it’s been quite a rollercoaster, I would say,” Royal said.He’s grateful to be safe, and to have a place to shelter. Although he’s kept journals ever since moving to New York, there’s more time to write nowadays. And he finally has the leisure to reach for his long-neglected bookshelf, pull down The Untethered Soul or Becoming, and find a corner to read.He’s still collaborating on a virtual reality project around his and Misty Copeland’s highly anticipated turns as Romeo and Juliet in May, they were supposed to make history as ABT’s first-ever African American duo in the titular roles. When the world’s stages finally reopen – and “that day will come”, he says – he knows he needs to be ready. After a long hiatus, he’ll have even more reason to portray characters such as Romeo the way he wants.“I think that’s what I’m looking forward to most,” Royal said. “I’ll be able to bring that experience of really these dreams that have been deferred for me to those roles, and they’ll be deepened in ways that maybe they wouldn’t have been had I done them this year.”During Val Chmerkovskiy and Jenna Johnson’s time in quarantine, they’ve celebrated both their birthdays and a first wedding anniversary. So they have decorated their house, mapped out a scavenger hunt, eaten dinner outside – small, creative gestures to make each other feel special.“This time has definitely slowed our life down, refocused our priorities and allowed us to really appreciate the things that we love and find important in our life,” Chmerkovskiy said.The Dancing With the Stars veterans have grown accustomed to their fast-paced lifestyle for the past seven years, where they shoot a season of the TV show in Los Angeles, then immediately hit the road. Now, their tour dates are all cancelled or postponed.“I think especially as dancers, creators, movers, you have to keep using that artistic side of you, or else you’re gonna go crazy,” said Johnson.They’ve shot videos for audiences around the world and hosted free Zoom classes for medical professionals. In May, they danced in The Disney Family Singalong, Volume II, which reached millions of viewers.But when they visited Johnson’s family for Mother’s Day, they gave a much more intimate performance. With a Bluetooth speaker and a 100ft extension cord, they swayed and spun streetside, in workout gear, for Johnson’s socially distanced grandparents, who were supposed to see them on tour in Utah before the pandemic hit.“Val and I decided to –”“Show ’em how we’re thriving,” the couple joked.“It didn’t take much from us,” Johnson said. “But that simple act truly made their whole Covid-19 experience a little bit better.”When studios shuttered, Kara Chan moved online with choreographer Pam Tanowitz for a virtual rehearsal.“It’s definitely different because you’re not feeling the energy of the dancers, and I’m on a small screen trying to hear her from far away, but making sure that she can see me,” Chan said. “So I guess those are the limitations. But 10 years ago I don’t think rehearsing virtually would have been even an option.”Chan was supposed to be working on a new project right now, and would have performed with Tanowitz’s company in London last month. But – virtual rehearsal notwithstanding – Covid-19 laid siege to her plans. So, instead of waiting in New York City, she’s thousands of miles away at her childhood home in Vancouver, meditating, playing piano and going on nature walks.“That’s been very nurturing and grounding, just being able to escape into the forest,” Chan said.She does ballet in the mornings over Zoom, “because taking class for me is like medicine”. But, after working on a whopping four projects in February, she’s also used the past few months to “reconnect with myself, with family – the things that really matter”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/482a012d665b909ee775042f6a815f7dec20bf0d/791_301_3453_2072/master/3453.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8346053cbc49b5f1d99bbbc21e2fe281","title":"surface earbuds review microsofts airpods rivals","story":"Novel design blends open-ear but secure fit with good sound, great controls and long battery lifeMicrosoft has finally launched a competitor to Apple’s AirPods and Samsung’s Galaxy Buds+ with its Surface Earbuds – and they are just a little bit different from the rest.The Surface Earbuds cost £199.99 and only come in grey. Their distinctive design certainly stands out.Instead of having stalks that hang down or looking like traditional earbuds, the Surface Earbuds are large circular discs with an earbud on one side. The outside world just sees a big, grey circle that resembles a large earring.The fit of the earbuds is also different. They sit in your ear without entering your ear canal, similar to Apple’s AirPods, but with a silicone tip that wedges against the inside of your concha with a small wing.Like the AirPods they do not block out any background noise. But are much more stable in the ear once twisted into place: no matter how hard I danced around, ran or shook my head they stayed in place. The earbuds feel light and are among the more comfortable options, despite being large and weighing a comparatively heavy 7.2 grams each. I could wear them for more than two hours without taking a break.The Surface Earbuds support Bluetooth 5 connectivity and the basic SBC and higher quality aptX audio standards, which is great for Windows PCs and Android smartphones, but lack of support for the higher quality AAC used with all Apple devices is a shame.Their connection to various Windows 10 PCs with either Bluetooth 4.2 or 5, a OnePlus 8 Pro, Samsung Galaxy Z Flip and an iPad Pro was strong and reliable. I could not, however, test their performance in congested areas because of government restrictions to stem the coronavirus pandemic in the UK.The Surface Earbuds support Microsoft’s Swift Pair for Windows 10 and Google’s Fast Pair for Android for one-tap pairing that works brilliantly. Pairing them to an iPhone or iPad requires the traditional manual process using the Settings app.The earbuds connect to only one device at a time, but you can switch devices by simply hitting connect on your phone or PC without having to first disconnect a previous device. The earbuds announce whether they are connected to a phone or a PC. Unlike most true wireless earbuds, you can only use the right Surface Earbud on its own, not the left.The large grey discs are giant touch panels for a great set of tap-and-swipe gesture controls. On either bud, double tap for pauseplay, triple tap to start playing music from Spotify on Android or tap and hold to activate your smartphone’s voice assistant. Double tap to answer or hang up on a call. Swipe up or down on the right earbud to change volume and forwards or backwards on the left earbud to skip a track.The Surface Earbuds sound surprisingly good considering their open fit. They offer a fairly wide soundstage, reasonable separation of tones and producing crisp highs, well-rounded mids and enough bass to make most tracks sound good. Those seeking really deep bass will have to look elsewhere as it is just not possible with an open earbud design.They lack a little sparkle and detail for expansive orchestral pieces, but they sound good with most other genres out of the box, including rock, rap, pop and high-intensity electronica, and there is also an equaliser to tweak things to your liking.Overall they sound slightly better than the standard AirPods, but will not come close to the best-sounding true wireless earbuds such as Sony’s WF-1000XM3 and Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 2.Call quality was pretty good too, with the other end saying I sounded clear but a little distant. My end was loud, clear and crisp in stereo, but background noise is an issue as they do not isolate.The earbuds slot into place inside a small, flip-top hard-plastic case for charging and storage, where they are held in place by magnets. The case is larger than that for the Galaxy Buds+ or AirPods, but is still easily pocketable and just about fits into the money pocket in a pair of jeans.The Surface Earbuds last for just under eight hours of constant playback. The case can charge the earbuds fully twice, for up to 24 hours of combined battery life. A 10-minute trip in the case is enough to add up to one hour of playback to the earbuds. The case charges via USB-C in an hour.In the process of conducting this review I received two sets of faulty earbuds. Each time the left earbud suffered from a bug that drained the battery in less than 90 minutes, caused it to heat up, not play audio and not switch off when placed in the case, and eventually refuse to charge. At least two users on Microsoft’s community forums appear to be affected by the same issue.A Microsoft spokesperson said: “All of our products undergo extensive quality testing to ensure that they provide customers with the best possible experience, and so we’re sorry to hear of this particular occurrence. We are currently investigating the issue that affected performance in the case of these earbuds.”A third set worked as intended for the last several weeks of the review period.The Microsoft Surface Earbuds are a bit different from the rest of the true wireless earbuds. They are one of very few good earbuds that offer an open-ear design alongside the AirPods. If you do not like having your ear canal blocked and are not keen on AirPods, the Surface Earbuds are great.But they suffer the same problem as the AirPods: they don’t block out any noise. That’s great for awareness of your surroundings, but if you’re trying to concentrate in a busy office or hear your music on a commute, when those things are allowed again, they will be no good.Despite being comfortable and secure in your ear – with good sound, long battery life and a pocketable case – they are big and attention-grabbing. People will look at you wearing these on the street. Two faulty sets is also a worry, and the lack of AAC support is disappointing to Apple users.They are certainly not cheap nor the best or feature-rich true wireless earbuds out there, but the Surface Earbuds are a decent alternative to the AirPods if you like design. Not bad for a first try.Pros: open fit that doesn’t enter your ear canal, secure fit, good sound, long battery life, good case, great controls, USB-C, good calling, apps for Windows 10, Android and iOS, apt XCons: no AAC for Apple, no isolation, no noise cancelling, can’t connect to two devices at the same time, no pause on remove, expensive This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

The bus has long attracted adventurers to an area without cellphone service and marked by unpredictable weather and at-times swollen rivers. Some have had to be rescued or have died. Christopher McCandless, the subject of the book and movie, died of starvation there in 1992. The rescue earlier this year of five Italian tourists and death last year of a woman from Belarus intensified calls from local officials for the bus, about 25 miles (40km) from the Parks Highway, to be removed. The Alaska natural resources commissioner, Corri Feige, said the Alaska Army National Guard moved the bus as part of a training mission “at no cost to the public or additional cost to the state”. The Alaska National Guard, in a release, said the bus was removed using a heavy-lift helicopter. The crew ensured the safety of a suitcase with sentimental value to the McCandless family, the release said.Feige said in a statement the bus would be kept in a secure location while her department weighed various options for what to do with it. “We encourage people to enjoy Alaska’s wild areas safely, and we understand the hold this bus has had on the popular imagination,” her statement said. “However, this is an abandoned and deteriorating vehicle that was requiring dangerous and costly rescue efforts. More importantly, it was costing some visitors their lives.” McCandless, a 24-year-old from Virginia, was prevented from seeking help by the swollen banks of the Teklanika River. He wrote in a journal about living in the bus for 114 days, right up to his death. The long-abandoned Fairbanks city bus became famous as a result of the 1996 book by Jon Krakauer, and a 2007 Sean Penn-directed movie, also called Into the Wild. The Department of Natural Resources said the 1940s-era bus had been used by a construction company to house employees during work on an access road in the area and was abandoned when the work was finished in 1961. In March, officials in the Denali Borough based in Healy, about 25 miles from the bus, voted unanimously to be rid of it.

And in April, more than 200 black women leaders and activists within the Democratic party signed an open letter calling on Biden to choose a black woman, noting that “the road to the White House is powered by black women and black women are the key to a Democratic victory in 2020”.Klobuchar, a white, moderate Democrat, has recently had to contend with her past as a prosecutor in the county that includes Minneapolis, where George Floyd was killed. During her tenure, Klobuchar declined to prosecute police accused of using excessive force against black suspects. More than two dozen mostly black and minority people died during encounters with police.Klobuchar, 60, was among a large field of Democrats who had sought the 2020 presidential nomination, running as a pragmatic Midwesterner who had passed over 100 bills. She dropped out and threw her support behind Biden before the crucial 3 March “Super Tuesday” contests after struggling to win support from black voters, who remain crucial to Democratic victories. Her best finish of the primary was in overwhelmingly white New Hampshire, where she came in third.The senator had to cancel one of her final campaign rallies after Black Lives Matter and other activists took the stage in Minnesota to protest her handling as prosecutor of a murder case that sent a black teenager to prison for life.Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina, a Biden ally and highest-ranking black person in Congress, said in the days after Floyd’s death that “this is very tough timing” for Klobuchar.During the 11th Democratic presidential debate, after Klobuchar had dropped out, Biden explicitly committed to picking a woman as vice president and nominating the first African American woman to the supreme court.Klobuchar, who has been an enthusiastic campaign surrogate for Biden, indicated she will continue to support him. In the interview with MSNBC, Klobuchar brushed aside the suggestion that her record as a prosecutor would have affected her ability to function as Biden’s running mate.“I think I could have functioned fine,” she said. “There’s a lot of untruths out there about my record and now is not the time to debate them.”After the interview aired, senior Biden adviser Symone Sanders indicated that she expected Klobuchar back on the campaign trail."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7335c8af40c0db99992784384dc252fd2f9082d/0_422_4803_2884/master/4803.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50db62e825dbc7ee4dc2f3b949b35efd","title":"tell us how has coronavirus affected people living in the north east","story":"We’d like to hear from people in the north-east and Yorkshire about the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreakWe would like to find out about the impact of coronavirus on you and your community.We’d like to hear from people in north-east England including the county of Yorkshire and we’re particularly interested finding out how the pandemic has affected your work and the local economy.

The mother superior and nuns had left the convent “in order to avoid unnecessary strife”, the regional diocese said in a statement. No one has been harmed as of Thursday evening.Romanov is a leader of an Orthodox religious cult of “tsar worshippers” and has legally changed his last name to that of Russia’s last imperial dynasty. He helped found the Sredneuralsk convent in the early 2000s not far from the site where the Bolsheviks buried the tsar and his family in 1918 and tried to dissolve them in acid.A former police officer, Romanov served 13 years in a prison colony for murder before joining the clergy and building a following among firebrand Orthodox believers centred at the Sredneuralsk convent, as well as other sites near Yekaterinburg, where the royal family was executed in 1917.The fundamentalist group has prominent followers among politicians and sport figures and launched vehement protests against the 2017 film Matilda, which depicted an affair between tsar Nicholas II and ballerina Matilda Kshesinskaya. There were several arson attacks targeted against the film’s director and a man drove his car into the facade of a cinema.Romanov’s raid was preceded by an ecclesiastical court hearing on Monday for violating public health orders and publicly cursing other priests who closed their churches due to coronavirus.“I will not leave the house of the mother of God,” said Romanov, referring to the convent, during the religious court. “My heart is calm, my conscience does not reproach me. They, that is the clergy, politan Kirill, will have to take the monastery by storm.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3b05518ab9ed6214572b53a97458fc8e2e8a385/0_282_720_432/master/720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52e23e3b2b6259d43a2af8c973b56037","title":"uk poised to abandon coronavirus app in favour of apple and google models","story":"NHS to switch to alternative design by tech giants, says Matt Hancock in latest U-turnThe government has been forced to abandon a centralised coronavirus contact-tracing app after spending three months and millions of pounds on technology that experts had repeatedly warned would not work.In an embarrassing U-turn, Matt Hancock said the NHS would switch to an alternative designed by the US tech companies Apple and Google, which is months away from being ready.At the Downing Street briefing, the health secretary said the government would not “put a date” on when the new app may be launched, although officials conceded it was likely to be in the autumn or winter.The idea behind the NHS app was that it could trace anybody that a person with coronavirus symptoms came into close contact with by using the Bluetooth connectivity on a standard smartphone, and notify them to self-isolate.Ministers had insisted on using a centralised version of the untested technology in which anonymised data from people who reported feeling ill was held in an NHS database to enable better tracing and data analysis. This version was not supported by Apple and Google.That was because the design of Apple’s iPhone operating system is such that apps quickly go to sleep when they are not being used and cannot be activated by Bluetooth – a point raised by experts and reported by the  in early May.The Department of Health and Social Care refused to say how much had been spent on the effort, although official records show three contracts worth £4.8m were awarded to the developer VMWare Pivotal Labs for work on the app.Silkie Carlo, the director of the privacy charity Big Brother Watch, said: “This just shows what a mess the centralised data-hungry approach was. Government was wrong to waste precious time and millions of pounds of public money on a design that everyone warned was going to fail, and now we’re back at square one.”Hancock had been particularly enthusiastic about the NHS app and had at one point said it would be “rolling out in mid-May” across England. Officials had denied the Apple-Google alternative was being evaluated, although on Thursday it was revealed that in fact work was going on to assess it from 6 May.On Thursday, Hancock said the alternative was not ready either because it could not measure distance accurately. In some cases it cannot distinguish between phones 1 metre and 3 metres away – even though one is inside and one outside the current 2-metre physical distancing limit.Experts say an app would be useful to track the potential spread from an infected person on public transport or in any other situation where they come into contact with people they do not know. But the distance measurement problem means it cannot be relied on to make decisions about who should self-isolate.When asked whether he had unwisely stuck to the wrong approach, Hancock said: “I’m from Newmarket, we back both horses.” He went on to argue that testing the Apple–Google alternative for several weeks meant the government could make the leap from one system to another with confidence.Contact tracing is one of the most basic planks of public health responses to a pandemic\u0026nbsplike the coronavirus. It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was – and always will be – central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014-15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure – originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far. The\u0026nbspWorld Health Organization\u0026nbspsays it should be the “backbone of the response” in every country.Apple did not immediately comment but in a statement on Thursday night, Google said: “We welcome the announcement from the UK government today. We have developed an Exposure Notification API with Apple based on consultation with public health experts around the world, including in the UK, to ensure that our efforts are useful to authorities as they build their own apps to limit the spread of Covid-19, while ensuring privacy and security are central to the design.”Earlier this week Italy and Germany launched their own apps nationwide based on the Google-Apple model. The Italian app has been downloaded 2.7m times, while the German app was taken up 6.5m times on Tuesday, its first day.Speculation about the fate of the NHS app had been circulating for weeks after Hancock’s mid-May deadline was missed. On Wednesday, James Bethell, a junior health minister responsible for the app, told MPs it would not be ready until the end of the year. “We’re seeking to get something going for the winter, but it isn’t a priority for us,” he told a parliamentary committee.At one point it had been hoped that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would also use the app, which is intended for England in its revised form. But the repeated delays had prompted the other nations to reconsider.Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said: “This is unsurprising and yet another example of where the government’s response has been slow and badly managed. It’s meant precious time and money wasted.“For months, tech experts warned ministers about the flaws in their app, which is why we wrote to Matt Hancock encouraging the government to consider digital alternatives back in May.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/684dffacc0681d2d045d79b86fda0cc7c425accf/0_68_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=c96b124fe940872483b7c5ebe9cc4b7e","title":"coronavirus the week explained","story":"Cheap drug yields life-saving results in trial ... new outbreaks in China and New Zealand ... NHS contract tracing app scrappedIt’s a cheap steroid, costing just $1 a course in some countries, but dexamethasone saves lives. The biggest randomised controlled trial of Covid drugs in the world has produced its first breakthrough. Dexamethasone is not a cure-all, but it does prevent the deaths of one in eight people on ventilators, who are the most acutely ill, and one in 25 on other oxygen support. It’s 60 years-old and has been well used in intensive care to reduce inflammation, but there were doubts because it can affect the immune system. A 6,000 patient-strong arm of the Oxford-based Recovery trial showed low dose got results with no problematic side-effects. Within hours the the UK government said the NHS in England would use it and others are expected to follow suit.Following speculation that trials of the UK’s contact tracing app on the Isle of Wight might have uncovered problems, plus the regular sound of ministers swatting away questions, it was finally confirmed that the NHS contact tracing app has been ditched. Baroness Dido Harding, chair of the test and trace programme in England, had been playing down expectations, labelling the app a mere “cherry on the cake”. But it was Lord Bethel, minister for innovation in the department of health, who flagged that something was up on Wednesday, saying that the app would not be ready until the winter and that it was not a priority anyway. People preferred a phone call from a real human being to an app alert in any case.Meanwhile the latest contact tracing statistics from the department show that the teams in the call centres did not reach around a quarter of people testing positive for Covid-19 in the second week of the scheme, between 4 and 10 June.Should we be concerned about air conditioning?

The Chinese authorities locked down neighbourhoods, closed schools and restaurants, restricted travel and set about testing tens of thousands of people. The outbreak was said to be centred on the Xinfadi wholesale food market, but the virus may have come from Wuhan, travelled to Europe and then been reimported to China.On Thursday, scientists published the genetic sequence online. An article published on Friday on the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection’s website said the virus came from Europe but was older than the one currently spreading there. “It could have been hidden in imported frozen food products, or it was lurking in some dark and humid environment such as Xinfadi, with the environment not having been disinfected or sterilised,” it said.The day before, the Commission flagged further concern about markets which, like the one in Huanan that is the prime suspect for the start of the pandemic, sell live animals. The outbreak underlined the urgent need to improve sanitation standards and minimise health risks at markets, said its report. “The epidemic is a mirror that not only reflects the dirty and messy aspects of wholesale markets but also their low level management conditions,” it said.New Zealand also no longer clear of CovidIt was all going so well for New Zealand, which declared it was Covid-free on 8 June and ended restrictions on normal life, to the envy of much of the rest of the world. But then two women, who had travelled from Britain and been released early from what should have been 14-days quarantine to visit a dying relative, tested positive for the virus on Monday.Worse, it emerged that the women had not driven the 400 miles non-stop from Auckland to Wellington, but had met up with friends on the way. Although this was said to be a brief five-minute meeting after the women got lost, some 320 of their contacts are being traced and the New Zealand government is red-faced. The compassionate grounds for an early release from quarantine will no longer be permitted.Sport and shopping return in UKIn England, lockdown restrictions on the high street began to lift, marked by long queues desperate to get into Primark – which does not sell online – and other clothes stores after months away. In Bicester shopping village, crowds formed, leading to calls to close it until social distancing can be maintained. EasyJet resumed a limited number of mostly domestic flights, to concerns that people could not keep their distance on board.The Premier League resumed, with the first match, between Aston Villa and Sheffield United played on Wednesday to an empty stadium and controversy – not over coronavirus and crowds this time, but over a disallowed goal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a239754dc355263d8f2d55a372d143d40741bca2/0_80_2500_1499/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acbd187624a8da0990db3c9d92f7abdd","title":"lamour is in the air again as french kissing returns on screen","story":"Culture minister announces smooching is back on film sets as cinemas reopen in France Actors have started kissing again on French film shoots, the country’s culture minister has said.Franck Riester said kissing had resumed on sets where the actors had been tested for coronavirus.And he insisted l’amour was not completely dead despite the pandemic.The minister told French radio that while shooting in Europe’s biggest film industry was allowed to restart earlier this month, “they waited a bit before doing that kiss that is so important in cinema”.Reister did not say which film or which actors were the first to get back to on-screen smooching.“No, the kiss is not over with,” the politician declared when asked if physical distancing was in danger of killing off love scenes altogether.French cinemas are to reopen on Monday after a three-month closure but with drastic distancing measures that mean they can never be more than half-full."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c20006e5df51f3bb088dec870c8a967aef799076/0_91_5790_3477/master/5790.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb01ae21d82e6176f04911e54f3dd75e","title":"mallorca welcomes a more sedate breed of german tourist","story":"As the first holidaymakers return to Spain, the closure of bars and clubs means partygoers are keeping awayDuring the morning at least, Palma’s S’Arenal beach and its six-kilometre stretch of sand still belongs solely to Mallorcans.Three women, all in late middle age, were admiring the turquoise waters of the Mediterranean as they jogged along the shoreline this week. “I’ve never seen the beach look so beautiful,” said Mercedes Blázquez. “The water’s like glass and the sand is just perfect.”Her sister Lumi agreed. “It’s ine, and we have it all to ourselves,” she said.Both work in hospitality, Mercedes in a hotel and Lumi in a bar, and they know how important tourism is to the economy of the Balearic islands. Even so, they can’t help relishing the tranquility that Spain’s strict Covid-19 lockdown has brought to the archipelago.That tranquility came to a necessary end on Monday, when thousands of German tourists began arriving on the islands as part of a pilot programme to reactivate Spain’s tourism sector.“If there are no tourists, there’s no jobs,” said Mercedes. “And without the Germans, there’s no work.”It is no exaggeration. In 2018, 4.9 million Germany tourists visited the Balearics, more than from any other country. Not for nothing is Mallorca known as the 17th state of Germany.The main streets by the beach in Palma are nicknamed Schinkenstraße (Ham street) and Bierstraße (Beer street), while the party mile by the sand has long gone by the infamous title of Ballermann – German wordplay on slang terms for getting legless and letting go.However, the reason for welcoming Germans back first is not solely economic. The German holiday-makers arriving on 47 flights have been allowed to return because their country’s epidemiological situation is similar to that of the Balearics – and better than the UK’s.Only a few hundred have arrived so far but they’re not hard to spot. Such has been the media interest in the pilot programme that almost every tourist is accompanied by their own camera crew.The broadcaster ARD was there to record the first beach trip of Thomas and Karina Wiendandt, a couple from Finsterwalde in Brandenburg: “It’s raining at home but it’s sunny here!”Bild, meanwhile, documented how Ela and Jörg Hauser from Cologne sipped their first beers while reclining in physically distanced hammocks: “The quality-to-price ratio is amazing!”And then there were Joachim and Anne Hagen, who speak only to the print media: “We’ve come here because it’s quiet. We normally avoid areas such as Ballermann.”Xevi Molas, a psychologist, has been watching the media show with an ironic smile. Having lived by the S’Arenal beach for 34 years, he’s something of an expert on its German visitors.“If they’re young and in a group, all sense of inidual responsibility is dispensed with – and our beautiful beach gets turned into a sewer,” said Molas.Last year he and some friends got so fed up with the summer excesses that they organised a small flashmob.Both the plan and its execution were simple: Molas and 15 others marched on to the beach armed with containers of tortilla de patatas and gazpacho and made straight for the heart of the drunken, sunburned German throng.After sitting down to enjoy their picnic, chatting, and going for a dip, the party set about picking up rubbish from the beach.“They were gobsmacked,” said Molas. “Our aim was to show them the kind of tourism we want on the island: something polite and respectful.”Molas, whose father was a hotelier, is convinced that “another kind of tourism is possible” – and that the pandemic could yet be the catalyst.He is not alone. The regional government of the Balearic islands recently issued a decree banning pub crawls, happy hours and other activities that tend to result in massive alcohol consumption.Today, the move seems a little unnecessary. The virus and the subsequent lockdown have solved the problem in one fell swoop. The doors of bars and clubs such as Bierkönig and Mega-Park are closed, at least for now.The only place open on Schinkenstraße is the San Siro, which is mainly frequented by locals. Martin Funke was leaning against the bar, smoking his first cigarette of the morning. He works for the Grillmeister chain – which specialises in German sausage – and was in a dark mood.“The tourists they’ve brought us are not our target market,” he complained. “And the others won’t come now. The whole season’s been lost.”He lit up another cigarette and added: “The party’s over. Ballermann is dead.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c33d997792057d949de3e3deb9e587ea42b195a9/0_284_4826_2896/master/4826.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1ff8efc86e6a9eed870ac337e6026d4","title":"polish president scales down homophobic rhetoric poland election nears andrzej duda","story":"Andrzej Duda, criticised for attacks on ‘LGBT ideology’, hopes Trump meeting will boost campaignPoland’s president, Andrzej Duda, has attempted to move away from homophobic rhetoric in recent days after attacks on “LGBT ideology” during his re-election campaign drew widespread criticism.Duda, who will travel to the White House next week aiming to receive a pre-election boost from Donald Trump just four days before the vote, made a campaign pledge to “defend children from LGBT ideology”, which he has claimed could be “even more destructive” than communist ideology.In the most homophobic outburst so far, Przemysław Czarnek, an MP from the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party and member of Duda’s campaign team, said during a televised debate on the issue: “Let’s stop listening to these idiocies about human rights. These people are not equal with normal people.”On Wednesday, Duda received the LGBT activist Bart Staszewski at Warsaw’s presidential palace in an apparent attempt to portray a more progressive side. Staszewski said that during the hour-long meeting, he presented Duda with a set of photographs of LGBT teenagers who had killed themselves in Poland in recent years.“I told him that these kids were people, not an ideology, and they committed suicide because others believed they represented some kind of ideology. But he seemed not to feel anything, and did not apologise for anything,” said Staszewski, who refused to shake Duda’s hand at the end of the meeting.“I told him I hope he will see these kids in his nightmares,” he said.PiS has combined rightwing conservatism with wide-ranging social spending programmes, but the coronavirus-induced economic downturn has made campaigning on economic issues harder, leading to the increased rhetoric on “family values”.On Sunday, Duda tweeted in English to accuse a number of media outlets, including the , of spreading “fake news” about his views on LGBT issues. He did not clarify which reports he believed were false or taken out of context.Radosław Fogiel, a PiS MP, claimed it was opposition politicians who had first raised the issue of LGBT rights, but conceded that Duda was distancing himself from some of the more extreme rhetoric. “It won’t disappear, but you can see that Duda is trying to calm some things down, because he doesn’t want the campaign to tear us apart as a nation,” he said.The election was originally scheduled for May, when Duda was riding high in the polls, but was postponed to 28 June because of the coronavirus pandemic. Rafał Trzaskowski, the liberal mayor of Warsaw, entered the race late and is now Duda’s main challenger. A poll this week suggested they would proceed to a second round of voting, with a potential run-off between the two candidates currently too close to call.Trzaskowski, a slick campaigner who speaks multiple languages, has gained momentum since entering the race last month, but is struggling to shake off a reputation as a condescending member of the metropolitan elite and broaden his appeal in the provinces.“Of course he’s talented, and he’s a fully European intellectual, but that’s not necessarily a recommendation in the elections,” said Adam Michnik, the veteran editor of liberal newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza, which has supported Trzaskowski’s candidacy.Government-linked media outlets have attacked Trzaskowski both on his record over LGBT rights and with smears that he represents sinister foreign interests. A source in Trzaskowski’s campaign said it was possible that Duda had gone overboard in the eyes of the public with his attacks on LGBT ideology. “The more they push it, the closer they are to the edge and the more chance they will burn,” he said.However, large swaths of Poland remain deeply conservative, and Trzaskowski has tried hard to avoid firm declarations of support for LGBT rights during the campaign. In the city of Wrocław on Sunday, he addressed a crowd of a few thousand supporters gathered on the main square he spoke about human rights, women’s rights and the rights of children with disabilities, but did not directly address LGBT rights.During a televised debate on Wednesday involving the 11 presidential candidates, all of them male, Trzaskowski said he supported civil partnerships for same-sex couples but then swiftly changed the subject. He declined an interview request from the .The source in Trzaskowski’s team said that, if elected, he would only be willing to work with PiS if they acceded to certain key demands, such as reforming the state television network, which currently functions as a government mouthpiece. The president cannot introduce legislation but has a blocking function, meaning if Trzaskowski wins, he could frustrate much of the PiS legislative agenda.Duda’s campaign team believes the final result could be within one or two percentage points, and are hoping that the surprise intervention by Trump could provide a decisive boost. Poles across the political spectrum are strong supporters of the US and Nato, and an announcement during the White House visit about an increased US troop presence in Poland would be a major boost for Duda on the eve of the vote."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c82375bd8e05d2c5b4f8c9367bbc6ba942ac669/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47a9556b127ede9006f7d01bdd713efd","title":"coronavirus covid 19 live news update us questions beijing cluster figures who vaccine doses latest updates","story":"Researchers working on more than 200 vaccines, says WHO global deaths pass 450,000 Brazil nears 1m cases.

Further samples taken from the same cities in January and February also found traces of Covid-19, while those collected in October and November gave negative results, La Rossa added.Italy’s first locally transmitted coronavirus case was confirmed in Lombardy, the region surrounding Milan, on 20 February, and in Turin, in Piedmont, on 22 February. The virus has so far killed over 16,500 people in Lombardy and 4,032 in Piedmont.The Lombardy region still accounts for the largest daily rise in new infections, with 226 out of 333 cases registered there on Thursday. There were 66 more fatalities on Thursday, 36 in Lombardy, bringing the death toll across the country to 34,514.Although new clusters have emerged since Italy started easing the lockdown in early May, for example in the regions of Lazio and Molise, the virus has mostly been kept at bay, with the widespread use of face masks and physical distancing believed to play a significant role. The Czech Republic reported its biggest one-day jump in new coronavirus cases in two months on Friday, with the daily rise exceeding 100 for only the third time since mid-April, Reuters reports.The number of new cases was 118 on Thursday, the Health Ministry said, the largest daily rise since April 21. The central European country has since May been relaxing rules to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.The country had reported 10,283 cases as of Friday morning, of which almost three quarters have recovered. Its death toll of 334 is a fraction of those seen it its western neighbours.With cases waning, the government has started focusing on localised measures rather than nationwide bans to contain the spread of the virus.According to health officials, the country has two hot spots in Prague and the eastern mining region of Karvina.A potential coronavirus vaccine being developed by China’s Clover Biopharmaceuticals using GlaxoSmithKline’s vaccine booster is now in early-stage testing in humans, the companies said on Friday.Clover said initial safety data from the trial, which is enrolling about 150 adults and also investigating the vaccine in combination with Dynavax’s adjuvant, is expected in August this year, Reuters reports. Chinese officials have released genome data for the coronavirus traced to a recent cluster in Beijing, saying it has similarities to a European strain.China has been under pressure to share the data with the World Health Organisation.It comes after Beijing reported nearly 200 fresh Covid-19 infections. Tens of thousands of people are being tested in the city, where neighbourhoods are under lockdown and schools shut. The cluster has been traced to a sprawling wholesale market in the city.In an article published on Friday on the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection’s website CDC official Zhang Yong said:According to preliminary genomic and epidemiological study results, the virus is from Europe, but it is different from the virus currently spreading in Europe.It’s older than the virus currently spreading in Europe.It could have been hidden in imported frozen food products, or it was lurking in some dark and humid environment such as Xinfadi, with the environment not having been disinfected or sterilised. Scientists have been cautious over drawing early conclusion about the link.Ben Cowling, a professor at the University of Hong Kong’s School of Public Health, told the AFP news agency.It is possible that the virus now causing an outbreak in Beijing travelled from Wuhan to Europe and now back to China .He added that patient zero hadn’t been identified yet and that it may be too late to find out how the latest cluster started.The first trial results of a coronavirus vaccine being developed by CureVac in Germany are expected in two months, German news website Focus Online reported on Friday.Reuters reports that CureVac, an unlisted German company, said this week that the first meaningful results could be available in September or October and, under favourable conditions, it could be approved by the middle of next year.More on Curevac’s work from its own website here.Government borrowing in the UK in May is predicted to have hit 55.2 billion - nearly nine times higher than in the same month a year ago, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).The figure is slightly lower than the 62.1 billion of borrowing in April, according to the ONS, although the organisation also revised down that figure by 13.6 billion to 48.5 billion on Friday.Reacting to this morning’s figures, UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak said they show “coronavirus is having a severe impact on our public finances”. He said:The best way to restore our public finances to a more sustainable footing is to safely reopen our economy so people can return to work.We’ve set out our plan to do this in a gradual and safe fashion, including reopening high streets across the country this week, as we kickstart our economic recovery.Indian officials have reimposed a lockdown in the southern city of Chennai and three neighbouring districts.The BBC reports that only essential services and neighbourhood grocery shops will be permitted to function under the 12-day lockdown, set to end on 30 June.Chennai is India’s sixth-largest city and the capital of Tamil Nadu state. It has more than 37,000 of Tamil Nadu’s confirmed 50,000 infections, making it one of India’s largest hotspots.With just over 600 deaths in total, the state has a relatively low mortality rate – but its death toll is being reviewed after reports suggested that at least 200 deaths in Chennai were not included in the official tally.It is the only city to reimpose a lockdown to curb the rise in infections.India has the fourth-highest caseload in the world, with more than 350,000 confirmed cases of the disease. Daily reports of infections are increasing, with Tamil Nadu among the worst-affected states.This is Alexandra Topping taking the reins of the global coronavirus liveblog for the next few hours.

It ends with us doing impressions in very bad taste of Craig Cash: “In Kiev, there’s been an explosion in reactor four …” We’ve reached the gallows humour that I expect every family has reached as we hit week 13 of lockdown.For some reason, Cats turned up unannounced on our Sky box.

Plans are in place for reopening  Ireland’s pubs and restaurants. Photograph: CollinsMoves to ease Ireland’s restrictions put in place to tackle coronavirus continue on Friday with announcements expected on the reopening of restaurants as well as hairdressers and barbers. The Cabinet is due to consider the further acceleration of the Government’s roadmap for easing restrictions and will also examine plans for theatres, cinemas, gyms and outdoor gatherings.Bit it is understood that the reopening of hairdressers and barbers will be brought forward to June 29th from July 20th under the new plans. Ministers are also expected to discuss the earlier reopening of salons and beauticians.At a briefing following the meeting of NPHET, Prof Philip Nolan, chair of its Irish Epidemiological Modelling Advisory Group, said that Covid-19 was at a very low level in the State and very stable. However, a resurgence in the number of new Covid-19 infections in the State as a result of foreign travel, including from Britain and Sweden, has raised concerns among public health officials.Fewer than 10 new cases of the coronavirus disease relating to travel outside the country were reported over the past fortnight after several weeks with no confirmed cases associated with travel.“Over the last two weeks we have begun to see a small number of travel-related cases - it is a cause for concern nonetheless,” said Prof Nolan. Many of these cases were still being investigated, he added. The Department of Health reported four additional Covid-19 fatalities and 16 new confirmed cases on Thursday, bringing the death toll to 1,714 and the total number of cases to 23,355.Nursing homes account for 962 deaths or 56 per cent of all fatalities from the disease. Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said the greater the progress made on suppressing the virus at home, the more important the risk of importing cases from abroad would become.“We wouldn’t like to see any cases being imported if we can avoid that,” he said and advised people to continue to avoid all non-essential and holiday travel to and from Ireland. Dr Holohan said the team did not see pubs reopening in the same phase as restaurants from the end of the month but that if pubs planned to operate as restaurants from this date he hoped publicans would be “responsible” in applying public health advice and guidance “in good faith”.Prof Nolan said that the figures on the low number of new cases and admissions to hospitals and intensive care units showed that the disease was “at a very low level and very stable.”But he sounded “a note of caution” that health officials “would only just now” be seeing the effect of changes made in the second reopening phase on June 8th. PrematureMeanwhile, public health expert Dr Joe Barry warned on Friday that the reopening of pubs is “a little bit premature”.On the balance of risks, the easing of restrictions should be taken “a little more gently” with high risk locations like pubs, he told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland.Dr Barry, who is Clinical Professor in Public Health Medicine and Head of the Department of Public Health and Primary Care in Trinity College, Dublin said the issue was that a person could walk into a pub, have a few pints and walk out with Covid-19, but be asymptomatic.“It’s a little bit premature to let pubs reopen the way they want to do it. This has to be looked at much more carefully over the next three weeks,” he said.Dr Barry said pub is a different environment from restaurants, and would be more difficult to control. Pubs are the ideal place for the spread of the virus given the close proximity of customers, he said. Adding alcohol to the situation meant that people’s judgement could “go a little bit.”He argued that the Fáilte Ireland guidelines on the reopening of pubs were “strange” with “a lot of wooly language.”Dr Barry said he could understand publicans intensely lobbying to reopen their businesses, but publicans were not unique in their suffering. The situation was too serious for people to think they could just out to pubs again. After all the efforts that had been made, there was too much to lose, he warned.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Greens will review implementation of policies every few months, deputy leader saysLouise Richardson references \u0026lsquoVoldemort\u0026rsquo figure in opposing removal of Cecil Rhodes statue at collegeVictim tells court she feels she has failed as a mother \u0026lsquofor being in such a dark place\u0026rsquoHairdressers and barbers expected to open earlier than plannedGarda ask people not to breach Covid-19 but express sympathy locally or onlineDay out to Lough Keel on Thursday afternoon ends in tragedyJoan Lucey says she is following health advice in order to protect her staff, customersAccused said reason for attack was \u0026euro300 owed to him by 17-year-oldLikely areas of inquiry include training and equipment, including firearms holstersDeal would see Fianna F\u0026aacuteil and Fine Gael get eight roles each with four going to GreensSuspect has history of mental health issues and drug and alcohol abuseThree prospective coalition parties plan to create posts for 20 junior ministersFormer presidential adviser says in tell-all book Brexit was \u0026lsquocritically important\u0026rsquo to USKilling of detective garda was \u0026lsquoa random act\u0026rsquo, says Drew HarrisIndustry group critical of delay in producing final guidelinesSearch operation was part of work targeting smuggling and shadow economy activityNoel Tobin told the court he wanted to avoid having to interact with drug dealersClaim made in legal proceedings relating to what man described as his unfair dismissalDeputy leader Catherine Martin endorses programme for government unequivocallyTen elected Senators bring proceedings over failure to fix a date for meeting of chamberStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4283340.1592564050!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"chance to renegotiate terms of government when taoiseach changes catherine martin","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen Party deputy leader Catherine Martin has said that when the Taoiseach changes there will be an opportunity to renegotiate the terms of the programme for government.

Photograph: Daragh Mc SweeneyProvisionA Cork bookshop owner has defended her decision to ask customers to wear masks coming into her shop to protect against Covid-19 following backlash on social media.Joan Lucey, who owns Vibes and Scribes on Lavitt’s Quay in Cork city centre, re-opened her shop on Tuesday and asked customers to wear a mask and, if they didn’t have one with them, the shop was happy to provide one.“We asked people to wear masks for the safety of our staff and our customers and if they didn’t have one, we were happy to provide them with one and they could make a donation to the Cork Sexual Violence Centre, ” said Ms Lucey.“But we were very surprised when we discovered this really bad reaction on line with some people going on to our Facebook page, accusing us of trying to humiliate them and others saying that they were going to blacklist us.”Another person expressed delight that Vibes and Scribes was after re-opening but said they would “not step a foot inside unless you remove the absurd requirement for people to wear masks”.“Happy to see you have been ‘allowed’ to reopen but very disappointed to see your mask policy! Big NO to masks!! Not necessary, not mandatory! Won’t be visiting your store or any store that has a mask policy,” said another.Another posted a message stating, “Great way to stop customers coming to your shop – nobody should be made to wear face masks, we all have free choice “ while another vowed not to visit “under these humiliating conditions.”OppositionIt appears some of those expressing strong opposition to Vibes and Scribes policy have links to the anti-vaccinations but Ms Lucey said she was simply following HSE advice on masks out of concern for her staff and customers.“We’re asking people to wear masks simply to protect our staff and customers and if for whatever reason, people refuse to wear a mask, we ask them to limit their visit to 10 minutes - again out of concern for our staff and customers.”Ms Lucey, who won Cork Retailer of the Year in 2015, said she was gratified by the many messages of support they had received online from people saying they will come into her shop as Covid 19 has had a devastating impact on retail.“Retail is on its knees. We’ve re-opened our bookshop and no matter what happens when we open up our craft supplies shop on Bridge Street, no matter how the customers feel towards us, it’s going to be very difficult.She said that she had moved all her staff to working on her online craft supplies business and nobody was left go from the Vibes and Scribes team during the pandemic but re-opening her shops presented new challenges.“Funnily enough, in our online shop we’ve been selling huge amounts of products for mask making because we sell a lot of elastics and fabrics, so I was aware that people are making masks and people were pro-masks.”“I admit we didn’t consult with anybody but to be honest I didn’t feel that it was terribly relevant, I thought I was doing the right thing for my staff and my customers and to be fair, most our customers have been supportive.”Official adviceThe latest official advice from the HSE, updated on June 15th, states that face coverings should be worn in situations where it is difficult to practice social distancing, such as in shops and on public transport.“Face coverings help to prevent people who do not know they have the virus from spreading it to others .... it may help to reduce the spread of respiratory droplets from people infected with coronavirus,” said the HSE.Just two days ago, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar launched a government campaign to urge people to wear face masks in public places and he did not rule out the possibility that the government might make the wearing of masks mandatory.“It’s seen as an additional hygiene measure that can help reduce the spread of the infection .... I do see people using them more and more so I think the message is getting across,” he said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4283330.1592563089!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cromwell statue at westminister should stay says irish vice chancellor of oxford","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe  statue of Oliver Cromwell at the Houses of Parliament in London. Photograph: EPANEIL HALLOxford’s vice-chancellor has invoked the name of Oliver Cromwell in an attempt to retain the controversial Cecil Rhodes statue at the college. Prof Louise Richardson – who is originally from Tramore, Co Waterford – said memorials were part of our understanding of history. Campaigners have sought for years to remove the statue of Cecil Rhodes from outside Oriel College. Rhodes was an imperialist and diamond magnate based in modern-day South Africa who left a huge amount of money to Oxford in his will. Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, was named after him. Responding to the Rhodes Must Fall campaign, Prof Richardson told the Daily : “The question is, how do we judge people? How do you judge Cecil Rhodes? Do we judge him by our values today or do we judge him by the context of his time?“This is the stuff of academia. This is the stuff of universities. This is what education is all about. I don’t think we can pretend our history is different from what it was.”However, Prof Richardson’s attempts to invoke the name of Nelson Mandela in the statue row has angered many of the university’s academics. Asked whether Mandela would have opposed the Rhodes Must Fall campaign, Prof Richardson said: “I think he was a man of deep nuance who recognised complex problems for what they were. And I don’t think he sought simplistic solutions to complex problems.” In a response published in the Daily , the academics accused Prof Richardson of “inappropriate ventriloquising” of the late South African leader. “It is especially so now, when universities need to listen to, not presume to speak for, black students and people of colour.“Secondly, she claims that the campaign amounts to ’hiding our history’. The opposite is true. What is being demanded is a full and frank accounting for Britain’s history, in place of the selective commemoration of ’great men’ whose wealth was made through white supremacy.” Prof Richardson’s intervention has not stopped the governing body of Oriel College voting to remove the statue of Cecil Rhodes. The college said it had “expressed their wish to remove the statue of Cecil Rhodes and the King Edward Street Plaque”. It will need the permission of the city authorities to do so. British prime minister Boris Johnson has indicated the statue of Cromwell at the Palaces of Westminster will not be removed. In a post on his Facebook page, Mr Johnson said statues were a reminder of the nuances of history and that we should not judge historical characters by contemporary standards. “Where will it end? Are we supposed to haul down Cromwell who killed so many thousands of people in Ireland?”The town of Cromwell in New Zealand is also engaged in a debate over its name. Cromwell resident Ben Deegan, who has Irish roots, told local media that places like Cromwell should be renamed.‘’The name itself is a monument to someone responsible for thousands of deaths, with no bearing on anything here in New Zealand. We are all living on indigenous land, and we should both embrace and respect that.”New Zealand, which removed the statue of Sir John Hamilton from the centre of the town named after him, is engaged in part of a worldwide debate about the removal of colonial-era statues and the renaming of towns and cities.

Photograph: Brian LawlessPA Regulations requiring people entering the Republic from abroad to provide the address where they will be self-isolating for the required 14-day period have been extended for a further three weeks. Upon arrival in the State at airports or ports, iniduals are required to fill in a passenger locator form. The coronavirus measures are in place to allow authorities to check if iniduals are self-isolating for 14 days as advised, and for contact tracing purposes. Those who do not fill out the passenger locator form or who provide false details can face a fine of €2,500 or a prison term of six months.The regulations were introduced on May 28th to last until June 18th, at which point they would be reviewed. A Department of Health spokeswoman confirmed on Thursday the regulations had been extended until July 9th, “at which stage they will be reviewed.”“This means anyone arriving in Ireland will have to fill out a form and inform us of their whereabouts. This ensures we have an adequate contact tracing system in place,” she said. The spokeswoman said public health advice instructing people to self-isolate for 14 days upon arriving into the State from abroad remains in place. However, she added this advice was “strongly recommended,” but not mandatory. “We would ask that all persons arriving into the State follow this advice as closely as they can,” she said. In recent weeks the Cabinet has discussed the potential easing of overseas travel restrictions, with the option of permitted travel between other countries where coronavirus has been controlled under consideration. One source said Cabinet colleagues had begun to receive queries from constituents on when they could travel abroad on holidays again.Insurance claimsCurrently the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) advises “against all non-essential travel overseas until further notice,” including Britain, but not Northern Ireland. Several insurance companies have warned if holidaymakers decide to disregard the existing advice on overseas travel they will not be covered. Zurich has advised customers that if iniduals travel abroad against the DFA advice any insurance claim arising from the coronavirus pandemic could be denied. Similarly Laya states if policyholders booked trips after the advice on non-essential travel was introduced they will not be covered.In a statement, Insurance Ireland, which represents the industry, said while the wording of policies differ, “in general if a policy holder decides to travel at a time when the Government advises against non-essential travel, they would be in danger of invalidating their travel insurance.” The group said its “strong advice” is that policyholders “follow the Irish Government’s advice at all times.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4283259.1592557221!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"we are devastated vigil held for colm horkan as books of condolence open","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHundreds gathered in Castlerea on Thursday for a vigil in memory of Colm Horkan.

He noted that he had served for a long time in Castlerea and in Ballaghaderreen and had recently returned to Castlerea as a detective. “This is a tragedy the town will never forget,” said Mr Fitzmaurice as he extended the town’s sympathy to the Horkan family.Fr McManus, who led the prayer service, said that the community had gathered in prayer and in memory of Garda Horkan. He added that this was a testing and painful time for the family of Garda Horkan and for all who knew and loved him.As the bell of St. Patrick’s Church rang through the town a minute’s silence was observed for the Charlestown, Co May native and candles were lit in his memory.Speaking in Castlerea on Thursday Garda Commissioner Drew Harris said described detective Horkan as “a beloved member of the community”. He said he was deeply saddened by the killing which was “a random act”.Expressions of sympathy have also been made the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and the President Michael D Higgins.Speaking in Dublin as he opened the online book of condolence Mr Brabazon said he was “deeply saddened” by the death.“Detective Garda Horkan was a dedicated public servant who had also worked as a retained fire fighter in Charlestown, County Mayo. I am opening this Book of Condolence to allow the citizens of Dublin to express their sympathies to the family and colleagues of Detective Garda Horkan. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam,” he said.Mr Brabazon led local authorities across the country which offered similar condolences. In Cork Mayor Doyle said he was “shocked and saddened” to hear of the death of Detective Garda Colm Horkan while on duty”. This is “tragic loss for his family, friends, An Garda Síochána and the community he served during these most difficult times.”A State funeral for Garda Horkan is expected to be held next week with Garda and Det Gda Horkan’s family working out how such a funeral may best be held under the Covid-19 restrictions.A Garda spokesman advised those intending to sign books of condolences to check with their local garda ision on the location of books, but not to breach Covid -19 restrictions.He advised checking with the condolences pages on RIP.ie and the Garda Facebook page.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Investigators say they have found gun and are talking to two \u0026lsquopeople of interest\u0026rsquoTensions remain high despite two governments agreeing to de-escalate confrontationAustralia says it will not name country responsibleKim Yo-jong\u0026rsquos criticism of Seoul illustrates her seniority and potential to become rulerBatons wrapped in barbed wire used in high-altitude brawl in which 20 Indian soldiers diedNZ officials tracing 320 people regarded as \u0026lsquoclose contacts\u0026rsquo of pair who returned from UKClash on Himalayan border is the most serious since 1967, why now and what next?Any moves to invalidate peace deals posemajor setback to Moon\u0026rsquos efforts for more lasting reconciliation with NorthFirst loss of life in area for decades as \u0026lsquoviolent face-off\u0026rsquo between troops elevates disputeLatest in a series of threats from the Kim regime since diplomacy with US broke downFierce criticism as editor of influential Rappler website faces up to six years in jailChile replaces health minister as deaths spiral while global cases exceed 7.6 millionSocial media giant says China ran network of accounts to spread misinformationTwo years after Trump-Kim summit minister says peace hopes are now \u0026lsquodark nightmare\u0026rsquoThere had been repeated calls by the Maori community to remove statue of John HamiltonLam warns city cannot afford further \u0026lsquochaos\u0026rsquoalmost 9,000 aged 11- 84 arrested in protests over past yearDecision marks a setback in relations amid efforts to persuade North to give up nuclear weapons programmeSouth Pacific nation of 5m declared it was coronavirus free on MondayHospitals feel the strain as lockdowns are eased despite fears of a spike in infectionsHolidaymaker said he stumbled into abandoned well after being chased by wild dogStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"World community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaTension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsGiven lack of other options, authorities used restrictions as main tool to fight pandemicFormer cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonWHO forecasts coronavirus will kill 42,000 and infect most of 28 million populationStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4282768.1592506325!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"london less reserved now that covid 19 has torn the skin off the world","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tShops and businesses around London are slowly beginning to reopen but months in lockdown has changed the environment. Photograph: Matt DunhamAP PhotoIt was not so much a garden as a small, walled patio but as three of us sat around a large table eating fish and chips, we knew we were within either the spirit or the letter of the lockdown law, even if we were not sure which. My friend Johnny had chosen the menu earlier that day when he saw that his local fish and chip shop had reopened and he was eager to give them whatever business he could.It’s a story repeated all over London and one friend after another this week has talked up the merits of their favourite burrito stand or sandwich shop just back in business but with no customers. With most office workers still working from home, the entire economy that provides them with lunches, transport, dry cleaning and other services is struggling to come back to life.But Johnny’s concern for his local businesses reflects something else that has changed in London during the lockdown as the traditional reserve that governs relations with neighbours has crumbled. James, who was also at the fish and chip supper, said he had spent 12 years avoiding anything more than breezy cordiality with the other residents of his flat block.He was particularly keen not to get too close to the woman who lived directly below him, who seemed to be quite sociable and fond of a drink like himself. He was afraid that if he started talking to her, they might decide to have a drink together in one of their flats and soon it could become a routine that would be hard to put a stop to. And what would he do then?A serious pyrophobe who will rush home from anywhere if he thinks he left the radio plugged in, James also believed that his neighbour smoked in bed and would one day burn the house down.It started with the weekly 8pm clap for the NHS, when they found themselves on the street outside waiting for the din to begin and she told him she had found a Waitrose that was always empty and had everything that was in short supply, from eggs to toilet roll.When the lockdown rules eased, James and his neighbour started to go for socially distanced walks in Regent’s Park, slurping very strong gin and tonics from runners’ water bottles. They now have a weekly date in a garden space they have commandeered and James says he regards her as a friend.In my building, we traditionally avoid anything beyond the shortest greeting apart from at a drinks party in the lobby once a year which only a handful of us go to.During the lockdown, I would check with the hall porter every day on the health of some of the older neighbours, particularly a funny, clever couple in their late 80s, both of whom had to go into hospital before Christmas. One sunny day when I asked after the couple, he waved towards the bleak, concrete courtyard outside.“They’re out there drinking a bottle of rosé,” he said.And there they were, she in a yellow cotton frock and he in pink shorts and a blue and white striped shirt, each of them with a glass of wine and a book in front of them. Other neighbours were scattered around the usually deserted courtyard, some on their laptops, others apparently doing nothing at all.As the lockdown has eased, the lobby has become the communal space its architects probably intended and everyone is talking to one another in a way we never have before. For some, it’s probably the loneliness of working from home alone with none of the casual daily interactions of office life that have pushed them across the Rubicon of getting to know their neighbours.But something else is happening too. A psychiatrist told a friend of mine that coronavirus has “torn the skin off the world”, leaving us more vulnerable than before to our feelings and fears. And in London, many people’s greatest fear is that the economy will not recover and that they or many of the people they see every day will soon be in deep trouble.Before Johnny went to the fish and chip shop the other day, he met the builders who have made his life hell for the past few years, drilling from 6am until late in the evening. His campaign against them, which included hectoring the contractor over the phone late at night, got so far out of control that the police spoke to him about it.When he asked them if they’d like him to move his car out of their way, they told him how sorry they were for all the nuisance they caused.“No don’t, I’ve changed,” he told them.“Please make as much noise as you have to for as long as you can. I’m just happy that you all have a job.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4283222.1592555300!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us army removes into the wild bus from alaskan wilderness","story":"An abandoned bus, made famous by the book and film Into The Wild, has been moved from the Alaskan wilderness after tourists repeatedly had to be rescued while trying to reach it.

Photograph: Sgt Seth LaCountAlaska National GuardA bus abandoned in the Alaskan wilderness and made famous by the book and film Into The Wild has been removed for public safety after tourists repeatedly had to be rescued while trying to reach it, the state’s National Guard said.A US Army helicopter airlifted the 1940s-era vehicle from its spot west of the Teklanika River on Thursday.The bus was made famous by adventurer Chris McCandless (24), who lived in it during the summer of 1992 and died of starvation after 114 days in the wilderness.His story was told by author Jon Krakauer in the 1996 book Into The Wild, which was adapted into a 2007 film directed by Sean Penn.The National Guard said the bus was a public safety issue because it was luring fans of McCandless to venture out into the dangerous Alaskan wild.There were 15 bus-related search and rescue operations by the state between 2009 and 2017, according to the Department of Natural Resources.Two travellers died after drowning while on their way to the vehicle in separate incidents in 2010 and 2019, officials said.As recently as February, Alaska State Troopers rescued five Italian hikers, one of whom suffered severe frostbite.Locals had called for authorities to reduce or eliminate the danger caused by the bus, the National Guard said.Corri A Feige, commissioner for the Department of Natural Resources, said: “We encourage people to enjoy Alaska’s wild areas safely, and we understand the hold this bus has had on the popular imagination.“However, this is an abandoned and deteriorating vehicle that was requiring dangerous and costly rescue efforts, but more importantly, was costing some visitors their lives. I’m glad we found a safe, respectful and economical solution to this situation.”The bus was removed by a CH-47 Chinook helicopter. The aircrew also ensured the safe transportation of a suitcase that holds sentimental value to the McCandless family, the National Guard said.Mr Feige said the bus will be stored at a “secure site” while the Department of Natural Resources considers a permanent place for it. – PAStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this.

Was I still living in the real world, or had I woken up in some kind of parallel universe? While the economy goes to self-induced hell in a handcart, we find ourselves arguing about what Nelson Mandela would have thought about removing a statue of Cecil Rhodes from the façade of Oriel College, Oxford.It might be argued, I suppose, that the one follows naturally from the other: that the argument over colonial statues, slavery, racism, and the bended knee is only a manifestation of the wider crisis in society and the economy. This is what three months of lockdown has done to us, giving wing to and amplifying a seething mass of ongoing distractions, resentments and grievances.I imagine this is just the beginning. Far from bringing us closer together in a wartime spirit of solidarity, the pandemic seems to be only driving us further apart.But not all comparisons with the war are invalid. The country is facing a degree of fiscal ruin that does indeed bear some comparison with the costs of a major war. How this is all going to be paid for is an issue of infinitely more importance than the future of our colonial statues, or what Dominic Raab might think of the bended knee symbolism of the Black Lives Matter movement.It is the disadvantaged in society who will be hit hardest by the continued closure of our schools, the annihilation of large parts of the hospitality, entertainment and retail industries, and the tsunami of debt sweeping in on us. Yet rather than how to get out of the mess we have created for ourselves, the national conversation instead seems stuck in taking offence. If it wasn’t so serious, it would be laughable. We apparently prefer anger-inducing distraction to facing up to harsh realities.The Government is set to borrow between £300 billion and £350 billion this year to help finance its coronavirus response, sending the national debt spiralling to in excess of 100 per cent of GDP. To this should be added the £100 billion, and rising, of Government guaranteed or subsidised loans to private business, many of which will never be repaid. Many of these aptly named “bounce-back” loans will come bouncing back on to the public balance sheet.None of this matters, it might be argued, as long as the magic money tree of the Bank of England printing press keeps whirring. As fast as the Government issues the debt, the Bank of England hoovers it up in secondary markets. Without this so-called “monetary financing”, the Government would have struggled to borrow on the scale it has interest rates would have rocketed, the economy would have further collapsed, and the Government’s debt‑servicing costs would have spiralled out of control.Yet there are signs that even the Bank of England is beginning to worry about its role as the national piggy bank. The extra £100 billion of “quantitative easing” announced yesterday leaves total asset purchases sanctioned for this year some way short of the amount the Government needs to borrow. Clinging to the hope that the economy can recover reasonably rapidly from here on in, the Bank’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, actually refused to vote even for the additional £100 billion.As long as everyone is doing the same, then monetary financing is just about sustainable. There is safety in numbers if all major economies are equally guilty of the same thing. It is also true that Japan has been doing debt monetisation for years without any obvious adverse consequence, so why not the UK?But Japan is different. It has a very high savings rate and relatively low taxes. There is a sense in whichThe Japanese government essentially borrows from its citizens, rather than taxes them. In the UK, we tax and borrow with equal vigour. This plainly cannot go on forever.The trouble is that even if we think of today’s extraordinary levels of debt accumulation as a largely temporary phenomenon that will ease as the pandemic passes, all the political pressures are for permanently higher spending, and therefore higher deficits. It is remarkable how quickly a “temporary” giveaway becomes “permanent”. Free school meals will soon be the new winter fuel allowance.But this is trivial against the big daddy of the 1 to 2 per cent of GDP now pretty much promised for additional public spending on health and social care. The wider “levelling up” agenda, infrastructure revolution, the Project Defend programme for building national resilience, more money for police, for defence, for education, and so on – all this comes on top.We’ll get found out pretty quickly if we start printing money to fund that lot. There is only so much bending of the Bank of England’s mandate that you can do before investors call time on the currency. We face generational challenges on the balance between debt, tax and spend. Yet we’d much rather talk about statues.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"travel news foreign holidays restart july 4","story":"Trips to Spain are on the horizonKey dates: When will destinations around the world reopen to British tourists? Which countries are likely candidates for an \u0027air bridge\u0027 holiday this summer? Can I take a UK holiday yet?Listen to our brand new travel podcast British holidaymakers could enjoy overseas breaks from July 4 under plans being drawn up by the government.Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to announce on June 29 that agreements have been made for so-called air bridges with a “small number” of countries with low levels of coronavirus.This would allow families to take foreign holidays without having to self-isolate on their return to the UK. People could only travel with members of their household or ‘support bubble’, however, unless rules on social distancing are eased before July. They would also have to abide by the rules on social distancing in their destination, meaning that countries with similar restrictions to the UK are likely to be first in the queue.Ministers want to set up air bridges to countries that are “most advantageous” to the UK economy, which are likely to include popular destinations such as France, Spain, Greece and Portugal, according to Government sources. One source told the : “The plan is to announce a small number of air bridges on June 29th, though it won’t come into force until July 4. Obviously it will depend on factors such as the scientific advice and the level of coronavirus infections at the time.“The Foreign Office will also have to change its travel advice before then because that remains a block on people going abroad for holidays.”The Foreign Office continues to advise against “all but essential” travel making it all but impossible for holidaymakers to secure travel insurance until the advice is changed.Follow the latest updates belowForeign holidays may resume from July 4 but, as it stands, you will only be travel with a restricted group of people. Greg Dickinson considers what that means for his summer plans: I’m destined to a holiday with my housemate and my mum.

So this means a holiday with Jamie (housemate) and Fee (mum). My “travel bubble”.Woop-de-blooming-doo. After months of reheated coffees, throwing a ball at a kerb in Brixton for entertainment, listening to each others’ conference calls, Jamie and I can finally get that much-needed “us time” we’ve been yearning.And my lucky old mum.

Government by leak doesn’t boost bookings or stem job losses. Other countries have proved they are far more adept at setting out a clear roadmap for openings, enabling businesses and consumers to plan effectively.We would still like to see a pan-Europe travel corridor open up, as someone could simply drive from Spain to Holland or ferry from Italy to Malta for example. We urge the Government to try and get a European consensus, open up short-haul routes from 29th June and then phase-in long-haul from early July as coronavirus case numbers fall even further.The French-speaking Caribbean island will reopen to visitors from all countries on June 22. Saint-Barthélemy has been under lockdown since mid-March and has recorded a handful of confirmed coronavirus cases. President Bruno Magras said in his announcement about the reopening that “life on the island has returned to normal. Beaches, restaurants and shops are open as usual without restrictions in place. International visitors will be asked to bring a negative Covid-19 test, taken within three days prior to departure, and present a physical or digital copy of the test at passport control. Those unable to present a test will be tested at a drive through centre in Gustavia within 24 hours of their arrival on St Barths. They will then be required to self-isolate in their accommodation until the test result is known.Lockdown measures were further relaxed in Singapore today after two months of strict curbs to socialising.  The changes allow gatherings up to five people and the reopening of shops, food outlets, beaches and parks.The cruise industry has been badly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global quarantine.But as lockdowns lift and countries ease – or plan to ease – coronavirus travel restrictions, cruise lines are drawing up dates for the resumption of sailings.River cruises began to return to Europe on June 1 and the first post-lockdown ocean cruise set sail on June 16. See the full list of planned restart datesDreaming of a holiday on the water?Hopes have been raised that the low-cost airline, which collapsed in March after failing to secure government rescue support, could resume service. An advisor to one of the investors that took over the airline told an Australia newspaper that the UK regional carrier could fly again. Cyrus Capital was among the investors in the Connect Airways consortium which took over Flybe in 2019. It had planned to rebrand Europe’s largest regional airline this year as Virgin Connect in a strategy to concentrate on feeding Virgin Atlantic’s hubs at Heathrow and Manchester.Jonathan Peachey, a Cyrus Capital advisor who played a key role in creating Connect Airways to acquire Flybe, told The Australian: “It’s definitely not the case that we have abandoned Flybe,” He added: “Cyrus is doing everything it can, along with the other consortium members, to ensure that a business emerges that can re-hire the many thousands of employees who were dependent on it.”Flybe handled eight million passengers annually but was hard hit when travel screeched to a halt as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Thousands of flights were grounded as a result of lockdowns and travel restrictions. Many carriers are now resuming service, with flights planned from July 1. See our full list of airlines that have announced the resumption of flights.London City will resume flights on June 21  Cuba and the Dominican Republic will welcome tourists from July 1 Malta will reopen to British holidaymakers on July 15 Florida’s tourism businesses fear second shutdown after new spikeItaly will pay its citizens €500 to go on holidayPolitics latest news: School \u0026#39contingency plans\u0026#39 under way in case pupils cannot return in September, admits minister Comment: Summer camp is a pathetic substitute for the discipline of going to schoolCoronavirus latest news: Covid alert level lowered from four to three as Matt Hancock declares it a \u0026#39big moment for the UK\u0026#39 Coronavirus positive: Good news round-up - Socially distanced skateboarding in SingaporeComment: Protectionism is rearing its ugly head once again as we seek cheaper, high-quality foodComment: Families like mine will never forget the moving legacy of France\u0026#39s wartime friendship with BritainSummer solstice 2020: everything you need to know about the longest day of the yearPolice die enforcing Latin America\u0026#39s strictest lockdown as Peru\u0026#39s futile strategy unravelsQueen sends message to British business praising \u0026#39heart-warming\u0026#39 response to coronavirusWhat is dexamethasone, and how can it help treat coronavirus?China releases genome of virus that caused Beijing outbreak saying could be linked to EuropeWithout a revival in Scotland, Labour will need to take safe Tory seats such as Jacob Rees-Mogg\u0026#39s to seize power Dutchman receives \u0026#39proof-of-life\u0026#39 photos of stolen van Gogh paintingThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and Alexa twice a dayColombian army rescues two kidnapped touristsCoronavirus world round-up: China publishes genome of latest virus outbreak\u0026#39This government is failing on every single front\u0026#39 -  readers on this week’s top storiesSouth Korea\u0026#39s unification minister resigns as tensions riseZoom will become magnet for child abusers with plan to encrypt calls, warns NSPCCBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/04/02/20/andrew-lloyd-webber.jpg","title":"andrew lloyd webber theatre reopen uk joseph technicolour dreamcoat palladium tickets","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Industry experts warned this week that the UK is on the brink of ‘cultural collapse’Lord Andrew Lloyd Webber has revealed that a government report advised that musicals return “without any singing” to stop the spread of coronavirus.In a week that saw industry figures warn that the UK is on the brink of “cultural catastrophe”, the composer told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme about his plans to keep theatre going.With the government being widely criticised for failing to support the arts during the crisis, Lloyd Webber explained that he’d had “a couple of phone calls” with Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden about the future of theatre.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I would love to say that I think that they understood a little more,” Lloyd Webber said.“I have seen a report, I don’t know what’s going to be in the report on theatre that’s coming out on Monday (22 June), but I sincerely hope it doesn’t contain some of the things that I’ve seen in some of their advice, one of which was a brilliant one for musicals – that you’re not allowed to sing.”RSC slams article that called Romeo and Juliet cast ‘garishly erse’Armando Iannucci warns of ‘absolutely terrifying’ future for the artsDavid Tennant says UK theatres are ‘teetering’ close to collapseLloyd Webber shared his plans to “prove” to the world that theatres can stay open. The composer hopes that a one-off performance of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat will go ahead at the London Palladium in July, explaining: “We’ve just had the final bits of equipment delivered into England, we hope to have them in the theatres next month.“All one can do is try and be positive. I really believe that we in theatre must be positive and use everything we can to demonstrate that we can open. If having done that we fail, at least we’ve tried.”The coronavirus has had a devastating impact on the British theatre industry, with producer Cameron Mackintosh announcing this week that Phantom, Hamilton, Les Misérables and Mary Poppins would not be opening their doors again until 2021, with redundancies expected for employees on all four shows.A report from industry leaders also published this week warned that the UK is facing a “cultural catastrophe” and the loss of £74bn and more than 400,000 jobs this year as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.The Phantom of the Opera\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Nasa has made a map of its trajectory, showing where the annular phase of the eclipse will be visible, weather permitting. Millions more will be able to witness a partial solar eclipse, though unfortunately for sky gazers in the UK and US it will not be visible.Details of object that smashed into Moon during lunar eclipse revealed“It’s much more important to watch the weather forecasts a day or two before the eclipse and choose a location with the best chance of a cloud-free sky during the eclipse.“Good weather is the key to successful eclipse viewing – better to see a shorter eclipse from clear sky than a longer eclipse under clouds.”A live stream of the eclipse will be broadcast by Timeanddate, allowing anyone to watch it no matter where they are in the world.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Mr Uddin is one of a number of suppliers who say that Sir Philip’s fashion empire has refused to pay for millions of pounds worth of orders, leaving them struggling to pay workers and keep the lights on.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Uddin told The Independent that he was forced to shut down production two weeks ago because cancelled orders meant his cash flow had dried up and he could not pay money owed to suppliers of materials. He said he is now paying out $25,000 per day in costs but has no income, and now fears that without an urgent resolution he will have to close his doors for good.The Bangladesh Export Processing Zone, where Denim Expert’s factory is located, has suspended Mr Uddin’s import and export permissions because of unpaid rent and utility bills. Goods that were due to be shipped out in February and March have been sat in containers at the port incurring charges each day.“With payments virtually suspended since the outbreak started, there has been a catastrophic impact upon the cash flow of our operation, which functions on very low margins at the best of times,” Mr Uddin said.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailAccording to campaign group Traidcraft, around 70 per cent of the cost of the garments is for the raw materials that go into them. Most manufacturers take this material on credit and pay it off when buyers pay them for the finished goods, meaning that when money is not forthcoming they quickly run into problems. Arcadia said it had no direct relationship with Denim Expert but confirmed that it did have outstanding orders for the company’s goods via a third party which buys jeans from a number of factories.Following media coverage of Mr Uddin’s problems with Arcadia and other buyers, an Arcadia representative contacted Denim Expert but no agreement has been reached. The company offered to buy some of the goods but not until August, an offer which Mr Uddin said he could not accept. An Arcadia spokesperson said the group was “in ongoing discussions” with its suppliers, including Denim Expert, to come to an agreement about the cancelled orders. The group has been in financial difficulty in recent years, narrowly avoiding administration in June 2019 after landlords backed a rescue deal at the last minute. Under the deal, 50 stores were earmarked for closure and 1,000 people lost their jobs. Former Debenhams employees raise money for Bangladeshi workersWhy coronavirus could add fuel to fast fashion’s fireRenting could be the trick to help me curb my fast fashion habitsLike the rest of the fashion retail sector, Arcadia has also been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic and lockdown, which forced all non-essential stores to close on the 23 March.Mr Uddin is one of hundreds of suppliers to the fashion industry facing imminent closure after months of unpaid orders.While some buyers, including H\u0026ampM and Zara, have honoured the majority of contracts and paid for orders, others such as Asda, Arcadia and Edinburgh Woollen Mill have demanded steep discounts or failed to pay for goods altogether.According to data published in April by the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), the Arcadia Group cancelled £9m worth of orders in Bangladesh alone.Usually in manufacturing industries like this, whatever the buyer wants, you have to accept. That’s how it’s been for the last 100 yearsGlobally, the group, which is owned by Sir Philip’s wife through a holding company in Monaco, cancelled as much as £100m, according to The Worker Rights Consortium (WRC).Mr Uddin added: “I am not interested to work with Arcadia any more. I want to get rid of them as a buyer. Usually in manufacturing industries like this, whatever the buyer wants, you have to accept. That’s how it’s been for the last 100 years.“I have made up my mind. I only want to work with the people who are fair and responsible.”Fiona Gooch, senior policy advisor at Traidcraft Exchange, said: “It is terrible that factories are having to close in Bangladesh, and other garment producing countries, through no fault of their own. “By refusing to pay up, brands like Philip Green’s Burton Menswear are putting thousands of workers, mainly young women and their families at risk of destitution. “Philip Green is a millionaire. Like other fashion brand owners, he can easily afford to pay for the finished clothes that they have previously ordered, and the fabric bought to make future orders for them.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But the bank’s purchasing programme provides some useful insurance against itAs the saying goes: “A billion here, a billion there – soon you’re talking serious money.”How about hundreds of billions?The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee has voted to increase its asset purchase scheme by another £100bn. This comes on top of the £200bn it committed to purchasing earlier in the year.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhat does that mean?The dirty truth about washing your handsWhat is the difference between Covid-19 and the common cold and flu?Can face masks really protect you against coronavirus or flu?The UK government’s four stages of fighting coronavirus explainedWhat are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?The first thing to note is that the bank will now be purchasing £300bn of UK government bonds in 2020.That’s roughly equivalent to the projected deficit of the UK government in the current financial year to pay for all its emergency coronavirus-related spending, including the jobs furlough scheme.It’s not quite correct to say that the bank is funding the state’s spiralling deficit during this crisis.The projected public-sector net cash requirement is actually more than £400bn and private investors will have to buy the debt first and then sell to the bank.Yet it’s abundantly clear to everyone in the financial markets that the bank is acting as an effective backstop for government’s borrowing.Does that matter?It certainly matters for UK government bond investors.They know they can be confident that when they buy UK government bonds – known as gilts – from the Debt Management Office they will be able to sell them on to the bank.That removes any fear that they will be stuck holding bonds that no one else wants to buy.This should stabilise the market for UK government debt, meaning that it can continue to borrow to support millions of ordinary British workers and businesses.It’s far from clear that there was any danger of a crisis in the UK government bond market. But the bank’s purchasing programme provides some useful insurance against it.Will it help the economy directly? The bank says the asset purchases should help support demand – or spending – in the economy. The evidence here is somewhat mixed. It’s plausible that purchases helped do that in the immediate wake of the financial crisis. But the power of successive rounds of asset purchases to support demand directly seemed to weaken.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In part that’s because previous warnings of an inflationary spiral proved unwarranted.It’s also because the Bank is no outlier it’s doing pretty much the same as other big central banks such as the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. The Fed has effectively promised unlimited bond purchases in this crisis.£100bn is serious money in anyone’s book. But the reality is that, in the world of central banking in the era of Covid-19, it’s nothing particularly special.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Let’s be clear, we’re still living in very unusual times.The minutes of the MPC’s meeting warned: “While recent demand and output data had not been quite as negative as expected, other indicators suggested greater risks around the potential for longer lasting damage to the economy from the pandemic.”Voting against further stimulus measures, Mr Haldane said that the recovery was happening “sooner and materially faster” than had been forecast in May.Data on payments suggest consumer spending started to recover in May and June, and the housing market has recently begun to pick up, the bank said.Official figures released last week show that gross domestic product (GDP) slumped by a record 20.4 per cent in April as the country endured a full month of lockdown conditions, and has now contracted by a quarter since the Covid-19 outbreak began.The UK economy is forecast to be hit harder than that of any other developed nation.The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said last month that UK output will shrink 11.5 per cent this year or 14 per cent if there is a second wave of coronavirus cases.The extra £100bn stimulus announced on Thursday will be used to buy gilts – UK government debt – with purchases to be completed by the end of 2020.Government spending has soared to cover the cost of schemes to support businesses and jobs. Public sector borrowing is expected to surpass £300bn this year.The bank says the asset purchases should help support demand – or spending – in the economy, which has fallen dramatically during the pandemic.There had been some speculation that the bank might cut its key benchmark interest rate to below zero for the first time.But there was no discussion of this in the MPC minutes.At the press conference Mr Bailey said that it remained an option but stressed there was no reason to expect it to be introduced imminently.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The scale of our response must match the scale of the challenge.“This package will make sure that every young person, no matter their age or where they live, gets the education, opportunities and outcomes they deserve, by spending it on measures proven to be effective, particularly for those who are most disadvantaged.“The plan will be delivered throughout the next academic year, bringing long term reform to the educational sector that will protect a generation of children from the effects of this pandemic.”It comes as children across the country have struggled to keep up their education during lockdown – particularly those with limited access to digital resources and devices. Government risks ‘failing a generation’ if schools not reopened soonAnd concerns continue to be raised over the wellbeing of at-risk children outside of school settings designed to serve as a safeguarding tool and a support network. Yesterday an open letter from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health warned that: “For many children and their families, these interventions are the difference between surviving and thriving. In their absence our already frayed safety net cannot function, and we risk failing a generation.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But the two-metre rule is in itself a social-distancing measure.“Removing it has an impact in terms of the transmission of the disease, so we have to make sure in that review that we have the space and the virus is under control enough to be able to make the change and replace the two-metre rule, if that is the conclusion of the review, with something that then makes it easier to do things like have people together in schools.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“As partial lifting of the measures takes place, we see signs of some activity returning,” said Mr Bailey in the press conference.But he added: “We don’t want to get too carried away by this. Let’s be clear, we’re still living in very unusual times.The minutes of the MPC’s meeting warned: “While recent demand and output data had not been quite as negative as expected, other indicators suggested greater risks around the potential for longer lasting damage to the economy from the pandemic.”Voting against further stimulus measures, Mr Haldane said that the recovery was happening “sooner and materially faster” than had been forecast in May.Data on payments suggest consumer spending started to recover in May and June, and the housing market has recently begun to pick up, the bank said.Official figures released last week show that gross domestic product (GDP) slumped by a record 20.4 per cent in April as the country endured a full month of lockdown conditions, and has now contracted by a quarter since the Covid-19 outbreak began.The UK economy is forecast to be hit harder than that of any other developed nation.The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said last month that UK output will shrink 11.5 per cent this year or 14 per cent if there is a second wave of coronavirus cases.The extra £100bn stimulus announced on Thursday will be used to buy gilts – UK government debt – with purchases to be completed by the end of 2020.Government spending has soared to cover the cost of schemes to support businesses and jobs. Public sector borrowing is expected to surpass £300bn this year.The bank says the asset purchases should help support demand – or spending – in the economy, which has fallen dramatically during the pandemic.There had been some speculation that the bank might cut its key benchmark interest rate to below zero for the first time.But there was no discussion of this in the MPC minutes.At the press conference Mr Bailey said that it remained an option but stressed there was no reason to expect it to be introduced imminently.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

For those that can’t figure out the puzzles for themselves, all 15 combinations are listed at the bottom of the article.Inevitably, spoilers for the game follow...In the game’s opening chapter, this safe is found in the supermarket in Jackson. The clue is found on the desk next to the safe. Look behind you, and you will see a wall with pictures of “Employees of the Month” – there should be one that stands out.In Seattle, Day 1, you have the option of exploring the Bank with Ellie in the Downtown area (located at 5th and James). You can find a note detailing the plans for a failed bank heist, which also provides the combination for the safe room. Travel through the safety deposit box room  – found at the end of the tills – and the vault should be on your left.What does The Last of Us Part II’s LGBT representation mean for games?Ellie finds this easily missable safe after going through the fence Downtown at Madison between 5th and 6th during Seattle Day 1. The combination is the same as the code used to open West Gate 2 – so check the list of gate codes that should be in your inventory.The fourth safe is found in the courthouse in Seattle Day 1. It’s located under a desk by the window before you travel into the car park. The skeletal remains of a FEDRA soldier are nearby. There’s a white board nearby with the combination written on.In the Capitol Hill segment of Seattle Day 1, you encounter this safe around the time you start seeing explosive tripwires, in a thrift shop that’s by a gym. The safe is placed right at the back, and requires solving two clues to open – the first, on the bulliten board, which leads you to the second, which is written on the walls of the thrift shop’s toilets.The final safe in Seattle Day 1 is located in a breakroom in the area where you first fight Shamblers. The clue is written on a note left on a table, which points you towards a can of soda. Smash open a vending machine, and you will find part of the answer. Tap the numbers into the lock, and you will gain access to the employee locker room.At the beginning of Seattle Day 2, you need to find a tattoo parlour, located near the bike shop. Go through the parlour, and there is a small building in the back with a dumpster propped against the door. The safe is inside you can find the combination written on a note in one of the nearby buildings. Beware though – there are infected inside too.The Last of Us Part II is a bleak and beautiful triumph – reviewLater in Seattle Day 2, when you’re en route to the hospital and walking down Route 5, you’ll reach a gate you can’t open, requiring you to use a dumpster to prop up the gate. Before doing so, however, look for a nearby apartment with a truck parked outside that you can climb to enter through the second floor. Once in, you’ll find a note telling you that the safe code corresponds to a wedding anniversary. It’s written on a calendar nearby – count back 30 years from the circled date.This safe is also found during Seattle Day 2. After travelling through the Merci building, you drop into a pool and emerge on the other side of the road. Go into Weston’s pharmacy – the note containing the full code is found on your way in.During Seattle Day 3, Ellie acquires a speedboat. After travelling a short distance, you’ll reach a point where a gate blocks your progress, and you have to leave the boat to open it. There’s a caged area in your immediate proximity containing the safe – climb up to the upper level and search one of the dead bodies for a note that discloses the combination. Shift the cart away from the wall to reveal a hole, which leads you into the cage.During Abby’s Seattle Day 1, you pass by a hardware store. After going through it and the boat repair shop, you come across a trailer. Break a window, go inside, and there’s a WLF gun cache note with the combination on it. The safe itself is then stored in a nearby building, which you can enter through a hole in the wall, around the left side.In Abby’s section of the game, you come across a row of shops, including a bakery and the Red Dragon Bar, and what looks like an antiques shop. Travel through the bar up to the second floor, and jump across into the opposite building. There’s a note on the second floor that tells you the combination to the safe – which is kept in the bakery opposite.Naughty Dog boss says The Last of Us Part 3 could be next projectThe final safe in Abby’s Seattle Day 1 is found on the crashed ship, at the back of the boat. The combination clue is written on the mutiny note.After climbing the rapids and crossing the highway overpass in Abby’s Day 2, you jump down into an apartment, which contains the safe and notes left between two of the building’s neighbours. Look at the apartment numbers on the doors in the hallway to determine the combination, as per the note’s instructions.The last safe is located in the skyscraper in Abby’s Seattle Day 2, which you must travel down on your way to the hospital. Search the storage room next to the gym entrance, before the spore-filled area. A clue for the combination is written on an artefact inside the back room – the code is the same as the Wi-fi password, which is written near the juice bar.All the combinations:The Last of Us Part 2\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Currently, it is only available to iOS users, but is expected to eventually come to Android users too.Tapping the button to compose a tweet will shows a new button with a wavelength icon. Hitting it pops up a record button, which will capture 140 seconds of audio.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever, many users pointed out that these kind of tweets could not be accessed by deaf people.Other social platforms, including YouTube, Zoom, Snapchat, and Facebook videos all have captioning.Journalist Liam O’Dell tweeted: “It\u0027s one thing getting Twitter users to caption their videos, asking them to caption audio tweets just makes the social media platform even more inaccessible to #deaf people like me.”Some users suggested providing subtitles, or alternative text, so that it could be more accessible.In a thread, the company apologised for treating accessibility as an “afterthought”.Instagram to overtake Twitter for news, report finds“We\u0027re sorry about testing voice Tweets without support for people who are visually impaired, deaf, or hard of hearing. It was a miss to introduce this experiment without this support” the company said.“We’ve fixed several issues related to vision accessibility, including making voice Tweets identifiable on the timeline and making accessibility improvements to the voice Tweet experience. These updates will be available in a forthcoming iOS release”“We’re already exploring ideas for how we could support manual and auto transcriptions. We’re also looking at how we can build a dedicated group to focus on accessibility, tooling, and advocacy across all products”It was also revealed that Twitter does not have a dedicated accessibility group. The company, which made 3.46 billion dollars in 2019, relies on employees volunteering rather than a formal team, according to Twitter software engineer Andrew Hayward.“The volunteers behind accessibility at Twitter (there is no formal team) strive to do their best to ensure products are shipped appropriately. Unfortunately though, we aren\u0027t aware of every product decision, and the wider #a11y conversation is ongoing.” he tweeted.Twitter’s head of design and research Dantley Davis said that he would advocate for accessability to be a part of project design from the beginning of all projects in future.“I appreciate the feedback and direct conversation about #a11y from our passionate community” It\u0027s clear we have a lot of work ahead to make Twitter more inclusive for people with disabilities.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.The bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

Feral cats that roamed the farms were also found to to be infected with the coronavirus.Experimental evidence shows that SARS-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, can infect cats, dogs, monkeys, ferrets, and hamsters, said the authors, who added that attention should be paid to rabbits, sheep, goats, cattle and horses as computational studies suggest the potential for infection.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?“Once SARS-CoV-2 circulates more widely beyond humans, it will be challenging to trace natural transmission between species because the viral genome is essentially identical in humans, and existing epidemiological are equipped to identify transmission between humans to interrupt it,” they write.The possibility of a new “reservoir species” must also be considered. A “reservoir species” refers to a living host of certain species in which a pathogen survives without always causing disease for the host itself.The authors said: “Domestic species whose population numbers are sufficient to act as a reservoir include cats and dogs, which is consistent with the case reports noted earlier, and studies showing or predicting infectivity.”Farmed wildlife such as mink and pigs, as well as rodents, could also act as a reservoir species as they “have sufficient numbers and densities for continuous transmission”.“These considerations should lead to strategies for implementing early surveillance and precautionary mitigation measures on different species,” the authors concluded.Prof Santini told the PA news agency: “We need to develop surveillance strategies to ensure we don’t get taken by surprise by a large outbreak in animals, which could pose a threat not just to animal health but to human health as well.“Virus transmission in animal populations could become irreversible if left unchecked, and may threaten the success of existing public health measures if people continue to catch the virus from an infected population of animals.”The comment comes after a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, published last month, said cats can readily become infected with SARS-CoV-2 and may be able to pass the virus to other cats.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In fact, I chaired a meeting this morning of our local action committee, which is the formal process through which we make these decisions, working with local leaders, for instance, in Kirklees.“And the local director of public health and the council are heavily involved in the response.”But it raised immediate questions about why Kirklees Council itself had apparently sought to keep the outbreak secret.All libraries, museums and galleries in Leeds could closeIn a statement, Rachel Spencer-Henshall, the area\u0027s director of public health, said: “We were made aware of a number of positive cases of Covid-19 at a workplace in Kirklees.“We have been providing support and advice to both the management and employees in order to minimise any further transmission.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

All the famous faces, including a picture of Sir Peter, are “fans” of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group.Each fragment will be signed by the artist and auctioned on Bidsquare, with bids starting at £325. The auction will be live until midnight on 26 June.The idea originated when London Advertising approached Sir Peter about the project as it wanted to use the mural to raise money for organisations helping people during the pandemic.Sir Peter, who also designed artwork for Paul Weller, Ian Dury and The Who, said: “I’m very happy that the Mandarin Oriental mural can be used a second time to raise money for such a wonderful purpose.

But organisers stepped up after the lockdown began and started providing 5,000 meals a week to families in Poplar struggling to afford or access food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDizzee volunteered as part of his work with Kitchen Social – the Mayor’s Fund for London programme providing food for children across the capital during the school holidays. “I was given an amazing opportunity to visit and help out Kitchen Social at Bygrove Primary School in Poplar, who are providing free food, books and school equipment to kids in the local area where I grew up,” he said.“Thank you to all the amazing people I met and thanks to the Mayor’s Fund for London for connecting the dots.”How to support our campaignBygrove Primary School is also receiving vital supplies from The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project.The food surplus charity, which delivers to hundreds of food banks and community projects across London, began helping the school at the start of the crisis by dropping off one or two trays of fresh produce and staple items each week.The charity has since increased the supply from one or two trays of food each week to 40 trays to help organisers cope with the huge demand.Mark Causton, manager of the school’s initiative, said: “The Felix Project have been an immense help – I can’t praise them enough. We know we’ll need to carry on this work right through the summer, so we rely on all the fresh food they’re supplying.”Mr Causton added: “We’ve seen a lot of parents furloughed or losing work over the past couple of months. In the case of some families struggling to afford to buy shopping, this is one of their only sources of getting food for their children.“It was really great to have Dizzee Rascal here helping out. He got stuck in, and got on so well with all the volunteers and all the families. It was just nice to see a smile on a lot of people’s faces.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

Figures from the Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) show a 175 per cent rise, with both charities reporting this their “busiest period ever”. Furthermore, a survey by the giving platform Neighbourly of 900 charities and community groups providing food to the vulnerable found that 70 per cent expect the situation to get even worse in the next six to 12 months.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent proprietor Evgeny Lebedev paid special tribute to the almost 6,000 ordinary iniduals who have dug deep to contribute to our appeal. He said: “Time and time again Londoners have shown that they are capable of immense generosity and community spirit in this period of crisis.“To all those that donated, bought and bid — I salute you.”Morgan Stanley said the bank and its employees in London had made the donation as part of their global Covid-19 response.How to support our campaignClare Woodman, head of Morgan Stanley EMEA, said: “The Felix Project plays a vital role in distributing food to people in need, especially those severely impacted by the pandemic. I am proud our employees in London are supporting them as part of our Covid-19 Hunger Relief Campaign.”Another substantial donor was Partners Capital investment group, which donated £95,287.John Collis, head of Partners Capital, Europe, said they “selected The Felix Project as one of our charities to support during this difficult period as it is one of the most impactful charities in London today”.Heads down for quiz nightThe original Top Gear trio — Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May — will tonight host a special Zoom quiz in aid of our appeal partner, The Felix Project. Participants in the Quintessentially Foundation’s “World’s Greatest Quiz Night” will face five rounds of questions devised by Nicholas Shearing, questions producer for top British TV quiz shows Pointless, Debatable and Impossible. May, who has driven Felix vans delivering food to vulnerable Londoners throughout lockdown, said: “At least in this stay-at-home pub quiz version, it will be easy to cheat.” 7.30-9pm. Tickets £10: thefelixproject.orggreatestquizOur appeal was also boosted by the silent auction, in partnership with Quintessentially Foundation, which closed this week with 135 bids placed for 36 lots and raising almost £40,000.The most highly prized lots were two tickets to a Liverpool FC game, four tickets to the Euro 2021 semi-finals, a video-chat with Spurs coach Jose Mourinho, a private guitar lesson with singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding and a helicopter lesson.The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

After paying rent and all her bills from the universal credit she receives at the beginning of the month, she now finds she has just £4.30 left over for food and nappies for the rest of the month.How to support our campaignSo she is almost entirely dependent on school vouchers available for her oldest two children (£15 per child per week) to buy absolute essentials, and one weekly food package dropped off by the Sufra food bank.“I don’t mind going hungry sometimes, so long as my kids have food,” said Ms Sarri-Gonzalez. “Sometimes I might have just one main meal for myself in a day. There was one point during lockdown I didn’t manage to eat anything for myself for two days, almost three days. But I always set the table for the children – I keep things as normal as possible for them.”“It’s so difficult at the moment. So stressful. I’m hoping when the kids go back to school later in the year I can go back to work and make things easier somehow.”The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project has quadrupled the volume of surplus food it gets out to people in need since the crisis began.The work remains as urgent than ever. The most recent YouGov poll for the Food Foundation charity shows over 1.5 million people in households with children have been unable to access food for economic reasons during the lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Watching parents struggle to put food on the table and go without food themselves is devastating.”Rebecca Archer and her partner – who have three girls aged eight, six and three at home in London’s High Barnet – have found it difficult to afford enough food during lockdown. “The shopping I do is costing a lot more with them at home all the time,” she said.Once the bills are paid and the main weekly shop is done on a Monday, the couple finds they have about £50 left to get through the week – about half the amount they usually had before the pandemic hit.The family has recently taken advantage of two £15-a-week school vouchers they get for their two oldest girls, and receive some cooked meals from their neighbour Katie-Louise Barber – a volunteer delivering food using The Felix Project’s supplies.“It’s been a real strain. Thinking and worrying about money all the time isn’t easy,” said Ms Archer. “I never thought I’d be worrying about having enough for the children to eat. There was one point we just didn’t have enough for the pre-paid gas meter, so we had to go without that for more than a week.”The Trussell Trust, which runs the country’s biggest network of food banks, has warned food charities cannot cope “indefinitely” with the huge spike in demand for help caused by the pandemic.A coalition of anti-poverty charities had written to the chancellor asking for an emergency income support scheme that would increase child benefits and end the five-week wait for initial universal credit payments.Anthony Cotterill, leader of the Salvation Army in the UK, warned: “It’s years since we have seen poverty to be such a real and present danger for so many people. We are approaching a poverty tipping point.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis. Find out how you can help here.

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease.

He added that it was time for legislative action and not another review.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe UK already has one of the most comprehensive centralised databases related to race and ethnicity in the form of its “Ethnicity facts and figures” service. It is designed to provide information about “the different experiences of people from a variety of ethnic backgrounds” and reveals some startling disparities between white people and Bame people living in the UK.Below are 11 charts that illustrate these different experiences.Stop-and-search powers have been heavily scrutinised in recent years and were the subject of a review by the Equality and Human Rights Commission in 2010 that found that black people were up to six-times more likely to be stopped by police than white people.Stop-and-search rates between 2018 and 2019 show that black people are now nearly 10-times more likely to be stopped and searched by police than white people. This has contributed to far higher arrest rates for black people than for white people.Not a single police force in England or Wales registered an arrest rate of less than 20 for every 1,000 black people.By contrast, not a single police force in England and Wales registered an arrest rate of more than 20 for every 1,000 white people.Disproportionate policing practices were also highlighted in a recent investigation into coronavirus lockdown enforcement across England and Wales.Freedom of Information (FOI) requests by advocacy group Liberty found that police forces were seven times more likely to fine Bame people during lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailFurther imbalance can be seen when it comes to home ownership and renting. Around 63 per cent of households in the UK live in homes that they own, according to figures from the English Housing Survey.When these households are broken down into ethnicity, however, a stark difference emerges.White British people have higher than average home ownership rates ⁠— nearly double that of black Caribbean people and more than treble that of black African people. These minorities are instead vastly over represented when it comes to private renting and social housing.Only Indian households, which make up just 2.5 per cent of the population of England and Wales according to the 2011 Census, have higher home ownership rates the white British households.The lack of home ownership among minority communities in the UK may contribute to a reduced feeling of belonging compared to white people.Results from the most recent Community Life Survey found that black people are increasingly less likely to feel as though they belong to Britain compared to white or Asian people.A similar story of inequality can be seen when breaking down education statistics by ethnicity. It emerges as early as primary education, where white British children are 10 per cent more likely to achieve the expected standard in reading, writing and maths.By the time the two groups reach A-levels, white British students are more than three times as likely to achieve high grades than black Caribbean students, according to figures from the Department for Education.Worse education transfers to worse employment rates for minorities, with black people seeing at least double the unemployment levels as white people between 2004 and 2018.The UK’s Annual Population Survey revealed that black people in employment are also paid less on average than white people.Average hourly pay for black people hovered between £9.91 and £10.80 between 2013 and 2018, while white people saw wages consistently rise from £10.58 to £11.87. Only people from Indian backgrounds received better pay than white people.Systemic racism in the UK even manifests itself in the proportion of deaths from the coronavirus pandemic.Data reveals that people from Bame backgrounds are up to twice as likely to die from Covid-19 than people of whit British ethnicity.The risk of death for people of Bangladeshi ethnicity is twice as high as white British, while other Asian, black and Caribbean ethnicities are between 10 per cent and 50 per cent more likely to die, according to a report from Public Health England.Health experts say there is no evidence to suggest that people from Bame backgrounds are genetically predisposed to be more vulnerable to the virus than white people. The figures are therefore a result of existing social and racial inequalities.In his attack on the government’s plans for a racial equality commission, Lammy said the time for holding discussions and launching reviews was over.Nine charts that show extent of racial inequality in US“It feels that yet again in the UK we want figures, data, but we don’t want action,” he said.“Black people aren’t playing victim, as Boris indicated, they are protesting precisely because the time for review is over, and the time for action is now ... Get on with the action, legislate, move. You’re in government ⁠— do something.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial. Our role as leaders is to keep that going, carry on putting emotional needs at the heart of everything we do, because then children are able to learn and benefit – and move through this crisis.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

It was jointly approved by the chief medical officers of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Hancock said:  “The UK moving to a lower alert level is a big moment for the country, and a real testament to the British people’s determination to beat this virus.“The government’s plan is working. Infection rates are rapidly falling, we have protected the NHS and, thanks to the hard work of millions in our health and social care services, we are getting the country back on her feet.”The change is likely to pave the way for further relaxations of the lockdown restrictions introduced by Boris Johnson in March. It will raise hopes that ministers will soon confirm the reopening of pubs and restaurants and permission for overnight stays in hotels and B\u0026ampBs from 4 July.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?But the chief medical officers warned that it did not mean the pandemic is over. They cautioned that localised outbreaks are likely to occur and urged the public to continue following safety guidelines.The UK has remained at Level 4 of the alert system since its introduction in May, signifying that a Covid-19 epidemic is in general circulation and transmission is high or rising exponentially.Level 3 indicates that the epidemic is in general circulation, but crucially makes clear that experts do not regard either the prevalence of the disease as high or its spread as rapid.In a joint statement, the CMOs for the four nations of the UK said they had reviewed the evidence and agreee with the JBC’s recommendation to move to Level 3 across the entire country.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The virus is still in general circulation, and localised outbreaks are likely to occur.“We have made progress against the virus thanks to the efforts of the public and we need the public to continue to follow the guidelines carefully to ensure this progress continues.”When first announced in the government’s coronavirus recovery plan in May, the alert level was presented as the key to easing lockdown restrictions.The plan stated that the timing of measures like the reopening of shops and the return of children to schools “must be warranted by the current alert level”.But in the event, the government went ahead with two waves of relaxation on 1 and 15 June without the JBC assessing that the risk level had fallen.At the time of the first set of adjustments to guidelines, Mr Hancock revealed that the Centre was not even up and running yet. And ministers later suggested that its principal role will be to monitor the disease for early signs of local outbreaks.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In Vietnam, rats are caught in rice fields – some traders breed them in farms with other live animals.For years scientists have warned that the wildlife trade – including wet markets that sell live animals – can harbour infectious diseases such as coronaviruses.The origins of the current Covid-19 pandemic remain contested. However, experts suspect that the disease started in bats and was transferred to another animal before being passed on to humans.The study, published in the bioRxiv journal ahead of peer-review, found six known coronaviruses in samples taken from three southern provinces in Vietnam between 2013 and 2014.New York rats feel the pressure of city livingPositives increased significantly along the supply chain.

And it couldnt come at a greater time of need: with our nation on the brink of the worst ever holiday hunger.The Covid pandemic has had a devastating financial impact on families up and down the country, with millions now struggling to keep a roof over their heads.Parents are, understandably, racked with anxiety over job losses, loved ones health and school closures, which have seen classrooms lie empty for  weeks.And this week, with the summer holidays looming, they faced another worry: how would they feed their children without free school meal vouchers Its a fear Rashford has bravely alleviated.The Man Utd star made an impassioned plea to the Government to prioritise Englands most vulnerable kids by extending the vouchers scheme over the six-week holidays.Under the programme, the families of around . million children eligible for free school meals are given £ a week in vouchers to spend in supermarkets to keep their kids fed.This is not about politics this is about humanity, Rashford wrote in an open letter. Political affiliations aside, can we not all agree that no child should be going to bed hungry The footballer was speaking from real experience: growing up in a low-income household in Manchester, his own family relied on free school meals and breakfast clubs.Today, a similar hand-to-mouth existence is being lived by millions of children across the country. And, in recent months, its been compounded by the coronavirus outbreak.Despite the Governments excellent furlough scheme, , Brits have lost their jobs during lockdown, with unemployment now set to hit the three million mark.As Rashford rightly observes, many families are living on a knes edge, gripped with fear over how they will pay their bills, cover their rent or even put food on the table.This is proven by new data from The Food Foundation, showing that food insecurity in households with children has nearly DOUBLED since the pandemic began.The research also reveals more than , youngsters have been forced to skip meals during lockdown because their family couldn’t access sufficient food.As Chair of the Commons Education Committee, I was delighted when, earlier this year, the Government extended its free school meals scheme for the Easter and May half-term holidays.Yet, like many, I believed its decision to halt the programme for the summer break was wrong.In my view, this was for three key reasons:Firstly, the vouchers have been a leline for many poverty-stricken families during the Covid lockdown. With further worrying and uncertain weeks ahead, these families need consistency.Secondly, and closely linked, is that millions of parents are struggling financially at the moment - something that may be exacerbated in August, when furlough contributions change.Feeding their kids over the summer will push their already stretched budgets to breaking point. Yet these youngsters desperately need, and deserve, nutritional meals.Thirdly, around three million children are at risk of holiday hunger every year .Extending the scheme was simply the right thing to do.It was also relatively easy: yes, its coming out of a £ million Covid Summer Food Fund, but unlike other schemes, it isnt bureaucratic and its understood by parents across England.It also goes to those who need it the most.Studies have shown that food poverty doesnt just impact on childrens health: malnourished kids are less likely to perform as well in the classroom as their better-off peers.This can shape the course of their adult le.England is already facing an educational Ice Ageschools cant open in September - by which point, children will have been out of education for six months.Despite parents home-schooling efforts,  per cent of teachers in the countrys most deprived areas have suggested their students are learning for less than one hour a day.And some , youngsters don’t have access to a computer or tablet at all.Its why Ive called for Alan Turing catch-up summer camps to be set up in school buildings, village halls and marquees - anywhere that can be used to educate our kids.Its also why, despite being a Tory MP, I publicly announced I would vote with Labour today and call on the Government to extend free school meals over the summer.To use a football analogy, it felt strange going to play for the opposite side. But like Rashford, I knew that impoverished families across the UK deserved more.Fortunately, Boris has seen sense, too.Amid this crisis, we need a bold vision from the PM about our childrens education: what are we going to do to get them learning again  How will we get them back to schools We need an exciting, confident agenda, because the next generation depends on it. With todays move, Boris has shown these families that, yes, we do mean business.As for Rashford, he has done as much -not more - for disadvantaged families than any politician. Hes brought a vital issue onto the national stage in a dignied way.Unlike virtue-signalling celebrities who fly on a plane from Los Angeles then go on about saving the environment, he has practised what he preaches.And in doing so, hes shown himself to be a nation icon on and off the pitch.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Well, the majority anyway.Be it scientist “Professor Lockdown” flouting his own advice, or Boris’s svengali Dominic Cummings bending the rules he helped make, the rot set in a couple of weeks ago and has now caused an undeniable fissure between the state and its initially compliant citizens.Yet, while thousands are blatantly breaking social distancing rules at parks, protests and shopping areas, many of them are still being furloughed — at vast taxpayer expense — to “stay home” from work.Whereas common sense dictates that being in an office that’s been health and safety-ed to the nth degree is a far more protected environment than any of the above.And what about schools  The majority of learning for GCSEs and A levels takes place in years  and  respectively, yet government plans for the \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"reopening of secondary schools remain “unclear”, with some reports saying they might not evenin September.Meaning that — on top of GCSEs and A levels being cancelled this year — hundreds of thousands of pupils will be in no position to take them next year either.If teenagers can gather in large, cheek-by-jowl groups at their local park, then surely ing to school isn’t beyond the pale  It might even be safer.As for the hospitality industry, well, not only is the two-metre rule killing it but pubs, in particular, face the galling reality of remaining closed while their beer gardens are used by hordes of people who’ve bought booze at the local supermarket.Enough already. Time, surely, for the Government to open its eyes to what’s happening around the country and exercise some common sense.Of course those who are vulnerable should continue to take as many protective measures as they wish, including remaining furloughed or off schoolnecessary.But the majority should nowto work or schooland start to get Britain back on its feet, both economically and psychologically.SCIENTISTS say that intelligent le could exist on as many as  planets in our galaxy.But they reckon aliens won’t visit Earth because of the distance.The two-week quarantine rules won’t help either.HOLLYWOOD actress Sharon Stone has revealed she was struck by lightening while doing the ironing.What a terrible shock.No, not the estimated billion volts that propelled Sharon across the kitchen, silly.The fact that a movie star was doing her own housework.TATLER magazine’s \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"controversial article on The Duchess of Cambridge proved that snobbery is still alive and kicking in certain sections of the British “upper” classes.Dredging up the age-old “doors to manual” jibe at Kate’s mother Carole, a former member of cabin crew, it also resurrected ancient, alleged whisperings among chinless wonders of her being “NQOCD” – not quite our class, darling.This week, Rosalind Mann died, after a -year career taking photos of posh “girls in pearls” for Country Le magazine.When asked the criteria for posing, she replied: “We never featured anyone whose house had a number.”There’s snobbery in the US too, but it’s largely centred around money, rather than class.In the compellingly vacuous Netflix series Selling Sunset, about a high-end estate agency in Hollywood, the buzz phrase is: “Millionaires have views, billionaires have compounds.”Sadly, I have neither.IN the next James Bond movie, No Time To Die, it’s reported that the legendary spy has a young daughter with Lea Seydoux’s character.Could this see those famous blue trunks being replaced by a papoose It’s tricky waters for Bond fans, with  per cent telling a recent poll that they think it’s a mistake to make the famous philanderer a family man.I’ll reserve judgment until the film is released, but suffice to say, tackling villains such as Le Chfre, Blofeld and Raoul Silva is child’s play compared to dealing with a toddler in meltdown.A PUNTER has placed a bet on Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis becoming PM by the end of .A spokesman for bookmaker Coral said: “The bet took us by surprise but someone’s convinced Maitlis could be the perfect match for No!”Presumably they’re not taking bets on which party she’d stand for as that would be too obvious.RICKY Gervais says that wherever he is in the world, he always frequents Italian restaurants because: “I know it’s going to be good and the same.”We have a similar issue at Moore Towers where – whether we’re at a Greek, French, Chinese, Italian or Japanese restaurant – the Bloke will spend aeons studying the ious culinary delights on offer before ordering “steak and chips” pretty much every time.THE stylist and “best friend” to Meghan Markle, Jessica Mulroney, is embroiled in a race row after appearing to threaten the livelihood of black lestyle blogger Sasha Exeter.Jessica, who has apologised, has now been dropped from regular TV slots and, while the pair have reportedly spoken in private, the Duchess of Sussex has yet to support her friend publicly.Something tells me that, aside from saying: “I need to do better” regarding race and injustice in society, Jessica is about to learn another valuable lesson.Hard times will always reveal true friends.CLOTHING website Missguided has been heavily criticised by shoppers after using slim models to market its plus-range of clothes in sizes  to .One said: “This screams, ‘we want to profit from plus-sized iniduals without representing or supporting them in any way’.” Very true.Equally, those ads for accessible baths showers targeted at the elderly but featuring a woman in her forties with the agility of a mountain goat.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And £million — the cost of extending free school meal vouchers during the holidays — is a drop in the ocean when you consider the overall cost of lockdown.We like Rashford’s style, too. How refreshing to see a celebrity using his fame to articulate a powerful argument with such authenticity. NEW unemployment figures make for grim reading. The number of people claiming  jobless benefits more than doubled to hit .million in May — the  highest level since . And because the furlough scheme is masking the true extent of the crisis, we fear the worst is yet to come. Scientists are trained to think about public health  in the narrowest sense. So their instincts tell them to keep Britain in lockdown for as long as possible. But elected politicians know that  poverty and  mass unemployment kill just as surely as the virus. It’s time they showed some leadership and started easing restrictions in earnest. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Government’s decision not to pay for the vouchers was mean-spirited and cheap.But you do wonder about a government which decides upon a policy — and then changes it as soon as a top footballer opens his mouth.Next week, Michael Gove decides to extend trade negotiations with the EU after an intervention by Harry Kane. And lockdown is lted completely when Kyle Walker says he wants to go to another house party.Still, Rashford was right and deserves credit. And he’s right, too, that the Government could go further in helping those of us who live in poverty. The pandemic has thrown the Government off course.It was bound to. But Boris and Co must remember why they were elected last December. They got a huge mandate from our country’s very poorest regions. The areas that usually support the Labour Party.That was partly because of Brexit, of course. And partly because the then Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn , was about as effective as a recently gassed badger.But it was also because Boris promised those former Labour heartlands what they wanted to hear.A closing of the ide between rich and poor, and between London and the rest of the country.Jobs, investment in new industries and transport infrastructure.He might think we’ve all forgotten. But we haven’t. The latest poll shows Labour only five points behind the Conservatives.The honeymoon is over.Boris could begin by increasing the minimum wage for people aged  and over. It is low wages, far more than unemployment, which is keeping people mired in poverty.It wouldn’t cost the Government very much at all. It would also provide a much-needed boost to the economy.An increase in free childcare from  hours per week to  hours would also enable those struggling to make ends meet to get out of the house and work for longer.Shortly after last December’s election, Boris turned up in the North East to give his thanks.He once again promised that the region would be rejuvenated.There’s been good news on some fronts — the Nissan plant at Sunderland, for example, won out over its rival in Barcelona. It will stay open, despite the loss of  jobs.But more needs to be done to attract industry to the North and the Midlands.So far as I can see, the Government has done nothing. OK, it’s had a few problems on its hands.But when this pandemic has passed, the Government will need to intervene to help our economy — the private sector alone cannot do it.And the place to start is away from London — in the places where the new breed of Tory voter lives.Marcus Rashford’s intervention was timely and needed. This Government needs to know the poor are watching and waiting. Waiting for action, waiting for the promises of last year to be delivered.THERE is a stupidity about the woke crowd, trying to ban everything, which defies belief.An old episode of Fawlty Towers was pulled. Because it had some disturbing and potentially offensive racial material in it.But as the star of it, John Cleese, tried patiently to explain – it was SATIRE.The character of Basil Fawlty was the subject of the humour. He was mocked for his idiocies. That’s why we laughed.The episode has now been reinstated – but the moron caravan has already moved on. Now they’ve got it in for Mahatma Gandhi. Racist! The bloke who fought for India’s liberation from British colonialism.Was he a racist  Yes, without much doubt. He took a pretty jaundiced view towards Africans. But the good he did easily outweighs the bad.And believe me, there isn’t a single person born before  who didn’t possess views which today’s society would consider offensive. Regarding race, or gender, or homosexuality. Not one.Why can these people not understand that the past was dferent  And that we judge its heroes in a dferent light There was a really nasty battle between the two sides, with many dead – the first time since .China continues to bully its neighbours and oppress its own people.In this battle, I know whose side I’m on.THE Government has not done much right recently.But at least Boris and Co are binning the Department for International Development.It is to be stripped of its status and merged with the Foreign Office.With any luck, this will mean we will not be giving away any more hard-earned taxpayers’ money to countries like India, which has its own space programme so is clearly not short of a bob or two.Or China – a nasty, totalitarian state and the second richest country in the world.In the last round of spending, we actually bunged money into a programme to help Chinese people improve their diets.Nope, not kidding.I wonderit mentioned anything about it maybe not being a great idea to eat bats Various studies have suggested these donations are worthless and often counter-productive.I think, right now, we need to spend money at home, no SCIENTISTS from Japan have predicted that within  years we will be able to understand what animals are thinking. We will be communicating with them.Uh-oh. Not sure that’s good. Imagine a chat with a wasp . . .“Hi, Mr Wasp. What you doing ”“I’m crawling up your window. What’s it to you  And it’s Ms Wasp, as it happens. I’ve transitioned. So don’t misgender me. Now, p*** off before I sting you on the neck.”Worse with cats. “LOVE you  WTF, I’ve never even liked you. You’re mugs, humans. Just put the food out and give me a warm place to sleep and I’ll purr for a bit to keep you happy. Now, excuse me. I’m going to sleep on the roof of the shed for six hours.”But I might start watching it now as the cast all seem to hate each other.The soap has been torn apart by rows over the Black Lives Matter debate.Lysette Anthony has taken loads of flack and her co-star Rachel Adedeji has described her as “actual trash”.Hmm . . . somehow I suspect the show will not be anywhere near as interesting as the row.NOT everything about lockdown has been bad. Far from it.My we hasn’t been to TK Maxx for three months, for a start. There’s a mercy.And we’re not using cash. There’s little indication we will need to use cash ever again.Those people who aren’t on the breadline have saved money.And then there’s offices. Will we really go back to that awful daily commute, when the vast majority of jobs can, these days, be done at home  Just think how many homes we could createwe converted all those empty offices into flats.Offices were created because we needed a place to store paper files. Don’t really need that now, do we The Government should encourage firms to move to home-working, when – the stats suggest – employees are a lot more productive.IN France – a country almost as badly hit by Covid- as the UK – the schools will be reopening on Monday. By law, no arguments. Full curriculum.Over here, meanwhile, there are suggestions that some schools will not be opening until JANUARY and will not open properly for a year. Incredible.The Government needs to get a grip of this right now, as I argued last week.Call the bluff of the horrible trade unions and get our kids back to school.

It’s just easier than trying to do the school work.“It’s a way of escaping from everything.“I’m worried the teachers will be disappointed in me because I haven’t done enough work.“I’m worried I’ll fall behind and have to resit the year when all my friends go on.”And he is not alone. A study by University College London revealed that two million children have done barely any schoolwork at home.Since March, around  per cent of pupils have done none, or less than an hour, a day. And just  per cent put in more than four hours a day.Finn’s mum Kerrie, , a former secondary school teacher, admits she only ever sees her son at meal times.The single mum, who also has daughters Imogen, , and six-year-old Elodie, has found it hard to juggle home-schooling with working full-time as a social worker.She says: “When lockdown started I thought I’d be able to manage, especially because I used to be a teacher.“I was really motivated and ordered lots of stuff on Amazon to help. I think because the kids could see I was motivated it rubbed off on them.“But as time has gone on it’s become more dficult and challenging. I can’t give  per cent to my job and  per cent to teaching my kids. It’s just not possible.”Now Finn usually gets up around .am, has breakfast then switches on his games console — and stays up until midnight.Kerrie says: “I tried to get Finn to do schoolwork. With not enough computers for me and the kids to work, I even set written work for him.“But I couldn’t make him do it, no matter how much I encouraged him.” As we report today, more than , child health experts have signed an open letter to Boris Johnson demanding the Government publishes a clear plan to get all youngsters back to school as soon as possible or “risk scarring the le chances of a generation of young people”.The letter, organised by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, warns children are “suffering enormously” from a lack of access to exercise, vaccinations and mental health support.m have done under an hour’s work a day, experts warn PM it will ‘scar a generation’This is par­ti­cu­larly concern­ing for Clare Cashion, , when it comes to -year-old daughter Libby.Clare, a civil servant from Worcester, who is also mum to Ollie, , Lochlan, four, and two-year-old Cullann, says: “Libby has gone from being a  hardworking student to a changed character, so I do worry about her wellbeing.”Libby now stays awake until am and usually gets up at about lunchtime. Instead of doing schoolwork, she spends most of her time talking to friends on social media.She says: “At first we didn’t know what we were supposed to be doing, and because there wasn’t proper work or anyone to check your work and because you can’t just ask questions, I didn’t want to do it.“When I did do it, I didn’t get any feedback, and then my friends would tell me they hadn’t bothered, so I just thought, ‘What’s the point ’.“I’m a huge worrier and I am concerned about falling behind, but I’d rather stay up and talk to friends on my phone. That’s when everyone is online.“Mum tries to make me do more schoolwork but it doesn’t work. There just doesn’t seem much point at the moment. “I’d just like to go back to school.”In a report last month, government advisory body Sage warned lockdown had caused a “shock” to kids that will last the rest of their lives and affect work opportunities.The report also confirmed the risk of children catching coronavirus was “much lower” than adults.Yesterday, MPs on the Education Select Committee accused teaching unions of running a “disgraceful political campaign” to keep classrooms closed by “cherry picking” evidence to make parents fear schools are “death traps”.Chairman Robert Halfon asked: “Can you explain why parents and children can have access to Primark over the coming weeks and months but not to schools ”For Libby and Clare, it will be a big relief when schools can reopen. Clare says: “School has now started online lessons, so one week they’ll be live, and  Libby has taken part in some, but the following week it’s just emails and sometimes they have to cancel.“I think Libby struggles with not knowing exactly what’s expected.”Finn is just as desperate to get back in the classroom.He said: “I really want to go back to school because it’s a lot easier to learn in a classroom with a teacher explaining the work, and I miss my independence.“I’ve found it really dficult being at home this long.”To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

All schools will be able to access it, but it will be targeted at those with high numbers of disadvantaged pupils.”The plan is also expected to involve summer camps for some pupils too throughout the holidays.However, its unlikely that schools will remain formally open.Government sources dismissed the reports as speculation.The Education Secretary is due to reveal the plans in full this week.The Government has said it aims to get all kids back into school by September.But this morning, Tory MP Geoffrey Clton Brown said it was likely that the m rule would have to be changed before that could happen.He told Radio s Today programme:I am absolutely sure, your contributor was right, we are not going to get all children back to school in September unless the m rule is changed.I am quite certain from everything I have heard, that it will be changed by then.The PM, as he’s made public, is undertaking a detailed study on this.I am absolutely certain that by September it would have been changed. A Department for Education spokesperson said: We are working with partners to develop a long-term package of support for children to catch up on lost learning as a result of coronavirus, building upon the £ million of support already made available to help children learn from home.

Teachers will head back to schools for the original target date - August  - to get classrooms ready for students. The guidance has a day one focus that concentrates on social distancing and hygiene considerations within school settings, Mr Weir wrote. The letter said: The Northern Ireland Executive has agreed that the current social distancing guidance of m must continue to be followed between all adults within the education sector, but that a distance of m is safe and appropriate between children and young people.Using protective bubbles has been supported by the Department of Health and PHA, and flexing their use to m will allow full classes to attend.The m guidance between children is to be followed as far as possible within the confines of the physical capacity of each classroom and the m rule for staff adhered to fully.To facilitate these arrangements, schools will be opening in week commencing  August for preparation purposes, he said.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said this evening the Department for Education was looking at a relaxation for the rule in England. He said: We are working on what is needed to get all schools open in September.I do get the interaction between  metre rule and getting people back to school.But the  metre rule is itself a social distancing measure, so removing it has an impact in terms of the transmission of the disease.

The virus is still in general circulation, and localised outbreaks are likely to occur.“We have made progress against the virus thanks to the efforts of the public and we need the public to continue to follow the guidelines carefully to ensure this progress continues.”  The Prime Minister unveiled the five-stage coronavirus warning system as part of a gradual easing of the lockdown during a televised address on May .He said he was establishing a new joint biosecurity centreto run the alert system, which is similar to that used to establish the terrorist threat.The group would detect increases in Covid- infection rates and judge how strict lockdown measures and social distancing rules should be.Two factors determine the UKs coronavirus threat level - the R number and the number of confirmed Covid- infections at any one time.The alert levels range from level one - green - to level five - red.When the scheme was launched, the country was at level four, which means a Covid- epidemic is in general circulation, transmission is high or rising exponentially.The system says that current social distancing measures and restrictions should remain in place.Level five is when transmission is high or rising but also when there was a risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed and will require an increase in social distancing measures.Level one means Covid- is no longer known to be in the UK and the only action should be routine international monitoring.Level three is when the epidemic is in general circulation and gradual easing of restrictions can take place, while level two is when the number of cases and transmission is low and no or minimal restrictions are required.But under level two there will be enhanced testing, tracing, monitoring and screening.At the end of May, Mr Johnson told MPs that were coming down the Covid alert system from level four to level three tomorrow, we hope, were going to be taking a decision tomorrow.But the alert level was not lowered - despite the easing of some restrictions - and it remained at four until now.Representatives from industries, such as the hospitality sector, may hope it could also pave the way for the two-metre rule to be relaxed which is key for many pubs, restaurants and cafes to reopen.Prof Matt Keeling, of Warwick University, believes the downgrade is currently justied but cautions against the easing of social distancing.He said: The move to level three is not a time for complacency, there is still the prospect of a second wavecontrols are relaxed too quickly and the reproductive numberrises above one.We are likely to be entering a new phase of this outbreak, where nationally and regionally cases will continue to decline, but locally there will be isolated clusters of cases that need to be contained.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nick Gibb declined to say children would definitelyin full in September - saying only it was the governmentaposs intention. It raises the prospect of a possible fresh setback to school opening dates after unions warned the September date was impossible. Boris Johnson has repeatedly insisted he wants all children in England toto school from September.But teaching unions say the maths doesn’t work under current distancing rules - which force schools to split pupils into -strong aposbubblesapos, doubling the number of classes. The National Education Union has called on the government to use public buildings for extra classroom space and use blended learning, with a mixture between home and classroom. Mr Gibb was challenged today over whether the September date could become another U-turn. He told Sky News: Well our clear intention is schools will reopen for all pupils in September. We’re led of course by the science and the medical advice. He added: We are taking every step in a cautious way, we’re working with the school sector, we’re taking advice.  And we give schools plenty of notice and time to plan for that reopening in September. Of course we’re working on other contingency plans, but the clear intention is we will have all children back in school in September. A third of Englandaposs primary schools are still not fully open to years R,  and  despite being asked to do so since June . And plans to reopen primary school years , ,  and  by July were dropped when government officials accepted there wasnapost enough space. The growing crisis in education in England has seen millions of kids unable to attend classes since the unprecedented Covid- lockdown ordered in March.Parents have been battling to homeschool youngsters amid fears some will fall behind their peers. A report by University College Londonaposs Institute of Education found two million children have done less than an hour a day of schoolwork during the lockdown. Today the government announced a £billion catch-up package to stop kids being left behind. Some £million will be shared across state primaries and secondary schools over the next academic year. And a £million National Tutoring Programme will boost access to tuition for the poorest kids. But the cash includes nothing for nurseries or further education colleges. And is not clear about how much support will be given over the summer holidays because it is up to heads how to spend the cash. Mr Gibb admitted the funding made available for schools will only start to be distributed from September. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, he said: The money will start to be paid in the academic year starting in September. Schools will know itaposs coming and they will be able to budget on that basisthey want to do things before September.

The four Chief Medical Officers for the four nations of the UK agreed it should be reduced from Level  to Level . It means the Covid- epidemic is in general circulation, but transmission is no longer high or rising exponentially. Itaposs finally happened after the government claimed for weeks that it was moving towards . Health Secretary Matt Hancock boasted it is a big moment for the country, and a real testament to the British people’s determination to beat this virus. But it doesnapost actually make much dference to how the UK will come out of lockdown. Thataposs because after a massive row over the alert level, the government claimed it doesnapost actually make a dference to easing restrictions. So what is the alert level and what dference will todayaposs announcement make to your le  Weaposve had a took. What are the coronavirus alert levels   There are five alert levels, set by a Joint Biosecurity Centre that was established in May to deal with the pandemic. They are:Level  COVID- is not known to be present in the UK Level  COVID- is present in the UK, but the number of cases and transmission is low Level  A COVID- epidemic is in general circulation Level  A COVID- epidemic is in general circulation transmission is high or rising exponentially Level  As level  and there is a material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmedWhat is the UK Covid- alert level now  As of Friday  June the alert level is three, meaning a COVID- epidemic is in general circulation. That is down from level four, as the alert level had been since the system was set up in May. Who agrees the UK alert level   Changes to the alert level are recommended by the JBC and then signed off by the four Chief Medical Officers in the four nations of the UK. In other words, despite Boris Johnson claiming for weeks that it was moving towards , he does not have direct power to change the alert level. The level is set primarily by R - the number of new people each carrier is infecting - and the overall number of coronavirus cases. What is the alert level actually used for   Thereaposs a big debate about some of this. We know from the roadmap for easing lockdown, published on May , that the alert level is designed to communicate the current level of risk clearly to the public. So itaposs a bit like the terror threat level. It crunches of all the risks facing the UK into one star rating, to give the public a vague idea of how bad things are. It shows the threat now - not the potential future threatthe virus spins out of control again. Whataposs controversial is how much the alert level affects lockdown directly. When it was first announced in May, the government said there was a link - but now it claims there isnapost a link at all. What did the government say before   When the alert level system was set up in May, the government linked it to the easing of lockdown. In a slide on May  , is said that at level , current social distancing measures and restrictions remain. Only at level  would there be a gradual relaxing of restrictions and social distancing measures. And at level  there would be no or minimal social distancing measures. And Boris Johnson said on May : That Covid Alert Level will tell us how tough we have to be in our social distancing measures – the lower the level the fewer the measures. The higher the level, the tougher and stricter we will have to be.  The government has since changed its tune and made clear any changes to lockdown are not based on the alert level. Instead, No says lockdown changes are based on the five tests for easing lockdown:The NHS is able to cope A sustained fall in deaths New infections dropping enough Adequate testing and PPE No risk of a second peak that overwhelms NHSThis prompted a massive row when the government started easing lockdown in England - opening schools and shops, and letting groups of six meet outdoors - despite the high alert level. Questioned on June , the PMaposs spokesman appeared to rewrite history. He said the government were always clear that changes to lockdown were based on the separate five tests - not the alert levels. Why did the row happen  We still donapost fully know. Perhaps itaposs possible that early No literature - including Boris Johnsonaposs address to the nation - was produced in error or when the policy wasnapost properly settled. But what we do know is this. Using the five tests, rather than the alert level, allowed some political input into the decision to ease lockdown. Rather than basing it entirely on the science about the virus, Boris Johnson could also base his decision on other factors like the economy. We also know it took a long time for the Joint Biosecurity Centre - which sets the alert level - to be ready. On June , three weeks after it was announced, No admitted the Joint Biosecurity Centre was not yet fully up and running”.

Elizabeth Manuel, , was forced to shut herself off from the world when the government announced vulnerable people and the over s should not leave home for  weeks. She lost her sight after suffering a near fatal brain hemorrhage and stroke at the age of . But as millions of people raced to the supermarket and selfishly stripped shelves of essentials - Elizabeth became one of the unfortunate needy Brits left without basic supplies.As she shielded at her Portsmouth home soon after the country entered lockdown - she was then struck down with coronavirus.Describing her terrying ordeal, Elizabeth said the virus choked her of breath as she desperately tried to call  for an ambulance.Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog hereShe said: I was one of the first people in early March told to self-isolate - from that point on I had no contact with anyone as I live completely on my own. I then went from the vulnerable to the extremely vulnerable category. And to add to the excitement, I ended up being diagnosed with coronavirus. I started off with a headache and then had a persistent cough that went into bad breathing dficulties. After  hours I knew I needed some urgent help and I had to call  because I simply could not breath. But I couldnapost even ask for an ambulance - I had no breath to speak and I had to press buttons to identy where I was. I then went to open the door for paramedics as I thought I could lose consciousness before they arrived. Elizabeth was admitted to hospital for three nights as she recovered from the worst part of her illness.  But after being confirmed well enough to go home, she ed to her empty house - struggling to get out of bed for three weeks while panicking about where her food was going to come from. Elizabeth, who despite her own blindness and lockdown struggles, signed up as an NHS volunteer in the hope of helping from home, also spoke about her struggles with supermarkets shops and deliveries. As supplies in her cupboards and fridge dwindled, Elizabeth panicked about how she would feed herself without any help. Despite writing to supermarkets, her local MP and local crisis groups, Elizabeth said she was made to feel worthless when nobody offered immediate help. She said: I knew I really needed food so tried internet shopping but there were no slots. Every day I would go online and there would be no slots, I was getting very axious. I wrote to the supermarkets because at that point there was nothing in terms of a priority slot. Then under government rules I went from being vulnerable to extremely vulnerable.  I was contacting people telling them I had about a weekaposs worth of food in my freezer and that was it. It made me feel worthless and one of the worst things about lockdown is I have felt more disabled now than i ever have since having my stroke. Elizabeth also said her anxiety about ing to the outside world after lockdown ends is also much higher.

Pet owners in the UK are being urged to get their much loved furry ones tested amid fears they can contract the virus, incubate it and pass it on to humans.This puts the country at risk of a fresh outbreak evencoronavirus has been wiped out in humans, itaposs claimed.There have been conflicting reports since the pandemic began about whether pets pose any coronavirus risk or not. Now researchers from University College London want a mass surveillance programme of all animals that live close to humans. Professor Joanne Santini wants more research into which animals are susceptible to Covid- and increased testing.  She wrote in the The Lancet Microbe medical journal: There is increasing evidence that some animals can catch SARS-CoV- from people, and might subsequently transmit it to other people - but we donapost know just how much of a risk this is, as itaposs an area of study that has not yet been prioritised.We need to develop surveillance strategies to ensure we donapost get taken by surprise by a large outbreak in animals, which could pose a threat not just to animal health but to human health as well. Virus transmission in animal populations could become irreversibleleft unchecked, and may threaten the success of existing public health measurespeople continue to catch the virus from an infected population of animals. Colleague Professor Sarah Edwards added: “There’s an urgent need for widespread surveillance, by testing samples, preferably non-invasively, from large numbers of animals, particularly pets, livestock and wildle that are in close proximity to human populations.”  More laboratory experiments on small numbers of animals are unlikely to give us the evidence needed to be confident that certain species are entirely safe, making major surveillance work the only real option here. Previous studies have hinted that Covid- could be transmitted to animals because the protein it depends upon is found in many species. Domestic and feral cats, dogs, hamsters, monkeys and ferrets have so far been shown to be able to be infected with the virus. Researchers say farmed wildle such as pigs, minks, bats and rodents, could act as reservoir species for the virus.  It can be hard to identysome animals are carrying the virus because while some will show symptoms others will be asymptomatic. If an animal tests positive for coronavirus they will need to be quarantined or culled. In Holland , farmed minks were killed after they became infected with the virus and passed it on to two humans. Experts believe that, once originally infected by humans, the outbreak spread to dferent farms through feral cats.  Tests discovered a signicant minority of cats had been infected with the virus. The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention acknowledges that cats, dogs “and a few other” animals can be infected. The organisation has updated its advice telling people not to let their pets interact with other animals or people outside the house. In New York Nadia, a four-year-old Malaysian tiger, contracted coronavirus at Bronx Zoo reportedly from a keeper.

The home in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, looks ordinary from the outside, but inside it is packed with newspapers dating back to , stopped clocks, a half-smoked pipe, and the owneraposs shoes left by the bed years after the property was vacated. Photographer Rebecca was invited in to see the decaying cottage after its owner died and she was left in awe of the haunting scenes within the perfectly preserved home. The cottage was lived in until  by the last of three brothers, who kept all of their family history, alongside tins of food from the early th century left unopened on the kitchen shelves.A man only identied as Dessie was the last to live there, leading aposa solitary le among the relics of the pastapos before moving into a home in  and passing away two years later. Rebecca, who owns the Abandoned NI website sharing photos of the derelict houses she explores, was allowed in by the owner to get a record of the incredible space before it was knocked down to make way for a new build. She said she was left gobsmacked by what she found, with old books, magazines, papers and photographs littered around the farm workeraposs cottage and left untouched. A clock on the mantel piece is stuck showing ., a pair of glasses are left ready to pick up and a rusted OXO tin has been left open, with two pocket watches stored inside. Hundreds of handwritten letters fill the drawers, and three kettles are sat on the stove, next to a cup which appears to have been placed there just before it was abandoned. Old books and newspapers including the Mid Ulster Mail from  were left sitting in the living room which had been shut off for more than  years, alongside one newspaper which reported the aftermath of the sinking of the Titanic in . Upstairs there remained rotting bedclothes, a bed pan on the floor and a flat cap left hanging on the end of a bedframe. Rebecca said she initially wasnapost surethe interior would be very interesting, but she has now created an exhibition based on the lives of Dessie and his family.  She said: I have to admit I saw the outside and wasnapost sureit was worth it. As soon as I opened the door I was blown away. I went into what I thought was a wee cottage and itaposs basically a social history museum. The cottage first appeared on maps in  and Rebecca began researching the family to help piece together the puzzle in all of the photographs. After talking to people to find out more about Dessie, she said: Among many things he was a fabulous cook, many friends still talk about his famous soda bread which he cooked over the original stove. He was a hearty farmer, milking cows to produce milk and butter.It was reportedyou stayed for dinner in the house and you finished up, you were given another dinner for seconds.No one left with an empty stomach. One of the mysteries Rebecca was able to solve was personal items belonging to an Edwin McQueen, who she was able to discover was married to Dessieaposs mum. He worked as a policeman, and a certicate from  and a framed picture of him in his unorm was found in one of the bedrooms.

German prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters said the first letter was to forewarn the family about the German authorities publicly announcing on June  that this is a murder inquiry and that Madeleine is dead. Mr Wolters added they wrote to the family at a later date too, with The Sun suggesting this letter was posted last week. The prosecutor has told Italian daily la Repubblica that while he didnapost write either letter, the Federal Police in conjunction with ourselves and the British got in touch with the family.  But the British couple said on Wednesday they had not received any letter from Germany stating their daughter is dead. It comes after criticism of the way Gerry and Kate McCann have been treated by that countryaposs auth­orities investigating convicted rapist Christian Brueckner, . Brueckner, jailed in the German city of Kiel, is the prime suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine from Praia da Luz in Portugal in  when she was three.  In a statement released earlier this week, Kate and Gerry said: The widely reported news that we have a received a letter from the German authorities that states there is evidence or proof that Madeleine is dead is FALSE. It comes as reports suggest police in Germany and Portugal have reportedly clashed over sharing DNA evidence that could lead to a breakthrough. German investigators want to retest a mystery saliva sample found in the holiday apartment the British toddler vanished from. The Portuguese police are reportedly unwilling to budge, with a source close to the Policia Judiciaria labelling re-testing a total waste of time. The evidence was found on the youngster’s bed inside apartment A at the Ocean Club by forensic teams after she went missing in .

When their gorgeous little girl was born in January last year, weighing lb oz, the couple were over the moon. But just four months later their joy turned to despair when they were told she was battling the rare liver condition biliary atresia. The illness only affects young children butleft untreated can lead to liver cirrhosis, which is most common among people with alcohol addiction. Millyaposs only hope was a liver transplant. Kamiesha only realised she was pregnant when she noticed she was more emotional than usual. The -year-old from Edmonton, in North London, said: I wouldnapost have suspected I was pregnantit wasnapost for my emotions being all over the place. I was getting very upset and crying a lot. I went to cancel my internet service one evening. I had to pay a leaving fee and I was crying my eyes out down the phone to my provider. I knew something was wrong after that and remembered having a similar breakdown when I was pregnant before. So, two days later, I bought a pregnancy test. After the fourth one was positive, I finally believed it. It was a surprise - but a pleasant surprise. And when I told Dakarai the next morning, he couldnapost stop smiling. For the whole day he had this huge smile on his face. Devoted mum Kamiesha, who has an older daughter, Aniyah, six, from a previous relationship, was plagued with morning sickness throughout her pregnancy and her labour was extremely tough. She explained: They tried everything to get her out. After three tanks of air and an epidural she finally came. She was seemingly happy and healthy and the next day we were out of there. But little Milly was far from a contented baby and Kamiesha says she would scream the house down and was always hungry. Kamiesha put it down to her daughter being a little grouchy. She said: Milly would just cry and scream all day long. She refused to nap and was always up.No matter how much we fed her she was never satisfied. Then, when Milly was a month old the whites of her eyes took on a dull yellow tinge which turned turned full on yellow within a week. Kamiesha said: They were yellow like the shining sun.The worried mum called NHS  and was told to see her GP, who thought she was suffering from acid reflux and prescribed Gaviscon - an over the counter heartburn and indigestion remedy - to be mixed with her baby milk.Kamiesha said: The doctor wasnapost worried about the colour of her eyes. She said it was quite common in newborns. But Millyaposs condition didnapost improve over the next few weeks and her aunt, Natalie, offered to pay for a private consultation with a paediatrician. Kamiesha and her delivery driver partner will never forget the day that changed their lives forever. She said: After feeling her stomach the doctor turned to us and said, aposI need a few minutes.apos He came back in the room and asked us to sit down. I knew then it was serious and, at that point, I was hysterical. They were told Milly had suspected biliary atresia - which affects just . in , births in England and Wales. The condition occurs when the liveraposs bile ducts become blocked and without treatment it leads to scarring of the liver, or cirrhosis, most commonly caused by prolonged alcohol abuse. Blood and urine tests at their local AE confirmed their worst fears. Kamiesha said: When they told us Milly needed a new liver, I was in a flood of tears. All I could think was, aposWhy is this happening  Why canapost it be straight forward apos It was actually heartbreaking. But, with no organ immediately available, doctors remained hopeful that they could still help Milly. She was booked in for surgery five days later, where they hoped to re-establish the flow of bile from the liver. Heartbreakingly, less than an hour into the three-hour operatio, Kamiesha received the gut wrenching news that her daughteraposs liver was already too damaged for the surgery to work.. While Milly spent the next three days recovering in hospital her parents were told she would now need a new liver to have any hope of surviving. For the next eight months Milly was given eight tablets a day – a combination of steroids, pain relief and vitamins - while she waited for an organ match. Kamiesha said: Those were the hardest eight months of my le. Milly was in so much pain, her stomach kept getting bigger and bigger. It felt like weaposd had all the special moments of her first year with us stolen. Then, in October last year, the family got the news they had been desperately hoping for - a liver match had been found and Milly was rushed to hospital by ambulance. Kamiesha said: I couldnapost control myself - I was crying with joy. Every emotion you can think of was running through my body. We were all so excited for her and she didnapost even know - she was too young to understand. After seven hours of surgery the operation was hailed a success and Milly spent the next month in hospital recovering from the massive procedure. Discharged on November , , for the next few months she seemed to be going from strength to strength. Kamiesha said: Everything was going okay. Milly started doing the things sheaposd missed out on, like sitting on the sofa on her own and babbling. But the Milly and her family were dealt a devastating blow in February. Blood tests at a routine check-up showed her liver was not ing properly and for the next two months doctors did their best to stabilise her by increasing the her anti-rejection drugs. Despite their best efforts, a biopsy from Millyaposs liver in April confirmed her body was rejecting the donor organ, seeing aof the totaposs extended stomach.  Still waiting to hear the next step in her daughteraposs treatment, Kamiesha said: Because of lockdown the doctors have pushed back Millyaposs review, which will tell us exactly what the next steps are. Worst case scenario, she is going to be relisted for a new liver and Iaposm not sure we can go through that again. Now the couple have launched a GoFundMe page, hoping to raise £, to fund treatment outside the NHSneeded. It was only going private that ended up getting Milly diagnosed in the first place and even then it was too late, Kamiesha said. She was putting on weight and seemed to be responding well. We knew something was wrong with Milly when she was just a month old.

The -year-old posted a photo of herself covered in colourful squares and what looks like cream cake in a celebratory post early this morning. The youngest ever Nobel Prize laureate also shared a snap of her and her family posing with balloons and a large cake which reads: Happy graduation Malala. She wrote: Hard to express my joy and gratitude right now as I completed my Philosophy, Politics and Economics degree at Oxford.I don’t know what’s ahead. For now, it will be Netflix, reading and sleep.Like many students this year Malala has graduated in unusual circumstances.

But in brighter news, the only thing we will be soaking up next week is glorious sunshine as we get back to sizzling in another mini-heatwave. Forecasters expect dazzling skies on Monday and Tuesday with the mercury hitting C in London and C in the South East by Wednesday.The Met Office ’s Becky Mitchell said: “On Monday we’ll see highs of C in the South East and low s in central England and Wales. On Tuesday it will start to get hotter, we see temperatures reach the high s. It will feel warmer in all parts of the UK.” But there is a grim patch to weather first and some face major clean-ups before breaking out the barbies again.Hundreds of homes were flooded yesterday – some for a third time this year. Emergency services pumped water out of houses in Pentre, Wales, a village flooded twice when Storm Dennis hit in February. Yellow thunderstorm warnings were in place for London, southern England and parts of south Wales.Ryan Shelton posted footage of a submerged street in Ilkeston, Derbys, and said the flooding was “worse than ever”. The -year-old said it was “quite scary” how  minutes of rain left .m of floodwater. Floodgates protected the front of his home but water got in the back via sewage pipes – leaving a “dreadful” scene. Residents had just six sandbags to protect  houses and were forced to unblock drains themselves. And the weather was so unseasonal residents on Cavell Close in Walsall, West Mids, were baffled to wake to what looked like a covering of snow after a hailstorm created a wintry scene in C.  Jerry Lovell, , said it was like a “Christmas card”, adding: “It was like January. It didn’t last long but was quite a sight, considering we had the barbecue out days before.” Meanwhile, an RNLI leboat rescued two fishermen drting in a tiny dinghy in turbulent waters off Rhyl, North Wales, on Tuesday. The Coastguard said: “Blow-up boats and toys are fun in the pool but we do not recommend their use at the seaside.” "},{"url":null,"title":"voice mirror once again government","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the Mirror: Once again the government has been found wanting in this crisisWe were promised a \"world beating\" test and trace operation in place by the start of June, but this incompetence has cost lives after the app was finally ditchedShareCommentsByVoice of the Mirror:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN Newsopinionthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video matt-hancock-technical-barrier-prevented-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news voice-mirror-once-again-government-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

At the heart of this would be a mobile app Health Secretary Matt Hancock said would allow the tracking of Covid- on a mass scale. The latest figures show the programme has failed to reach more than a quarter of people who tested positive and the app has been ditched after it was found not to work. Other countries moved quickly to work with Apple and Google to develop a tracing app. The UK, contrary to what the Health Secretary said yesterday, decided it knew better. Once again, the Government has been found wanting. Time and again since the outbreak, ministers have made boastful promises but then failed to deliver on them. This incompetence has not just wasted public money – it has cost lives. We are beating the world only when it comes to the multiple failures by this Tory administration and the mounting number of fatalities. Best of British Dame Vera Lynn was the voice that gave our nation hope amid the horror of war. It was a testament to her enduring appeal that her classic hit We’ll Meet Again became the anthem not just of the Second World War but the coronavirus crisis  years on.  Throughout her  years, she epitomised the best of British spirit, whether mucking in with troops in Burma or doing her charity work. It is poignant she died on the th anniversary of Churchill’s “finest hour” speech. While the former Prime Minister rallied the nation at its darkest moment, she lted its spirits. We shall be for ever grateful.

Upon his death the alcohol supply the monkey was reliant on ran dry, prompting him to take to the streets in a blind fury. The animal indiscriminately attacked humans as he passed them, making a particular bee-line for young girls. Numerous children were left needing plastic surgery after Kalua ripped at their faces with his fangs. According to Patrika one of his victims died.

That’s invaluable.”Irvine and Mackay work closely together at Dundee – but it’s not the first time they have worked together.Dee first team coach, Mackay, was brought to St Johnstone by Derek McInnes while Irvine was the Perth side’s first choice right back.In the end, Mackay went on to be come a club legend at McDiarmid, while Irvine moved on to Dundee.But there are no hard feelings from Irvine, who has loved every minute of his time at Dens Park.He said: “Dave Mackay came in from Livingston in [St Johnstone’s] first season in the SPL to add competition for places. I was unfortunate because I’d chosen to have surgery to tidy up an ankle problem that had niggled me.“The plan was that would tie in with the close season and I could start pre-season.“But it hindered me and I was behind with my fitness and struggled a bit to get back to form.“Dave, obviously, came in and did well and I think him being able to play in a few positions helped him, too.“I recognised at that time, being in my mid-s I wanted to be playing every week and I wouldn’t get that at St Johnstone.“I’ve nothing against Del, that’s the decisions that have to be made to win games – when Dave came in, the manager couldn’t guarantee me games and I heard there was interest from Dundee.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

The football was great.

The limit has increased from meeting one household to meeting two. This must still be in a group of eight or less and the need for physical distancing remains.But, people who are not shielding can now use toilets indoors while visiting the outdoors of another household, however they must avoid touching surfaces.Former Evening Express reporter Hamish McKay, , who has Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseasehas been shielding at home in Seaton for the last three months and has  set his sights on a trip to his local park now the restrictions are easing.Hamish said: “The unlimited aspect of the putative exercise period is an unexpected bonus for shielders in the scheduled announcement by the First Minister.“It certainly is splendid and unexpected news to me as a shielder.“I was secretary of the Friends of the Seaton Park and people tell me it is looking in great shape.“So I think I will go for a walk there.”Aberdeen-based defence solicitor Peter Keene, who has Diabetes, has also been shielding and welcomed the lting of exercise restrictions .He said: “Of course I am pleased but this is decision based on health or economy “I would like to think it is relatively safe to go outside but what does it mean for my job as I often get close to people in court ”Meanwhile, shops are also gearing up to reopen their doors off the back of the announcement.Street-access retail can reopen from June , once guidance is implemented but shops inside centres must remain closed until phase three.Outdoor markets can reopen with physical distancing measures and controls on numbers from June .Beaverbrooks, which has an outlet on the city#s Union Street is initially planning to reopen its stores in Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow Fort and Fort Kinnairdon Monday.The jewellery firm has revealed plans for reopening safely, including floor markings and physical boundaries to ensure safe social distancing for customers and colleagues, daily temperature checks for team members, and hand sanitizer stations at the entrance and throughout the store which will be mandatory for shoppers to use before entering.Anna Blackburn, managing director at Beaverbrooks, which has a branch on Union Street said: #The directors and I, along with the senior management team have been actively involved in the reopening plans, from personal visits to stores and the warehouse to help implement the changes to ensure the safety of our people, to developing the plans for reformatting of stores in line with government guidance.#It has been a challenging and uncertain time for all of us, but we are feeling optimistic about the future.#Many of our  colleagues are back in stores already and welcoming customers in England and Northern Ireland, so we look forward to doing the same in our Scottish stores.#Primark also has an on-street entrance, though a spokeswoman for the fast fashion-chain said: “We are still working through our plans for re-opening in Scotland and can confirm that we have not announced an official re-opening date for Primark in Scotland.Nothing matters more to us than the health and wellbeing of our employees and customers.#That is why we will only re-open our stores in Scotland once we are convinced that it is safe and right to do so. We are closely following all safety advice from government and will treat this as the minimum standard across all our stores.#While, Shona Lawrie, Marks Spencer head of region for Scotland North said: #Over the last couple of months our teams have been incredible in the ways they have adapted to support local customers and communities.#Every store has been brilliant at implementing the necessary social distancing and hygiene measures to help customers shop for Food, and we’ll be bringing those lessons and insights over to Clothing  Home in stores across Scotland that the government has announced can open.#Preparation is now well underway for the th June – from the installation of perspex screens at tills, to putting in new signage. Whilst shopping may feel dferent at our St Nicholas Street and Union Square stores, there will still be the same great service and expert advice customers expect, as well as more digital solutions to supplement the in-store experience – such as our enhanced online bra fit tool.#Adrian Watson of Aberdeen Inspired said: “Like everybody , our businesses understand that public safety and well-being are paramount and recognise the step taken  to move, of a fashion, into Phase  of easing the lockdown.#Useful too that there will be at least be a review of the ‘ metre ruling’ as this has signicant impact on all that we are looking to do in getting the local and national economy going, which is becoming ever so more critical as time moves on.##Of course,  many of the ‘non-essential’ shops at least now know that they are gearing up for a  June  re-opening and this will be welcomed, but we hope to see this complimented, in early course,  with the opening of outdoor hospitality and a quick transition to phase  where we see the remaining retail and wider hospitality brought back into play.”And college and university staff can alsoto work under the easing of restrictions in order to make preparations for restarting in phase three.An Aberdeen University  said: “We welcome the announcement from the Scottish Government, which allows us to take forward work to ensure a safeto our campuses for our staff and students.“Our Campus Planning Group has been developing plans for some time for a phasedto on-campus working that prioritises ato lab-based research with physical distancing, alongside preparing to offer blended learning in the next academic year.“Our key workers have been on campus throughout the lockdown period to provide essential services, and they continue to play a crucial role. The resumption of on-campus activities is a complex logistical task # our involvement in the Scottish Government’s Covid- research response means that some of our labs have already been open for several weeks, and we will draw on this experience as we open up other labs in due course.“Other elements include timetabling, physical space management, and the enhanced provision of hygiene facilities, all of which require detailed planning to ensure we provide a safe environment on campus for students and staff in line with national guidance.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

This can be as simple as a scarf or bandana that ties behind the head.Before putting it on, you should wash your hands or use hand sanitiser and do the same after removing it.Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth at all times and store any used face coverings in a plastic bag until you have an opportunity to wash them.Do not touch the front of the face covering, or the part of the face covering that has been in contact with your mouth and nose.Once removed, make sure you clean any surfaces the face covering has touched and wash the covering regularly.

What a shame, then, about the second thing I couldnrsquot help noticing: how drab and disappointing George Square remains.Granted, the grim sight of loyalist protesters wrapped in Union flags ldquoprotecting the statues and Cenotaph didnrsquot help. But even without their isive presence the cityrsquos historic square is a let-down, visually, socially and culturally, a frustrating waste of urban space that could and should be far better utilised.Where other European squares create buzz and atmosphere with year-round arts, culture, food and shopping attracting locals and visitors, George Square is dreary and uninspiring: a few trees, some benches and a clutch of dull, predictable th-century statues ndash ldquogreat men and Queen Victoria ndash that few feel any kinship with. The only part of the square that has any real purpose and meaning is the Cenotaph.The idea that George Square is in serious need of a makeover is nothing new, of course, and there have been ious  dawns and broken promises over the years, not least the outrageous fiasco of  ndash remember that  ndash which wasted huge amounts of public money and goodwill alike. But the two defining events of  - coronavirus and the Black Lives Matter protests -offer Glasgow the best opportunity in a generation to finally get this right and transform George Square into the vibrant civic centre Glaswegians deserve.Letrsquos start with the pandemic, which will continue to damage the economic and social pull of town and city centres. As lockdown restrictions are gradually lted we will grasp a new reality ndash fewer shops, restaurants, bars and cultural attractions than before, with those that do re-open unable to work at full capacity for now. Answers to the sort of questions around attracting people to city centres that were already stumping businesses, planners and local authorities even before coronavirus hit have become all the more pressing.Thatrsquos where a proper revamp of George Square comes in, a key step forward in boosting Glasgowrsquos economy and cultural capital in the wake of the pandemic. What should the square contain  That would be for citizens to decide, but herersquos a few quick ideas that presume an eventual end to social distancing: an ampitheatre for live music, theatre and comedy, proper seating, pop-up pods for community groups, a food and craft market, arts and exhibition space, murals, a garden and childrenrsquos play area.As for the fate of the statues, again, it would be for the people to decide whether they still have a place in this new urban realm. Not that we would want to forget our past, of course. But surely we can find new and more creative ways to confront, commemorate and celebrate it, taking in voices that were previously ignored ndash women, ethnic minorities, working class people, gay people, the disabled ndash reflecting the ersity of our city as it is now.Rather than an expensive international competition for designs ndash letrsquos learn from  ndash a three-month public consultation could be held, and a  of local architects, planners, artists, businesspeople and community groups convened to create perhaps three dferent plans, which would then be voted on by the people of Glasgow. Granted, such an ambitious revamp wouldnrsquot be easy to fund in the dficult years ahead, but with a crucial economic and culturalat stake, it should be prioritised. Surely a mixture of public, private and philanthropic funding could be sourced Glasgow City Council has already started the conversation that could make all this happen, by bringing forward the pedestrianisation of George Square and suspending a third of city centre parking bays to make room for walkers and cyclists.I would urge council leader Susan Aitken and her team to think bigger. A commitment to redesign George Square would offer an exciting, positive and inclusive focus for Glaswegians in the tough months ahead. The end result could be what Glasgow has been crying out for for a generation: a proud and modern civic centrepiece that is worthy of our great city, a place that excites, entertains, and educates, that makes us feel part of something bigger.

But in Scotland, thanks to Covid it could be within sight. Schoolrsquos out, not just for summer but for the foreseeable future.At least that was the educational prognosis from the Deputy First Minister, John Swinney, at the weekend. He announced a new ldquoblended learning, which sounds like something to do with tea, but is a euphemism for Scottish children spending most of the school week at home.:Opinion: Brian Beacom: Why I am edging slowly towards the pro-independence point of viewParents in Edinburgh were told that, when schools go back on August , theyrsquoll be lucky to see their children getting face-to-face teaching for a third of the time. Many Scottish pupils might only get one day a week. This is not so much blended as half-baked.Mr Swinney also endorsed the view of Larry Flanagan, general-secretary of the teachers union the EIS, that next yearrsquos exam diet should be cancelled, like this yearrsquos. Few in the education establishment much like competitive exams at the best of time, so it might seem unsurprising that they have been dropped ndash for the first time since .Parents, who donrsquot seem to have been consulted by Mr Swinneyrsquos misnamed Education Recovery Group, are furious. They see this as an abdication of responsibility by bureaucrats who care nothing about educational attainment and are putting the interests of their own client groups above the welfare of children.Parents in Edinburgh formed an instant pressure group,  , to demand proper, face-to-face education at least  per cent of the week. Sarah Chisnall says they also want serious benchmarked online learning for the other part of the ldquoblended learning experience, with a regular amount of teacher face time.Three months into school lockdown, it is surely a scandal that nothing of the like has been done. Home schooling is practically non-existent in many areas, according to parents, with some children having no contact with anything remotely resembling an actual teacher on line. Google, FIFA  and Instagram are poor substitutes.A UK-wide study from University College London confirmed yesterday that two million children across Britain have done little or no schoolwork at home during the lockdown. Four million have not had regular contact with a teacher and six million have not ed their most recent assignment.Nicola Sturgeon, who recognises a political disaster when she sees one, leaped in to try to undo the damage done by her deputy. ldquoIt is absolutely not the case that we are planning on blended learning to last a year or anything like it, she said on Monday, giving no guarantees that it wonrsquot.The First Minister promised that face-to face-teaching will happen ldquoas soon as possible. Exams will go ahead ndash well maybe ndash and she hinted that the two-metre rule in social distancing might be relaxed in schools.ldquoDelusional. said the SNPrsquos sometime coalition partners, the Scottish Greens, which has a lot of teachers amongst its membership. Like Larry Flanagan of the EIS they think next yearrsquos exams should be cancelled because there is no safe way of preparing children for them.Tell that to the parents. We know that the risk to children is vanishingly small. To prevent pupils spreading the disease to teachers and parents, schools could use masks, hand sanitisers, ldquobubble cohorts, and perspex screens.It is not aschildren arenrsquot associating already out of school.

It manestly isnrsquot in supermarkets, parks and public transport either. So why is this bureaucratic red line being applied in schools Why is the education of their children not a priority, they say  With classes and schools only able to handle a third of children, the obvious answer is to increase the number of classrooms and the number of teachers.Break out of the school precincts and start deploying unused venues like cinemas and churches, even marquees. Bring in supply teachers and retired teachers to bump up the numbers.It would of course mean more than the pound million or so in additional funding the Government is currently offering the local authorities. But the Scottish education and skills budget is more than pound. billion. Surely some of that could be reallocated, as was the case in the NHS when they set up ldquopop-up hospitals like the Louisa Jordan.At any rate, Nicola Sturgeon now has a major fight on her hands. The EIS says, correctly, that the two-metre rule is still what the Governmentrsquos scientic advisers say is necessary to prevent a second wave of Covid-. They are not going to sht on that, eventhe World Health Organisation has been talking about reducing it to one metre.There are two million parents out there and only , teachers. Ms Sturgeon can do her political arithmetic. She is going to have to spray some serious cash to get the schools back on any kind of ing basis.Scottish teachers got a  per cent pay hike from the Government last year. I suspect Mr Swinney is going to have to loosen the purse strings again to prevent the deschooling of a generation of Scottish children.The late Ivan Illich, whose thinking influenced the Curriculum for Excellence, envisaged children teaching themselves, using technology, even though he was writing before the internet existed.

New Zealand has achieved much the same with Covid: it had had no new cases at all for  days, until two UK visitors tested positive this week.The lower the prevalence of the virus within the population, the easier it is to pinpoint and contain new clusters, prevent a second wave and allow a fullerto normalityalbeit at a later date.Whatever our progress, Scotland recorded  new cases between May  and June , so eradication is still elusive.: Why the science has no clear-cut answers to Scotlands two-metre dilemmaIn this context, the decision not to re-open beer gardens is all about a better result later: for example, reducing virus prevalence enough that physical distancing can be halved to one metre in time for the hospitality traderesuming on July .Ms Sturgeon said there is emerging evidence that pubs, restaurants and gyms are \"hotspots for transmission\". Japanese research found that the risk of infection is around  times higher indoors than outdoors.So why is it safe to open outdoor food markets but not beer gardens  One theory is that people in beer gardens spend a prolonged period in same company, increasing the risk of transmissionsomeone in the group is infected but not yet showing symptoms.They are also more likely to talk loudly, shout, or even singwhich is also linked to transmission. At two metres, the risk of infection is an estimated % at one metre, %.

However, tidal and wave action continued to drive erosion under the tree roots and actually encouraged erosion.ldquoThese days, the awareness and understanding of the cycles that sand dunes go through ndash and their value as habitats in their own right ndash is much more prevalent so we are looking at how best we can restore sand dunes to their natural state.Sand dunes help to protect the coastline and are likely to be an increasingly important defence against sea level rise as a result of the Climate Emergency.Natural and healthy dune systems change their formation in response to wave, wind and tidal action, with some sand removed only to then be replaced at a later stage with deposits of new sand.This self-sustaining process can play out in the course of one storm but more often occurs over many years and,viewed at a particular moment in the cycle, could give the impression that the dunes are disappearing.Tree planting in previous generations attempted to stop this apparent erosion and fix the dunes in place ndash but it also interrupted the natural process of replenishment, as well as the colonisation of dune vegetation.Ms Dolby said: ldquoPrevious restoration attempts over the last  years have failed to properly restore open dunes because they did not deal with a surface layer on the dunes that had been enriched by fallen leaves or needles, conditions which favour woodland plants and that effectively prevented more sensitive dune plants from surviving.ldquoThe method wersquore trialling now involves removing the trees and scrub and scraping and burying the plant litter layer to leave a bare sand surface, which will hopefully support the rare vegetation special to these dunes.The trial site, at Morrich More, will be closely monitored over the next five years to assess the effectiveness of the restoration process.Scotlandrsquos more than , hectares of sand dune systems are considered among some of the countryrsquos most valuable habitats, thought to support more than  rare species.Risks to the dunes include coner plantations which have already claimed around , hectares and sea buckthorn which has colonised signicant areas of sand dune in parts of south-east Scotland. This non-native shrub, like the tree project, was originally planted to combat erosion, but has itself become a problem.In , Scottish Natural Heritagerevealed that Donald Trumprsquos Aberdeenshire golf resort could lose its status as a protected wildle site after the sand dunes at Menie no longer included enough of the special features for which they were designated a site of special scientic interest .:Wrapping up the Eighties with Runrig, Jesus and Mary Chain, Del Amitri and Deacon BlueThe designation is given to areas with rare species of fauna or flora, or with important geological or physiological features.A three month consultation on the future status of Foveran Links SSSI began that June, but was postponed until this year only four months later.In official documents SNH said Menie Links Golf Course had ldquoadversely affected the sand dune habitat with  per cent of the total SSSI lost and % of the sand dune habitat gone.Mr Trump was granted permission to build a golf course at the site despite concerns about damage to the dunes and the links opened in .SNH said evidence showed permanent habitat loss following the construction of fairways and greens, and that the stabilisation of mobile sand ldquohas destroyed the dynamic nature of the site.Trump International said the move by the Government body was politically motivated and a ldquostitch-up."},{"url":null,"title":"wrapping-eighties-runrig-jesus-mary-chain-del-amitri-deacon-blue","story":"The Jesus and Mary ChainldquoA spitting, snarling, hissing, crackling vinyl assault, the Heraldrsquos Dave Belcher wrote of this East Kilbridersquos band November  debut, Psychocandy.

Hipsway toured with the Eurythmics across Europe, supported Simple Minds at four big outdoor concerts, and toured clubs in the US. The Honeychief was also a hit in the US. A second album, Scratch the Surface, followed, thought internal frictions had caused the band to split before its official release.DANNY WILSONThis trio were not the longest-lived of Scottish rock or pop outfits, but their great single, Maryrsquos Prayer, a worldwide hit, endures, as does their debut album, Meet Danny Wilson . A great early review in NME had brought them to the attention of record labels, and they went with Virgin. Critics swooned over the single and the album enthusiastic comparisons were drawn, more than once, with Steely Dan.

Their formidable debut album, Raintown, with its memorable cover image by Oscar Marzaroli, was laden with hit singles: When Will You , Dignity, Chocolate Girl, Born in a Storm. They took to the road with enthusiasm, building up a large, hard-core audience by the time their second album, When the World Knows Your Name debuted at number one, they were one of the biggest acts in Britain.HUE AND CRYThe stylish s work of Gregory and Patrick Kane is well well worth re-exploring not just for familiar hits as Looking for Linda and Labour of Love, but for such tracks as I Refuseand Human Touch, on the first album, Seduced and Abandoned , and Ordinary Angel, Dollar William, Under Neon and Where We Wish to Remain, from Remote .

Employers should support their workers in using face coverings safely and provide advice,requested, on applying and removing the covering.On ferry services face coverings must also be worn by passengers and staff unless the ferry, or part of the ferry which is open to members of the public, is entirely outdoors or physical distancing of two metres can be maintained.Transport Secretary Michael Matheson stressed the importance of the new rules and that by wearing a face covering everyone is engaged in a collective responsibility to reduce the risk of transmission.He said: “Our message remains clear that public transport should be for key workers and those who need it most and can’t walk or cycle to work.#Capacity is reduced to enable physical distancing and operators are not yet running full services. However, as we work towards recovery and more peopleto work and further local leisure opportunities begin to open up it is vital that measures are put in place to protect everyone’s health.“Transport operators continue to play a key role in supporting essential travel and in ensuring passenger confidence in public transport while maintaining physical distancing. The use of face coverings forms a fundamental part of gaining that public trust.“We are asking people to take personal responsibility to do the right thing.

Here are two examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available.Source: Her Majesty’s TreasuryAn unprecedented package of UK Government financial support has helped firms like Q-Mass in East Kilbride weather the coronavirus crisis. Director Ronnie Robertson said lockdown hit his company’s order book, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been vital to help them hang on to their valued staff.Ronnie said: “Before this, we had quite a good order book, with three to four months of work planned, so we were pretty worried where it was going to take us.” At first, he was worried how he would keep Q-Mass’  staff on the payroll, but then the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced.It offers UK Government support to pay  per cent of staff’s wages up to £, a month, and the scheme has now been extended until the end of October.Q-Mass manufactures bespoke parts for the oil, gas and defence industry so staff training is important. Ronnie said: “Our staff are very highly skilled. We’ve gathered a bunch of people here and trained them up and taken on apprentices. We do a lot of training, we’ve got good people, we train them a lot and we want to hang on to them.”He found applying for the furlough scheme quick and straightforward. He said: “It was surprisingly easy and we were surprised that the money came through relatively quickly.”Now staff at the firm who’ve been furloughed are gradually ing to work, with strict safety measures in place. Ronnie said: “We’ve put a day sht back on and we’ve still got a few office people working at home, with quite a few still on furlough.And because of the size of the building, maintaining a two-metre distance hasn’t been a problem for ing staff.“The workshop’s a big, wide open space and we have to keep cleaning things like photocopiers and touch screens, but it’s been quite straightforward.”Now Ronnie’s looking forward to a brighter future. He said: “I feel like we’re on the side of the valley and we’re looking across to the other side and it looks absolutely fantastic. Getting through the next few months is crucial for us. We have a really good bunch of people and we want to hang on to them. The furlough scheme has helped us to do that.” vw, px\"  Planning, forward thinking and invaluable help from the UK Government has enabled a Northern Ireland firm to ersy and remain solvent.

We were so relieved that we had, at least we could carry on trading with our UK and European customers.” With around half of the company’s sales in the UK and Ireland and half in the export business, Shnuggle had to rely on their local retail-base.Sinead continued: “Baby items were classed as essential goods which was a huge relief to us. This meant as long as we could socially distance within the warehouse we could continue trading and selling online.“All of our business is supplying other retailers like John Lewis, Mamas and Papas, Amazon.

This should be contained in a single green bin or box.

The two metre social distancing rule will affect passenger capacity for our ferries – and we also continue to experience issues around the availability of staff and the effect that has on opportunities around timetabling.“I would assure our isles residents that we continue to bring these issues and challenges to the attention of the Scottish Government and will do all we can to maximise sailingsnecessary, taking on board the views of our isles residents throughout.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

UKrsquos chief medical officers have agreed to downgrade the coronavirus alert level from four to three.Head teachers say they were not consulted on the details of the scheme which will see the most disadvantaged children in England given access to funds to pay for tutors, while the majority of the funding will be shared across schools to help pupils from all backgrounds affected by the lockdown.College and nursery leaders have criticised the Government for leaving their pupils out after it announced that pound million would only be given to state primary and secondary schools for the - academic year.A further pound million will be spent on a one-year subsidised national tutoring programme targeted at the most disadvantaged pupils in schools.But sector leaders say the funding will not reach young children in nurseries and college students who are most ldquoin need of support amid the pandemic.It came as the UKrsquos chief medical officers agreed to downgrade the coronavirus alert level from four to three, after a ldquosteady and continuing decrease in cases in all four nations. vw,vw,px, px\"Localised outbreaks of Covid- are still ldquolikely to occur, the

school funding announcement, David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges , said it was ldquoindefensible to overlook the needs of students in tens of thousands of colleges across the country.Meanwhile, Purnima Tanuku, chief executive of National Day Nurseries Association , has accused the Government of failing young children ldquowho are most in need of support in their early development.David Laws, executive chair of the Education Policy Institutethink tank, added that the catch-up plan was ldquopoorly targeted and unlikely to prevent a large increase in the disadvantaged gap.The former Liberal Democrat minister added: ldquoWe are also concerned that there seems to be no extra financial support for early years or sixth form students ndash these phases are crucially important, yet they have suffered from persistent funding neglect over a sustained period of time.It came as schools minister Nick Gibb said it was the Governmentrsquos ldquoclear intention to have all children back in schools across England by September.Concerns have also been raised about the ability of some schools to pay towards the tutoring scheme amid funding pressures already facing schools. vw,vw,px, px\"Boris Johnson uses a sink in the playground to wash his hands during a visit to Bovingdon Primary School in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire Geoff Barton, general secretary of the

extra teaching spaces.ldquoThe Government must urgently engage with unions and others in the sector to plan for such a .Speaking on Sky News, Mr Gibb said the Government wants to ensure that no pupils

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"owners asked to let coastguard know if boats are left unattended ","story":"Boat owners are being reminded to please inform the coastguardthey will be leaving vessels unattended for any period of time.The Aith leboat was called out on Sunday evening after reports of a small boat lying empty near an uninhabited isle to the west of Scalloway.While no missing people had been reported in the area, the volunteer crew of the Charles Lidbury were asked by local coastguard officers to make their way to the scene and investigate.The call out came at .pm and the leboat team steamed south to where the skf had been moored – near the skerry of Sanda Stour at the entrance to Weisdale Voe.On arrival the small boat was recognised by a crew member – who then made contact with the boat#s owner to confirm that they were safe and well.

Meter readers will be able to take readings from meters located in outside positions as normal.NIE Networks is urging customers to protect its meter readers and themselves by continuing to observe social distancing protocols. Ben Cupples, Meter Reading Manager at NIE Networks, explained the importance of recording a precise meter reading for the customer.“Providing a precise meter reading will ensure that your electricity bills accurately reflect your consumption,” he said. “Our meter readers will call to your home and will record the reading you provide while we wait.“If you are unable to read your meter for any reason oryou are not at home when we call, we will leave a card with information on how to submit your meter reading online via the NIE Networks website, via email or over the phone.”Mr Cupples explained that while meter reading activity would resume it would only be carried out with the health and safety of the public and meter readers in mind.“The safety of our employees and customers is our utmost priority. “If you see our meter readers out and about, we would ask that you please help them by standing at least two metres away. Likewise, we will stand at least two metres from customers’ doors at all times.“We are continually reviewing how we undertake our meter reading activities in light of COVID- and we are looking forward to being able to resume our normal way of working with customers at some stage, but we will only make that decision when it’s safe to do so.” NIE Networks is reminding customers that you only need to submit your reading to either NIE Networks or your supplier – there is no need to do it twice. Customers unable to submit a meter reading will receive an estimated bill from their supplier based on their usage history.If a member of the NIE Networks team arrives at the door, they will always show identication.

Victor Leonard, chairman of the international youth football competition at which Rashford was twice a winner with Manchester United, has always been impressed with the manner in which the young England international striker has handled himself. As Rashford vowed to continue helping those in need after successfully forcing the government to reverse its decision not to provide free school meal vouchers during the summer, Mr. Leonard described the footballer as an inspiration to everyone. He added: “We first came across Marcus in the Manchester United squads that came across to Northern Ireland to compete in our tournaments. “He was a smash hit as United went on to win the Premier section in  and  but you could not help but admire the way, even at a young age, Marcus conducted himself. “We have been across to United many times and it was always very clear how highly regarded he was as a player and a person.” Rashford came off the bench in United’s  final victory over County Tyrone at Ballymena Showgrounds and started when the Red Devils triumphed  months later against defending champions Vendee from France. Victor added: “I think he is an inspiration to everyone. He has been so passionate about this issue but gone about attempting to bring change in a highly commendable manner. “He is a credit to his family and his club and we at STATSports SuperCupNI are privileged that he is one of our tournament graduates who has gone on to achieve greatness in his football career and also through his campaigning for something in which he believes so fervently. “Hopefully he will continue to be an inspiration to all of us.” Rashford has raised about poundm to supply around three million meals to vulnerable people while working with charity FareShare UK during the coronavirus lockdown. In an emotional open letter to MPs, Rashford drew on his own experience of relying on free school meals and food banks growing up. He said his story was all too familiar for families in England. Yesterday, Northern Ireland’s First Minister Arlene Foster said the Executive would also look at reinstating the summer free school meals voucher schemefunds were available."},{"url":null,"title":"apology his honour judge desmond marrinan","story":"On May , , we published an article under the headline Yes of course review current legislation on hate crime, but not at the expense of free speech relating to the ongoing Review led by His Honour Judge Desmond Marrinan.Our article contained a number of factual inaccuracies, and, in addition, under-estimated the number of outreach events, the signicant number of media reports, and the breadth and extent of the consultations.In fact, contrary to what was suggested in the article, a number of outreach events were held throughout Northern Ireland, Judge Marrinan took part in a round of interviews with local media which were widely reported, a dedicated website had been set up and there had been consultation with the four main churches and the Evangelical Alliance.Indeed, we understand that there were over a thousand responses to the consultation paper, not only from iniduals but from many institutions such as churches, victims groups, relevant statutory agencies, NGOs and charitable groups, indicating the depth of interest in the work of the review and the importance of the subject.

We had flexibility built into that plan and we have headroom to continue to look forward, she said.We#ve also said that this is going to be gradual, and it#s not easy.It#s far from simple, but we#re guided by the science.Everything we do is looking to the future - it#s about supporting families.Mrs O#Neill said she hoped the latest measures would help families and businesses plan for the future.On financial support for the childcare sector, she said work was continuing with the Executive, with further discussions to be held next week.It#s very clear we need to find a way to support childcare providers, parents and the workforce, she said.There clearly have been issues with the first pot of funding that was put out for childcare providers, so there needs to be lessons learned there and have a scheme that actually gets the money to the providers.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood MP welcomed the latest measures, but asked on Twitter: How is it possible that you can go to Mass, get a haircut and have a pint but not visit your family  Rather than jumping from headline to headline, we should be providing detailed, strategic guidance.Speaking to the Belfastlater, he added: I think the Executive have done this in a very ad hoc way, where they seem to be responding to lobbying from dferent groups - understandable lobbying - but when you do things that way you end up in a scenario where you just react to the last person you spoke to, rather than have a plan that people can understand.To have pubs, churches and hairdressers open, and we support that, but you still can#t go and see your granny is just crazy.We#re left in the bizarre situation, for example, where families can plan to meet up in retail outlets or pubs, but have no indication of when they might see each other in their own homes.And we have entire sectors that have no idea when they can safelyto business or what guidelines may be in place to support them.This ad hoc approach does not serve the needs of workers or businesses. What is needed is a strategic plan with indicative timelines.Belfast Most ReadNorthern Ireland#s most popular property listings as market reopens after lockdownCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Hairdressers to reopen, shielding to be paused and social distancing at schools reduced to mCoronavirus: MLA Bradshaw says reason for small cluster outbreak in NI #should be made public#Derry man Conor McColgan killed alongside girlfriend in horror crashPrimark shoppers join early morning queues for Belfast store reopening after coronavirus lockdown,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mark Hamiliton, who is a member of Ash, and his dad, Neil, started the project a year ago and since then the customised bangles have been snapped up by fans. The father and son team have now raised £, for the charity, which has had to suspend many of its services for local cancer patients and their families, and has furloughed most staff due to the coronavirus pandemic.The charity has also had to postpone its fundraising events, so donations are even more vital during the current crisis. The latest batch of bracelets are from guitar and bass strings played during Ash#s recent European tour, which was cancelled half-way through. Over the last year, Mark#s dad has made hundreds of bangles as souvenirs from a host of the band#s concerts played all over the world. Mark, who said he hopes to be back on tour once the pandemic is over, said: Thanks so much to all the Ash and Snow Patrol fans who have supported our #RockBangle project for Cancer Focus NI. So far we have raised around £, and hope to sell more bracelets once our tour recommences, whenever that may be. Big gratitude also to dad, who#s worked so hard on making these bangles in his wee shed, and Happy Father#s Day to him from my lockdown home in Northumberland.Mark donated the proceeds of the bracelets to Cancer Focus NI because of his mum, Miriam, who has now thankfully survived cancer three times. Miriam has received great support from Cancer Focus NI over the years. She is also one of the founder members of the charity#s support group in Downpatrick, helping other women who#ve been diagnosed with cancer. Mark, who sells the bangles on his social media channels, explained that making the bracelets is a team effort. I weave and cut the strings to size and my dad solders the joints together, making what was an ugly joint into something that resembles a metal pearl, he explained. They look nice, but raw and rustic. I want them to retain a bit of that rock #n# roll aesthetic. Rosie Forsythe, from Cancer Focus NI, said: We can#t thank Mark and his dad enough for all their hard work and generosity. Cancer Focus NI relies on donations for over % of our income.

Ms Smith - who granted Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams a controversial visa in  to visit the US amid serious opposition - died at her home in Manhattan, her daughter Kym told the New York Times. Last night, Mr Adams said her appointment as Irish ambassador had been pivotal to the development of the peace process.She was a wonderful, compassionate, formidable woman who played a key role in persuading her brother Senator Ted Kennedy to support a visa for me in , he said.Though she never ran for office, she campaigned for her brothers, travelling the country for then-Senator John F Kennedy as he sought the presidency in . In , she stepped in for a travelling Jacqueline Kennedy and co-hosted a state dinner for Ireland#s president. The same year, she accompanied her brother, the first Irish Catholic president, on his famous visit to Ireland. Their great-grandfather, Patrick Kennedy, was from Dunganstown in Co Wexford. Three decades later, she was appointed ambassador to Ireland by President Bill Clinton, who called her as Irish as an American can be. During her confirmation hearing, she recalled the trip with her brother, describing it as one of the most moving experiences of my own le. As ambassador, she helped persuade Mr Clinton to grant a visa to Mr Adams in defiance of the British Government, which branded him as a terrorist. She later called criticism of her actions unfortunate and said she thought history would credit the Clinton administration with helping the peace process in Northern Ireland. The then-Taoiseach Bertie Ahern said in  that it is not an understatement to say that didn#t happen at the time, perhaps other events may not have fallen into place. In , though, Ms Smith had been reprimanded by Secretary of State Warren Christopher for punishing two of her officers who objected to the visa for Mr Adams. In December , Ms Smith again risked controversy by taking communion in a Protestant cathedral in Dublin, going against the bishops of her Catholic church. Her decision was a strong personal gesture of support for Irish President Mary McAleese, a fellow Catholic who had been criticised by Irish bishops for joining in the Protestant communion service. Religion, after all, is about bringing people together, Ms Smith told The . We all have our own way of going to God. When she stepped down as ambassador in , she received Irish citizenship for distinguished service to the nation.

An activist diplomat, she was not afraid to break with convention or explore the limits of her mandate. She brought passion and clear values to her role, providing many of the elements that promoted peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said: She proved an extraordinary diplomat during the crucial years leading up to the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, building lasting relationships with all sides and becoming an instrumental figure in the Northern Ireland Peace Process.Her courageous and determined diplomacy helped to bring peace to our island, built bridges, opened doors to all communities, and to all those striving for peace when peace was not a certainty, Mr Varadkar added.Ms Smith was the eighth of nine children born to Joseph P and Rose Kennedy, and she tragically outlived several of them by decades.

I haven#t felt as sad since  and I#m going to take a while to get over it.These men are out there protecting us and it#s a very sad thing that they can#t go about their duties, this is how they are rewarded.Local TD Denis Naughten said he was absolutely shocked and saddened to hear of the tragedy.He said at age , Det-Gda Horkan would have been only a child when the two gardaí were killed. He may not have been old enough to remember it but all of the community would remember their tragic deaths.This brings all of that back, particularly to the community in west Roscommon and around Castlerea. It adds to the tragedy.Daylight brought floods of tributes from all corners of Ireland and beyond.From the Taoiseach, President and colleagues of the fallen garda.There were more local tributes too, including one from Charlestown Sarsfields GAA club, where Det-Gda Horkan had earned the nickname #The Bear#.What we have here is a random act, a violent act, that led to the death of Det-Gda Horkan, so it is tragic and it is an attack upon us all. Garda Commissioner Drew HarrisGarda Commissioner Drew Harris visited the town and described the brutal killing of Det-Gda Horkan as a random act.Colm served the communities he worked in with distinction and pride during his  years as a member of An Garda Síochána, said Mr Harris.Detective Garda Colm Horkan is the th member of An Garda Síochána killed in the line of duty. Today is a terrible reminder of the signicant sacrices, including the ultimate sacrice, that gardaí make to keep people safe.Speaking to reporters in Castlerea yesterday afternoon, he said there was no sense that the death was linked to organised crime, saying it was a random act.As we know in this time, this was in effect a conversation between Det-Gda Horkan and a member of the public, he said.There was then an altercation during which the service pistol which Gda Horkan was carrying was then used against him and he was shot and fatally wounded.He received very prompt and professional medical attention but to no avail and died from his injuries.Mr Harris said that Det-Gda Horkan#s death was an attack upon society.I can certainly say at this moment in time there is no sense of a bigger picture, organised crime or subversive, he said.What we have here is a random act, a violent act, that led to the death of Det-Gda Horkan, so it is tragic and it is an attack upon us all.It is correct to say that it#s an attack upon society, he added.The commissioner appealed to the public to help with the investigation as there is a video of the attack circulating social media.Colm gave his le protecting the community he had served with distinction and courage. Taoiseach Leo VaradkarHe urged anyone who was in Castlerea Town Centre on Wednesday night at pm-.am to come forwardthey have information.Far from Castlerea, on the steps of Government Buildings, the shooting of a serving garda brought pause to a political week dominated by government formation talks.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar praised Det-Gda Horkan for the courage and sacrice he showed during his more than two decades serving with An Garda Síochána.Mr Varadkar offered his condolence and support to Det-Gda Horkan#s family.Colm gave his le protecting the community he had served with distinction and courage during his  years as a member of An Garda Síochána, he said. His story is the same as the thousands of men and women who wear the unorm. A story of courage, sacrice and service.Our gardaí are our s of the peace and defenders of the rule of law, he said. They are role models.This tragedy is a heart-wrenching reminder of how much we owe our gardaí for the work they do all over the country.They protect and serve our citizens, our communities and our country, every day putting themselves on the front line of crime prevention on behalf of all of us, he added.Meanwhile, in the second largest town in Co Roscommon, disbelief was being replaced by grief.Up to  people gathered in the town centre last night for a vigil in Det-Gda Horkan#s memory.A small green marquee was set up in the Fairgreen in the Main Street and tributes were led by local Fianna Fáil Councillor Paschal Fitzmaurice and parish priest Fr McManus.Heavy rain lashed down as the small town mourned the passing of the garda.The terrible sad occasion that happened here last night is a tragedy that I suppose we will never, ever forget, said Mr Fitzmaurice.District Officer Superintendent Goretti Sheridan also paid tributes to a friend and colleague. I want to thank everyone for coming this evening, it means a lot to us.We#re obviously devastated at the death of our friend and colleague Colm, she said.Fr McManus said that the community had particularly felt the blow of the now three losses because they were very much a part of the community and widely respected in the Roscommon town.Our prayers and thoughts are very much with his family, relatives and his colleagues here in Castlerea, and gardaí everywhere, he said.Additional reporting by Gabija Gataveckaite, Conor Feehan and Tom Brady.

Publicans in Derry who took a ‘massive’ financial hit by closing ahead of St Patrick’s Day in the interest of public safety have encouraged the public to ‘support their local’ once they reopen. Northern Irelands hotels, bars, restaurants and cafes can reopen from July . William McGuinness and his business partner Phil Nolan own Paedar O’Donnells, The Gweedore and Fty Seven nightclub on Waterloo Street. Before the government issued any formal directive for businesses to shut, Paedar’s led the way by announcing that it was closing its doors on March . googletag.cmd.push It came two days before the busiest date on the calendar for Irish bars, St Patrick’s Day. “It was a matter of conscience for us,” Mr McGuinness said, “the general feeling at the time was that the NHS was going to be under pressure and we thought St Patrick’s Day would have been a petri dish for infection and we didn’t want to be responsible for that.” Boris Johnson’s order for all non-essential businesses would come over a week later on March . Derry City and Strabane has the second lowest COVID- death rate of every council area in the country and just  positive Coronavirus cases to date – also the second lowest in the country. googletag.cmd.push Chair of the British Medical Association in NI, Derry doctor Tom Black, has credited the part played by local businesses who took their cues from the Republic of Ireland. Mr McGuinness said they’re happy they made that decision even though the business took a ‘massive hit’ because of it. “St Patrick’s Day is our busiest day of the year and we were thinking about retirement soon but this thing has thrown it all up in the air. “We knew that, but we were just concerned about the health of Derry people.” Paedar’s missed out on grants because it didn’t meet the criteria but employees were furloughed. The rebuild will be a slow process, Mr McGuinness said, as the pandemic took its toll. DIFFICULT From July  pubs and bars will be allowed to trade but must serve food and operate on a table service basis. Pubs that do not serve food will be allowed to sell alcohol outdoors, such as beer gardens, also restricted to table service. Mr McGuinness said that will make it ‘very dficult’ for small bars like Paedar’s with limited outdoor space. Permission to use that space is absolutely essential in his view. He added: “I would object to the fact that restaurant bars are allowed to open but bars aren’t allowed to serve inside. “I think the risk is higher in a restaurant bar with adults and children being served food and drink whereas we’re just serving alcohol to adults. “With food there are all sorts of utensils but we just have glasses and disposable plastic. “I don’t see the sense in holding us up because we don’t do food.” The ‘rush’ is now on to ready the bar for customers and bar owners like Mr McGuinness are looking to the government and local authorities for guidance. Paedar O’Donnell’s has been cleared of tables and chairs to allow for the walls to be freshly painted and floors nished ahead of the grand reopening.  Mr McGuinness hopes that the government advice is relaxed to allow bars to serve indoors. They’re awaiting further guidance before spending any money on Perspex screens or other safety measures. He concluded: “We’d encourage people to come back but it’s going to be very limited space. “We don’t have the tourists, we were a very busy bar at weekends, and we’re not going to get those numbers in – nowhere is – because Derry people like to go out on a Friday and Saturday and nowhere will be able to cater for them because of social distancing. “There’s no money to be made in the next few months that’s the reality. “But hopefully over timeit is under control and there’s no resurgence maybe we can get back to some normality.” INFORMATION The owner of numerous bar-restaurants in the city including the Bentley, The Magnet and Molly Malones, Tony O’Connor, is also seeking clarity. “I’m surmising that they’re working on it at Stormont but we need more information about social distancing and so on,” he said. With all of his restaurants serving food he’s assured by the fact that customers can sit indoors but is unsure as to whether dining customers can stay longer to socialise. Mr O Connor said: “Every one of our premises will be opening on July  because of the food situation. Out of our six bars, five of them have outdoor areas.” This week he held a meeting with management and they’re ‘all positive and raring to go’. Like many businesses, the pandemic has been a ‘nightmare’ for Mr O’Connor but he realises that everybody is on the same boat. The Irish government ‘deserves a massive pat on the back’ for closing bars before St Patrick’s Day, he said, because ‘you would have had thousands and thousands across Ireland’ spreading the virus. “A lot of bars lost out on revenue there, no money was coming in and none getting paid out, so you just start over again,” he added. AMAZING  Bars have been actively discouraged from staging live music events or screening football matches to minimise the urge for customers to ‘dance’ or ‘hug each other’ after a goal is scored. It’s Mr O’Connor’s aspiration that the bar will be allowed to have a singer-songwriter, two-piece band performing or DJ providing entertainment. The local businessman said they will have hand sanitisers at each entrance, on every floor, at every table and also behind the bars and in kitchen areas for staff. “I’d rather not open as to have big screens in front of the bar because I think it takes the atmosphere away. “We have enough space so we can take tables away to create distance,” he stated. They’re also considering an App on which people can order food and drinks but are awaiting further guidance. And extra staff will be on hand to carry out an increased cleaning schedule. Looking to the future, Mr O’Connor would like to see visitors to the city from other parts of the island. He said: “I think Derry will get a good turnout because we handled the pandemic well as a city, there was a low number of Coronavirus cases. “I can’t wait to get my teeth back into it, we’ve been doing nothing the past few months, and the not knowing is the worst thing. “We’ve been doing takeaways but getting fully open is going to be amazing. “We’d invite people to get back out and support your local. “Self-awareness is key, Derry has played a blinder, it should be recognised and people here don’t have to be told to social distance, they’re fully aware.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It comes after First Minister Arlene Foster told a Stormont sitting on Tuesday that she ‘does not intend to make any announcement about the date of first intake until all the necessary preparation work has been completed’. Speaking to the Derry News yesterday, Sinn Feacutein MLA Karen Mullan reiterated the point that students will enrol next year. Karen Mullan said the announcement by Michelle O’Neill on May  was made ‘on behalf of the Executive’ which involves the five main parties. googletag.cmd.push That was needed to allow Ulster University to move on to the next stage of the General Medical Councilaccreditation process. She added: “I know people may feel frustratedthere is no commitment in terms of dates and movement but there are no concerns at this stage on our part that the work isn’t being done. “That’s not to say it hasn’t been dficult but there are no concerns from the university either, they have everything they need to progress through the GMC stage. “And even when we get to the next point on this journey when we will have applications out there is so much work, it is a long-term project. googletag.cmd.push “The initial intake is for  students but that will increase over five years and we need a financial commitment to resource that for every year and work on the wider expansion of Magee.” A General Medical Council spokesperson confirmed that the next date to comply with is the Graduate Medical School Admissions Testapplication process in July. A GMC spokesperson said: “There are stages that must be completed, required for all new medical school applications, before students can be recruited. “We will decide on the readiness of the University of Ulster to accept students in September , by the end of this July.” Since the May  announcement, key players in delivering the project including the Economy Minister Dianne Dodds and Arlene Foster have spoke of ‘signicant work’ and risk assessments that must be carried out before they can commit themselves to a date. Karen Mullan said that it is ‘dficult’ when there are ‘dissenting voices’ and it ‘does create that sense of fear that is out there’. She recognised that work still has to be done to get it over the line and ‘you can’t mitigate against something that is out of everybody’s control’. Asked is Sinn Feacutein is facing resistance from within the Executive Karen Mullan was clear that all parties signed up to the commitment laid out in the New Decade, New Approach document towards Magee. But she acknowledged that Magee is not a priority for other MLAs who are focused on their own constituencies. ‘TRANSPARENCY’ SDLP Leader, Colum Eastwood MP has expressed concern that the First Minister was unable to give SDLP MLA, Mark H Durkan, a cast iron guarantee that the Magee Medical School would be ready to open in September . The Foyle MP said: “The SDLP have been campaigning for Magee expansion for many years and we secured a ringfenced funding commitment as part of New Decade, New Approach. We also worked hard to secure a commitment to supporting Magee expansion in the draft Programme for Government in the south. “The money was made available and in the months that followed, we urged the DUP and Sinn Fein to make the necessary decisions and get this project delivered. “Not only did we find ourselves rebuked as negative when asking practical questions, we were told that it was a done deal. “Clearly, it is not as the First Minister was unable to provide these basic assurances today in the Assembly Chamber, when questioned by my colleague Mark H Durkan MLA. “We will continue to fight for the Medical School and a fully expanded Magee campus. We hope that it will still open next year, but this latest statement from the First Minister makes it more dficult. “At very least, the people of Derry deserve transparency and honesty from those holding the most senior positions in the Executive. SDLP Economy Spokesperson, Sinead McLaughlin MLA added: “This is a very disappointing lack of clarity and to be blunt, Im angry about it. We were promised the Magee Medical School was coming next year and now we are not sure. “We have to invest in training more doctors to reduce locum costs and to strengthen our health service. Covid- demonstrated the need, but it looks likely that Derry and the North West will be let down by the DUP and Sinn Fein, once again.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

From  July, subject to the rate of community transmission continuing to be low, people will no longer need to shield and should instead follow the same guidance and precautions as those considered to be generally vulnerable. That involves taking particular care when out and about - and strictly maintaining social distancing. Letters will be issued in the coming days to all those covered by shielding informing them of the planned change. Mr Swann stated:“I have been clear that shielding would not last one minute longer than it needed to. We have now reached the point where,the current trends continue, there will be no need for anyone to shield after  July. googletag.cmd.push “I have listened to many of you and to the challenges you have faced during this period. I am in no doubt as to the dficulties shielding has presented for a great many people. “It is unrealistic to think these dficulties will just vanish because the need to shield has ended. That is why the letters we issue will provide details of the support which will continue to be available up to and after  July. “While my announcement today will be welcome news for many who are shielding, some will view the prospect of an end to shielding with great anxiety. I want to assure them that they should decide what to do at their own pace. Everyone will approach this situation dferently. googletag.cmd.push “As is so often the case at present, this will be about weighing up the options and making informed choices. Going outside can bring some degree of potential risk but this can be mitigated and minimised by strict social distancing. Staying indoors indefinitely is not good for anyone’s mental or physical health. “Finally, I would ask everyone to be considerate as people end their periods of shielding. We should all continue to social distance, but in the coming weeks I want you to be particularly understanding of the fact you might be encountering someone who has had to stay at home for many weeks. Please be aware of this, show respect and kindness to all and keep your distance.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

These exclusive photographs show the special screens which have been erected at Tinneys Bar in Derry. All other pubs are expected to install similar screens between staff and customers as the hospitality sector reopens following the coronavirus lockdown.  A local blinds shop has been assisting Derry bars and businesses as they prepare to reopen safely. Ace Blinds have been operating in the Derry area, serving the community for over five years and employing local people. As businesses adjust to the so-called new normal after lockdown, they have to enforce social distancing and come up with innovative ways to protect their customers. googletag.cmd.push Therefore, Ace Blinds has fitted ‘COVID- roller shields’ in local bars and the orders have been mounting from other businesses in the city. “It has gone a bit crazy at the minute and we have already taken  orders for bars,” says John Kelly of Ace Blinds. It is new territory for Ace Blinds in terms of the material they are using. “The plastic material suits bars great as they can be moved up and down very easily, not like perspex, and they are a lot easier on the eye for customers, so more friendly. They can be attached to suspension ceilings with a special clip so no drillingneeds be. googletag.cmd.push “The material is easily cleaned, you just hold the bottom bar and wipe clean and it can be secured to bars or the groundneeded.” The company has fitted the bathroom at EI Engineering to separate sinks which provides an extra layer of protection for workers. Other businesses in the town have come to them with dferent proposals which they’re working through together. This week, the Economy Minister Dianne Dodds announced that all non-essential goods retailers in Northern Ireland can re-open from tomorrow. Pubs and restaurants are expected to follow suit in July. Confirming the ‘major step forward’, the Minister said: “The pandemic has had a devastating impact on the local economy. The recovery has already begun and it is time now for the pace to accelerate. The re-opening of all goods retail outlets will be a huge part of this. “The safety of staff and customers is of course paramount. All retailers must be able to implement measures that minimise the risk to their staff and to the people who visit their stores. “We will be co-existing with this virus for some time to come so it is vital that we continue to adhere to guidance to work and live safely.” The Minister added: “The re-opening of our local shopping sector is a signicant step forward in the Executive’s pathway to recovery. I and my Executive colleagues remain committed to moving forward in the recovery while at all times keeping the health, wellbeing and safety of people at the centre and being transparent in our approach.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Crossroads Primary School in Kilrea have enlisted the help of Pearse’s GAC for the event, which will take place at Pearse Park on Thursday, June  at .am. The ceremony will be restricted to the families of Primary  pupils only, with designated car parking spaces mapped out for each pupil. Principal Eugene Mullan said the school wanted to do something special to mark the end of the pupils’ time at Crossroads. “I was racking my brain trying to think of something that was memorable and special for the Ps. They’ve missed out on so many experiences in Term ,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “We had a residential planned and we had all the end of season tournaments were ahead of us. We had a trip just before lockdown with the Year s and the school council to Stormont and at least they had that experience and got away together. “I’d considered doing a live stream, but I saw an ad for drive-in bingo in Banagher at the weekend and thought we’d give the prizegiving a go. “At least this way, the children can all come together. They won’t get to socialise with each other the way they normally would have, but at least they’ll be able to see one another.” googletag.cmd.push Mr Mullan said the venture was something the school had never attempted before, but that dficult times need creative thinking. “It’s a first for our school and I’ve never heard of a school doing a drive-in prizegiving before,” he said. “It’s an unprecedented time, though, so we have to come up with creative solutions and try and make it some way memorable for the children. “The big screen is being set up on Thursday morning and we’ll connect up a laptop with photo presentations so everyone can see and follow on with what’s happening. “All the P cars will have a designated parking space in an arc in front of the big screen and then extended family can park in behind.” The Ballerin native said Covid- had frustrated the school’s usual work in preparing the Primary  pupils for their transition to secondary education. “In Term  we would normally talk about moving on and any concerns or anxieties the children have,” he said. “We haven’t had a chance to do any of that and they’ve missed out on open days and taster days in their new schools too. “It’s going to be a big culture shock for them, but this should be special for the boys and girls and give them a nice send off.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The portable toilets that replaced them were also withdrawn following a dispute between NI Water, who own the site, and the Forestry Service, who manage it. Cllr Kathleen McGurk welcomed the reopening of some sites and said reinstating toilet facilities was ‘imperative’. “It is welcome news to see the reopening of these facilities as a tentative step out of lockdown,” she said. googletag.cmd.push “This will hopefully allow many more people to enjoy the fantastic scenery and outdoor recreational spaces our council area has to offer. “However it is imperative that the toilet facilities which were once at Banagher Glen are reinstated as a matter of urgency. “It is simply not acceptable that other recreational spaces are afforded more amenities than Banagher Glen. “If we hope to attract more tourism to the Dungiven Sperrins area of the Borough we should ensure we offer a world class experience, and that must include basic amenity facilities. “I will be contacting all stakeholders, Council, NI water and Forestry Services, to ensure that they engage with each other to provide the amenities that this recreational space deserves.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The access to the complex would be via Spencer Road. There are no plans for the car parking within the complex, as the developers say that the apartments are in a central position. Within the complex, there are also plans to construct a garden and soft play area. A statement submitted to Derry City and Strabane District Council on behalf of the applicant said: Most of the buildings included in the application have lain vacant for many years and their replacement will only improve the visual outlook of this street.” googletag.cmd.push An application for the Duke Street apartments has recently been submitted to the councils planning department. Last year, the council approved plans for the erection of a separate seven-story residential building that will house  new apartments at a nearby vacant site at the corner of Duke Street and Fountain Hill. The  units will include  one-bedroom and  two -bedroom apartments. The development also includes associated site works and the development of an amenity space.

The announcement was made today by the Northern Ireland Executive. Churches in the Republic will be reopening around the same time. “It is particularly helpful that parishes in cross-border communities will be able to plan together for a safeto Mass around the same time, said Archbishop Martin. I have been heartened by the amount of preparation which is already ongoing in our parishes to ensure that our sacred spaces will be as safe as possible when we begin to gather again together in prayer. googletag.cmd.push I expect that we will be beginning in a cautious way at first, and there will be a need for ongoing patience and careful monitoring of the situation. “In recent days, having spoken to priests across the dioceses of Armagh and Dromore, it is clear to me that there is a strong desire from our people, religious and priests to be able to celebrate the Eucharist and have access to the other sacraments, especially baptism, marriage and reconciliation. Archbishop Martin commended parishes for reaching out to parishioners in very dficult circumstances during the lockdown which included the broadcasting of Mass and other prayer opportunities by webcam. googletag.cmd.push Since March, we have also been alert to God’s presence in the lonely and the suffering. Sadly the pandemic has brought great hardship to many families whose loved ones have died because of the virus. In a lot of cases it was not possible for family members to be by their side, or to be present at their funeral. God knows our grief and how much we need strength, courage, consolation and comfort at this time”.

With handsanitiserat the door to every store, one-way systems, contactlesspayment, and limits on customernumbers, the new normal might take a while to get used to. Around half the shops in Foyleside Shopping Centre were open on Tuesday morning, with Dunnes Stores attracting the biggest crowds. Staff in Marks and Spencers and Boots, which have remained open throughout the pandemic, were glad to see a bit more hustle and bustle in the centre And with sales on in Debenhams, Dunnes and Marks and Spencer, many shoppers remarked on how happy they were to be out spendingagain. googletag.cmd.push But while the shops are open, cafes and coffee shops in the shopping centres remain closed for now. Mary McLaughlin, who hasnt been shopping in the city centrein over three months, said shewas glad to be back. This is my first day back up the town and Im all hyper with it, she said. I havent been up thetown since way beforeSt Patricks Day Its been awful not being able toget up the town, butas long as we are all healthy thats the main thing. Its just great to get out again. Ive been looking forward to it. Self-confessed shopaholic Geraldine Deery has been yearning for the social side of shopping. googletag.cmd.push Im ashopaholic and its been drivingme crazy, she said. I missed going up the town and meeting people and having a chat. And I really miss going in for a cup of coffee with my sister. Ive gone abit crazy buying things, Im making up for losttime of the weeks I missed. The management at Foyleside, The Richmond Centre and Debenhams have clearly put a lot of timeand effortinto establishingand marking out one-way systems and there are plenty of signs in place reminding people to keep to the two metre social distance rule. You do be a bit nervous because youre looking at the floor, trying to make sure you are going the right way, said Mrs McLaughlin. Everything is well spaced out and the floors are all marked out. Although Im glad I came out early because its quiet at the minute. Derrys small independent retailers are also slowly getting back to business after getting the go ahead this week, David Thomas, whose jewellery shop and workshop Thomas Goldsmith has operated from Pump Street for over  years, has been surprised that some of his fellow small traders havent reopned yet.  Ive just been for a walk round and Ive noticed that a large number of small independents arent openat the minute. This is the second dayinto it and they are taking their time to get back to work. Maybe thats their own choice. It surprisedme because to rebuild businessagain is important. For a lot of them who have furloughed staff and who are self employed as it were and are receiving payments they are thinking I wont risk it because theres a safety net there. But obviously that safety net is going to start disappearing. Business has been quite slow this week, but MrThomas is hopeful that shoppers will be back. We arecompleting the work we werent able to complete in March after the guillotine came down and we werent able to finish. And then we were hit by problems in the supply chain but that has started to ease up. In the last two weeks it has relaxed and things are filtering thoughnow. Were now able to complete things we should have done in March so weve stillgot that momentum from then, but in terms of work coming through its going to be a bit slow. There are a lot of people are being made redundant or who havent been able to claim grants and things like that. But on the other hand there are people who were furloughed and had to stay at home and werent able to spend money and they should have a fairly healthy bank account and they are desperate to get out and buy stuff. Mr Thomas has made changes to the way the shop operates in order to comply with the new regulations. Only one customer is admitted at a time, staff are usingfacemasks and hand sanitiser, and jewellery that has been tried on is being cleaned before it goes back on th shelf. People are understanding and respectful, remarked Mr Thomas. He feels that lockdown has given people time to reflect on their work le balance and lestyle. People are saying it will never be the same, he said. We were all chasing our tails a bit, workingvery hard. Does it have to be like that  Can we take things a bit easier  Do we have to be rushing off to Portugal on cheap flights  It has been strangeto sit at home in the garden and look up and see the skies totally clear. Many of Derrys charity shops have also reopened their doors, with Oxfam, Kinship Care, the Red Cross and Cancer Focus back in businessearlier this week. However, the three month closure has meant some stores are struggling with low stock levels. Deborah Tracey is the manager at Cancer Focus on Shipquay Street, which opened in May .  The shop reopened last Friday after a week of cleaning and preparation and have been busy ever since. Inside there is hand sanitiser at thedoor and a one-waysystem in place. Most people have been using the hand sanitiser before they come in, said Ms Tracey. We have been busy with people bringing stuff in and buying stuff too. People seem to feel confident coming out to shop now and theyare glad toget back to a bit of normality. Cancer Focus has amanager and deputy manager but all the other staff are volunteers. Some of our volunteers have been worried about coming back because they are older and more at risk, said MsTracy. So weare lookingfor newvolunteers now. We provide everyonewith shields, masks and gloves for their safety. Cancer Focus has also launched an appeal for donations. Any donations to the shop must be quarantined for  hours when we receive them, said Ms Tracy. We are looking for donations of clothes, bric-a-brac, shoes, bags and books. If you would like to make a donation to Cancer Focus or to enquire about becoming a volunteer telephone .

With handsanitiserat the door to every store, one-way systems, contactlesspayment, and limits on customernumbers, the new normal might take a while to get used to. Around half the shops in Foyleside Shopping Centre were open on Tuesday morning, with Dunnes Stores attracting the biggest crowds. Staff in Marks and Spencers and Boots, which have remained open throughout the pandemic, were glad to see a bit more hustle and bustle in the centre And with sales on in Debenhams, Dunnes and Marks and Spencer, many shoppers remarked on how happy they were to be out spendingagain. googletag.cmd.push But while the shops are open, cafes and coffee shops in the shopping centres remain closed for now. Mary McLaughlin, who hasnt been shopping in the city centrein over three months, said shewas glad to be back. This is my first day back up the town and Im all hyper with it, she said. I havent been up thetown since way beforeSt Patricks Day Its been awful not being able toget up the town, butas long as we are all healthy thats the main thing. Its just great to get out again. Ive been looking forward to it. Self-confessed shopaholic Geraldine Deery has been yearning for the social side of shopping. googletag.cmd.push Im ashopaholic and its been drivingme crazy, she said. I missed going up the town and meeting people and having a chat. And I really miss going in for a cup of coffee with my sister. Ive gone abit crazy buying things, Im making up for losttime of the weeks I missed. The management at Foyleside, The Richmond Centre and Debenhams have clearly put a lot of timeand effortinto establishingand marking out one-way systems and there are plenty of signs in place reminding people to keep to the two metre social distance rule. You do be a bit nervous because youre looking at the floor, trying to make sure you are going the right way, said Mrs McLaughlin. Everything is well spaced out and the floors are all marked out. Although Im glad I came out early because its quiet at the minute. Derrys small independent retailers are also slowly getting back to business after getting the go ahead this week, David Thomas, whose jewellery shop and workshop Thomas Goldsmith has operated from Pump Street for over  years, has been surprised that some of his fellow small traders havent reopned yet.  Ive just been for a walk round and Ive noticed that a large number of small independents arent openat the minute. This is the second dayinto it and they are taking their time to get back to work. Maybe thats their own choice. It surprisedme because to rebuild businessagain is important. For a lot of them who have furloughed staff and who are self employed as it were and are receiving payments they are thinking I wont risk it because theres a safety net there. But obviously that safety net is going to start disappearing. Business has been quite slow this week, but MrThomas is hopeful that shoppers will be back. We arecompleting the work we werent able to complete in March after the guillotine came down and we werent able to finish. And then we were hit by problems in the supply chain but that has started to ease up. In the last two weeks it has relaxed and things are filtering thoughnow. Were now able to complete things we should have done in March so weve stillgot that momentum from then, but in terms of work coming through its going to be a bit slow. There are a lot of people are being made redundant or who havent been able to claim grants and things like that. But on the other hand there are people who were furloughed and had to stay at home and werent able to spend money and they should have a fairly healthy bank account and they are desperate to get out and buy stuff. Mr Thomas has made changes to the way the shop operates in order to comply with the new regulations. Only one customer is admitted at a time, staff are usingfacemasks and hand sanitiser, and jewellery that has been tried on is being cleaned before it goes back on th shelf. People are understanding and respectful, remarked Mr Thomas. He feels that lockdown has given people time to reflect on their work le balance and lestyle. People are saying it will never be the same, he said. We were all chasing our tails a bit, workingvery hard. Does it have to be like that  Can we take things a bit easier  Do we have to be rushing off to Portugal on cheap flights  It has been strangeto sit at home in the garden and look up and see the skies totally clear. Many of Derrys charity shops have also reopened their doors, with Oxfam, Kinship Care, the Red Cross and Cancer Focus back in businessearlier this week. However, the three month closure has meant some stores are struggling with low stock levels. Deborah Tracey is the manager at Cancer Focus on Shipquay Street, which opened in May .  The shop reopened last Friday after a week of cleaning and preparation and have been busy ever since. Inside there is hand sanitiser at thedoor and a one-waysystem in place. Most people have been using the hand sanitiser before they come in, said Ms Tracey. We have been busy with people bringing stuff in and buying stuff too. People seem to feel confident coming out to shop now and theyare glad toget back to a bit of normality. Cancer Focus has amanager and deputy manager but all the other staff are volunteers. Some of our volunteers have been worried about coming back because they are older and more at risk, said MsTracy. So weare lookingfor newvolunteers now. We provide everyonewith shields, masks and gloves for their safety. Cancer Focus has also launched an appeal for donations. Any donations to the shop must be quarantined for  hours when we receive them, said Ms Tracy. We are looking for donations of clothes, bric-a-brac, shoes, bags and books. If you would like to make a donation to Cancer Focus or to enquire about becoming a volunteer telephone .

He spoke to Michael McMullan about his love for football, his career and answering Irelands call. *** It has always been football for Ruaidhri Higgins. Always. He has never known anything dferent. Even in Primary Four, Leo McCloskey saw enough to call him into the Termoncanice PS team. The following year, they lost a Northern Ireland final, before going one better  months later. It was the beginning for the man Stephen Kenny has put his trust into lead the scouting and analysis of the Republic of Ireland soccer team. googletag.cmd.push Higgins obsession for the game smashed through the roof when he began to play with the local Newtowne underage teams from the age of seven. “I wasnt one of those kids that was into cartoons, super heroes and Disney films, I was just obsessed by playing football from no age,” Ruaidhri begins. “I cant ever remember not playing it and it has been my le.” It began to get more serious when Kenny Shiels, who was taking his son Dean to play for Lisburn Youths at the time, asked Ruaidhris fatherhis son would join them. It was a prominent shop window for scouts, but the regular . kick-offs demanded a six oclock rise and trek up the M. googletag.cmd.push “It was a massive commitment,” Ruaidhri said, of his parents Danny and Marys time. For two years, it was Newtowne in the summer and Lisburn in the winter and all the travelling it entailed. They backed him  percent. Ruaidhri and Paddy are their youngest sons, with a  year gap to Michael and Kevin. “It is two dferent generations, but we are unbelievably close, the four of us,” Ruaidhri stresses. “I have been in every corner of Europe with football and they have always followed, they have been massive supporters in my career. “Without that upbringing and without that support, then I probably wouldnt be in the position I am in and wouldnt have had a career in this country like I had. I am very grateful and I dont take it for granted.” Ruaidhri played Gaelic football in his youth and as a pupil of St Marys Limavady lost an Ulster final replay to Coalisland. Growing up, he rarely missed a game when Derry were challenging for Sam Maguire. Even then, at the age of eight, Ruaidhri was deeper in thought than most. “The semi-final was probably the final, I remember when Johnny McGurk hit the winning score with his left foot,” Ruaidhri recalls of the  triumph, with the detail he will be using to suss out Irelands opponents. “It was a massive passion at that time but football shaded it. My brothers, my Da and my uncles first love would be GAA.” His first soccer football game was a trip to Parkhead to see Celtic come from - down to beat Dundee United in the Scottish Cup. He has been to Old Trafford, but doesnt have a favourite team. “I wouldnt say I am a fan of anyone. I am a football fan and I would look out for Celtic orUniteds score but it wouldnt ruin my weekendthey didnt win.” As the years passed, Ruaidhris prowess in the ious underage leagues attracted the attention of soccer scouts and was forward and back with too many clubs before opting for Coventry City. *** There were offers from more prominent clubs on the table, but Coventry attracted him. A chance for first team football, a long-term contract and hospitality all influenced his decision. “I was made feel unbelievably welcome, even at that age, by Gordon Strachan, the first team manager,” Ruaidhri states. “Richard Money, the Academy Director, and George Mackiemade my family feel unbelievably welcome every time we went over and made a big fuss.” Ruaidhri has no regrets about the move and completed his last two years of school in Coventry. At the time, a growth spurt led to knee problems and he spent the first two months in plaster and he didnt kick a ball for close to six months. “It was the right decision,” Ruaidhri points out of the club insisting he join earlier than anticipated. “I was playing through the pain barrier at home and they werent happy about it. Until they fixed it, I went  months in and out of playing because of the pain I was in. They had invested in me and were well within their rights. “It toughened me up. I moved away from home at  and had to become a man before a normal teenager, that stood me in good stead. Looking back, in terms of becoming more streetwise, it gave me a sound footing.” While he was happy with his progress in his first two years, he felt there was a genuine point he caught the eye of first-team manager Gary McAllister, who liked how Ruairi played in possession and he bagged two goals on his reserve debut. “I played really well and got peoples attention around the club,” Higgins felt. It was a quick evolution in how the game changed and relegation from the Championship sent out a warning message. “It was all about second balls and getting up and down the pitch. That didnt suit my style. Once athleticism started to take over from creative players, I kinda knew I might not have a career at that level,” he added. For four and half years, Coventry had high hopes for the Limavady man, but it faded away. When his contract ended, he wasnt too keen on going down the leagues. “It is a body blow to players when they get released from clubs in England. It is your dream, it is your passion, you feel you have failed.” Just when he needed a saviour, Stephen Kenny made the first of five important phone calls to Ruaidhri Higgins. *** With his teenage years coming to an end and his Coventry career over, an   number lit up on Ruaidhri Higgins phone. Kenny had just taken up the mantle as Derry City manager in August  and was putting together a squad. “I had never spoken to him before,” Ruaidhri reveals. “There was a definite rebuilding process when I came home, I wasnt the same person for six to  months. I lost my confidence and felt I had let people down,” he said, while stressing nothing was further from the truth. “Stephen was the perfect manager for me at that time. Living at home with my parents helped massively.” Slowly but surely he got his mojo back. “I owe Stephen a lot. In my first six months I played a lot in the reserve team just to get playing football again. I was performing better and better and running games in the reserves and it gave me the confidence that I could get my career back on track.” Kennys management skills continued, when he waited for the opportune moment to bed him back into the senior squad. It wasnt a rush, but rather some games to ease him into a regular spot. The Candystripes, with Higgins as a regular, won four League Cups in a row from  to . In , they won the FAI Cup with a - extra-time thriller, Kennys last game before taking over at Scottish side Dunfermline. After losing the  title to Cork City on the last day of the season, they missed the  treble after Shelbourne won the league on score dference. “Stephen brought great success and, particularly in  and , the Brandywell was packed and there was a great buzz”, Higgins states. “We had a really good run in Europe in  and that probably cost us the treble because of the backlog of games.” Derry beat IFK Gothenburg and Gretna before going out against Paris Saint-Germain - on aggregate, after holding the French side scoreless at the Brandywell in the first leg. Higgins played in both legs against Gothenburg and rates it has his European highlight. “They had three or four Swedish internationals that played in the  World Cup. We were something like - to win in Gothenburg,” he remembers. Kenny broke down their opponents in advance of the game, showing video clips of unknown teams and how they got results against Gothenburg. “I remember after that meeting, we walked out of it and we were thinking we have a helluva chance here. “We went out and deserved to win the game. It wasnt a smash and grab, it was an unbelievable performance. The home game we deserved to win that, we won - on aggregate and it was a massive achievement for the club.” Derry lost the FAI Cup final in  and were relegated to the First Division the following season, due to financial irregularities. “We went four or five months without pay. I had just bought a house, I had a mortgage and I had bills to pay,” Higgins points out. Pat Fenlon brought him to Bohemians. During the stint Bohs won the Setanta Cup, but Higgins was cup tied and missed out and again Higgins missed on a league medal on score dference to champions Shamrock Rovers. “I probably didnt do myself justice there. I had a decent period in mid-season, I lost my form and when Derry got promoted I went back there.” Back at the Brandywell, Higgins won a fth League Cup and in the FAI Cup decider, his flick on setup Rory Patterson for the extra-time winner. “We qualied for Europe through the league and were actually in the title race until four or five games in the season.” The  season, was one of Higgins best in a Derry shirt, but when Roddy Collins came in as manager, he wasnt in the plans. “I had a good season and had a new options and it was Stephenwho brought me to Dundalk and we won the League Cup, that was my sixth. It gave us the confidence to push on and win the league,” Higgins recalls. “We were trailing Cork going into the final game of the season. We played them at home and we beat them -, that was an amazing night. I was involved in four titles that went to the last game of the season, I lost three and won that one. “There has been a lot of ups and downs but thankfully there are a lot of good memories to look back on. You get lower with the downs than higher with the ups “Throughout my playing career in the League of Ireland, I averaged a trophy a season, so I had a successful enough playing career.” After a spell at Coleraine, where he also managed the U Academy squad, he began to focus more on coaching. He remembers Willie McKeown, then Coventrys Ireland scout telling him youve a great eye for the game and encouraging him to push on and get his coaching badges. “I had no interest at that time obviously. You have this dream of becoming a star footballer, but I genuinely always had an interest in the tactical side of the game,” said Higgins. Stephen Kenny also thought he had a good eye for the game and asked him to join Dundalks coaching staff. In the first season, they lost out to Cork City in the league. “I stayed in the role as analyst, we won thedouble and Stephen left to take theUs, Vinnywas promote to manager and I was promoted to assistant manager. So, I won the league with Dundalk in three dferent roles.” *** When Kenny was promoted to the Ireland manager post, he once again punched Higgins number into his phone. It was a brilliant call to get,not altogether a shock. “We have that relationship. He values me. It was a shock in a sense that it was the international stage, a dferent level. “It is a huge honour and a privilege to be asked. I had made my mind up very quickly because it is impossible to turn that opportunity down when it comes.” He acknowledges Dundalk, who he states were amazing in giving him the . Going to another League of Ireland Cup would have took some serious thinking. “When you are going to the international stage, it is incredibility tough to even consider turning that down,” Ruaidhri highlights. Now the work starts again in earnest. When I first call, he is scouring footage of European play-off opponents Bulgaria. His weeks are taken up with meetings, both online and face to face where circumstances allow it. “ One thing you can be sure, Stephen will have plenty for you to do and he leaves nothing to chance,” Ruaidhri stresses. “We have two games in early September, thats the main focus for myself, Stephen and the staff under him.” When le gets back to normal and gamesto the fixture calendar, Ruaidhri will be clocking up the air miles. “I will be going to watch our own players in England and reporting back, as well as studying the opposition,” he adds. Nothing beats being there and seeing a game in the flesh. The TV camera will only ever follow the ball. “If you have a birds eye view from the stand, you can see everything that is going on. When the ball is at this end of the pitch, what is the teams shape like back here. “When you are watching an inidual player, you literally focus on the player. It is dferentyou are watching a team. You are analysing the whole structure of the team. It is two completely dferent things,” Higgins continues. From playing on Termoncanices school team, to now, he is now an important cog in international football and takes Stephens approach as a massive compliment. “There are a lot of bigger names than me, who he couldve went after and have loved the position. He has huge trust in me and sees the value I can bring and I take it as a massive compliment and for me, it is a huge confidence booster.” He has never been at a major tournament as a fan. Watching from a pub as Damien Duff tore Spain apart in the  World Cup clash in Suwon is a memory, a game Ireland lost on penalties. “Damien was probably the best winger in the world and thats not exaggerating,” Higgins says of the man who, along with Alan Kelly and Keith Andrews, is now in the management setup with him. Now, qualying for a major tournament would be a dream, but as part of the management is also an objective Higgins has an input to. “We have an opportunity within the next two years of getting to the Euros and getting to a World Cup. “You dream of it when you were a small boy. We will be doing everything we can, it wont be from the want of trying. We have a really good group of players to go and try to achieve something special.” Football has always been Ruaidhri Higgins le. His skill set has opened the latest door of opportunity.

He spoke to Michael McMullan about his love for football, his career and answering Irelands call. *** It has always been football for Ruaidhri Higgins. Always. He has never known anything dferent. Even in Primary Four, Leo McCloskey saw enough to call him into the Termoncanice PS team. The following year, they lost a Northern Ireland final, before going one better  months later. It was the beginning for the man Stephen Kenny has put his trust into lead the scouting and analysis of the Republic of Ireland soccer team. googletag.cmd.push Higgins obsession for the game smashed through the roof when he began to play with the local Newtowne underage teams from the age of seven. “I wasnt one of those kids that was into cartoons, super heroes and Disney films, I was just obsessed by playing football from no age,” Ruaidhri begins. “I cant ever remember not playing it and it has been my le.” It began to get more serious when Kenny Shiels, who was taking his son Dean to play for Lisburn Youths at the time, asked Ruaidhris fatherhis son would join them. It was a prominent shop window for scouts, but the regular . kick-offs demanded a six oclock rise and trek up the M. googletag.cmd.push “It was a massive commitment,” Ruaidhri said, of his parents Danny and Marys time. For two years, it was Newtowne in the summer and Lisburn in the winter and all the travelling it entailed. They backed him  percent. Ruaidhri and Paddy are their youngest sons, with a  year gap to Michael and Kevin. “It is two dferent generations, but we are unbelievably close, the four of us,” Ruaidhri stresses. “I have been in every corner of Europe with football and they have always followed, they have been massive supporters in my career. “Without that upbringing and without that support, then I probably wouldnt be in the position I am in and wouldnt have had a career in this country like I had. I am very grateful and I dont take it for granted.” Ruaidhri played Gaelic football in his youth and as a pupil of St Marys Limavady lost an Ulster final replay to Coalisland. Growing up, he rarely missed a game when Derry were challenging for Sam Maguire. Even then, at the age of eight, Ruaidhri was deeper in thought than most. “The semi-final was probably the final, I remember when Johnny McGurk hit the winning score with his left foot,” Ruaidhri recalls of the  triumph, with the detail he will be using to suss out Irelands opponents. “It was a massive passion at that time but football shaded it. My brothers, my Da and my uncles first love would be GAA.” His first soccer football game was a trip to Parkhead to see Celtic come from - down to beat Dundee United in the Scottish Cup. He has been to Old Trafford, but doesnt have a favourite team. “I wouldnt say I am a fan of anyone. I am a football fan and I would look out for Celtic orUniteds score but it wouldnt ruin my weekendthey didnt win.” As the years passed, Ruaidhris prowess in the ious underage leagues attracted the attention of soccer scouts and was forward and back with too many clubs before opting for Coventry City. *** There were offers from more prominent clubs on the table, but Coventry attracted him. A chance for first team football, a long-term contract and hospitality all influenced his decision. “I was made feel unbelievably welcome, even at that age, by Gordon Strachan, the first team manager,” Ruaidhri states. “Richard Money, the Academy Director, and George Mackiemade my family feel unbelievably welcome every time we went over and made a big fuss.” Ruaidhri has no regrets about the move and completed his last two years of school in Coventry. At the time, a growth spurt led to knee problems and he spent the first two months in plaster and he didnt kick a ball for close to six months. “It was the right decision,” Ruaidhri points out of the club insisting he join earlier than anticipated. “I was playing through the pain barrier at home and they werent happy about it. Until they fixed it, I went  months in and out of playing because of the pain I was in. They had invested in me and were well within their rights. “It toughened me up. I moved away from home at  and had to become a man before a normal teenager, that stood me in good stead. Looking back, in terms of becoming more streetwise, it gave me a sound footing.” While he was happy with his progress in his first two years, he felt there was a genuine point he caught the eye of first-team manager Gary McAllister, who liked how Ruairi played in possession and he bagged two goals on his reserve debut. “I played really well and got peoples attention around the club,” Higgins felt. It was a quick evolution in how the game changed and relegation from the Championship sent out a warning message. “It was all about second balls and getting up and down the pitch. That didnt suit my style. Once athleticism started to take over from creative players, I kinda knew I might not have a career at that level,” he added. For four and half years, Coventry had high hopes for the Limavady man, but it faded away. When his contract ended, he wasnt too keen on going down the leagues. “It is a body blow to players when they get released from clubs in England. It is your dream, it is your passion, you feel you have failed.” Just when he needed a saviour, Stephen Kenny made the first of five important phone calls to Ruaidhri Higgins. *** With his teenage years coming to an end and his Coventry career over, an   number lit up on Ruaidhri Higgins phone. Kenny had just taken up the mantle as Derry City manager in August  and was putting together a squad. “I had never spoken to him before,” Ruaidhri reveals. “There was a definite rebuilding process when I came home, I wasnt the same person for six to  months. I lost my confidence and felt I had let people down,” he said, while stressing nothing was further from the truth. “Stephen was the perfect manager for me at that time. Living at home with my parents helped massively.” Slowly but surely he got his mojo back. “I owe Stephen a lot. In my first six months I played a lot in the reserve team just to get playing football again. I was performing better and better and running games in the reserves and it gave me the confidence that I could get my career back on track.” Kennys management skills continued, when he waited for the opportune moment to bed him back into the senior squad. It wasnt a rush, but rather some games to ease him into a regular spot. The Candystripes, with Higgins as a regular, won four League Cups in a row from  to . In , they won the FAI Cup with a - extra-time thriller, Kennys last game before taking over at Scottish side Dunfermline. After losing the  title to Cork City on the last day of the season, they missed the  treble after Shelbourne won the league on score dference. “Stephen brought great success and, particularly in  and , the Brandywell was packed and there was a great buzz”, Higgins states. “We had a really good run in Europe in  and that probably cost us the treble because of the backlog of games.” Derry beat IFK Gothenburg and Gretna before going out against Paris Saint-Germain - on aggregate, after holding the French side scoreless at the Brandywell in the first leg. Higgins played in both legs against Gothenburg and rates it has his European highlight. “They had three or four Swedish internationals that played in the  World Cup. We were something like - to win in Gothenburg,” he remembers. Kenny broke down their opponents in advance of the game, showing video clips of unknown teams and how they got results against Gothenburg. “I remember after that meeting, we walked out of it and we were thinking we have a helluva chance here. “We went out and deserved to win the game. It wasnt a smash and grab, it was an unbelievable performance. The home game we deserved to win that, we won - on aggregate and it was a massive achievement for the club.” Derry lost the FAI Cup final in  and were relegated to the First Division the following season, due to financial irregularities. “We went four or five months without pay. I had just bought a house, I had a mortgage and I had bills to pay,” Higgins points out. Pat Fenlon brought him to Bohemians. During the stint Bohs won the Setanta Cup, but Higgins was cup tied and missed out and again Higgins missed on a league medal on score dference to champions Shamrock Rovers. “I probably didnt do myself justice there. I had a decent period in mid-season, I lost my form and when Derry got promoted I went back there.” Back at the Brandywell, Higgins won a fth League Cup and in the FAI Cup decider, his flick on setup Rory Patterson for the extra-time winner. “We qualied for Europe through the league and were actually in the title race until four or five games in the season.” The  season, was one of Higgins best in a Derry shirt, but when Roddy Collins came in as manager, he wasnt in the plans. “I had a good season and had a new options and it was Stephenwho brought me to Dundalk and we won the League Cup, that was my sixth. It gave us the confidence to push on and win the league,” Higgins recalls. “We were trailing Cork going into the final game of the season. We played them at home and we beat them -, that was an amazing night. I was involved in four titles that went to the last game of the season, I lost three and won that one. “There has been a lot of ups and downs but thankfully there are a lot of good memories to look back on. You get lower with the downs than higher with the ups “Throughout my playing career in the League of Ireland, I averaged a trophy a season, so I had a successful enough playing career.” After a spell at Coleraine, where he also managed the U Academy squad, he began to focus more on coaching. He remembers Willie McKeown, then Coventrys Ireland scout telling him youve a great eye for the game and encouraging him to push on and get his coaching badges. “I had no interest at that time obviously. You have this dream of becoming a star footballer, but I genuinely always had an interest in the tactical side of the game,” said Higgins. Stephen Kenny also thought he had a good eye for the game and asked him to join Dundalks coaching staff. In the first season, they lost out to Cork City in the league. “I stayed in the role as analyst, we won thedouble and Stephen left to take theUs, Vinnywas promote to manager and I was promoted to assistant manager. So, I won the league with Dundalk in three dferent roles.” *** When Kenny was promoted to the Ireland manager post, he once again punched Higgins number into his phone. It was a brilliant call to get,not altogether a shock. “We have that relationship. He values me. It was a shock in a sense that it was the international stage, a dferent level. “It is a huge honour and a privilege to be asked. I had made my mind up very quickly because it is impossible to turn that opportunity down when it comes.” He acknowledges Dundalk, who he states were amazing in giving him the . Going to another League of Ireland Cup would have took some serious thinking. “When you are going to the international stage, it is incredibility tough to even consider turning that down,” Ruaidhri highlights. Now the work starts again in earnest. When I first call, he is scouring footage of European play-off opponents Bulgaria. His weeks are taken up with meetings, both online and face to face where circumstances allow it. “ One thing you can be sure, Stephen will have plenty for you to do and he leaves nothing to chance,” Ruaidhri stresses. “We have two games in early September, thats the main focus for myself, Stephen and the staff under him.” When le gets back to normal and gamesto the fixture calendar, Ruaidhri will be clocking up the air miles. “I will be going to watch our own players in England and reporting back, as well as studying the opposition,” he adds. Nothing beats being there and seeing a game in the flesh. The TV camera will only ever follow the ball. “If you have a birds eye view from the stand, you can see everything that is going on. When the ball is at this end of the pitch, what is the teams shape like back here. “When you are watching an inidual player, you literally focus on the player. It is dferentyou are watching a team. You are analysing the whole structure of the team. It is two completely dferent things,” Higgins continues. From playing on Termoncanices school team, to now, he is now an important cog in international football and takes Stephens approach as a massive compliment. “There are a lot of bigger names than me, who he couldve went after and have loved the position. He has huge trust in me and sees the value I can bring and I take it as a massive compliment and for me, it is a huge confidence booster.” He has never been at a major tournament as a fan. Watching from a pub as Damien Duff tore Spain apart in the  World Cup clash in Suwon is a memory, a game Ireland lost on penalties. “Damien was probably the best winger in the world and thats not exaggerating,” Higgins says of the man who, along with Alan Kelly and Keith Andrews, is now in the management setup with him. Now, qualying for a major tournament would be a dream, but as part of the management is also an objective Higgins has an input to. “We have an opportunity within the next two years of getting to the Euros and getting to a World Cup. “You dream of it when you were a small boy. We will be doing everything we can, it wont be from the want of trying. We have a really good group of players to go and try to achieve something special.” Football has always been Ruaidhri Higgins le. His skill set has opened the latest door of opportunity.

His book has been described in The Independent as ldquoone of the finest pieces of modern nature writing in recent years. In this extract the autistic teenager shares his joy of the natural world on a day out to Murlough with his sister and brother.OUR garden is thrumming with birds today: coal, blue and great tits, blackbird, thrush, magpie, jackdaw, rook, all of them revelling on the grass, pecking at the feeders.I could happily watch them all day but rain is coming from the east, so we decide to go west to the coast at Murlough to stay in the sunshine. I usually despise being in the sun. I find its light too bright, its heat too hot, and it can make me feel astherersquos nowhere to hide. But with this rain coming, I feel like being on the dunes at Murlough, pressed by warmth and sea breezes.The ancient dune system here is six thousand years old, fragile and spectacular. The unusually high dunes were formed in the late th and th centuries by massive storms, and were used by people in the Middle Ages as rabbit warrens to provide them with meat and pelts.Grazing rabbits encouraged the grassy heathland here, but when myxomatosis first broke out in the s, as it did in other parts of Ireland and Britain, the population was almost wiped out. With fewer rabbits, sea buckthorn and sycamore could grow, turning heath to scrubland. Now the National Trust have intervened at Murlough, managing the landscape so it reverts back to heath mdash and judging from the copious pings, it looks like the rabbits are thriving again, too.The day is sparkling, the wind is shaking and shaping the clouds. Lorcan and Blaacutethnaid want to swim, so I stroll along the beach with my binoculars. Shapes out at sea stop me: a trinity of torpedoing gannets. They swoop, wheel and suddenly drop, spiralling until the last second when they transform into arrows before hitting the water.Swallows are overhead ndash I can see their small bodies so clearly, weightless and constantly moving. I feel myself rising with them.My dark, knotted thoughts seem to be staying away at the moment. I feel as free as the gannets and swallows. If they can live their lives, shouldnrsquot I do the same  Can I breathe and live and also fight  The natural world mdash which includes us mdash is facing such enormous challenges that itrsquos easy to become overwhelmed and depressed. But we must fix them, andIrsquom no longer here, alive, I canrsquot be part of the solution.What is it thatrsquos holding me back  Anxiety  Depression  Autism  These are the shackles. Surely, I can break free. Or at least I can accept these things as part of me. I have no answers, but the lightness of these thoughts and these days weave my body and mind with everything around me. The only thing that I am really bound to is nature ndash as we all are.Lorcan and Blaacutethnaid are running towards me, and I run to them, and then we run together, exultant. We slow down in unison, all feeling the same pull of the large peculiar shells dotted around the beach. We each pick one up and hold them outstretched, delicate porcelain in our hands.They look like pale planets, pockmarked with symmetrical lines. I rattle mine, listening to the whisper of sand and the past. These are sea potatoes mdash a type of sand-burrowing sea urchin mdash with pocks that once held spines and a bleached calcium carbonate shell that could so easily shatter on land or at sea. Each one is a miracle. So many miracles washed up at once.We start to collect them and Lorcan decides to name three of the best specimens Sandy, Sam and Sandra. He holds a conversation with them, three sea potatoes, which makes us laugh so hard that tears well up and almost flow, and wersquore still laughing as a warm rain starts to fall on us.Under dark skies, I feel completely unburdened of any doubts in my own abilities to help our planet. Instead, I feel energised and ready. Sopping wet and cold and with chattering teeth, still giggling madly, I feel hope pouring in the rain. Being myself is enough.Diary of a Young Naturalist by Dara McAnulty is published by Little Tollerand can be bought online, or at No Alibis bookshop in Belfast..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"A lifetime of capturing Ireland’s scenic beauty  ","story":"AMATEUR photographer Chris Laverty spent a letime capturing Irelandrsquos scenic beauty.The former Queenrsquos University computer centre manager travelled extensively, always with his camera, and always with an eye for the magic of the countryside around him.

As we work to do so, our absolute priority will be to keep our patients, service users and staff safe. the statement adds.The health trustrsquos insistence that emergency services will be restored at the Downe comes ahead of a meeting with a Sinn Fein delegation to discuss the issue.Spearheaded by South Down MP, Chris Hazzard, the delegation will be seeking assurances that all services will be restored to their previous level.Ahead of the meeting, Mr Hazzard said that due to the pandemic, the local community was left without access to vital services at the Downe due to the health systemrsquos response to coronavirus which ldquorequired what amounted to extraordinary measures for an extraordinary time.The MP said the Downe was left ldquounrecognisable as emergency and outpatient services, amongst others, closed from the end of March.ldquoWhere required, all available staff and equipment from these units was also requisitioned for use in other parts of the South Eastern Trust area, he continued.ldquoIn agreeing to the radical reconfiguration of the Downe, the community made a big sacrice in order to accommodate the unprecedented demands made by both health trusts in the fight against Covid-.Insisting that it was the right thing to do at the right time, Mr Hazzard said there is now an onus on trust management to respond in kind to the community.He said the recently published recovery plans have delayed the restoration of vital services to the community, causing signicant concern amongst many who fear that ldquotemporary closure might inevitably mean permanent removal.Mr Hazzard said the Sinn Fein delegation will be calling for the full restoration of services at the Downe and will also be meeting with the chief executive of the Southern Trust to call for services removed from Newryrsquos Daisy Hill hospital to be reinstated.Rowallane DUP councillors are also demanding the full restoration of services at the Downe Hospital, highlighting the importance of reopening the emergency department as soon as possible.Cllr Billy Walker said it was ironic that within hours of confirmation that the Downpatrick ED would not reopen at this stage, the South Eastern Trust revealed via social media that the Ulster Hospitalrsquos emergency department was extremely busy.ldquoThis is nothing new, he declared. ldquoThere is a clear need for the Downersquos emergency department to reopen now. Having this facility available can help ease the pressure on other EDs and we cannot understand why there is not increased investment in Downpatrick.ldquoWe all understood the temporary closure of services at the Downe to allow health chiefs to respond to the global pandemic, but the time for those services to be reinstated is now.

However, bearing in mind the scheme is all but shovel ready, this should be a simple case of signing the commencement orders with construction starting as soon as possible.Mr Hazzard said the roads minister has a capital budget of more than poundm to be spent this year, suggesting that very few projects are as advanced as the Ballynahinch bypass.ldquoThere is no logical reason why this long overdue project canrsquot get the green light for construction as a matter of priority, he said.The MP added: ldquoIn light of the severe economic impact of Covid- and the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the commencement of this scheme would be a welcome step towards improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of our community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Darragh Cross residents bring cheer to local residential home  ","story":"RESIDENTS from Oakland Court in Darragh Cross made the most of the lockdown by having socially distanced nights of entertainment while helping the residents of a nearby residential home.From hosting fun events such as bingo and discos, they raised pound for Willowview Residential Home in Saintfield.Oakland Court residents would like to thank Darragh Crossrsquo Vivo shop for its donation of prize hampers and everyone who donated prizes and gts.In turn, all residents and staff of Willowview Residential Home would like to say pay their gratitude to to all the residents of Oakland Court and Darragh Cross Vivo for their kindness and thoughtfulness..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"DNA testing on dog dirt  ","story":"SENIOR Newry, Mourne and Down Council officers say they will need time to research the issue of using DNA testing on dog dirt in a bid to trace animals which are allowed to use public areas as open air toilets.Members of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee will discuss the issue at their virtual meeting later today.A motion on the issue tabled by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown at the March meeting of the full council was referred to the local authority committee for discussion.Dog dirt poses a major health risk, especially to children, who could potentially lose their sight as a result of coming into contact with it.Cllr Brown said there was a need to consider innovative ways of tackling the issue which has been raised on a regular basis by elected representatives across the local authorityrsquos seven DEAs.He is keen for the local authority to investigate the viability of using DNA testing in a bid to identy offenders and aid enforcement officers to dish out fines.Cllr Brown is also eager for council officials to draw upon best practice from other councils who have introduced such a scheme in a bid to crack down on the dog fouling issue.In addition, he wants the local authority to roll out what he has described as an ldquoenhanced public awareness campaign focusing on the dangers of dog fouling.Ahead of tonightrsquos council meeting, officers are recommending that Cllr Brownrsquos motion is agreed to allow them time to research similar schemes which have been introduced where.In addition, officers say that they will need to understand the time and resources required to implement such a scheme locally beforereporting back to the council committee.Politicians, who have previously asked for more enforcement staff to be deployed across the district to deal with the dog fouling problem, say the highly contentious issue is one of the single most complained about problems in the area.They say that despite valiant efforts over recent years by council officials and others, the issue has not been adequately addressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Drive in assembly at Crossgar primary school  ","story":"CEDAR Integrated Primary School in Crossgar has said farewell to its P pupils.Staff held a drive-in leavers ceremony for the outgoing P class last Friday.Parents and carers were invited to park in the playground and watch the  pupils receive folders of their work from their time at Cedar.They also received a survival kit for lsquobig schoolrsquo, as well as trophies for sports, arts and ICT,.

He was also famous for discovering milk chocolate.Born in Killyleagh on April , , Sir Hans died in Cha in , aged  and described as the worldrsquos greatest collector who, from his earliest years, catalogued and carefully encased every artefact that he found.Over the years he accumulated nearly , items many of which today are on display in the British Museum.Close to the picturesque harbour in Killyleagh stands a copy of the London statue in honour of Sir Hans with a local councillor branding the campaign to take down the statues in the capital as ldquoridiculousCllr Billy Walker insists that the pioneering physician was not a slave trader and that the clamour for many statues to be taken down was becoming ldquosilly, urging the Government to show some backbone on the matter.He said Sir Hans was ldquorevered in his home town where people were proud to have a copy of the statue to a man who did so much for the world.Cllr Walker continued: ldquoSir Hans gave us the concept of free museums, found a cure for smallpox and pioneered science and medicine to do away with magic for treating illness.ldquoHe also promoted the use of quinine against malaria, discovered milk chocolate and was the first man to lead both Royal Colleges.

In addition to the services directly provided at our local hospital mdash the peoplersquos hospital mdash Downe staff were redeployed to other healthcare facilities andcontributed enormously to the NHS effort.When the emergency planning was taking effect, it was the clear understanding of many local political and community representatives, that the emergency department service would be restored immediately upon the conclusion of the pandemic.Whilst there is clearly a signicant possibility of a so-called second surge in infections mdash and we are all aware as to just how serious such a second surge could be mdash at the same time there is increased normalisation of health provision across the North.The restoration of the urgent care service previously provided at the Downe must be a top priority as part of this normalisation. It should have been included in the June action plan, published by the health trust last week.Just last week, as attendances were increasing at the remaining emergency departments, including at the Ulster Hospital, it was apparent that existing facilities are and will be unable to cope with demand.During the Covid emergency planning, decisions were taken to temporarily close the emergency departments at the Downe, Daisy Hill and the Mater hospitals.Just last week, trade union representatives received categorical assurances from the Southern Trust about the re-opening of about Daisy Hill Hospital. Similar assurances are now required about the Downe.There is also a signicant impetus gathering now for the implementation of restructuring of healthcare services generally, and of urgent care in particular, across Northern Ireland.Decisions about the future of healthcare, particularly urgent care, afford an excellent opportunity to redress health inequalities that have arisen and been perpetuated by the historic under investment in the health service by successive governments and by the pursuit of centralisation policies.Many people believe that those centralisation policies played a crucial role in leaving us facing into a pandemic with insufficient hospital beds, insufficient intensive care beds, insufficient ambulance cover, insufficient ventilators and insufficient healthcare workers.Any change to emergency and urgent care provision is only permissible where it happens with the consent of the people.In the final analysis, decisions about the allocation of healthcare resources are political decisions taken by politicians, elected by the people and not by bureaucrats. Tiers and levels of bureaucracy make no dference to where ultimate responsibility lies.I have a great deal of sympathy for the recently appointed health minister, Robin Swann, who within a few weeks of his appointment, found himself facing the biggest public health emergency in the history of the National Health Service.I would respectfully suggest that Mr Swann should insist upon the criteria for change stated by Michelle OrsquoNeill when she was Health Minister.The now Deputy First Minister stated in November  that local people should be at the centre of decision-making processes in designing and delivering services. The , people who marched through Downpatrick in support of the Downe Hospitalin the Love the Downe Rally on February , , would certainly agree with that.As far back as , Dr Michael McBride, speaking at the sod cutting ceremony for the new Downe Hospital, said that ldquothe emphasis would be on making the health system respond to the patient rather than the patient to the system. I concur with that.In the Down Recorder of November , , after the publication of the Bengoa Report, Michelle OrsquoNeill was quoted as saying: ldquoWe will deliver care and support in the most appropriate settings, ideally in peoplersquos homes and communities.Again, I would concur with that.If there is to be a change in urgent care provision across Northern Ireland, no one can expect to be immune from that change. At the same time, change would only be possible or acceptableit is to create a better service for all of the people and a fair and equitable distribution of services.Many people in this area believe that we have had a very raw deal for over  years from the health service and some politicians.It sometimes seems to be forgotten that the National Health Service is free at the point of use, but it is certainly not without cost. It is the people who pay for it.Rural communities have particular characteristics and needs that must be addressed, in terms of at the most basic, accessibility to services. Like everyone , they have rights.Access to healthcare is a right, not a privilege.If it is to be the case that urgent care is being restructured, citizens in rural areas which, for this purpose, includes virtually anyone outside the Greater Belfast area, cannot be expected to forego services so that Belfast can continue to enjoy a proleration of emergency services, with not one but two Type  emergency departments on the scale of that at the Ulster Hospital, on its overdeveloped and cramped site, the Royal Victoria Hospital and the Mater, with the Type  unit at the Lagan Valley hospital, just seven miles from Belfast, a similar distance to that travelled by the people of Ardglass to the Downe hospital.Of course, Type  emergency departments are also to be found at Antrim and Craigavon, neither of which are far from Belfast and are linked by the best possible road infrastructure.Logically, it would seem, that the existence of two Type  units in Belfast is not sustainable, given the apparent massive pressure on services.We were told by the Department of Health at the time of the January  public meeting in Downpatrick Cricket Club that the purpose of that meeting was to enable local people to ldquofundamentally shape, inform and influence the criteria to be used to deliver services in the future.We hope that is still the case and await meaningful engagement with the community before change is implemented.The then deputy permanent secretary was quoted as having said that the then Minister would want to see ldquoongoing engagement in redesigning services. I am sure that the current Health Minister has the same views.The challenge for the Health Minister in the future must surely be to develop a fair and equitable distribution of services that would end discrimination against rural communities and ensure that all services, including ambulance services, are readily accessible to all of the people.It is worth remembering as well, that there was actually a .%in the attendances at emergency departments in Northern Ireland between December  and December . In the same period, attendances at the Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department rose signicantly.Decisions about change in the health service are political decisions. All of the major parties form the Northern Ireland Executive, which is collectively accountable for the program for government and all that it delivers or fails to deliver for the people.It is imperative that any attempt to change or restructure healthcare provision in Northern Ireland is done so in full consultation with the end users of the services, who are also the paymasters for it. This will be very dficult, as history has created a deep mistrust between substantial elements in our community and the Department of Health.Our community has suffered greatly from repeated cuts to services and the ruthless pursuit of a centralisation agenda a pursuit that has continued even in recent years when the NHS in England and Wales has been investing in and supporting smaller hospitals, recognising their crucial roles at the heart of local communities and using technological advances to support them.If it appears that Covid- is being used as a cover to implement long-standing Department of Health policy, then any changes would be resented by the community and in fact rejected by it. This would lead to an irreparable breach of trust between the people and the State.If an attempt is made to in any way reduce the services that are currently on offer at the Downe Hospital, this community, as it has done before, will rise up in righteous indignation.Twenty five thousand people took to the streets of Downpatrick in February . If our emergency department is not restored within a reasonable timescale mdash a matter of weeks mdash it is very likely that this area will see an unprecedented display of anger, with , plus people on the street, with legal challenges about any perceived abuse of process and a community-wide campaign, a cross-community campaign and political upheaval at the highest level of government.The people of East and South Down have had enough. They have reluctantly sacriced local services, as a temporary measure in the short term, but their resolve should not be underestimated.The people of Newcastle, Ballynahinch, Castlewellan, Ardglass, Killough, Clough, Downpatrick, Strangford, Crossgar, Lower Mourne and the vast surrounding rural hinterland need these services.Farmers, fishermen and builders need emergency care as much as ever, so too do the tourists who flock into our area every year and probably will do so in even greater numbers this year.It is time to restore the Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department and it is time to concentrate investment in local services, delivering for the people who need the services, where they need those services.The NHS must serve the people from ldquocradle to grave.

Beyond the boundary!Yet this domineering, almost bullying, approach belied one of Irish cricketrsquos truest gentlemen off it: soft-spoken, never a word that offended, never a word against him.In one of the most distinguished legacies to the local game, the late Downpatrick farmer captained the Ireland team before turning to administration in the roles of chairman and president of the Northern Cricket Union and president of the Irish Cricket Union.Yet it was where it mattered most, at the grassroots of the game, that Alfie left his indelible mark.His devotion to the Downpatrick club and its famous international ground The Meadow was boundless and le-long, from underage player to captain of the club, coach and ultimately chairman and president.He either played or captained Downpatrick in five NCU Senior League, three Senior Cup-winning sides and an Irish Senior Cup triumph along with his older brother Hugh, another talented batsman whose death at the age of  dealt a terrible blow to Alfie.In later years it was a source of great pride that Hughrsquos son, Paul, was to captain the club and daughter Anne played for Ireland.His wersquos nephew, James Cunningham, also captained the club.Alfiersquos hard-hitting ways over four decades from the s took him to  Irish appearances mdash six of them as captain mdash in the days when international caps were much less liberally awarded, and his contribution to the success of NCU representative cricket has rarely been equalled.Administration was an endless labour of love at local, provincial and national level. Such was his accommodating nature that he chaired countless committees ranging from solving an umpire shortage in the NCU to raising funds at ICU golf days.His contribution to his local community extended far beyond the boundaries of the cricket club.In his day he was a member of the NI Sports Council, a director of his local hospital trust and president of Ardglass Golf Club.Alfiersquos friends were legion, none more close than Cecil Walker, that leading light of the Lisburn club.Their playing days over, they travelled the world with their wives watching international cricket and storing delightful memories of new friendships, whether tales of the Bodyline era over tea with Harold Larwood at his home in Sydney, or a fond mention by David lsquoBumblersquo Lloyd from the commentary box.Of all thatrsquos been written down the years about Alfie Linehan, one game has been overlooked and yet it speaks more than any of his commitment to Downpatrick.It was Saturday, August , , and Downpatrick were due to play Lurgan. It was also the day of Alfiersquos wedding to his beloved Mary. No problem: wedding in the morning, cricket in the afternoon, reception in the evening, off on honeymoon the next day.Of all the tributes paid to Alfie none has been more signicant than that on BBC Televisionrsquos Sports Personality of the Year programme last December.He was included in the prestigious roll of honour of international sports personalities who had died during . The programme called them ldquospecial people.My own personal memory of Alfie will always be the toast he iniably delivered at the end of an eveningrsquos conviviality, of which there were many:ldquoMay you always walk in sunshineSlumber warm when night winds blowMay you always live with laughterFor a smile becomes you soThis article was first published on the CricketEurope website as part of a series paying tribute to those who have made signicant contributions to Irish cricket..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Traffic calming measures are needed at Castlewellan road  ","story":"TWO local Sinn Fein representatives have voiced their concern over speeding traffic on a Castlewellan road.MLA Emma Rogan and Cllr Roacuteisiacuten Howell say residents in the Burrenwood Road area have contacted them over the speed of some of the vehicles.However, they are both disappointed with the responsive their queries received from the Department of Infrastructure.Cllr Howell said that while the road met the criteria for traffic calming measures to be introduced and had been earmarked as a priority, the Department was unable to carry out the work at present.She remarked: ldquoWhile both myself and the local community welcome that Burrenwood Road has been recognised as a priority, it is extremely frustrating that due to an oversubscribed waiting list the work will not be carried out.ldquoItrsquos very annoying for us to hear the road now meets criteria but wonrsquot be completed due to it not sitting high enough on a waiting list.Cllr Howell added: ldquoThis is a disappointing response and I understand the frustration of residents.Ms Rogan said she would be contacting the Infrastructure minister to ascertain when the work will be carried out.She added: ldquoThe safety of pedestrians especially young children must be paramount..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Virtual meeting to support businesses affected by virus  ","story":"PLANS have been unveiled for a virtual meeting to help businesses across the district which have been severely hit by the coronavirus pandemic.South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Downpatrick councillor John Trainor are organising a so-called lsquotown hallrsquo event designed to offer solutions for business operations post Covid-.The event mdash which takes place next Wednesday evening on Zoom at pm ndash will feature expert advice from a number of leading figures from the business world.They include Glyn Roberts of Retail Northern Ireland and Colin Neill of Hospitality NI, who will be joined by Tourism NIrsquos chief executive, John McGrillen.Mr McGrath and Cllr Trainor want as many businesses as possible to join the June  video conference event and ask the questions that matter to them.The Assemblyman believes that itrsquos incumbent on politicians, Northern Ireland Executive ministers and MPs to fight for businesses and help develop strategies that will benefit them post-coronavirus.ldquoNext weekrsquos virtual meeting is deigned to provide these businesses with key advice so that when they all reopen, they will continue providing the first class service they have been offering, in some instances, for decades, said Mr McGrath.ldquoI have been working with our local council SDLP team in establishing a video conference call with expert figures from this sector.Mr McGrath said next weekrsquos event will outline his partyrsquos plans for how it will work with local business as everyone prepares to exit lockdown.He added: ldquoI would encourage as many businesses as possible to get in touch and wersquoll get you connected with this quickly evolving network of local business support and advice.Cllr Trainor said while the financial support offered by the NI Executive to many businesses to help them cope with the challenges of coronavirus was welcome, his party was keen to explore what would happen post Covid- and what support would be required.He added: As a result of the initial shock and upheaval caused by the pandemic, businesses have lost a great deal and some have had to shut up shop entirely.ldquoThere is much fear and concern over what will happen to the businesses that are still operating, in particular, those in the retail, hospitality and tourism sectors..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11488231.jpg","title":"relaxation restrictions announced","story":"Deputy First Minister Michelle OrsquoNeill said: ldquoToday we have been able to continue the forward momentum in our phased recovery plan.

We would need a period of reasonably wet weather before we would see a signicant change in the levels of most of our reservoirs.“There are a number of steps NI Water can take to alleviate the stress on reservoirs including a hosepipe ban.However, the key to conserving water is public action now.How we all use our water now will have a massive impact on our water levels during the summer months and on whether a hosepipe ban will be required.“For example, we know from the increase in our night usage some customers are leaving sprinklers and hoses on overnight we are appealing to them to stop.A sprinkler left on overnight is enough to meet the daily water needs of  families. We are also asking people to think before they use their pressure washer. Could the task be put off until we are out of this dry period  “However, the easiest way for everyone to save a little water and make a big dference is through normal household tasks.If each of us turned off the tap when brushing our teeth, in a month we would save enough water for the daily handwashing of  people.  “Similarly,you put a jug of water into the fridge rather than running the tap, those actions alone would save approximately  litres per day.This is enough to keep  people hydrated for a whole day! “We want everyone to enjoy their home and garden, we just need people to think about how they use their water andwhat they are doing is essential.If it is not essential we would really appeal to people not do it at the moment.”\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

We weren’t alone, with the BMA and nursing professional bodies concurring. We were denied sight of ‘the science’ until Imperial College’s research was leaked. This ideological, Darwinesque, anarchistic push from the libertarian-right set an unfortunate tone from which we should all guard. The botched ‘closure’ of schools in Northern Ireland, with + schools remaining open to receive, on average, just two, three or four children of key workers, was a reflection of local political dference. Far too many schools opened during lockdown and teachers could do little about this.NEU have contributed positively with the minister for education and the department to find ways forward. Our detailed -page discussion document “On ato Education in Northern Ireland” was widely praised as a positive pupil-centred contribution when presented publicly and to the Assembly Education Committee. Our teachers and educators have continued to work long hours, well beyond the constricts of their contracts. Teachers well understand that disadvantage is compounded for the most marginalised pupils during lockdown. With infection rates dropping, and the economy struggling, we all accept that calculated risks are required for some sort of normalisation to occur. Our recent meeting with the minister on th June was wholly constructive and collegiate.It is time to ‘dial-down’ the tone of the discourse and work together, positively, for a safeto schooling in mid to late August.Mark Langhammer, Regional Secretary, NEU, Northern Ireland ——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch

make face masks compulsory public transport","story":"Mark Drakeford said Englands decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel

decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel alternative.\" article_url   content_id

option to alleviate potential flood risk.More NewsVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldMillions become unpaid carers due to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become

including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen we consider the marginal

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

college pupils","story":"Head teachers say they were not consulted on the details of the scheme which will see the most disadvantaged children in England given access to funds to pay for tutors, while the majority of the funding will be shared across schools to help pupils from all backgrounds affected by the lockdown.College and nursery leaders have criticised the Government for leaving their pupils out after it announced that pound million would only be given to state primary and secondary schools for the - academic year.A further pound million will be spent on a one-year subsidised national tutoring programme targeted at the most disadvantaged pupils in schools.But sector leaders say the funding will not reach young children in nurseries and college students who are most ldquoin need of support amid the pandemic.It came as the UKrsquos chief medical officers agreed to downgrade the coronavirus alert level from four to three, after a ldquosteady and continuing decrease in cases in all four nations. vw,vw,px, px\"Localised outbreaks of Covid- are still ldquolikely to occur, the advisers warned, and the virus remains in general circulation.But the downgrading ndash recommended by the Joint Biosecurity Centrendash means transmission of coronavirus is no longer considered to be ldquohigh or rising exponentially.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said moving to a lower alert level was a ldquobig moment for the UK, and showed the country was getting ldquoback on her feet.On the school funding announcement, David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges , said it was ldquoindefensible to overlook the needs of students in tens of thousands of colleges across the country.Meanwhile, Purnima Tanuku, chief executive of National Day Nurseries Association , has accused the Government of failing young children ldquowho are most in need of support in their early development.David Laws, executive chair of the Education Policy Institutethink tank, added that the catch-up plan was ldquopoorly targeted and unlikely to prevent a large increase in the disadvantaged gap.The former Liberal Democrat minister added: ldquoWe are also concerned that there seems to be no extra financial support for early years or sixth form students ndash these phases are crucially important, yet they have suffered from persistent funding neglect over a sustained period of time.It came as schools minister Nick Gibb said it was the Governmentrsquos ldquoclear intention to have all children back in schools across England by September.Concerns have also been raised about the ability of some schools to pay towards the tutoring scheme amid funding pressures already facing schools. vw,vw,px, px\"Boris Johnson uses a sink in the playground to wash his hands during a visit

September, a full-timeto education means Government will have to find extra education staff and extra teaching spaces.ldquoThe Government must urgently engage with unions and others in the sector to plan for such a .Speaking on Sky News, Mr Gibb said the Government wants to ensure that no pupils face any long-term detriment to their education as a result of Covid-.He added: ldquoWe are working with the school sector, wersquore taking advice and we give schools plenty of notice in time to plan for that reopening in September.ldquoOf course, wersquore working on other contingency plans but the clear intention is that wersquoll have all children back in school in September.EPIs Executive Chair, David Laws, has commented on the Department for Educations \"catch up\" package announced today pic FwqVXVfGmdash EPIJune , Mr Gibb said the funding for schools will begin to be distributed from the start of the academic year ndash and head teachers will have the discretion to decide on how the catch-up funding is spent.In Northern Ireland, most pupils are set for ato education in the autumn after ministers agreed to cut the social distancing measure to one metre.But Mr Hancock, speaking at the daily Downing Street briefing on Thursday, said the same would not happen in England until the virus was ldquounder control.His comments came as the Government prepares to reveal the latest UK Covid- reproduction number ndash referred to as the R value ndash which will be used to guide ministers on whether further lockdown lting can take place. vw,vw,px, px\"Pubs and restaurants,

an Alliance councillor has said.By The NewsroomThursday, th June , : pm\"\"Cyclists.Alliance Party representative, Councillor Peter Lavery, called on Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council to take a more proactive role in local active travel and has asked that time be set aside during July’s meeting of Council’s planning committee to discuss the issue.“It has been great to see an increased number of people out cycling during the past few months,” said Cllr Lavery.“We as a public body need to be proactive and collaborate with experts to create ideas and put plans in place to harness this renewed enthusiasm for the long term.“Looking to the future, Alliance believes that government needs to rebalance funding away from roads and into more sustainable transportforms so that an increased number of transport choice are viable for residents.“This would include integrating public transport by creating links between the bus and rail network, car users and cyclists.”Noting recent announcements from the Department for Infrastructurerelating to cycle lanes and greenways, Cllr Lavery asked why this borough should not enjoy the same amenities.“The point also need to be made that when it comes to investment in projects like greenways and cycle lanes there is more to Northern Ireland than just Belfast and Derry,” he said.“Although I welcome investment in those cities, we in the ABC Council area are the second biggest in terms of population so we cannot be left behind.”A spokesperson for Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council said Council remains committed to active travel.“Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council is committed to active travel,” said the spokesperson.“Our Corporate plan outlines a number of short term outcomes to ensure, ‘There is understanding of and respect for the contribution of the built and natural environment and the role it plays in improving the health and vitality of urban and rural communities, their sense of place, character and identity’.“And, ‘Our physical and environmental assets are accessible. Everyone appreciates and takes responsibility for their protection, preservation and enhancement’.”The spokesperson continued: “In addition to a number of active travel projects already completed, the Council is continuing to develop and deliver initiativesto allow it to meet these objectives.“Active travel is a unique resource as a potential driver for economic regeneration and user well beingand the council is currently looking at ‘The One Path’ initiative in order to discuss and understand the issues people face when using shared paths and to collaboratively develop ways which help people to better share the space.“The Council is currently investigating the possibility of delivering a Landcare project in the Carn, Seagoe and Charlestown industrial areas of the Borough with the aim of developing the infrastructure around existing walking and cycling networks.“The Council fully understands the importance of implementing active travel within our infrastructure and is open to exploring all options to help benefit the lives of all who live, work and visit our Borough.”Adam Morton , Local Democracy Reporting Service\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1592493837675.jpg--health_minister_issues_shielding_advice.jpg?159249383700","title":"health minister issues shielding advice ","story":"Health Minister Robin Swann has announced plans to pause the shielding advice that was issued to people ahead of the Covid- peak in Northern Ireland. From  July, subject to the rate of community transmission continuing to be low, people will no longer need to shield and should instead follow the same guidance and precautions as those considered to be generally vulnerable. That involves taking particular care when out and about - and strictly maintaining social distancing.Letters will be issued in the coming days to all those covered by shielding informing them of the planned change.Mr Swann stated: “I have been clear that shielding would not last one minute longer than it needed to. We have now reached the point where,the current trends continue, there will be no need for anyone to shield after  July. “I have listened to many of you and to the challenges you have faced during this period. I am in no doubt as to the dficulties shielding has presented for a great many people.“It is unrealistic to think these dficulties will just vanish because the need to shield has ended. That is why the letters we issue will provide details of the support which will continue to be available up to and after  July.“While my announcement today will be welcome news for many who are shielding, some will view the prospect of an end to shielding with great anxiety. I want to assure them that they should decide what to do at their own pace. Everyone will approach this situation dferently.“As is so often the case at present, this will be about weighing up the options and making informed choices. Going outside can bring some degree of potential risk but this can be mitigated and minimised by strict social distancing. Staying indoors indefinitely is not good for anyone’s mental or physical health.“Finally, I would ask everyone to be considerate as people end their periods of shielding.We should all continue to social distance, but in the coming weeks I want you to be particularly understanding of the fact you might be encountering someone who has had to stay at home for many weeks. Please be aware of this, show respect and kindness to all and keep your distance.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bdeaefeeeced   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_addebfbcababc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
