The figures are in stark contrast to rates paid by Amazon which came in at just £14million on its 14 warehouses across England and Wales last year.           Debenhams posted a loss of almost £500million for the year and is planning to close up to 50 stores as a result          Debenham\u0027s financial results for the year are a far cry from the previous results when the firm posted a profit of £59millionThe Mail has been campaigning for an overhaul of business rates, with more than 50,000 jobs lost this year as shoppers increasingly buy online.

Sergio Bucher, Chief Executive of Debenham, has backed calls for lower business rates‘So when you are facing a tough market, having business rates that continuously go up is a clear headwind and we definitely need our Government to take action to establish a level playing field across the retail industry.’Mr Bucher added that action on business rates was crucial in securing the future of the struggling high street.I can’t pre-empt what the Chancellor is going to announce on Monday. The only thing that we are asking is to have a level playing field,’ he added. ‘What’s important to remember is that we need vibrant high streets because that helps the cohesion of communities and it keeps life inside our cities and town centres.’Andy Street, former managing director of John Lewis, added: ‘The Government must make sure there is a level playing field for our retailers on the High Street.

And because it\u0027s on a Monday, Philip Hammond will not speak until 3.30pm because parliamentary business gets off to a later start after the weekend.So will there be anything leftfield in the speech itself? Well even in the dullest Budgets there is usually something worth commenting on. Here we run down what might be in the 2018 fiscal statement:ECONOMY AND PUBLIC BORROWINGBritain\u0027s finances are in better shape than they have been since the 2008 crash. Official figures show Government borrowing below £40billion in 201718, having peaked at £153billion in 2009.And it emerged this week that the pressure could have eased on the Chancellor to raise taxes to fund Tory pledges on the NHS and ending austerity.Help, my £1m property is a Stamp Duty prison! On the eve of...Stamp duty and property slowdown blamed as number of homes...Have cash Isas become too complex? The amount of money...Share this articleWhat to expect in the Budget - and is a Labour government the real big tax threat? The This is Money podcastReports said that stronger than expected tax receipts mean that the Office for Budget Responsibility\u0027s forecasts for the public finances were set to reduce the deficit for 2018-19 by around £13billion - a massive revision.That could help the Chancellor avoid unpopular tax increases to pay for Theresa May\u0027s pledge earlier this year to raise an additional £20billion a year for the NHS in England by 2023.One of the many things that Brexit makes awkward is economic forecasting: the Office for Budget Responsibility has its work cut out there. For the record, the OBR\u0027s current forecasts are below.          Workers will be getting out their calculators if the Chancellor freezes income tax thresholds on Monday.Some £7billion worth of previously announced benefit cuts are still working their way through the system.There is a lot of pressure from Tory backbenchers for more generous funding of Universal Credit, including from the architect of the system Iain Duncan Smith.  Reversing cuts to the new benefit imposed by George Osborne in 2015 could cost anything between £2-£5billion.Any serious change to the rollout, or the generosity of the benefit, would be politically embarrassing after Mr Hammond\u0027s resolute defence of the scheme. VAT, SIN TAXES AND INSURANCE PREMIUM TAXIt is tempting for Chancellors to increase the tax on insurance because no one really takes much notice. And they have done: the Government has been raising the rate on Insurance Premium Tax in recent years. In 2011 it was just six per cent, but in 2015 was pushed up to 9.5 per cent, 10 per cent in 2016 and 12 per cent in June this year. Last year it raised £6.1billion from IPT - more than inheritance tax.          Duties on tobacco and alcohol are likely to rise although MPs have called for a freeze on beer duty to protect pubs.Reports say the Chancellor is examining controversial proposals to drag hundreds of thousands of firms into the VAT system. At present, traders only have to charge VAT if their turnover tops £85,000 a year.Halving the threshold to £43,000 – the level said to be favoured by the Chancellor – would affect half a million small firms and raise up to £1.5billion for the Treasury in extra VAT receipts.Cutting the rate to £25,000 could yield up to £2billion, but would drag 1.5million small traders into the VAT system. Similar plans were abandoned in the run-up to last year\u0027s Budget following warnings they would be politically toxic.One report has speculated that Mr Hammond could impose VAT on private school fees for the first time in a £1.5billion grab. Private schools do not currently charge the 20 per cent levy on the thousands of pounds a year they net in fees because they are set up as charities.Duties on tobacco and alcohol are likely to rise although MPs have called for a freeze on beer duty to protect pubs. FUEL DUTYDespite speculation this summer that Mr Hammond was set to lift the cap on vehicle excise duty, Theresa May has promised that VED will be frozen for the ninth year in a row. The Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank estimates that the policy costs the Treasury around £9billion a year.          Estate agents say homeowners aren\u0027t trading up for larger properties because of punitive stamp duty rates on more expensive homes.STAMP DUTY \u0026amp HOUSINGMr Hammond scrapped stamp duty for first-time buyers last year to help people get on the property ladder.But estate agents say homeowners aren\u0027t trading up for larger properties because of punitive stamp duty rates on more expensive homes - which is restricting the supply of smaller homes for first-timers and generally gumming up the property market.So there\u0027s a  chance he could do something again with the stamp duty rates higher up the ladder - it would be eye-catching and probably not that expensive.Other possibilities include \u0027help to sell\u0027: giving landlords tax incentives to sell to their tenants.PENSIONSAccording to the Treasury, tax relief costs the Government £39billion a year - a cost that some now believe is excessive. Hammond has described pensions tax breaks as \u0027eye-wateringly expensive\u0027.Mr Hammond could either cut rates of relief - which correspond to the higher rate at which the saver pays income tax - or the annual allowance, i.e., the amount one can save each year tax free. Or some combination of both.

Another wrestler, Daniel Bryan, was also reportedly backing out of the event.Saudi officials had been denying any involvement when Khashoggi initially disappeared on October 2 after entering the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul.

According to a story in The Guardian, it told Ipso that several papers had misrepresented the event which the Labour leader attended.Last night a spokesman for the Labour Party said: \u0027Our view remains that the reporting we complained about seriously misrepresented the nature of what took place, those buried in the cemetery and the mainstream Palestinian leaders conducting the ceremony, and these inaccuracies breached the Ipso code.\u0027Regrettably, confidential communication with Ipso was leaked and it was unable to trace the source or assure us it would not recur, and we considered that the complaints process was unacceptably compromised.

The figures are in stark contrast to rates paid by Amazon which came in at just £14million on its 14 warehouses across England and Wales last year.           Debenhams posted a loss of almost £500million for the year and is planning to close up to 50 stores as a result          Debenham\u0027s financial results for the year are a far cry from the previous results when the firm posted a profit of £59millionThe Mail has been campaigning for an overhaul of business rates, with more than 50,000 jobs lost this year as shoppers increasingly buy online.

Sergio Bucher, Chief Executive of Debenham, has backed calls for lower business rates‘So when you are facing a tough market, having business rates that continuously go up is a clear headwind and we definitely need our Government to take action to establish a level playing field across the retail industry.’Mr Bucher added that action on business rates was crucial in securing the future of the struggling high street.I can’t pre-empt what the Chancellor is going to announce on Monday. The only thing that we are asking is to have a level playing field,’ he added. ‘What’s important to remember is that we need vibrant high streets because that helps the cohesion of communities and it keeps life inside our cities and town centres.’Andy Street, former managing director of John Lewis, added: ‘The Government must make sure there is a level playing field for our retailers on the High Street.          West Midlands Mayor Andy Street formely ran succesful department store chain, John Lewis‘Online and offline retailers must be treated equally when it comes to corporation tax, and the Government should act to make business rates fit for the 21st century.’The £492million loss at Debenhams follows three profit warnings this year. The company has now seen its stock market value plummet from £1.5billion to £91.7million in six years.

She tells us about her meditative approach and why ‘thinking too much is boring’A translucent bubble floats in the air next to a picture of a baby’s head cradled tenderly in an adult’s arms. Nearby, among an arrangement of similarly intimate images, an infant’s tiny hand is gently enfolded in an elderly grandparent’s grasp. On a single wall in the National Portrait Gallery, amid the contrasting styles and subject matter of the 2018 Taylor Wessing portrait prize, Rinko Kawauchi’s vivid images of four generations of her family create a quietly intense space in which to pause and ponder the beauty and fragility of the everyday.Recently, that sense of life’s frailty has become more acute for Kawauchi following the birth of her daughter, whose first few years have been captured in characteristically hypnotic images. Since Kawauchi’s arrival on the art scene in 2001 with the simultaneous publication of three photobooks, Utatane (“Catnap”), Hanabi (“Fireworks”) and Hanako (a Japanese girl’s name), her family have featured in her work alongside often breathtakingly beautiful photographs of the natural world – insects, rainbows, clouds, butterflies and, of late, sacred rituals and ancient sites in her native Japan. She is an artist of the quotidian sublime, creating a world in which the tiniest details – a slice of watermelon on a plate, a bird’s egg cracking open – are imbued with meaning as part of the greater whole, the great interconnectedness.The images on show at the NPG are a continuation of an ongoing project that began with her 2005 book, Cui Cui, which comprised photographs of extended family taken over the previous 15 years. In that time, she witnessed the death of her grandfather and the birth of her nephew. It is not, though, she insists, a work of “personal disclosure” – rather a visual contemplation of the cycle of life in all its sadness and wonder.She is, she tells me in her faltering but often poetic English, “in sympathy with small things in the bigness of nature”. Her approach is patient, deeply attentive, akin to a kind of heightened meditation. “It’s about finding a certain space of mind, if that makes sense. When I am shooting, I am following my intuition without thinking. Thinking too much is boring, not good. It stops the surprising from coming through. When a picture happens, I just say ‘thank you’ and move on. It is only afterwards that I become an editor and impose the meaning on the work.”In person, the diminutive Kawauchi is quietly spoken and self-contained one senses that her work is an extension of her self. It is difficult to imagine her operating in the combative world of commercial advertising photography, which she did for several years after graduating from college in the early 1990s. She cites the American master of the everyday William Eggleston as a formative influence, alongside the younger Japanese photographer Takashi Homma. Her early images, which often seemed like deftly composed snapshots, were bathed in natural light and washed with bright colour tones that added to their almost dreamlike quality.In 2004, Martin Parr gave her two gallery spaces when he guest-curated Les Rencontres d’Arles, and in 2006 she had a solo show at the Photographer’s Gallery in London. Back then, I noted that her work “might initially appear to approach the deadpan detachment that characterises so much contemporary art-photography, but on closer inspection there is always some glimmer of hope and humanity, some sense of wonder at work in the rendering of the intimate and fragile.” That remains the case, but, of late, her vision has widened and deepened. In 2013, her series Ametsuchi announced a departure of sorts. Using a large format camera mounted on a tripod, she shot from a distance, creating panoramas of the stark, elemental, volcanic terrain around Japan’s Mount Aso, a sacred site for Shinto pilgrims who gather there to perform often spectacular fire rituals.Last year, Halo continued her exploration of these bigger themes. In rural Japan and China, she photographed other religious fire rituals and the vast constellations above. On England’s south-east coast, she captured the wondrous natural spectacle that is the murmuration of starlings. The private and the everyday had suddenly given way to the celestial elemental, the tranquil to the spectacular. And yet, they remained Rinko Kawauchi photographs: striking, luminous, poetic.“Halo is really about the relationship between nature and the manmade,” she says, “There is something about time passing in all the work and, with Halo, it is about a practice that is unchanging for hundreds of years while the world changes around it.”Her work is changing in other ways, too. When she began making work, Kawauchi gravitated towards the photobook as the perfect medium for her closely observed images of the world around her. Now, she is intrigued with the possibilities of the moving image. To this end, in 2015 she created an installation in a gallery in Shinjuku of video works mounted on 30 monitors, her images, both intimate and elemental, unfolding to an ambient soundtrack of natural noises – wind, insects – and “music created on real instruments”.I ask her, in conclusion, if being a mother has changed her approach to her work. She thinks for a long moment. “I would say yes, but not in the expected way. In my personal life, it has been amazing of course as a photographer, I am not so sure. When I feel happy, I see no reason to make work, but sometimes there is this hunger to make work. So, it is complicated. I need this hungry spirit and the calm. I need the balance to find the story inside me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69e42de58301d99a1bbd1b27d4eaa1f9ee8cef33/0_2_980_588/master/980.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a874991bdf030c7e8117bd0236ddf83c","title":"students persuade jeff koons to stage rare uk museum show","story":"US artist to stage Ashmolean show after accepting award from Oxford University societyJeff Koons, one of the superstars of the contemporary art world, is to get a rare UK museum show and it is largely thanks not to curators, but the Edgar Wind Society for Art History.The Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, the world’s oldest public museum, announced on Friday that it would stage a major Koons show in 2019 displaying works, most of which have never been seen in the UK.Alexander Sturgis, the museum’s director, said it was students who enticed the American artist. Sturgis said the university’s Edgar Wind Society decided to set up a contemporary art prize and the first winner was Koons, so they invited him to Oxford.“In an entirely typical way Jeff got on a plane, flew to Oxford for the day, accepted the prize, spoke to the students, was incredibly giving of his time and incredibly gracious in every respect and then flew back to New York that same night,” said Sturgis.From that, plans have emerged for a mini-retrospective of Koons’s career featuring some of his best-known works.Sturgis said Koons pushed hard at the boundaries of what an artist was or could be. “It is hard to think of any other artist of the last 50 years who has such a significant and influential place in how we think about what art is today.”His works, whether giant shiny casts of balloon animals or repainted masterpieces with the addition of a blue bauble, attract strong opinions. He is seen by some as an example of everything bad about contemporary art by others as everything good. At auction his works attract some of the highest prices in the world.A retrospective of his work was held at the Whitney Museum in New York in 2014, which toured to Paris and Bilbao. But UK public galleries have been more reticent about staging Koons’s shows with one of the few being held at the Serpentine in London in 2009.Sturgis said artists such as Koons, with his huge commercial success, were sometimes viewed with a degree of suspicion. “It seems absurd to suggest that a Jeff Koons show is a risk, but I think there is a degree of establishment anxiety about the place that he holds in the art world.”The Oxford show will be curated by Norman Rosenthal and will feature 17 works, 14 of them being exhibited in the UK for the first time. They will include Seated Ballerina, a 2-metre high mirror-polished stainless sculpture and the 2.6-metre high Balloon Venus (Magenta).• Jeff Koons at the Ashmolean runs from 7 February to 9 June 2019"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afe52592842efe1611eae994268b706ade56bcf2/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d509e3464e299dfd7b2a87b6a93bb58","title":"life on the tiny island of migingo in pictures","story":"A rounded rocky outcrop covered in metal shacks, Migingo Island rises out of the waters of Lake Victoria like an iron-plated turtle.

The right soundtrack has the power to transform even a burger and chips into a fine-dining experience, at least according to research by Cornell University. Why? Because the music makes us eat more mindfully and even perceive our food more favourably.“Dinner parties are essentially about communication and the mingling of several different conversations, so you want background music that’s sophisticated enough to spark conversation, then melt away rather than competing with your chat,” says composer Oliver Davis, whose 2018 album Liberty recently topped the iTunes classical charts. So what music works best with different dishes? We spoke to a range of experts – from restaurateurs to party planners and composers to find out.Soundtrack for starters“I put as much thought and care into the music I play at a dinner party as I do into my cooking,” says restaurateur Asma Khan of the Darjeeling Express in Soho, London.Her favourite starter is a mutton shikampuri kebab, a recipe from the Royal Kitchens of Hyderabad. “It has a uniquely layered shah-jeera flavour,” she says. “You think it’s mild at first, then the cardamom and cumin spice blend hits you. Most people don’t recognise all the flavours, but this starter never fails to impress.”While guests dig in, Khan plays the classical Indian Sufi song Maula-e-Kull, sung by Abdida Parveen. “It has a very deep rhythm,” she says. “You don’t need to understand the words to feel the emotion in the voice of the singer: it starts off with the love between two people, then becomes deeply complex. Both the song and the starter have this incredible hidden layering, and together they set a rich, serene tone for your evening.”Your musical main“The right music helps the conversation flow, which is particularly important when your guests are meeting for the first time,” says Alice Matthews, founder of MotherHustler supper clubs.“I love the classical guitar interpretation of Johann Sebastian Bach’s Air on a G String, by Richard Mollenbeck,” she says. Like the vegetarian tagine she serves her guests, the music is about different interpretations of a classic, melodiously coming together to create something new. “I’ve discovered guests relax and enjoy themselves more when eating familiar food and listening to familiar music, but in a heightened, luxurious atmosphere,” she says.Sweet symphony“I love to cook with seasonal, locally sourced ingredients, and my taste in music reflects that too,” says Henrietta Inman, author of The Natural Baker: A new way to bake using the best natural ingredients.“For a dinner party I’ll make my plum, blackberry and blueberry crumble, served with a rosemary and lemon syrup. The topping is crunchy and decadent, made with wholegrain spelt, oats and almonds.” And the perfect accompaniment? The Lark Ascending by Vaughan Williams, says Inman.“It’s a beautifully tranquil piece by an English composer and it brings to mind a dusky evening eating outdoors, with birds singing in the hedgerows and trees hanging heavy with ripe fruit,” she says.The tune for cheese“The cheese course comes at a perfect moment to steer conversation into another direction,” says La Fromagerie’s Patricia Michelson, author of Cheese.She recommends presenting a five-strong board with Sinodun Hill, a nutty goat’s cheese the creamy, sweet and aromatic Beaufort Chalet D’Alpage Lincolnshire Poacher Double Barrel, a hard cheese with a distinctive savoury acidity from the chalky soil where the cattle graze a decadent Brie aux Truffes and Regalis, a ewe’s milk blue that combines sharp mineral qualities with a rich, floral taste.On the playlist is a classical composition with a jazz vibe, such as the Jacques Loussier Trio playing Bach. “It’s reflective and stimulating but soft and flowing, and these are words I often use when describing cheese too,” says Michelson.The finale Just as a digestif serves to calm the mood at the end of the meal, music plays a similar role. “One of the wonderful things about music is it fills in any awkward silence at the end of your dinner party, when everyone’s said an awful lot,” says Davis.“I love an Amaretto, but I wouldn’t be as didactic as to suggest that a sweet liqueur goes with sweet music,” he says. “Go for something cosy that welcomes guests into your own personal comfort zone.”For that, try downloading Rêverie Nocturne by Giulio Regondi or Liberty by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.Waitrose \u0026amp Partners know that food and music are the perfect pairing.

His consort song for five voices and five viols is effectively an early 17th-century rendering of the sounds of Cockney stallholders advertising everything from “lilywhite mussels and new fresh herrings” to “roasted sausage, hot puddings, fresh cheese and cream, and ripe strawberries”. It may well have been inspired by Clément Jannequin’s Voulez ouyr les cris de Paris – similarly including the everyday sounds of a Renaissance French street market.While today there are a few restaurants in which music students will entertain you with arias between courses, in centuries past musical accompaniment to dining was a common phenomenon. The concept only became formalised in the 18th century and the best-known collection of such work is Telemann’s Tafelmusik, (Table Music). Published in 1733, it is a traditional set of suites to be played by a small group of string players at banquets.A musical work inspired by food, which became a popular sensation following its 1898 London premiere, is Hiawatha’s Wedding Feast by Samuel Coleridge-Taylor. The cantata for tenor, mixed chorus and orchestra sets part of Longfellow’s epic poem, delighting in the lush and sensual choral description of the sumptuous menu: “First they ate the sturgeon … and the pike … then on pemmican they feasted … and buffalo marrow, haunch of deer and hump of bison, yellow cakes of the Mondamin, and the wild rice of the river.”Belshazzar’s Feast (1931) depicts another impressive meal, this time a lavish banquet thrown by the hedonistic and hubristic Babylonian king. In the biblical cantata by William Walton, apart from generous libations of wine drunk from sacred goblets looted from the Temple of Jerusalem, Osbert Sitwell’s libretto does not tell us what was on the menu. However, a clue is given in a description of the city’s resources for such a meal: “fine flour, wheat, beasts and sheep”, which we might conclude, like the score, was lavish.On a smaller scale, Erich Korngold’s Die Gansleber im Hause Duschnitz, (The Goose-liver in the Duschnitz House) is a song written spontaneously by the Austrian composer following a meal in 1919, thanking his Viennese hosts by honouring their delicious main course, with his lyrics declaring: “Because a goose liver like this is a wondrous thing … when it’s browned, when it’s crisp and crackly …”In a rare instance of music from the perspective of the food itself, there is Olim lacus Colueram. Known as the Song of the Roasting Swan, the exquisite aria for tenor and chorus comes from the pseudo-medieval secular cantata Carmina Burana (1936) in which composer Carl Orff manages to create a sense of dizzying musical rotation as the roasting bird delivers its, er, swansong, with the tenor singing at the top of his range in sympathetic anguish.Turning to something more sugary, Hansel and Gretel, Engelbert Humperdinck’s 1893 operatic retelling of the Grimm fairy tale, features a gingerbread house covered in sweets. Tchaikovsky’s festive ballet The Nutcracker (1892) is also filled with confectionary, in which, following mice eating gingerbread soldiers, young Clara and her prince are whisked off to the Land of Sweets, which is ruled by the Sugar Plum Fairy, an otherworldly character represented by a brand-new twinkling keyboard instrument, the celesta.Then there are cookbooks set to music. La Bonne Cuisine (1947) was inspired by Emile Dumont’s culinary guide. From it the American composer Leonard Bernstein arranged four recipes for mezzo-soprano and piano. The gastronomic delicacies are Plum Pudding, Ox-Tails, Turkish Delight and Rabbit at Top Speed – the last well-named, as the entire song-cycle is under five minutes. Three years later with Ode à la Gastronomie (1950), composer Jean Françaix showed that the French can also have a sense of humour when it comes to food. His lighthearted satire punctures the pretentious solemnity of Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin’s 1825 tome La Physiologie du gout, offering a both comic and exquisite paean to the sensual pleasures of eating, setting the gastronomic ruminations as a choral work for 13 a capella singers.Eating, of course, provides a backdrop for dramatic action and consequently it often crops up in opera. A great example is Giacomo Puccini’s La Bohème, which migrates from a cold and empty flat in Montmartre to the local Cafe Momus. There, among the riot of life, street vendors shout their wares: “Oranges, dates, hot chestnuts, trinkets, crosses, nougat, whipped cream, fruit pies, toffees, finches, sparrows, dates, coconut milk, carrots, trout and plums.” The friends enter the bistro and order sausage, roast venison, table wine, dressed lobster, creme caramel and chicken, before leaving the bill for hapless sugar daddy Alcindoro.Finally, there is food inspired by classical musicians. French modernist Erik Satie ate only white foods, so for more mouthwatering invocations one must look to the Italians and dishes created in their honour. Neapolitan tenor Enrico Caruso had a sauce named after him by Uruguayan chef Raymundo Monti. Salsa Caruso is a warm sauce for pasta consisting of cream, onions, ham, cheese, nuts and mushrooms. Meanwhile, Tournedos Rossini is a steak dish created by French chef Marie-Antoine Carême in collaboration with the famously food-loving composer. It consists of beef tournedos pan-fried in butter, served on a crouton, topped with hot slice of foie gras, garnished with black truffle and Madeira demi-glace sauce.And for afters? How about peach melba, the famous dessert of peaches and raspberry sauce with vanilla ice-cream, created in 1892 by French chef Auguste Escoffier at London’s Savoy Hotel for the Australian soprano Dame Nellie. Quite a final movement, that is.Waitrose \u0026amp Partners know that food and music are the perfect pairing. Feeling inspired to cook your own masterpiece tonight?

There Mary meets a kindly woman who guides her as the train speeds through dark tunnels and a bleak autumnal landscape.In one of the corn fields a scarecrow caught her eye, crossed staves propped aslant, and the corn husks rotting under it. The dark ragged coat wavered in the wind, empty, without substance. And below the ridiculous figure black crows were strutting to and fro, pecking for grains in the dry ground.At the station for the sixth kingdom, a conductor dressed in black escorts a pale woman off the train, despite her protests. Mary is relieved that the other passengers seem content, but their bland indifference about their final destination fills her companion with horror: “They won’t care until the time comes, in the ninth kingdom.”Plath wrote the story in December 1952, while she was in her third year as a scholarship student at Smith College – an exciting but troubling time for Plath, according to the biographer Andrew Wilson, whose account of Plath’s early years, Mad Girl’s Love Song, was published in 2013.“She was under a great deal of pressure, a lot of it self-inflicted,” Wilson said of this period. “She was incredibly competitive and she had always been used to being the best. Now she was surrounded by young women who were as talented as her, if not more so. She had to top up her income and so peeled potatoes and chopped vegetables in the college kitchen, and she also earned a sizeable amount of money from writing poems and stories.”“Many of Plath’s early stories have their roots in her own life and deal with situations she herself had experienced,” Wilson added. “But this story stands out because of its daring metaphysical aspect.”Steinberg, who co-edited a collection of Plath’s letters that was completed last month, agreed that Mary Ventura and the Ninth Kingdom “stands out on its own”.“I think Plath here is attempting to feminise and modify some biblical stories, as well as Dante’s Divine Comedy, by having Mary Ventura enact a journey by modern transport into the underworld,” Steinberg said. “Mary in the end is presented with an opportunity to release herself from a fate she did not choose.”As a writer who was “deeply attuned to colour” from an early age, he continued, it’s no surprise the story’s details are awash in red. “She loved the colour through her life and so it’s no surprise to me to see it used so vividly and expertly in the story.”For Wilson, Plath was not only conscious of mixing with women from more privileged backgrounds, she was also “anxious about her future. Would she be able to combine the role of a wife and mother with that of a writer? She was hugely ambitious, but often felt frustrated by the society in which she lived. She was angry about so many things – and quite rightly so.”The literary critic Sarah Churchwell cautioned against a narrowly biographical reading of the story, arguing that it is much more interesting as a story about the assertion of female agency, “not least because Plath works so hard to strip realistic social detail from it. She wants it to be read in archetypal terms, quite clearly: this is a story about women breaking out, being unconventional, and whether mothers will help young women do so, or whether they will acquiesce to patriarchal expectations and tell their daughters to repress their true selves.”The story anticipates themes Plath returned to in her only novel The Bell Jar, Churchwell continued, which explores how “trying to be the ‘right’ kind of woman was soul-destroying. It’s also a book about hating your mother for trying to get you to comply. I would say this story also anticipates Plath’s use of mythical motifs and structures to suggest the universal aspect of women’s struggle with their mothers, and to suggest that is just as archetypal as men’s struggles with their fathers: this idea runs through both her poetry and her fiction.”After graduating from Smith in 1955, Plath carried on writing both short fiction and poetry until her death in 1963. But it was only with the posthumous publication of her collection Ariel in 1965 that she was established as one of the 20th century’s most important poets.It’s difficult to read about the opportunity for escape offered by the train’s emergency cord without thinking of another thread running through Plath’s life. According to Steinberg, by the time she submitted the story for Mademoiselle magazine in early 1953, suicide was already on her mind.Steinberg explained that at the time of writing she was “dealing with a difficult relationship with a boyfriend, had a broken leg and was really starting to feel the strain of her courses, social life, financial issues, and an always-on-the-go lifestyle so that yes, I do think suicide was something she considered. But also, and kind of opposite, at this point she was in many ways rather far from taking that kind of action.”While the story is “really very good” for a 20-year-old, Churchwell said, it’s unsurprising Mademoiselle turned it down: “The story’s symbolic-allegorical approach wasn’t really their style.”Despite the resonances with Plath’s suicide and the difficult questions of forging an authentic self in the consumer world that resound both through the story and the rest of her work, Wilson detects an optimistic note.“There is a possibility of spiritual rebirth, of comfort, of escape, of freedom,” he said, “a welcome balance in the Plath narrative which is often dominated by tales of her difficult marriage to Ted Hughes, his infidelity and her suicide”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d15f9a410a13b56a58bddbfefd654a7db9e6fcfd/0_275_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89dea75505faef782aad0f18d6c263b7","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of themWelcome to this week’s blog. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.First up, EstelleMoon, who has had a disappointingly fulfilling experience:Well, as much as I’d like to say I’ve been reading something esoteric and obscure, no, I’ve been reading something incredibly popular. And as much as I’d like to say that the popular thing is overrated and bad, no, in fact, it turns out it’s incredibly popular and incredibly good.I’m talking about Elena Ferrante. I finished My Brilliant Friend a couple of days ago, and I’m now about 100 pages into Volume 2 of her Neapolitan Quartet, The Story of a New Name. They’re so vivid and rich when it comes to detailing this beautiful, frustrating and profound friendship between Elena and Lila, full of love, full of competition, full of resentment, full of life. But they’re also a portrait of a community, of a country coming from fascism, they’re about the urge to break away from the stifling world you grew up in, they’re about masculinity, about family, about politics and so much more – but all these heady themes emerge in the best way possible – ie, organically, through the story and the lives of Elena and Lila.Oh well. Elsewhere, julian6 has enjoyed Mario Vargas Llosa’s early book, The Time of the Hero:This account of the daily struggles and cruelties at a military academy in Peru has sharply etched characters and wonderfully economical descriptive work. Llosa plays with time sequences throughout, moving back and forth, slowly drawing out the painful life journeys of his characters. It is clear-eyed, unsentimental and unfailingly honest, showing its vulnerable, petty, vindictive but not entirely irredeemable protagonists in a raw uncompromising light. The translation brought out the fluency of phrasing, the choice vocabulary. These narrators - for there are many viewpoints in this work, as well as third person - know their world intimately. I was drawn in from the beginning. The sympathy that emerged was never pleaded for or crudely awakened. There is nothing cheap in Llosa’s vision - it is a naked portrayal of diminished lives caught in an unforgiving web of poverty, prejudice and pitiless power structures.A second reading of Life and Fate by Vasily Grossman has impressed Ieuan:Very similar to War and Peace (which was its inspiration – and of similar length and complexity). The manuscript was confiscated by the KGB upon writing and Grossman was told it couldn’t be published for ‘at least 200 years’. A copy was smuggled to the west in the 1980s and published here. It was hailed a masterpiece and (IMHO), it is.The Power by Naomi Alderman gets a nod from koelner:I just finished reading and it absolutely blew me away. I didn’t necessarily agree with how things developed (ie that it would really work out like that if it happened in real life) but it was just so clever, especially the letters between authors at the end. I finished it and immediately had the urge to write an essay on it like back when I was in school. I mean, I didn’t, but there was just so much to think about and comment on and discuss. It really fired my imagination. It would be such a good book to study at school. Really enjoyed it.Meanwhile, The Power and the Glory by Graham Greene has worked for scoopster35:Greene puts you exactly in his world – peasant Mexico, in this case – with no fuss, no flowery prose, just hard, clear, vivid writing.RedmonT recommends The End of Vandalism by Tom Drury:It’s hilarious. Rare indeed that I laugh out loud from a book but I have done several times already. There’s something tragic about it, too.Here’s paulburns on Richard Flanagan’s Death of a River Guide:During an expedition down the Franklin River in northwest Tasmania, Aljaz Cosini, the expedition’s guide, drowns in an attempt to rescue a punter who has fallen into the raging rapids. As he drowns he recalls not only his own life, but the lives of several generations of his relatives, one of whom is a Tasmanian Aborigine. (For those who don’t know, Tasmanian Aborigines are a different type of indigenous people to the mainland Indigenous Australians), and another a convict, whose relatives are ashamed of the ‘convict stain’. At the same time, Flanagan writes in detail and lovingly of travelling down the Franklin River (not the safest thing in the world to do) in a journey beset by tragedy. This is a fine, beautifully written book.I am reading Harry Potter again, this time with my grandson. He is the same age his mum was when the first book was published,when we found it in the library, well before it became A Thing. He pleads for another chapter each time we finish one. ‘You can read this yourself,’ I said. ‘Yes, but it’s funner having you read it so I can imagine it in my head’ he said.

But certainly at liberty to leave the frying pan for the next blazing inferno. The prime minister has survived talk of a leadership challenge in much the way she usually does, which is less by pulling off some dramatic intervention (for all the talk of her “emotional and personal” address to the 1922 Committee, MPs coming out of it didn’t seem able to recall a single memorable line) than by letting them have a good hard think about the alternative.People will tolerate a surprising amount when all the other options look dreadful, which is fast becoming the guiding principle of May’s government. But while her modus operandi of grinding opponents down into a state of weary resignation still works reasonably well within her own party, it won’t help with her next challenge, which is delivering on a promise earlier this month to end austerity. Here is the real litmus test of what the Tories actually learned from their 2017 election disaster, and whether they’re capable of doing anything with that knowledge.May’s speech to the party conference already feels like a lifetime (and several leadership crises) ago, easy to forget in all the ensuing melodrama. But on Monday her chancellor must deliver a budget that will now be judged almost solely on whether it fulfils that conference promise – or it will if Labour has anything to do with it, which is why the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, is so eager to offer his own definition of what ending austerity really means.Say the A-word, and most people probably think about food banks and rough sleepers, headteachers sending home begging letters asking for cash, or the home affairs select committee saying that underfunded police forces risk becoming almost an “irrelevance” in some areas.Its meaning is now as much emotional as technical, shorthand for a general feeling of things coming apart at the seams – some of which genuinely is due to budget cuts and some of which has more to do with bad decisions. Universal credit has quite understandably come to symbolise everything that’s gone wrong in the past eight years, and it was austerity that carved billions out of Iain Duncan Smith’s original plan to simplify the benefits system, turning it into a cover for smuggling through welfare cuts. But it is the delays and errors and clumsy assumptions built into the system that so often push people into debt in the first place, which means sorting out the mess probably requires both cash and a rethink of how it operates.And what most people expect from the words “ending austerity” goes well beyond the strict economic definition of easing off from cutting the deficit. It’s a general feeling that the sun might finally be coming out again that their own lives are getting easier that they no longer see so many sleeping bags in high street doorways perhaps even that the government accepts it might have gone too far and is genuinely ready to change tack. For without the latter, Hammond could end austerity in the strict economic sense yet barely touch the sides of the political disaffection it’s caused. A technocrat’s budget that grudgingly keeps to the letter, but not what voters surely hoped would be the spirit, of May’s promise would be almost worse than no promise at all.It goes almost without saying that if the Brexit talks collapse, then all Hammond’s efforts are for the birds no chancellor can conjure up a cheery feelgood mood while sick people are stockpiling medicines for fear of running out, or civil servants are talking of chartering ships to bring food aid to Britain. But in the near-miraculous event that Brexit doesn’t go horribly wrong, and even assuming that revised forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility give him a bit of room for generosity, the Tories still have a reckoning with the electorate ahead.For the overriding impression left by that party conference was that most Tories still don’t get exactly why they so nearly lost the last election. Fringe meetings were jam-packed with grassroots members earnestly trying to understand why young people seemingly don’t want to vote for them. But even among those who grasped the peculiar meaning of “young” in this electoral context (not so much Generation Z as people in their 30s and early 40s, with jobs and kids and often mortgages, living in marginal seats) there’s often a curious blind spot.It’s comforting for Tories to blame their unpopularity on the fact that fewer people are becoming homeowners, since that fits with a very conservative idea about the virtues of living in a property-owning democracy. But as important as housing is, it’s very far from being the only problem (school funding cuts are right up there for many of May’s target voters) and it’s not what has retoxified the brand. The damage done not just to their own life prospects but to the social fabric over the past eight years is surely a large part of what has made voting Conservative toxic by association for so many.May hinted rather opaquely at that in her conference speech, saying that the process of getting the deficit down had been “painful”. But if she wants those millennial swing voters back now, she’s arguably going to have to do more than ease off on austerity and hope they obligingly forget it ever happened. She’s going to have to apologise for it, or at the very least acknowledge the damage done, if she genuinely wants people to think it’s over. And in that sense, this budget isn’t really the end of austerity. It’s barely even the end of the beginning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/876a42772a28d50d1dffc588f0017e2dc71e8bb7/0_107_1640_984/master/1640.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ca27dd4d12f3d66f37d62305214652d","title":"gradgrind ethos school exams special educational needs","story":"There was a boy in my rural primary school who we used to tease as the village idiot. He was popular though, and we fiercely defended him if anyone bullied him. Our two teachers worked hard to fit him into the school and thus the community, and in this they succeeded. I think he was a happy boy. Yet today that school would risk penalties for lowering its test score and accommodating him would damage, not enhance, its reputation. That is the absurd situation in which our schools find themselves.Recent revelations that pupils with special needs are being excluded to improve school performance can be put down to one thing: an obsession with testing. Since public league tables were introduced by John Patten in 1992, they have defined English education. First it was just A-levels, then GCSEs, then Sats, as the cry went out to measure everything.Ministers of both main parties have become obsessed with the OECD’s Pisa tests, a crude way of comparing the incomparable. Under Michael Gove, English schools were to be benchmarked against Chinese ones. Under Nicky Morgan, tougher tests were demanded for six- and seven-year-olds. These were “essential to make British pupils more competitive with students abroad”. Education was treated as a branch of the Olympics.In an attempt to make the important measurable, we have instead made the measurable important. This month we have a first straw in what, it must be hoped, is a wind of change. Ofsted’s boss, Amanda Spielman, has criticised schools “where too much time is spent preparing for tests at the expense of teaching”. This is like the chief of the defence staff joining CND. Ofsted has for years judged schools on “exam floor targets” – the regime that led the last chief inspector, Sir Michael Wilshaw, to declare that fully “a third of British schools are failing”. That was after nearly three decades of league tables used to score, penalise and humiliate schools and their teachers – before starving them of money.Exams are educational dross to which politicians turn when they can think of nothing else for pupils to do. The new GCSEs last June produced a deluge of criticism for challenging pupils’ mental resilience more than their memory. Such was the pressure that half of London parents bought private tuition. There was a predictable surge in mental stress among children. Examination implies a public loss of faith in the profession of teaching. We don’t judge doctors by patient longevity, or lawyers by cases won. Yet we reduce education simply to what can be recalled on a particular day, even if promptly forgotten. It scores not just children but teachers and schools. A teacher recently wrote to the Times that in Germany, largely exam-free schools “are trusted to educate in the broadest sense, and objectively assess their own pupils, without recourse to any self-serving, outsourced exam industry”. I doubt that a modern English school would know what to do with its time without exams.Askmost people what they remember from school and they mention an inspiring teacher, not an exam result. Ask employers what they look for in a recruit and they list articulation, presentation, creativity, imagination and social skills – qualities that appear nowhere in an English curriculum. They might be the benefits of talented pedagogy, but scoring them is absurd.Pisa, Whitehall and Ofsted are obsessed with maths not because algebra is the key to happiness, or geometry to great riches, but because it is easy to score globally. Bereft of an ideal of a good education, government, and especially central government, likes anything that yields mass data. It holds the key to control, to the regime of rewards and penalties that underpins modern administration and its funding.One day, I believe exams will be as outdated as the slate and the birch. For the time being, we can only bewail those most likely to suffer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/918e29eb1f20435b0e7ede1af31700c81d61d8ff/0_113_5565_3339/master/5565.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ecf46a02c4116dac2f111a3b1337147","title":"insurance no deal brexit norway for now then canada","story":"I very much hope that the prime minister will return from the negotiations with a deal that parliament can support in the national interest. No politician – at least none that are serious about protecting British jobs and livelihoods – can accept the idea of crashing out of the European Union next March without a deal. But that’s the track we’ll be on if MPs both reject the deal reached through the negotiations, and then cannot decide on the terms of our departure.So we need to draw up an insurance policy, quickly, which can be used in the event of the prime minister’s deal failing to make it through parliament.Any such policy must meet the test of delivering our safe exit from the EU, thereby honouring the referendum result, and do so in a way that does not harm British industry. It should have, as its longer-term aim, the agreement of a free trade deal with the EU that delivers prosperity and sets us free to make our own laws, implement a balanced immigration policy, and reach our own trade deals around the world.A Canada-style deal has always been the most attractive proposition. I believe a mutually beneficial relationship with the EU, underpinned by an ambitious free trade arrangement, must remain our end goal.But there are real problems with going for that option straightaway, given so much of the past two years’ negotiations appears to have been wasted.It will be almost impossible to negotiate this outcome in the time we have left before our departure. Yes, the EU has made clear it is open to a Canada-style deal. Yes, it has even said it can come with some plus, plus, pluses to make it work even better. But the EU says the price for this is that it must be for Britain only, with a border in the Irish Sea, carving our country down the middle. This is unacceptable and simply will not fly.Moreover, we cannot be sure that a Canada-style deal would pass through the House of Commons at this moment, and a satisfactory resolution has yet to be found for the Irish border. It’s because we haven’t been able to convince the Europeans that technological solutions can deal with the border that they are intent on having.I am convinced that, in time, solutions can be found and a Canada-style deal can be made to work for our constituents’ jobs and living standards, for the Europeans and for MPs. But there’s the rub. We haven’t got time. We are fast running out of it. “Canada now” just does not work.That’s why I have been discussing with colleagues on the Labour and Tory benches an alternative option – an insurance policy – that we can negotiate with Europe, pass through parliament, and which can protect the integrity of the UK.If the government fails to negotiate a suitable deal in time, we should go for “Norway for now, then Canada”. This option would involve membership of the European Economic Area, European Free Trade Association and a customs union, preventing the need for a hard border, for as long as we need to negotiate our longer-term relationship with the EU.Although the safe harbour of a “Norway for now” option alone would suffice for some colleagues, the addition of “then Canada” is crucial to winning support from others, particularly on the Labour benches, whose constituencies voted to leave and wish to see that as our ambition.Hence the importance of having an insurance policy that, while affording breathing space, does so with that longer-term objective of securing a Canada-style trading relationship with the EU where we will control our own borders and are not subjected to the European courts. Indeed, the monies the EU want from us should not be paid until that Canada-style deal has been reached.“Norway for now, then Canada” offers the chance of delivering Brexit in the safest way possible, if the present negotiations fail to deliver a satisfactory outcome. An immediate aim is to unite MPs with as broad a range of opinions as possible around this insurance policy. If we can succeed on this front, the Commons could help similarly to unite the country.• Frank Field is MP for Birkenhead"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cd1cc4049775b04d58e0a3315c5c78cba96e8b1/0_101_3028_1817/master/3028.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ab4d321862f71b694ae8a666dbb8778","title":"russia brexit britain trade wto negotiations liam fox","story":"Liam Fox was finally able to announce the start of a set of trade negotiations yesterday, but they were of a kind he had probably hoped to avoid. The issue is this: as the UK leaves the EU, it must go through a process of certifying its own schedule of goods and services at the World Trade Organization. This schedule is essentially a set of rights and obligations the UK must follow regarding other WTO members. The UK has been part of the EU’s schedule, but now, following Brexit, must set its own independent one.The UK had hoped this would be an uncontroversial technical exercise, and for the most part it has been. This is because the UK intends to replicate as far as possible the EU’s schedule of commitments and concessions, including on tariffs. Where this has become problematic, as expected and even seemingly anticipated by the UK, is on splitting the EU’s current share of tariff rate quotas (TRQs).TRQs essentially set the amount of imports that can enter a country at an agreed low duty rate. Beyond that volume limit, higher tariffs then apply. Unsurprisingly, they are most controversial when it comes to agricultural goods, where the upper limits of many countries’ tariff rates are high. Extracting the UK share from the EU’s current set of TRQs is a delicate exercise. While the EU would be only too happy to offload some of its quotas, other countries want to make sure they are still getting the same market access to Europe for their produce, as well as access to the newly independent UK.The UK and EU together agreed an approach to split their TRQs in a way that still added up to the present quotas for the EU28 as a whole. But a number of countries have protested, both to the UK’s draft proposal and to the EU’s. While Russia’s objection has occupied the headlines, many of Britain’s closest allies have raised concerns as well. Among these are the US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. The reality is that when it comes to agriculture, special relationships mean little in practice. Everyone’s out for their own as far as meat and dairy go, and trade negotiations sink or swim on these issues.The UK will get its first real taste of this battle as it moves to open the 90-day comment period – the beginning of the negotiating process – for these talks, under article 28 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. This means the negotiations could go right up until the UK’s official Brexit date.But while leaving the EU with the UK’s new schedules “uncertified” – that is, without agreement from all other members – is undesirable, it would not be calamitous.A country can trade on uncertified schedules, as the EU itself knows from recent history. With successive rounds of enlargement, it has had to modify its own goods schedules at the WTO to reflect the integration of member states. This has even led to Brussels having to compensate other WTO members for changes to their market access. The process has been a protracted one, so slow that only last year the EU circulated revised goods schedules for all 28 members, meaning it has been operating with uncertified commitments long out of date. Not that you would know it from a day-to-day trading perspective.So as negotiations go, the UK’s schedules snafu is probably something of a storm in a teacup. The government’s negotiations to accede in its own right to the global procurement agreement is more pressing, and reported US moves to challenge Britain’s application could prove thorny.But they all pale into significance when set against the scale of Brexit negotiations. If nothing else, British negotiators are getting a crash course in trade talks. The learning curve is steep, but at least we will emerge less naive about the challenge of turning global Britain’s trade policy into a reality.• Allie Renison is head of Europe and Trade at the Institute of Directors"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da4d997ec9218f7572f995dfe9eb0240d1688d1d/0_249_4030_2418/master/4030.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1e5f1aef45baa4081fe74ea5f141649","title":"energy minister had private meeting with fracking firms in may claire perry","story":"Claire Perry failed to record meeting with Cuadrilla and others on transparency registerThe government wants Britain to export its approach to fracking around the world, the energy minister Claire Perry has told the shale gas industry.Details of Perry having a private meeting with fracking firms have emerged, as the 17th minor earthquake was recorded since the shale company Cuadrilla began fracking near Blackpool earlier this month.Perry and officials met with all the key shale players – Cuadrilla, Ineos, iGas and Third Energy – along with oil and gas companies including BP on 21 May. While her meeting with wind power executives on the same day was recorded on an official transparency register, the shale event was not.Minutes of the shale meeting, which were eventually released under freedom of information rules, reveal:Friends of the Earth questioned the lack of transparency and called for a halt to fracking.“There is no model of fossil fuel extraction that we should be pursuing, much less trying to sell globally,” the FoE campaigner Rose Dickinson said.Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, said: “You can see why the government has attempted to withhold information about this meeting, as the notes reveal they are working hand in glove with the fracking industry to weaken regulations and planning protections to prop up an industry which the companies themselves acknowledge is commercially difficult.“Not content with undermining the UK’s own climate change targets, the government seem intent on wrecking the efforts of other countries by exporting the ‘UK model’ of fracking around the world.”The extent of public opposition to fracking was acknowledged in the meeting, with senior officials and the minister saying energy policy should not be made “on the basis of those groups who shout the loudest”.When asked what would be considered a success, Perry said “several wells in production” and a “line of sight to commerciality”.The industry is a long way from that point. Cuadrilla has only just begun exploratory fracking on two horizontal shale wells to test whether enough gas flows for the company to consider raising more finance and moving to commercial production.What the UK could export to the world on fracking is unclear, though the government has argued that operators will be more heavily regulated than elsewhere. The US is the world leader in fracking, which is dominated by American companies, including oil services firms such as Schlumberger, which is undertaking Cuadrilla’s fracking outside Blackpool.The shale roundtable in May was part of an industry lobbying drive in the spring, with Cuadrilla and Ineos also having separate meetings with Perry. In March, the business secretary, Greg Clark, met Jim Ratcliffe, the founder of Ineos and the UK’s richest person, to discuss shale gas.In May, the government announced plans to fast-track shale wells through the planning system, in which Ineos has been mired.BP was invited to the shale meeting but does not hold a stake in any UK fracking firms and is understood to not have any plans for shale gas extraction in Britain.The attendees and minutes of the roundtable were initially redacted and held back but eventually released after an appeal by the campaigner Richard Bales."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/862567f818f4a1cc74e0055f3feaade30fc67edf/0_366_5492_3295/master/5492.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46a44b4cfde86046d79b568707b41865","title":"soy destruction deforestation in argentina leads straight to our dinner plates","story":"Argentina’s Gran Chaco forest is being razed for soya, ending up in Europe as animal feed, and on our plates. It’s the backbone of Argentina’s fragile economy, but has come at a price for the indigenous people who live thereby  Uki Goñi in SaltaThe extent of the destruction is painful to see. Flying over the area around the El Corralito indigenous community in a single-propeller plane, only thin strips of green are left between vast fields of pale, newly uncovered earth, pencilled in with parallel white lines of the ashes of bulldozed trees.Only a few years ago, this stretch of land in Argentina’s northern province of Salta was still forest – home to the Wichí people, and part of the gigantic Gran Chaco forest that spreads across northern Argentina and its neighbouring countries Bolivia, Paraguay and Brazil. Second only to the Amazon in South America for its size and bioersity, the Gran Chaco covers 250,000 sq miles of dry forest, which is being cut down faster than scientists can study it. Since 1996, when the government authorised the introduction of genetically modified soya bean, Argentina has cleared nearly a quarter of its native forests. Much of that newly cleared land has been turned over to the soya bean crop that has been critical to Argentina’s cyclically ravaged economy. “Argentina is in a forest emergency,” says Natalia Machain, director of Greenpeace Argentina.Once harvested, the small creamy beans are crushed. The extracted oil is mainly used for fuel, while the remaining meal – the protein – is used for animal feed. Only a small percentage is turned into human food products such as soy milk. Around 43m tonnes of soya bean meal, soya oil and soya bean a year floods out of Argentina and into Russia, the Middle East, Australia and Asia, with the largest part going to Europe and Europe’s farms.Argentina is Europe’s largest single supplier of soya bean meal, providing more than a third of total European soya meal imports, 9.8m tonnes out of a total 27.1m in 2016.A number of major food companies, most notably the fast food company McDonald’s, have pledged to axe deforestation from their global supply chains. The European Union itself has made a number of impressive sounding noises on the subject. But when it comes to traceability, Argentina lags far behind its giant neighbour Brazil, which has more controls in place because of its history with deforestation in the Amazon.“The truth is that at the moment decent traceability of soya bean in Argentina is a black box, and while it remains a black box, Argentina’s forests are going under the axe,” says Toby Gardner, an environmental expert at the Stockholm Environment Initiative intent on providing traceability for South America’s exports. The Roundtable on Sustainable Soy is working to try to improve things, but has had limited success. A team sent to Argentina by the US-based NGO Mighty Earth came up against a brick wall recently trying to determine what percentage of Argentina’s soya bean originates from deforested areas. “There is no legal requirement for companies to document the geographic origin of their soya bean or provide evidence that it has been produced legally,” Mighty Earth says in a report on the trip released earlier this year. “As such, it is currently impossible for European companies that source from these traders to ensure that the soya bean they are buying has not been produced through deforestation.”European supermarket chains frequently market their meat and dairy products as sustainable and locally produced, but the feed consumed by the livestock often comes from thousands of miles away, says Mighty Earth. “As such, the locally grown labelling only represents half the truth about the origins of this meat.”Mighty Earth says the environmental commitments of food companies are difficult to uphold if livestock raised in Europe is fed with soya meal from a country where traceability remains opaque. “Consumers want to know where products come from and want their food to be produced in a manner consistent with their values,” says Glenn Hurowitz of Mighty Earth. “We’ve made great advances regarding traceability of soya bean from the Amazon but we have been blind to the deforestation happening in Argentina.”Meanwhile the Wichí people helplessly stand by as their home disappears. “We have no future,” says Amancio Angel despairingly. He is standing next to a clump of trees, the only home left to his clan after another swath of green was uprooted earlier this year by giant bulldozers hauling chains through the dwindling forest. “We used that forest to hunt and collect fruit, people from other communities got honey there, now life has become impossible,” says Amancio.Now it is almost totally gone, part of 9,000 hectares (an area about one-and-a-half times the size of Manhattan island) earmarked for deforestation by just one out of a total 32 deforestation permits issued in recent years by Salta’s provincial authorities.Nonetheless, in response to pressure from environmental groups to halt the rampant deforestation, Argentina’s congress passed a law that went into effect in 2009 iding the country’s forestland into red (untouchable), yellow (mixed use) and green (available to deforest) areas. Unfortunately for communities such as El Corralito, the law has been honoured more in the breach than in the observance, with inidual provinces authorising vast deforestation projects in red and yellow protected zones. In Salta, for example, more than 170,000 protected hectares – an area larger than Greater London – have gone under the bulldozer since the law came into force.Earlier this year the national government was forced to intervene, and a moratorium was put in place in Salta. But the deforestation continues, according to Greenpeace Argentina. The local governor, Juan Manuel Urtubey, a good looking and softly spoken 49-year-old politician who has ruled Salta since 2007, and is a likely candidate in Argentina’s upcoming 2019 presidential elections, may have handed out plenty of permits himself but he frowns on the landowners who have continued clearing land after the moratorium was imposed in January.“Clearings carried out outside the framework of the law are a crime and administrative and judicial instances are under way so that those who committed that crime pay their responsibility,” he says.The problem is that the law sets only moderate monetary fines for offenders. “The fines are no deterrent at all, producers just factor them in as another cost,” says Noemí Cruz, an indigenous campaigner for Greenpeace in Salta.“What producers have done to get around the forest law is obtain written statements from community chiefs agreeing to deforestation in exchange for houses and water deliveries,” says Ana Alvarez, a lawyer who defends indigenous rights. “These statements, often signed with a thumbprint by Wichís who cannot read or write Spanish, are then used by landowners to obtain deforestation permits from the province.”Governor Urtubey vows that he is taking the deforestation issue seriously. “We are discussing a law to duplicate the size of protected areas in Salta,” Urtubey tells the . “So we’ll have 4m hectares of protected areas and 2m hectares of agriculture. We’re working with the national government, environmental organisations and producers on how to reduce the environmental impact of productive activities evaluating on a case-by-case basis.”The effect is not only felt by the Wichí. Soya bean has created a rural exodus from dairy- and beef-producing areas, displacing local farmers in favour of mechanised production by giant conglomerates who wield tremendous economic influence. The sight of the horseback “gaucho”, Argentina’s equivalent of the US cowboy, trailed by dogs, has disappeared from the landscape. Many landowners have knocked down their farmhouses to make more space for soya bean.During a two-hour drive across dirt roads in Salta, once peopled by gauchos, farming families, horses and dogs, the only traffic encountered was a lorry with a trailer hauling a giant bulldozer to cut down more forest, followed by a small tractor pulling a cistern carrying fuel for the tree-killer.The short-term benefit for Argentina’s economy comes at a heavy price. “Soya bean devastates native forests and decreases the infiltration capacity of soils,” says the indigenous campaigner Cruz. “Its associated agrochemicals pollute the water table and aquifers. In the Gran Chaco area there is little water to start with, so the contamination of natural water sources is doubly serious.” The salinisation of the soil, which renders it unusable for further planting, is another problem associated with soya bean production.John Palmer, a British anthropologist who has been living in Salta since the 1990s says the message for the Wichí is: “Bye-bye indigenous people. This world is not a place for you. The world is a place for us, the big spenders, the big money grabbers – that’s who the world is for.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03685a3da671e9d00b210937187d029b11952de1/605_121_4781_2868/master/4781.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e6d233b1aaae9aeebe0e107844f2d46","title":"how tattoos went from subculture to pop culture","story":"Body art is more mainstream than ever but for many it is no longer a design for lifeWhen Nathan Boon started working as a tattoo artist about 10 years ago, tattoo parlours could be found in back alleys or on the outskirts of town. Over the years, as trends have moved from tribal designs on the lower back to geometric designs on the sternum, he has seen more shops open up in central business districts. “When I first started, you had to go and find someone to tattoo you. Now it’s in your face,” he said.The Manchester Tattoo Emporium, where he works, is in the city’s most central shopping area. On a weekday afternoon business is booming in the studio, which opened four years ago. The company has three other studios – the first of which opened six years ago and the newest one a year ago. “There are more kids now than ever who have tattoos,” said Boon. “It’s not a taboo thing any more.”Earlier this week the Chelsea and England footballer Ross Barkley spoke publicly about his decision to remove a whole sleeve of tattoos, including one that marked his first game with his previous club, Everton.“I got them at a young age and sometimes when you are young you do stupid things and do not think about it,” the 24-year-old midfielder told the Times. “But I went into it too quick and over the years I felt I wanted to get them removed.” He said he would not rule out getting more tattoos in the future.After being shown a picture of Barkley’s tattooed arm, Boon said he was not surprised by the decision. “I can see why he’s taken them off because it’s a whole bunch of different styles that don’t really go together. He was probably in a rush to get tattooed,” he said. “If you get tattoos for the sake of getting them, you can regret them a few years down the line.”It is hard to find a modern pop star without a tattoo. Justin Bieber got his first one aged 16 and now, aged 24, has an estimated 56, including one of his ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez’s face on his wrist and a tiny cross next to his eye. Rihanna, 30, is thought to have at least 25, with a henna-style design on her hand and the image of Queen Nefertiti on her ribcage. Ed Sheeran, 27, got his first tattoo aged 18 and now has over 60. More recent additions include a large lion’s face on his chest and a Heinz ketchup label on his arm.“If more people are getting tattoos then there will be a market for more removal,” said Boon, who attributes the rise in popularity to the influence of celebrities and social media. “I say to my clients all the time, be careful of the choices you make because what I liked when I was 20 is not what I like now.”Chris Bull, the marketing director at Sk:n, which has 51 skin clinics in the UK, says demand for laser tattoo removal has increased significantly over the past five years. “I would argue that it is because tattoos are becoming more popular so people are choosing to change them or adapt them over time,” he said.David McComb, the author of 100 Years of Tattoos, said: “Tattoos have always gone in and out of fashion throughout history. The best example is that back in the early 1900s there was a craze in high society for tattoos. Famously, Winston Churchill’s mother had a snake tattooed around her wrist. Literally, within about five years it had gone completely out of fashion again.“Whereas my generation would think about it for a long time, young people don’t think twice about going to get a tattoo,. They have a more relaxed attitude towards body art and, if they don’t like it in a few years, they’ll just get something else to cover it up.”McComb believes the current level of popularity is unlikely to last. “If I had tonnes of money I’d certainly invest in a tattoo removal machine,” he said. “I think it’s something that’s going to become very, very popular over the next few years.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffd6b8375c67e065618edda0de539112c460602f/0_81_2643_1587/master/2643.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff21437e5b8c67f0010e8a339a146495","title":"clueless remake paramount tracy oliver","story":"Paramount orders remake of the 1995 hit based on Jane Austen’s Emma from Girls Trip writer Tracy OliverClueless, the much-loved teen comedy, which catapulted Alicia Silverstone and Brittany Murphy to fame in the mid-90s, is to be remade by Paramount.

When the time is right, I probably will find out but that hasn’t happened yet.“There is no contract on the table at the moment so there is nothing for me to consider or whatever.

It shows the 10 goalkeepers who have made the most saves in Europe’s top five leagues over the past five seasons and the player leading the way is the same man who has just been thanked by the photographer for doing a decent job in goal for his fantasy football team. “Oooh, I’ve never seen a stat like that. That’s cool,” says Fabianski, running his eyes over the names and numbers before pausing for a moment. “But you should also include the most goals conceded in there.”That last remark, made with the hint of a smile, is typical of Fabianski. Self-deprecating and unassuming, Fabianski is not the sort to get swept along by praise for his performances, or some impressive facts and figures. Asked how he interprets those statistics, the 33-year-old breaks into laughter as he replies: “Well, the first thing that comes into my mind is that I’ve been busy!”Overworked would be another way of putting it after three successive seasons of fighting relegation with Swansea and a challenging start to his West Ham career. Nine games into the campaign and only Joe Hart has made more saves in the Premier League, which partly explains why the Poland international is so popular with fantasy football fans. Fabianski has another theory. “I’m probably one of the cheapest ones,” he says.West Ham certainly got value for money when they paid £5.5m for Fabianski in the summer, with the positive reaction from their supporters to his signing indicative of how much his reputation has changed over the last few years. After all, it seems unlikely the transfer would have gone down so well if Fabianski had moved to West Ham straight from Arsenal in 2014. “Yeah, I think that’s fair to say. Before my last year at Arsenal, when we won the FA Cup, I was really up and down, never really consistent, and never really put my mark on the team. I understand that then there were question marks over my name.”Looking back, Fabianski says there is a “massive difference” between the goalkeeper who left Arsenal and the one who signed for West Ham. He highlights the influence Javier García and Tony Roberts, the goalkeeping coaches he worked under at Swansea, had on his career – “They were on me every single day” – and also the way his mindset totally changed because of regular football.Talking in a cafe in Hornchurch for more than an hour, Fabianski comes across as such a likable guy. There is no ego or edge to someone who describes himself as “easy-going and family-oriented”. Once the goalkeeper gloves are off, he just wants to blend in with the rest of the world, which is why he appreciated that throughout his time living in Swansea he was “always seen as a person rather than a footballer”.Fabianski’s last appearance for Swansea, against Stoke in May, ended in tears, after the sound of the fans serenading him on the day the club were relegated became “too much”. Six weeks later, West Ham completed his transfer and Fabianski, who was away at the World Cup at the time, went to his hotel room to write a letter to the staff, players and supporters at Swansea. “I had two attempts, if I’m honest,” Fabianski says, smiling. “Obviously I am foreign, so I don’t know if it was correct when it came to the grammar. But I did the first attempt and I didn’t feel it was a good one.”Asked why he felt the need to write a letter, given the majority of footballers would happily leave anything like that in the hands of their agent, Fabianski replies: “I think all the people I met at the club at Swansea, they deserved the respect they showed me over the time I was there. It’s the club that took a chance on me – a goalkeeper who was mostly questioned, someone who was 29 years old and who wasn’t first choice for seven years, so that’s one part of it. The other part is that all the people I met in Swansea, they were always very kind towards me and my family, even if we had a bad run of results. The four years we spent there were really good, my son was born there, so I wanted to show respect.”Fabianski smiles when it is put to him that he has not swapped Swansea for West Ham to sign up for another relegation battle. “No, no, I haven’t. But, to be honest with you, because I’ve experienced so much at Swansea, I don’t want to make it sound like I don’t mind it. But I don’t get hyped about having such a bad start, or winning against big teams. So I wasn’t really panicking when we lost the first four games. This is an exciting team at West Ham that needs a bit of time to get in the right groove.”Although West Ham, who travel to Leicester on Saturday, have lost six of their nine league matches, Fabianski’s displays have been impressive and he has filed a contender for save of the season with the brilliant one-handed stop that kept out Marouane Fellaini’s header in the 3-1 victory over Manchester United. Fabianski’s take on that is fascinating and turns into a conversation on the art of goalkeeping."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c9767763097eab8c619c79c0da9435cdee71305/0_102_1926_1156/master/1926.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7dd0b2d8b92892b5c1eb86c50c3c5c5e","title":"pep guardiola manchester city dropped football","story":"Pep Guardiola has warned his Manchester City players that they must retain the correct attitude in training after being dropped or they will have a “big problem”.The manager said there was currently no issue around this but was clear that anyone left out must take it professionally.“The guys who don’t play deserve to play – it’s always like this,” Guardiola said. “When they are training in a bad way they are out of the selection.

When asked by Sky about David de Gea’s contract, and the prospect of the keeper signing a new one, he said:I am not confident. But I’m not also... how do you say the opposite of confident? I am not worried. I am not more than worried. I cannot find the word in English. Let’s see what happens. Only the club, David and David’s people can answer to that. My comment is only one: everybody knows how good he is, everybody knows how important he is for Manchester United. And if Manchester United wants to be better than it is now and not worse than it is now, obviously that would be very important to keep David.You may have seen that FA chief executive Martin Glenn had suggested in the last couple of days that the shortfall from the now nixed sale of Wembley could be made up with a levy on football betting. In short, the plan would have been to get a little something from each bet placed on football, and direct it to the grassroots of the game. Impractical? Absolutely. Now the gambling industry have responded, and they’re dead keen on the id...just kidding: they’ve invited Glenn to do one. Gillian Wilson, chair of the Senet Group, an independent body which manages the campaign to promote responsible gambling on behalf of the betting industry, told the Press Association:What’s surprising is that football already receives large volumes of revenue from the gambling industry serious amounts of cash flow from the gambling industry to football. Therefore one would think they could use some of those revenues to fund the grassroots game. To call for another tax out of the blue is quite surprising. This is just inappropriate, as a link. It would be going in the opposite direction of travel to what most reasonable people think is sensible. We should be very concerned about protecting young people, particularly young men, and vulnerable people. Someone call the cops, Xherdan has nicked Joel Matip’s strides...Speaking of Real, let’s Clasico! One of the numerous strikes against Julen Lopetegui has been that he hasn’t used Brazilian youth Vinicius Jnr, silly as that might sound when discussing an 18-year-old with minimal experience. You could say easing the kid in (just 12 minutes over two substitutes appearances in the league so far), when the team is collapsing around his ears, is one of the few things Lopetegui has got right. Anyway, a Hail Mary pass might be available to Lopetegui in the shape of Vinicius, as the youngster is available to play. He’d been sent off in a recent Real B game after two yellow cards, but having appealed to the better nature of the disciplinary committee, they have decreed that the second of those - an apparent e - was incorrectly given, so he’s free to play. But will he? No! Probably not! But let’s speculate he will anyway! A few more bits from Mauricio Pochettino’s press conference earlier. Firstly, he reckons the Wembley pitch will be absolutely fine on Monday for their game against Manchester City, despite the NFL having a game there on Sunday. Fine for Spurs, that is: a lovely deployment of the old FA Cup non-leaguer playing a Premier League team, ‘the pitch could be a leveller’ gambit here:Maybe it is good for us because we are going to face one of the best teams in Europe and the world in Manchester City and maybe it will help us. It wasn’t a plan for us to play in that period at Wembley and now we cannot complain. Only we need to accept the reality and know that we cannot change that. We hope that the weather will be good and not kill the pitch and we can play in a very good condition. I am sure all the people that are involved in the pitch are going to work so hard to get it in a really good condition. That is my wish and I hope it can happen. Poch was also asked about the prospect of being approached for the Real Madrid job, should Julen Lopetegui be shoved through Florentino Perez’s big trapdoor. He...sort of answered.Here’s some more Fifa stuff, from the man you want telling you about Fifa stuff, David Conn.Sam Vokes has signed a new contract at Burnley, keeping him at the club until 2021.

The £28m summer signing has yet to appear for Everton since arriving from Barcelona with a foot injury, and then suffering another in training, but has been back in full training for a fortnight. In his absence, Michael Keane and Kurt Zouma have struck up a good partnership in central defence and the Colombia international may have to wait longer for his debut.“What the club spent on him is not important when I make my decision,” said Silva. “The money is not important for me. The important thing is Yerry is working hard and working well. He is involved every day and understanding our model after losing the first two months. He is working hard to get in the starting eleven but the other two are playing well. The good thing for me as a coach is to see him fighting every day for his place and enjoying the club. When his chance comes he needs to be ready.”I don’t think Jose Mourinho will manage Real Madrid again, you don’t think Jose Mourinho will manage Real Madrid again, Jose Mourinho probably doesn’t think Jose Mourinho will manage Real Madrid again.

Here’s Luiz Suarez, Barcelona firebrand and leader of their attack this weekend with Leo Messi absent. He told the Barca website:El Clasico is always El Clasico. Look at El Clasico last year we were practically champions already but the intensity was the same as in any Clasico. It’s like that, you’re always up for it. You do have to look at the teams’ most recent results but the Clasico is the Clasico and nobody thinks about the other team’s morale or if they’ve been playing badly or better.Here’s Rafa Benitez, speaking as Newcastle go into the weekend without a win to their name. Key theme: we did it before, we can do it again.To be in the bottom three is always bad news, but to have the situation we had last year - that is my hope, we know we can do it. We work hard, and change little things, but we are very close to the first win and the first win changes everything.

As Jacob Steinberg writes here, it could be a big day for Jürgen Locadia:Afternoon all, Niall here filling in while Nick takes a quick break. Let’s check in with Mauricio Pochettino, who’s been straight talking on Dele Alli, Hugo Lloris and Wembley ahead of Monday’s match:On the NFL game at Wembley on Sunday, he jokes: “maybe it’s good for us. We are facing one of the best teams in the world!” Then, less jovially, “it wasn’t the plan for us to be playing at Wembley now. That is the problem. We can’t complain, it’s the reality of the situation.”The nice thing about advancing in years is that you can unashamedly resent the young, particularly precocious types who achieve enormous things at a young ageprivileged upstarts who benefit from being related to people who have enormous things.With that in mind, here’s a quick story from Reuters about Inter’s new president:Inter Milan have appointed 26-year-old Steven Zhang as their new president, the Serie A club said on Friday. Zhang, who becomes the 21st president in the club’s history, is the son of Zhang Jindong, chairman of China’s electronics retailer Suning Holdings Group which bought a majority stake in the club in 2016. He has been on the board of directors for the last two years and has effectively been responsible for the day-to-day running of the club. Inter announced the appointment by posting a video on social media.“When I close my eyes, I see a city with so much history and more to be written,* said Zhang in the video. “People with ideas, with the will to improve what*s around them and themselves. A club that plays beyond the field to win the hearts of everyone. But then I open my eyes and see that all this is already here. I’m ready, are you?” “Hey Nick,” begins Louis Smith. “As trite a response as it may be, Mourinho and Manchester United would be my candidates for the most unsuitable partners. A fanbase that fetishises long-termism and attacking football, with a larger interest in commercial viability over practical squad building paired with the ultimate defensive pragmatist - who doesn’t even have good defenders at his disposal. As a Liverpool fan the schadenfreude has been excellent!”Spot of team news from Tottenham: Dele Alli, who has been out with a hamstring problem, is back training and available to face Manchester City on Monday. Danny Rose and Jan Vertonghen are both still out, however. More clásico stuff.

Bolt may or may not have been offered a contract by the Central Coast Mariners, despite being a 33-year-old not professional footballer. He’s got a touch like a trampoline. It’s nice to have the attention on the A-League but him playing in the A-League, that’s not for me.He’s shown a bit of potential but it’s a little bit of a kick in the teeth to the professionals that are in the league.If there’s someone who genuinely thinks he’d be a good football addition, I don’t think they should be in a position to make those calls.One of the bigger selection problems of the weekend, in terms of the player’s important to his team, is whether Glenn Murray has recovered from the concussion sustained at Newcastle last week in time to play up top for Brighton against Wolves. Chris Hughton said:We’ll need to make a decision on Glenn Murray. What you have to do is go through a correct protocol during the week. We’ve done that and at this moment he feels fine in regards to the actual knock itself. Glenn has been super for us this season and his goal record since he’s been here says that. But we’ve got competition in the squad. When somebody misses a game it’s a really good opportunity for somebody else. That’s how it always has to be.Quick line from the courtsthe world of Antonio Conte: reports in Italy (specifically from Sportmediaset) that Conte has finally come to an agreement with Chelsea over his contract. They’re spinning this as clearing the way for him to take over at Real Madrid, but if you can think of a top club and top manager less suited to each other, I’d love to hear them. Infantino says the taskforce on the Club World Cupglobal Nations League proposals - which, publicly at least, are powerfully vague at the moment - will report by the next Fifa Council meeting in March. He also asks if anyone has any suggestions, they should make them to Fifa: think he was talking about the various associations and officials, but if you’ve got a cunning plan, drop the big man a line.Infantino has also been speaking about the proposal to play Spanish Liga games in America - he says that it’s the view of the relevant “stakeholders” that games such as that should take place “within the organisation’s territory.” I suspect people like Charlie Stillitano, one of the men behind the wheeze, will just accept that and move on, mind.

When I lived in Las Vegas, we had to make do with baseball-size ones from the grocery store. But since we moved to the north-west 10 years ago, we’ve visited a local farm every October. There we ride tractors to the pumpkin patch and I compete with my three brothers and sister to seek out the biggest specimen. My dad has a rule that we have to carry our pumpkins back to the wheelbarrow, and as the eldest child I have an advantage – in 2015 I staggered back with an 85-pounder.The following year, when I was 16, it was hard to tell whether my prize or the one chosen by my 14-year-old brother, Jason, was the winner. Unfortunately we neglected to weigh them before scooping out their innards, but I was determined to prove my point. All five of us were hard at work at the kitchen table, with my mom filming the annual ritual. I’m unsure now why I thought forcing my head inside the pumpkin would settle the matter, but it seemed to make perfect sense at the time.With the pumpkin resting on the table, hole uppermost, I leaned over and pressed my crown against the opening. At first I got jammed just above my eyes and then, as I leant into my task, unwilling to quit, my nose briefly prevented entry. Then in it popped: my whole head, like a cork forced into a bottle. I was able to straighten up, triumphantly, with the gigantic squash resting on my shoulders.My exultation was short-lived. The pumpkin was heavy. “I’m going to set it down, now,” I said, and with Jason helping to support its weight, I bent back over the table to give it somewhere to rest. It was only when I tried to remove my head that I realised getting out was going to be less straightforward than getting in. The knot of my ponytail caught against the rim when I tried to pull out, as did the underside of my jaw. When I pulled my chin into my neck, my nose got in the way instead. I felt a jab of panic as I braced against the table and moved my head around trying to find the right angle, but it was no use. “I can’t get it out!” I roared, my voice sounding unnaturally loud in the enclosed space. The muffled voices from outside were oddly calming, though – Mom unruffled and amused, Jason giving advice, my 10-year-old brother, Austin, singing a song I couldn’t make out. There was enough space around my neck to let a little light in and, fortunately, I’ve always liked the smell of pumpkin. My bellowing provoked little sympathy. “Don’t use up all your oxygen,” Mom suggested.Dad was summoned – less, it seemed, in expectation of practical help than to make sure he didn’t miss out on the spectacle. I heard him propose calling the fire department. “Stay tuned,” said Mom she’d mentioned she was going to upload the video to Facebook, but it was only then I realised she’d been filming the whole time. I was stuck for five or six minutes though it felt much, much longer. The video cuts before my rescue – Dad got me to push my head farther into the pumpkin so Mom could reach in and undo the rubber band round my ponytail. I emerged with squash-conditioned hair, a sore chin and my nose plugged with pulp.That Facebook video went up the Monday before Halloween, and by the end of that day it had over 1,000 views. People asked Mom to put it on YouTube, and by Wednesday morning we were getting 5am calls from TV breakfast shows and then the international media – the video started racking up hundreds of thousands of views. When I went on a youth camp, I was recognised by children I’d never met. The pumpkin also became a minor celebrity. Passersby and trick-or-treaters would knock and ask, “Which is Rachel’s pumpkin?” before taking selfies with it.Although our pumpkin carving the following year was a more sedate affair, I wouldn’t say I learned my lesson. A few months later I squeezed myself into a laundry basket during a game of hide-and-seek and became hopelessly jammed. It was Dad who responded to my cries for help. Inevitably, I was kept waiting for a while – first he had to look for the video camera.• As told to Chris BroughtonDo you have an experience to share?

Rents for a three-bed would average £2,260 – affordable, it says, for three sharers who each earn £30,000.Southwark councillor Johnson Situ says: “With over 10,000 people on our housing waiting list it is very disappointing to see such a little amount of social or genuinely affordable housing in this application. As it stands, we are still a long way from agreeing a scheme that meets the council’s policies.”Grosvenor argues that on the proposals it submitted a year ago, it would break even only 20 years after completion. To satisfy Southwark’s affordable housing requirements it would have to spend another £100m, which the property group argues is not financially viable.Simon Harding-Roots, the head of major projects at Grosvenor, says the flats, on the site of an old biscuit factory, would be affordable for “the forgotten middle – the nurses, teachers and police, who are often on shift work, can’t afford to buy and are not eligible for social rented housing, and are having to move out of London”.It is understood that Southwark council’s planning officers will make a recommendation for refusal in a report before a planning committee meeting in coming weeks. If the committee rejects the scheme, it would be referred to the GLA for a final decision.The GLA declined to comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e8aeeee08f783d83fa927c466da372108603b46/0_7_1650_990/master/1650.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68c6d4976383d0dcfd3a2814f462b752","title":"cod complex why boy george is one of inauthentic reggaes all time greats","story":"With a new Culture Club album out, is it time to reappraise music’s most chastised genre?Status update: Boy George has given up being the Ministry of Sound knob-twiddler we last knew him as, reunited Culture Club and turned out his first album in 19 years. The first we knew of his return was a comeback single, Let Somebody Love You, which was not good. Not good in the way his voice has blown a gasket, its narcoleptic tempo, and the depressing sense that George hasn’t taken the title’s advice in a long time. The one thing you couldn’t really criticise it for, though, was being cod reggae.Cod is a favourite dig used by music journalists who want the final word. Even the kind of professionally daft hacks who spend all their time defending Daphne \u0026amp Celeste or rhapsodising Drake will circle the wagons when you try to put more steel drum than is strictly necessary on your next dub-heavy single. But it shouldn’t be like that.In fact, Boy George is one of the great cod reggae artists of all time. In the cod rankings, Culture Club’s 1982 classic Do You Really Want to Hurt Me stands somewhere between 10cc’s Dreadlock Holiday and every third Paul McCartney song from the 70s. In the popular imagination, cod reggae is just white reggae. It is inauthentic, a borrowing of stylistic tropes without real heart. The word itself means a lark, a low-grade gag. James Joyce mentions it in Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man: “Some fellows had drawn it there for a cod.”Cod is a strange term, because it throws so much light on how we see authenticity in music. Cod metal? Mathematically impossible. Metal is constitutionally committed to its own debasement. Metal is already the cod of music itself. Cod rock? A quick Google reveals the first page of hits are for a beauty spot on the coast of Australia. The only other genre that can easily be called cod is psychedelia. The Stones’ Their Satanic Majesties Request birthed it Oasis specialised in it from the moment Noel quit the class As.It’s no coincidence that these are two highly spiritual genres. Milan Kundera once said that “kitsch is the absolute denial of shit”. Which means that the only types of music that can be turned into kitsch by making them even more like themselves are those with a faint pong of moral superiority. This is why reggae, with its Rastafarian roots and its reliance on a western fascination with the innate “soulfulness” of the black man, always tops the pile. Far from giving cod reggae a good kicking, we ought to celebrate its capacity to take the piss.It’s not as if it can’t be every bit as successful as Bob Marley’s Legend. Rihanna once called Diplo’s music reggae for airports. She then semi-famously turned down his loping Lean On, which went to Mø instead. It has since had 2.4bn plays on YouTube.

Which makes all other scriptures redundant.”She has since documented her new faith, writing that she was “very, very, very happy” after being given her first hijab, and expressing thanks to “all my Muslim brothers and sisters who have been so kind as to welcome me to Ummah”, meaning the Islamic community. She also posted a YouTube video of her making the Islamic call to prayer.Her full new name is Shuhada’ Davitt, using the surname she gave herself when she changed her name to Magda Davitt in 2017. She said at the time that she wanted to be “free of the patriarchal slave names. Free of the parental curses.”Davitt has candidly documented her struggles with mental health in recent years, posting a Facebook video in August 2017 in which she admitted to suicidal thoughts. “I am one of millions ... people who suffer from mental illness are the most vulnerable people on earth, we can’t take care of ourselves, you’ve got to take care of us,” she said in the video. “My entire life is revolving around not dying, and that’s not living.” In a previous update in November 2015, she said she had “taken an overdose”, and a police search was launched for her in May 2016 after she briefly went missing in Chicago, sparking fears for her wellbeing.Earlier this week, she claimed on Twitter that a healthcare assistant working with her was fired “for spiking me with crystal meth”.She was ordained as a priest in 1999 by the Irish Orthodox Catholic and Apostolic church – the group are not officially affiliated with the Catholic church, who do not allow the ordination of women as priests.She became disillusioned with Catholicism in the wake of child abuse scandals in the church, describing the Vatican as a “nest of devils” in a 2011 newspaper article. In an open letter published in August this year, she asked Pope Francis to excommunicate her, and said she had made similar previous appeals to Pope Benedict and John Paul II.Also in August, she released her first new music in four years, a song called Milestones made with Northern Irish producer David Holmes, whom she met at a birthday party for Pogues frontman Shane MacGowan. She is preparing a new album called No Mud No Lotus, which, she says, won’t be out before October 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/078bc9ff041a7090c016fc3950bd2b04155b09d3/0_112_5262_3157/master/5262.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=0ac955a370453815e3221f72452f7bcc","title":"politics live readers edition 26 october","story":"A forum where readers can discuss today’s politics and share links to breaking news and to the most interesting politics stories, blogs and tweets on the webWe’re not writing our usual blog today but here, as an alternative, is the Politics Live readers’ edition.

As a result, Hubble has remained in so-called safe mode and all science observations are on hold.Gyroscopes are needed to keep Hubble pointing in the right direction as it operates 340 miles (545km) above Earth. Precise pointing is crucial: astronomers use the telescope to peer deep into the cosmos, revealing faraway galaxies, black holes and solar systems. Last week, astronomers said they may have discovered the first moon outside our solar system, with Hubble’s help.The problem with the backup gyroscope was spotted when detectors in the gyroscope wrongly signalled that the wheel within the device was rotating at a much greater rate than that 19,200 revolutions per minute it should be spinning at.Nasa has said Hubble is expected to  return to normal science operations soon after it performed a “running restart” of the gyroscope on 16 October, which turned the device off for a second. The intention was to clear any faults that may have occurred during a restart on 6 October. That did not seem to work so it was followed up on 18 October with a series of spacecraft manoeuvres – known as turns – in an attempt to clear any blockage around the sealed “float” which contains the spinning wheel in the gyroscope. At the same time the system was switched between two modes to help with the procedure. The team think that the dodgy rotation speeds could have arisen if the float was off centre in the device.“At a high level, if people want to call it jiggling around, I suppose they can,” Patrick Crouse, Hubble’s operations project manager, told the Washington Post. “But we were trying to do very particular activities we thought would clear the problem. It certainly wasn’t as simple as turning it off and turning it back on.”The next day further jiggling of the telescope and twiddling of switches was performed: the issue now appears to be resolved.The space agency said: “The Hubble operations team plans to execute a series of tests to evaluate the performance of the gyro under conditions similar to those encountered during routine science observations, including moving to targets, locking on to a target, and performing precision pointing. After these engineering tests have been completed, Hubble is expected to soon return to normal science operations.”Jessie Christiansen at the Nasa Exoplanet Science Institute described the news as a “huge relief”.The 28-year-old telescope has had trouble with its gyroscopes before. Shuttle astronauts replaced all six in 2009 during a spacewalk on the final servicing mission. Three of the devices are now considered unusable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97b474252a23b496d7cb295479bd9ec86ed6c53e/0_202_3586_2151/master/3586.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cbc24ac1aa018f825207e1d872a66ba5","title":"story of a nation hs2 rail archaeological dig begins in uks biggest excavation","story":"Early discoveries on 150-mile route are Victorian time capsules and prehistoric toolsArchaeologists on the HS2 rail link between London and Birmingham have begun work on the UK’s biggest ever excavation, cutting an “unprecedented” slice through 10,000 years of British history.The mammoth archaeological project, taking in more than 60 separate digs along the 150-mile route, is the first stage in construction of the controversial rail line ahead of main building works starting next year.The developers have now revealed some of their early finds including a prehistoric hunter-gatherer site on the outskirts of London, a Wars of the Roses battlefield in Northamptonshire, a Romano-British town near Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire and an Iron Age settlement in Staffordshire.Their discoveries include prehistoric flint tools, a Romano-British cremation urn and two late Victorian time capsules dug up close to Euston station in London, containing rolled-up newspaper tied with twine, calling cards and leaflets promoting temperance.More than 1,000 archaeologists, bone specialists, scientists and conservators will be working on the sites until 2020, making the excavations the largest archaeological dig ever undertaken in Britain and potentially in Europe, according to Helen Wass, the project’s lead archaeologist.“It’s an unprecedented undertaking certainly there has been nothing in Britain on this scale,” said Wass. “We are really going to be able to tell the story of a nation.”As part of their initial surveys, the developers put together a Lidar (light detection and ranging) map – based on laser scanning – of the entire route, and archaeologists have carried out ground-penetrating geophysical surveys of the equivalent of 14,000 football pitches.At Colne valley, to the west of London, archaeologists have been examining evidence of herds of horses and reindeer which roamed the floodplains during the early Mesolithic period (from 11,000-8,000 BC), and of the humans who occupied the valley continuously from that date until the medieval period.A very different excavation in Fleet Marston, near Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, has revealed a Romano-British town at the junction of a number of Roman roads. “We have roadways, the remains of buildings, animal enclosures and fence lines,” said Wass, “and you can get a really great picture of how people at that time lived and worked and moved around the country”.In Handsacre in Staffordshire, a dig has uncovered the remains of an iron age house and a pit alignment, thought to have been used as a farming boundary during that period in the same way as hedges are today.And in Stoke Mandeville in Buckinghamshire, the ruins of an Anglo-Saxon church and burial ground will allow scientists and historians to study bodies dating back to the 12th century, to build a picture of the history of the village and its inhabitants over almost 1,000 years.Asked if she had a personal favourite discovery, Wass mentioned the site of the Battle of Edgcote, in Northamptonshire, where the armies of the Earl of Pembroke were defeated in 1469 by a rebel force led by Robin of Redesdale during the Wars of the Roses.“It just looks like a field,” said Wass. “It wasn’t a period of history I knew a huge amount about, but by reading the research that our specialists have undertaken about that time in our history when we were moving towards the Tudors, you have Welsh poets writing about the battle, you have the armies of various people moving across the landscape, and some of those markers are still there today. So that is one of our exciting sites.“But there really is going to be something for everybody, because we do cover the entire range of history.”A battlefield site presents particular challenges, she said. “They are really ephemeral in the landscape, because people just met there for a day, moved across, had combat and went away.” Archaeologists will use metal detectors to hunt for arrowheads and weaponry, while there is a slim chance of burials on the edges of the battlefield.“But you’re just trying to look for something that can validate the written sources that we have, that are obviously hundreds of years old. If we find arrowheads of the day, or weaponry of the day, or pieces of armoury, that helps us really pin down what people were writing about. Because obviously history was generally written by the victors, so they might have a particular spin on the battle. So are they telling the truth?”In Birmingham, excavations include exploration of the 19th century Park Street burial ground on what will be the site of the new HS2 Curzon Street station, which the archaeologists say will offer an insight into a period when the city’s population grew tenfold in the Industrial Revolution.At the other end of the line, another burial ground at St James’s gardens, next to Euston station, is expected to be the largest archaeological excavation of human remains from 18th and 19th century Britain.The cemetery, where up to 61,000 people were buried between 1788 and 1853, was the final resting place of both paupers and nobility, including a number of notable names including Captain Matthew Flinders, who completed the first circumnavigation of Australia, and Bill ‘The Terror’ Richmond, a freed slave who was born in New York but came to London and became a famous bare-knuckle boxer who taught Lord Byron to spar.Wass said the project would seek to engage people living along the length of the rail line, offering community events, pop-up museums, apprenticeships and training opportunities at different sites.“We are really trying to engage communities, because I think everybody is very interested in their locality, even if they haven’t been particularly aware, for example, of the Roman site down the road. I think people always want to know who these people were, where they lived, how they lived, how they cooked their food – all those stories that bring our ancestors to life.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/943af9ea26e4f7b4c6c109213453eba346301b34/130_0_3340_2004/master/3340.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4a0b8dbb404ffa99c2b705185ed838a","title":"astronomy photographer of the year 2018 the winning images","story":"The US photographer Brad Goldpaint has beaten thousands of amateur and professional photographers from around the globe to win the Royal Observatory Greenwich’s title of Insight Investment Astronomy Photographer of the Year 2018.

In 39 seats it was at least double the majority in 23 of those seats, it was five times higher.Those said to be at risk included one of the key architects of UC, the former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, whose majority of 2,438 was significantly outweighed by the 6,180 households expected to be moved on to UC. Sharma is defending a majority of 2,876 in a constituency where 6,567 households were expected to feel the impact of the shake-up.The chair of the public accounts committee took evidence from charities and local authorities, which told MPs they had seen sharp increases in rent arrears and food bank usage among new recipients of universal credit, not least because of the five-week wait for the first payment.But the committee said McVey’s department had repeatedly been unresponsive to on-the-ground evidence about the practical problems with universal credit, and what it called the “unacceptable hardship” faced by many."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03e1ddc820ceb04de953575dd3a55baf0b272c3e/74_249_1866_1119/master/1866.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91fc17d89e66ca9b532b1a1f1d96080f","title":"ben stokes looks future world cup ashes england cricket team sri lanka","story":"Ben Stokes hopes his future England performances will become what he is eventually remembered for as he looks to put the events of last year’s much-publicised street fight firmly in the rear-view mirror.After being found not guilty of affray at Bristol crown court during the summer, the England all-rounder has one last hurdle to overcome as both he and teammate Alex Hales go before a cricket disciplinary hearing in early December.But speaking at the England team hotel in Colombo before Saturday’s one-off Twenty20 in Sri Lanka, Stokes insisted his mind is now solely on delivering for his country and not on any sporting sanctions that may result.Asked about missing last winter’s Ashes, Stokes replied: “That’s the thing about going forward. Everything you do from here onwards is what people will hopefully remember. That’s what I’m trying to do. As I said, it’s a big year coming up, two important things – a World Cup and an Ashes – and with them both being in England it’s really exciting.”Despite the not guilty verdict in August, the England head coach, Trevor Bayliss, said the fallout from events in Bristol on 25 September had likely serve as a “wake-up call” for Stokes and added that a show of public contrition may be advisable at some stage.With the Cricket Discipline Commission’s verdict yet to be determined – he and Hales are due in front of the panel on 5 and 7 December – Stokes is keeping his counsel for now and there has been the suggestion that this is to avoiding prejudicing the process.Instead he intends to let his cricket do the talking and despite a rain-affected one-day series against Sri Lanka, there are signs his best form is returning. Both an unbeaten 35 in the shortened third match, and his 67 from 60 balls in the fifth, saw him far more fluent at the crease and the England management are encouraged.In the summer’s Test 3-1 series victory against India Stokes throttled back with the bat, scoring at a strike-rate of 41 due to the seaming conditions. The 27-year-old believes this adaptability will serve him well down the line, not least looking ahead to the Tests with Sri Lanka that start on 6 November in Galle.“It’s just playing to the situation. We’re always getting told ‘go out and express yourself, play with freedom’ but sometimes you have to understand the way you need to play with the situation in the game.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d65a2ac79edf28b9d305057fbb6df6f642e9e122/123_221_4402_2641/master/4402.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5f881238839024b41f4c8c1f2b7abdc","title":"england new zealand first test sam tomkins jake connor","story":"Wigan full-back Sam Tomkins will make his England return after a four-year absence against New Zealand – at half-back, alongside club teammate George Williams.The England head coach Wayne Bennett has announced his starting line-up for Saturday’s first Test in Hull, with the major talking point being the recall of Tomkins, who will move to Catalans Dragons for the start of next season.Tomkins has largely played at full-back for Wigan in their run to the Super League title this season, but St Helens’ Jonny Lomax is preferred in that position by Bennett.Another eye-catching selection is that of Hull FC utility back Jake Connor at centre ahead of Mark Percival. Although his preferred position is stand-off, Connor is confident he can justify his selection in the three-quarters. “I’ve played a lot of centre in my time,” he said. “It’s not new to me. I’ll try to do the same job that I’ve always done.”The only debutant on Saturday will be the Wigan centre Oliver Gildart. “It’s not sunk in yet, I think the nerves will hit me tomorrow building up to the game,” Gildart said. “Obviously it’s all new to me so I’m kind of just taking it in my stride. It’s a massive honour, there’s some great players in this squad and I’m really privileged to get my chance.”Michael Maguire, the New Zealand head coach, first switched Tomkins to full-back while he was coach at Wigan, and has warned his team to be wary of his former charge.“He’s like a rubber man – he bounces all over the place and he loves to show the ball,” Maguire added. “We’ve going to have to make sure we’re very strong defensively.”Maguire has named the same 17-man squad that upset Australia earlier this month, winning 26-24 in Auckland. Eleven of Maguire’s players have fewer than 10 international caps, with Shaun Johnson the most experienced starter with 26 caps.England team for first Test: Lomax Makinson, Gildart, Connor, McGillvary Williams, Tomkins Hill, Hodgson, Graham, Whitehead, Bateman, O’Loughlin.

LeBron James changes the balance of power in the NBA every time he moves teams. Serena Williams has forced tennis to confront issues of racism and sexism. Neymar’s contract demands may soon affect global GDP rankings.We should now include a 4ft 8in 21-year-old on that list. Through a perfect storm of circumstances – a strong claim to be the greatest ever in her sport and a series of misadventures in her national federation – she wields incomparable influence. She’s Simone Biles, and she is changing gymnastics in innumerable ways.When the American competes at the World Gymnastics Championships in Doha this week, few of her competitors will have any hope of challenging her. On the mat and various apparatuses, she is beyond comparison. She literally rewrote gymnastics’ history at the age of 16, when she added a new, fiendishly difficult leaping tumble to the sport’s code of points in the same year she won the first of her three successive World Championship all-round titles. She was one of the stars – in any sport – of the 2016 Rio Olympics, winning four gold medals. She took a break in 2017, but has returned to competition this year and is as dominant as ever.It’s away from the gyms and arena that she’s truly flexing her muscles. She has spoken about her difficult childhood – she entered foster care at the age of three before she was eventually adopted by her maternal grandparents – and has worked with organisations that help children in similar situations.But it was this month, when USA Gymnastics appointed a new interim presidentCEO, that Biles’s influence became clear. Mary Bono, a former gymnast and Republican congresswoman, was appointed to the position on 12 October. She didn’t last long. The next day, gymnastics fans found a tweet of Bono drawing over a Nike swoosh in response to the company’s campaign featuring quarterback-turned-activist Colin Kaepernick. Biles offered a short but pointed response on Twitter: “Don’t worry, it’s not like we needed a smarter usa gymnastics president or any sponsors or anything,” she wrote.Bono promptly deleted her original tweet, but a headline in Deadspin summed up the situation in US gymnastics: “Simone Biles Has All The Power, And She Knows It.” Fellow Olympic champion Aly Raisman then followed up Biles’s lead. She attacked Bono for her ties to a consulting firm she accused of failing to act on the Larry Nassar sexual abuse scandal while it worked with USA Gymnastics. On 16 October, Bono resigned. Under fire from Biles and Raisman, her reign hadn’t even lasted a week.Even before the Bono incident Biles had emerged as a fearsome force for change within USA Gymnastics in the wake of the Nassar sexual-abuse scandal, which shook the sport to its core. Biles wasn’t the first athlete to say she was a survivor of Nassar, the longtime USA Gymnastics team doctor who pled guilty to sexual-abuse charges and is now serving an effective life sentence for his crimes. That would be Rachel Denhollander, who broke the long-standing silence on Nassar and eventually opened the floodgates for a wave of survivors to tell their stories, many of them Olympic medalists.Raisman has taken the most direct approach to confronting not just Nassar but those who failed to stop him. In a blistering testimony at Nassar’s sentencing hearing in January, Raisman calmly and firmly ripped into the disgraced doctor before she turned her attention to USA Gymnastics and the US Olympic Committee for their failure to stop the abuse. In March, she sued both organizations along with Nassar and two former USA Gymnastics officials – president Steve Penny and board chairman Paul Parilla. (Penny was arrested this month, accused of tampering with evidence in the Nassar investigation.)While Biles did not appear at Nassar’s hearing to tell her story of abuse under his care, she has made a powerful impact, using her position as the sport’s biggest star to change gymnastics, often with an economy of words.In August, two days before the US Championships, Biles responded to a question about the overhauled management of USA Gymnastics – including Kerry Perry, who had been named presidentCEO in November 2017 and had been criticised for her inaction over the Nassar scandal. With a succinct but withering statement Biles said: “Hopefully, it’s going in the right direction but nobody can know until Kerry Perry speaks up. It’s kind of hard.” Biles was then asked if Perry should step up and speak more. “Yes,” Biles said. “It’s her job.” Less than a month later Perry resigned.Biles’s comments certainly weren’t the only factor in Perry’s exit. Raisman and Denhollander spoke up again when USA Gymnastics hired Mary Lee Tracy, a coach who complimented Nassar shortly after his indictment in 2016, as elite development coordinator. Each called the appointment “a slap in the face.” But throughout this time, Biles was finding her voice. While sweeping the gold medals at the US Championships in August, she wore a teal leotard, intentionally selecting a color that has emerged as a symbol of strength for sexual-abuse survivors.Biles’s implicit support of Kaepernick during Bono’s attack on the quarterback is interesting. Although the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback’s activism has attracted far more attention than Biles’s own foray into social issues, her impact has arguably been more concrete. Kaepernick deserves immense credit for influencing the national conversation on race and freedom of expression in America, but the NFL has dug in its heels on national anthem protests and he is still without a team. Biles, in contrast, has helped remove two CEOs from her sport’s governing body, advocated for abuse survivors and arrives in Doha as the finest gymnast in the world.She clearly isn’t going away either: she has spoken of her desire to compete at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. It’s a safe bet she won’t be silent – or powerless – in the run-up to the Games, and perhaps for years to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0956ad98f2497d6ea9ac89e02cde773ed217e19b/0_221_3313_1988/master/3313.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44985a8615c4e5645deb0961e6cf2ac9","title":"wta finals kerber v stephens live","story":"American will take on Pliskova in WTA semi-finals after defeating Kerber 6-3, 6-3 while Bertens also advances following Osaka’s injury retirementSloane Stephens increasingly looks the player to beat at the WTA Finals after the 2017 US Open champion maintained her dominance over world No 2 Angelique Kerber to win 6-3, 6-3 and advance to the semi-finals.Stephens holds a 5-1 record over the German, who hasn’t beaten the American since 2012 and rarely in Singapore did she look likely to reverse the trend losing in an hour and 40 minutes. Following the injury retirement of Naomi Osaka in the opening game of the final round robin matches in the Red Group, both players were in a position to reach the last four with victory.Stephens had to save break points in each of her first two service games before breaking Kerber twice to surge into a 5-2 lead, although the 25-year-old then missed an easy forehand on her first set point. That error threatened to prove costly when Kerber broke serve to keep the set alive, but the left-hander promptly lost her own serve for a third time to gift Stephens the set.t The second set then threatened to get away from the German as Stephens was in position to go 4-1 with a second break but she wasted the opportunity allowing Kerber to draw level at 3-3. However, her resistance could only last so long as an accumulation of unforced errors and poor first serves prevented any kind of pressure being put on Stephens whose defence was relentless and her groundstrokes ruthless. Two more breaks of serve then helped Stephens secure her third victory of the week and set up a semi-final with big-serving Czech Karolina Pliskova. The other last four ties will be contested between unbeaten Elina Svitolina and Kiki Bertens of the Netherlands who earned a straight-sets ‘win’ over Osaka following her injury. Osaka took to the court with tape on the back of her leg for a problem that flared up in her defeat to Kerber on Wednesday and was competitive for half a set before opting to withdraw after Bertens took the opener 6-3. The US Open champion said: “I was told I shouldn’t really do much. I should just rest for a few weeks. So I think that’s what I’m going to do,” she said of the injury. “I’m looking forward to going back home (to Florida). I haven’t been home since the U.S. Open. So definitely looking forward to going back.” Here was the winning point...Stephens speaks ... briefly ... on beating Kerber and facing PliskovaShe’s a really tricky player because there are a lot of angles and spins. I was up 30-0 in a lot of games and it was tough not being able to take all those break points. She’s (Pliskova) got a big serve so I’ll have to find a way to neutralise that. Just play my game, really. Stephens is also enjoying the shopping and tea in Singapore. Before we hear from the players, here is your semi-final lineup...Stephens has been guilty in this second set of letting Kerber off the hook too often but there was no sign of that in the defining game. Just a solid set of groundstrokes, forcing errors and it all looked far too easy, serving to love. All over in an hour and 40 minutes. That was hard work for Kerber. She was in early trouble with a double fault and then a forehand into the net. There wasn’t much let-up after as a lazy looking baseline shot drifted just out for three break points. Stephens finds the net with the first, Kerber holds the second advancing to flick a winner into the corner and on the third, the American cuts the ball downwards into the net. After doing the hard work, though, she can’t see the game out an under-hit drop shot, more first serves missing the target, a groundstroke into the net, all culminating in a fourth break point which she claims as Kerber blasts a forehand into the net. Stephens serving for the match. Emphasis on Stephens to regain control of a match she was cruising through and this game indicates she can do just that. Sending Kerber from right to left, and back again, there were some notable winners. The pressure is now back on the German who simply has to hold her next service game. Just when the pressure needed to be applied, Kerber fails to get in her first three serves and Stephens is able to feel her way back into control taking a 0-30 lead, without much effort. The next point required it, however, with Kerber digging in to win a 19-shot rally as Stephens finds the net. Parity is restored after Stephens overhit drop shot offers a gimme on a favourable bounce for Kerber to crash home. She then wins the next two points to level the set. Kerber breaks! Stephens was turning the vice and Kerber didn’t look so much look pained, just exasperated as she didn’t seem to have the answers ... but the American can be her own worst enemy sometimes and despite looking in control gaves the German two break points, with the No 1 seed converting the second and greeting it with a sizeable cry of, “come on!” Newsflash: Sloane Stephens hits a tennis ball very hard. So much so, Kerber, somewhat playfully, swipes at clean air as she attempts to reach one groundstroke. The German holds serve at 30-40 and then an overhead smash (which threatened to go out) gives her advantage but, oh Angie, a double fault lets Stephens back in. A strangely misdirected backhand, under little pressure, gives the American another break point but, my oh my, that is then leathered waaaaay into the backcourt on the full. Kerber’s unforced error gives Stephens a third bite at the apple ... but, no, she’s long again. Stephens wastes a fourth break point, inexplicably finding the bet with her backhand. She gets a fifth but Kerber stings a forehand a winner. A sixth is saved on the backhand. But on the seventh, Kerber clips a drop shot into the net. 10 minutes of error-ridden and scrappy tennis ... Kerber is struggling now.Stephens’ movement is a little conservative (and that’s being kind) and the German maintains her energy on the baseline to take an early advantage at 30-15. However, Kerber can’t keep the pressure on and a net cord gets Stephens back into the game. At deuce, Stephens fluffs one drop shot but on the second attempt gets her angles just right and then the German goes long with a looping forehand. Kerber was right in that game but Stephens’ defence remains relentless. Some brighter signs for Kerber who delivered a nice forehand winner on the move but Stephens, for the most part was in control, emphasised at how easily she seems to be getting to the ball and then finding areas beyond her opponent’s reach. Kerber’s scream in celebration after another big winner down the line for 40-30 prove a little premature as the game goes to deuce and that first serve lets her down again ... as does her drop shot. However, Stephens lets her back in and then Kerber’s wonderful inside out, sliced backhand spins all over the place for a smart hold. Kerber is getting annoyed out there, whacking her racquet against her trainers as Stephens is comfortable in the opening game. Everything Kerber is doing right now seems to be reactive, as opposed to earlier in the match when she was trying to force the issues. Stephens leads the winners 17-7. “Keep her moving and let your forehand dictate play” is the overall message from Stephens’ coach Sylvester Black. Kerber breaks back! Stephens gets a huge slice of luck with a net cord which spoons up and then spins over for 30-15. An ace then creates two set points. She’s long on the first one, Kerber busy in her returns. The second one then also sneaks out, just as her backhand looked to be crawling inside the line. Kerber just cannot catch a break and moves into the net to force the issue but a passing volley creates a third set point but, my word, that is an open goal ... a door marked, “here’s the set, put this away” instead her forehand with the whole court to aim at is wide. Kerber is then able to fashion a break point (her eighth) and takes it when she needed it the most.Stephens breaks! Ouch ... Kerber was never in that game with some loose and uncontrolled groundstrokes and quickly gave Stephens three break points. She only needed one, pouncing on a drop shot to flick a winner to the German’s right. Stephens already serving for the set but it hasn’t looked as comfortable as the score suggests. Good opening recovery from Kerber, really finding the angles on her forehand to keep Stephens moving and winning the first point. A series of errors then takes the game to deuce where Kerber claims another break as Stephens is long with a deep backhand. But after a devilishly good first serve, she then drills a backhand right on the line to save it. However, another long backhand going cross-court presents Kerber with another break (her seventh overall) ... guess what, she can’t take it. Stephens then sees it out to open up some daylight. Stephens breaks! Not sure if that last game took it out of Kerber, mentally and physically, but she’s sloppy with two early unforced errors. She’s temporarily let out of jail, though, by a poor Stephens drop shot. However, Stephens earns her first break points of the match with a ripping backhand and then completes the job, moving to the net and smashing a winner into the corner. A mini epic, as Stephens saves three break points. Kerber was a little unlucky but she is bringing real energy to this match. How long she can keep it up remains to be seen but she’s busy along that baseline and is trying to fashion opportunities for winners. One forehand, in particular, which brings up 15-30 leaves Stephens completely flat-footed. Stephens finds some extra kick in her serve to take the game to deuce but then she double faults, presenting a break point. After Stephens saves, Kerber then delivers the shot of the match so far with a stretching backhand cross-court winner to set up another break point. She finds the net and offers a face of pure disappointment but then a fun little net exchange sees Stephens long with a lob. But again, Kerber can’t see it out and Stephens goes onto hold. Stephens’ forehand is gaining velocity and getting some traction as Kerber is doing all of the early running allowing the American to pick her spots. However, the German keeps playing the percentages and while she may not have the same level of power, gets the job done and it’s a comfortable hold in the end. After starting the game with a poor forehand, a mammoth rally, full of aggressive groundstrokes, allows Stephens to restore parity. Kerber bursts to the net to crunch home a forehand winner to take a 30-15 lead. Stephens is then long to give the No 1 seed two break points. She saves one with a stylish forehand on the move and the second as Kerber finds the net. At deuce, it’s much better from Stephens as she takes complete control of both rallies to hold. Stephens goes after the Kerber serve straight away, moving well and delivering some big groundstrokes but a wayward forehand and an overhit backhand lob give the German a platform to take the game, however she double faults for deuce. Stephens’ whipped forehand is long again and then Kerber sees it out with a crashing forehand winner which the American can’t reach. Stephens and Kerber discuss each other’s game...Stephens (who won the toss and has elected to receive serve first) ...The first time I played Angie was at Indian Wells (in 2012) and I was up and ended up losing. I play well, I matchup well against her. In the past, I have played well against on good surfaces. I’m just going to go out and do my best. It is not so easy to play against Sloane, she is playing incredible and has so much talent. It will be a really tough match. But it’s great to play her because it’s always interesting and you have to push yourself to the limits. The players are out on court! About to begin their warm-up. It’s very noisy. Stephens is wearing earbuds. Clearly not happy with the tunes. A quick reminder as to the semi-final outcomes of this match...Just to revisit this link in my preamble ... it’s definitely worth a watch. Sloane Stephens revealing a love of Lionel, bingo and embalming. Yup. Not wanting to be a doom-monger (but I am going to be) surrounding Kerber’s chances but along with her dismal 1-4 record against Stephens, she also suffered a lower back injury in beating Naomi Osaka on Wednesday...If you’re twiddling your thumbs waiting for the match to start, then why not put them to good use with our Sports Quiz of the Week (a mediocre 710 over here)...Elsewhere, reviews could be expanded to include double-bounces and net touches with the ATP trialling the new system at the Next-Gen Finals in Milan from November 6-10. This, from Phil Casey of the Press Association...A new form of video review will be tested at next month’s ATP Next Gen Finals, allowing players to challenge a wider range of decisions. Using the same Hawk-Eye technology which is used on disputed line calls, the experiment will cover double-bounces, net touches or shots played before the ball has crossed the net. In such situations players will be able to call for a review, with no limits on the number of requests, with a video operator then sending the relevant footage to the chair umpire’s table. As with line calls, the same images will appear on the big screen in the venue. Gayle David Bradshaw, executive vice president, ATP rules and competition, said: “Controversy with these types of decisions are rare, but when they do occur they can be particularly unsettling for players. “We do not expect a lot of challenges, but should any instances arise, this technology will ensure the correct decision is reached.” Future use of video review could also include decisions on whether to award the point or to replay it in the case of a corrected line call by an official. In other, considerably more serious, injury news Caroline Wozniacki revealed yesterday that she’s been diagonsed with rheumatoid arthritis...Speaking in her post-match presser, Bertens, who led 6-3, said...I saw her in the match before that she was struggling a little bit with the hamstring, and of course she was taped today, but I think in the beginning she was still okay. It’s never easy or never nice to win a match like this, but it is what it is. I’ll take it and I’ll take my rest, and I have some more recovery time for tomorrow.Regarding Naomi Osaka’s injury, it seems it was her left hamstring. Although that’s unconfirmed.Hello... Noted Lionel Richie fanatic Sloane Stephens takes on Angelique Kerber in the final round robin match at the Finals and, joy of joys, for you, me and the good people of the WTA, there’s plenty at stake! Naomi Osaka’s fantastic season came to a rather sad end earlier today when she had to retire hurt from her match against Kiki Bertens, which has put the latter into the semi-finals – the first Dutchwoman since Brenda Schultz-McCarthy in 1995 to do so, which is nice. Aaaaanyway, as a result, both Stephens and Kerber need to win to follow Bertens into the last four, with Elina Svitolina and Karolína Pliskova having qualified yesterday. Stephens has been impressive, beating Bertens and Osaka – albeit needing three sets in both – and victory over Kerber would ensure she tops the Red Group. Should the German, who defeated Osaka but lost to Bertens, triumph she would advance as runner-up with Stephens eliminated.In terms of head-to-head records, history would lean heavily towards a Stephens win given she’s beaten Kerber in four of their five encounters with the only loss coming at Indian Wells in 2012 when she was just 19 and beginning to make her breakthrough on Tour. In those four straight victories, the American is also yet to drop a set and Kerber’s resistance has amounted to only 16 games. Play begins at 12.30pm BST"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b91345fa4da6091edf006e543e33cd74f71224b/0_133_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47d21651cde17b700b14e1d45bdcd8dc","title":"us troops mexico border caravan","story":"Kirstjen Nielsen says soldiers have ‘no intention’ of shooting migrants as Jim Mattis expected to sign orderHomeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said American soldiers have “no intention” of shooting migrants who try to cross into the US from Mexico – at least for the time being – but they will all be apprehended, as Donald Trump moves towards a plan to close the border.The Trump administration on Thursday announced it is planning to dispatch at least 800 active duty troops to the southern border, at the direction of a president who has sought to transform fears about immigration into electoral gains in the November midterms, as a caravan of thousands of migrants makes its way through Mexico.The US defense secretary, Jim Mattis, is expected to sign an order sending the troops to the border, bolstering national guard forces already there.And on Thursday evening, in an interview with Fox News while visiting the border in Arizona, Nielsen said: “We do not have any intention right now to shoot at people, but they will be apprehended, however.”The government is weighing an order to deny even asylum applications at a fortified border, by asserting emergency powers that would almost certainly face challenges in the US courts, the Washington Post reported.Nielsen added: “But I also take my officer and agent, their own person safety, extraordinarily seriously. They do have the ability of force to defend themselves.”The action comes as Donald Trump has spent recent days calling attention to the caravan of Central Americans, many fleeing violence or extortion by gangs and grinding poverty, including thousands of parents with babies or older relatives, slowly making their way by foot into southern Mexico, but still more than 1,000 miles from US soil. Many are aware they are not welcome by the Trump administration but have no idea how their journey is stoking an election cycle political firestorm in the US and inspiring drastic plans from the government.Trump, who made fear about immigrants a major theme of his 2016 election campaign, has been eager to make it a top issue heading into the 6 November midterm elections, which will determine control of Congress. The president and senior White House officials have long believed the issue is key to turning out his base of supporters.The additional troops would provide logistical and other support to the border patrol, said the US official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a plan that had not been finalized and formally announced.It’s not unusual for the national guard to help with border security. Active duty troops, however, are rarely deployed within the US except for domestic emergencies like hurricanes or floods. Trump has used the caravan to bolster his election-season warnings that the US is being infiltrated by illegal immigrants “pouring across the border”, whom he has painted with a sinister brush.He has claimed, without any apparent basis in fact, that “Middle Easterners” were among the group. At rallies and on Twitter, Trump has tried to portray the Democrats as pro-illegal immigration, even claiming, with no evidence, that Democrats organized the caravan.He tweeted Thursday: “Democrat inspired laws make it tough for us to stop people at the border” and said he was using the military to respond to what he called a “National Emergency”.Most of the migrants in the group are Hondurans, seeking to escape poverty and violence, and include families with children.The caravan swelled to about 7,000 people after crossing the Mexican border on 19 October, but sickness, fear and police harassment have whittled down its numbers.Trump tweeted a direct message to the migrants Thursday, urging them to return home.The migrants have largely been disconnected from news reports about them. When asked about Trump’s tweets, they have generally responded that he should stop attacking them and said they would keep heading north.Candy Guillermo, a 37-year-old migrant in the caravan, said she and the children in group would be considered a threat. “Trump should be more humanitarian,” she said. “We only want to give our kids a better future.”Migrants who do reach the US border can claim asylum under US and international law. Those who clear an initial screening are often released until their cases are decided in immigration court, which can take several years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45548ae4a410f563e06eab5e27b8143ee02a84bd/0_216_4928_2956/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf6e49c08f603fdc40b08d5490ec9d98","title":"pipe bombs false flag claims ann coulter rush limbaugh conspiracy theories","story":"Ann Coulter, Rush Limbaugh and Michael Savage suggested Democrats sent packages to elicit sympathy ahead of midtermsA range of high-profile conservatives have embraced a conspiracy theory that mail bombs sent to liberal public figures are a “false flag” attack by leftwingers. Many have also claimed that the attacks are intended to elicit sympathy for Democrats ahead of the looming midterm elections.Authorities are yet to identify a suspect or motive in the bombings, which have seen 12 pipe bombs sent to a range of figures from former president Barack Obama to Bill and Hillary Clinton to financier George Soros and even to the out-spoken actor Robert De Niro. All the suspects have one thing in common: they have been targets of Donald Trump’s ire.Nevertheless, without evidence, a raft of ostensibly mainstream conservatives joined more overtly conspiracist outlets in either expressing skepticism that conservatives would damage their own cause, or making outright accusations that the left are orchestrating the bombing campaign in order to sabotage Republicans.In a now-deleted tweet, on Thursday Fox Business TV host Lou Dobbs wrote: “Fake News ― Fake Bombs. Who could possibly benefit by so much fakery?” Dobbs has a close relationship with Trump and the two reportedly speak frequently on the phone.Elsewhere on Fox, three guest analysts suggested that the bombs were “false flag” attacks.Also on Thursday, president Donald Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr, liked a tweet which read in part: “FAKE BOMBS MADE TO SCARE AND PICK UP BLUE SYMPATHY VOTE.” In the past he has liked tweets questioning whether Parkland survivor, David Hogg, was actually present at the Florida school shooting that led him to become an anti-gun campaigner.On Wednesday, after a caller said the bomb plot didn’t “pass the smell test”, leading talk radio host Rush Limbaugh asked rhetorically: “Would it make a lot of sense for a Democrat operative or Democrat-inculcated lunatic to do it? Because things are not working out the way they thought.”His fellow rightwing broadcaster, Michael Savage, opined the same day that that there was a “high probability that the whole thing had been set up as a false flag to gain sympathy for the Democrats”, and to distract from the so-called “caravan” of migrants currently in southern Mexico.Far-right and anti-immigrant media personality Ann Coulter, meanwhile, claimed on Wednesday that the “bombs are a liberal tactic”. Conservative author and filmmaker Dinesh D’Souza, whose recent work has drawn parallels between Democrats and Nazis, tweeted: “I hear the FBI squeezed lemon juice on the suspicious packages and a very faint lettering revealed a single word: DEMOCRATS.”Those further down the conservative media pecking order were also on message with “false flag” allegations.Trump-aligned podcaster and social media star Bill Mitchell described the bombs as “Soros astro-turfing”, referring to the billionaire philanthropist (and magnet for conspiracy theorists) who was the first target of the bombing campaign. He added that the attacks were “Pure BS”.Rightwing cartoonist Ben Garrison drew a cartoon entitled Raising a false flag, featuring Hillary Clinton, CNN media reporter Brian Stelter, and former CIA director John Brennan – all bombing targets – raising a flag shaped like a mail bomb. Underneath the flag, he has George Soros exclaiming: “See? We’re victims of Trump’s hate!”In the past, “false flag” theories have mostly been aired in more openly conspiratorial media outlets like Alex Jones’s Infowars.The term has been used by Jones and other conspiracy theorists to allege that violent attacks have been carried out not by their apparent authors, but by powerful, manipulative actors seeking to deceive observers and hide their own responsibility. Its adoption this week by a broad range of right-wingers suggests an increasing openness to conspiracy theory in more mainstream conservative media.Jones was himself banned from most social media platforms earlier this year over his long-standing claims that the Sandy Hook school shooting was faked, and employed “crisis actors” in order to build support for gun control in the United States.Jones was also a part of the so-called 911 Truth Movement, members of which asserted that the 2001 attack on the World Trade center in New York had been a “false flag” on a grand scale. Many truthers alleged that the attack was orchestrated by the Bush Administration in order to provide a justification for the invasion of Iraq.On Wednesday, just hours after multiple bombs had arrived at the homes of former public officials and the offices of media companies, Jones alleged that the bombs had been planted by leftist antifascist or “antifa groups”, in order to “smear conservatives who support President Trump”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8e946ff2f633fe797dbe30efe92685556751a27/0_302_2016_1210/master/2016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61c4ca65e66d59895bf0e4861e0e2642","title":"suspicious package pipe bombs latest found cory booker florida","story":"A man in southern Florida has been arrested in connection with the suspected pipe bombs that were sent to political figures including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.“We can confirm one person is in custody,” Sarah Isgur Flores, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said on Twitter.Federal agents were surrounding a vehicle in Plantation after news of the arrest was announced.Two more suspicious packages were discovered in the US on Friday, addressed to a Democratic senator and the country’s former intelligence chief and further escalating what authorities have described as a domestic terrorism campaign.The packages were sent to Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence. There have now been 12 packages found this week, after pipe bombs were sent to former president Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and several other Democratic political figures.“The #FBI has confirmed an 11th package has been recovered in Florida, similar in appearance to the others, addressed to Sen. Cory Booker,” the FBI said on Twitter early Friday, just minutes before a 12th package was found, in New York.Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, said at an event in Washington that federal agents were “working tirelessly” to catch the sender of the packages. “I can assure you that we are dedicating every available resource to this effort,” said Sessions.But Donald Trump responded by casting doubt on the attacks and focusing on political concerns.“Republicans are doing so well in early voting, and at the polls, and now this ‘Bomb’ stuff happens and the momentum greatly slows - news not talking politics. Very unfortunate, what is going on. Republicans, go out and vote!” he said on Twitter.The 11th package was discovered in or near Opa-locka, Florida, sources told ABC News.Investigators trying to find the perpetrator behind the spate of explosive devices have zeroed in on the postal facility in Opa-locka, which the packages may have passed through, according to ABC. Forensic evidence found on the parcels and US Postal Service images of mail drew investigators to south Florida.And in New York, also on Friday morning, authorities discovered another suspicious package at a Manhattan post office.It was addressed to Clapper at the offices of CNN, but was intercepted at a postal facility in the Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood before reaching the network’s offices a few blocks further uptown, CNN reported. Previously, CNN’s Manhattan office was evacuated on Wednesday when another pipe bomb was sent there, meant for former CIA director John Brennan.Both former intelligence officials have become outspoken critics of Trump.“We are responding to a report of a suspicious package in the vicinity of West 52nd Street and 8th Avenue, #Manhattan. Please avoid the area and expect a police presence and heavy traffic,” the New York police department said in a tweet.Clapper on Friday said the packages were part of campaign of “domestic terrorism” intended to sow fear and intimidate people.“This is not going to silence the administration’s critics,” Clapper told CNN. “But anyone who has in any way been a public critic of President Trump needs to be on extra alert and take some precautions particularly with respect to mail.”Clapper praised the FBI for its work on the investigation and for persevering in the face of abuse from the president. Trump has accused the FBI of being involved in a “deep state” conspiracy to undermine him and of botching an inquiry into private email server used by Hillary Clinton. “Will the FBI ever recover its once stellar reputation?” Trump asked in a tweet in August.The governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, said Trump’s reaction to the attempted attacks was “wholly inappropriate” and showed he had “never fully made the transition” to being presidential. “Am I hopeful that the zebra changes his or her stripes today? No,” Cuomo said on CNN.Cuomo said the hunt for the person or persons behind the bombs is “making significant progress”. While the devices did not explode and it is unclear whether they were intended to, Cuomo said they were genuine explosives.“No one can say that they were fake bombs. These were dangerous devices that could explode,” he said.A suspected pipe bomb was also discovered at the offices of the actor Robert De Niro in lower Manhattan on Thursday.“I thank God no one’s been hurt, and I thank the brave and resourceful security and law enforcement people for protecting us. There’s something more powerful than bombs, and that’s your vote. People must vote!” De Niro said in a statement.De Niro’s office is in a complex in the trendy Tribeca neighborhood that also includes the restaurant he owns, the Tribeca Grill, an entertainment industry favorite, which opened normally. It also comprises the offices of the Tribeca film festival, which De Niro pioneered as a boost for lower Manhattan after the 911 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center just a few blocks south, and in addition used to house Harvey Weinstein’s downtown office, too, on another floor."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f021d5d158195249562ab3c772c6589da6d2c44e/0_316_3813_2287/master/3813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eecc7105eae582260c524015220b42b6","title":"armistice day 100 years on share your letters stories and photographs","story":"Whether your family members or friends were in active service, or in some supporting role at home or abroad, we’d like to hear their storiesSunday 11 November this year will mark 100 years since the armistice treaty was signed between first world war allies and Germany, bringing to an end four years of war in western Europe.On that day people in Britain celebrated by pouring out onto the streets and gathering in large places.

Joyous, of course, unless you are a parent of small children, own pets, are working a night-shift over the weekend, or don’t like the trade off of earlier sunsets for a bit more morning light.2018 may mark one of the final times that the continent of Europe changes the clocks back in unison with the UK – or indeed at all, as moves are afoot to abolish daylight saving time in the EU.Since 2002, EU Directive 200084EC has regulated the time change between winter and summer time in the EU, stating that the last weekend in March and the last weekend in October should be the switchover dates. But a 2017 report by the European parliament into the practice has led to the European parliament voting that daylight savings time arrangement be reconsidered, allowing member states to opt out of changing their clocks. Some non-EU European countries, like Russia, Turkey, Belarus and Iceland, have already abandoned the practice.The argument in favour of the harmonising the clock change across the EU is that it helps the single market to function, and is beneficial to the transport sector, especially cross-border, while also making some energy savings.But scientists and politicians have become increasingly worried on the impact it has on the human sleep cycle. In 2016 an investigation by the German Bundestag concluded that “the process of adaptation to the time change might be more difficult for some people than has been assumed in earlier years”.Researchers had previously thought that the clock change, particularly in spring, caused people to suffer minor jet-lag style symptoms for a couple of days after the change. They now think, according to the Bundestag report, that the effects can last up to four weeks, and that “for some people the process of adaptation itself takes place only insufficiently or not at all”.While not the highest consideration in Brexit talks over the Irish border, it raises the possibility that in the future Dublin could have to choose between abolishing daylight savings time and creating a time-zone border with Northern Ireland, or retaining it and being out of step with the time zones of some fellow EU states.Changing the clocks seems set to stay in the UK. It is just over 100 years since the concept of changing the clocks was introduced by the 1916 Summer Time Act, and there doesn’t appear to be any great groundswell of opinion among British politicians about changing domestic arrangements for British summer time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66f1cfe1a2a73c01bdd3dbbe8e824bb13a72842e/0_370_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5fd635b4d898ad3823725ee1d7d3fae","title":"from forgotten breed to game of thrones how one woman saved icelands goats","story":"Thanks to pioneering farmer Jóhanna Thorvaldsdóttir, a heritage breed facing extinction now graces Reykjavík’s top menus – via an appearance in the HBO showIn Reykjavík, Icelandic goat is increasingly appearing on the menus of the city’s best restaurants. At the contemporary restaurant Nostra, dried goat hearts get shaved over grilled cucumber, while at Dill, Iceland’s first Michelin star restaurant, goat cheese is served alongside beets and crowberries.Krauma, a geothermal bath and spa facility in the western part of the country, has become one of the biggest buyers of products from Háafell, Iceland’s first commercial goat farm. One of its signature dishes is an Icelandic goat platter, with thinly sliced goat meat that has been cured with thyme, salt and sugar like a carpaccio, as well as rosemary smoked goat, goat sausage, goat feta cheese and pickled vegetables.“We try to keep it local, and people are curious about the goat,” says Franklin Margrétarson, the chef of Krauma’s restaurant.For the first time since Háafell’s owner Jóhanna Thorvaldsdóttir took in four Icelandic goats in 1999, she is making a profit from them. Goat cheese, ice-cream, meat and the breed’s cashmere-like hair are bringing in money to help care for the animals, as are increasing numbers of tourists stopping for a tour to see a unique heritage breed that very nearly disappeared.Brought by the Vikings from Norway when they settled 1,100 years ago, the Icelandic, or Settlement, goat was once widespread in the country. However, a mini ice age that began in the 1300s and lasted for several centuries made living in Iceland quite difficult. The fattier meat of the sheep was in high demand and goats fell out of favour. Numbers dwindled over the centuries and by 1962 there were just 70-80 left in the entire country.When Thorvaldsdóttir acquired her first four, the country’s remaining goats were spread out on more than 40 isolated farms. There were inbreeding problems and many infections. The breed could easily have become extinct.Thorvaldsdóttir decided to leave her job as a nurse, and began breeding goats. There was little income, but her flock grew to several hundred strong. Then, after Iceland’s financial collapse, interest rates sky-rocketed, and in 2014 her farm was in foreclosure.The food writer Jody Eddy, who had visited the farm while writing a book, launched a crowdfunding campaign. Conveniently, right around that time several of the goats appeared on season 4 of Game of Thrones in one scene, a dragon breathes fire over a small herd and snatches one up into the air. More than $115,000 was raised – enough to pay off the banks and keep the farm going in the short term.Thorvaldsdottir now has 250 goats on her farm, far more than anyone else in the country, and the nationwide population has grown to 1,200. Still, the breed’s survival is not guaranteed.When she first tried to sell goat meat, people gave her funny looks. “Is it even edible?” they would ask. But public opinion is changing quickly more restaurants are serving goat, and more Icelanders and tourists are acquiring a taste for it.“When saving a breed, you have to use it,” says Thorvaldsdóttir. “If they aren’t giving you income, no one will work with them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b2e95b7279e1bde31134e2eca5870ced54ac42b/0_253_3340_2003/master/3340.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7855e169a415598048cf33a8c27b1891","title":"jamal khashoggi was worried about consulate visit says fiancee","story":"Hatice Cengiz says journalist had not wanted to go to Saudi consulate on 2 OctoberThe fiancee of killed journalist Jamal Khashoggi has said that he was worried about having to visit the Saudi consulate in Istanbul for his fateful appointment, but he told her he did not think that the Saudi authorities would dare to interrogate or arrest him in a foreign country.“His local network in Turkey was very good as you know, his political network as well,” Cengiz told Turkish broadcaster Haberturk in an interview on Friday. “He thought Turkey is a safe country and if he would be held or interrogated, this issue would be swiftly solved.”The Washington Post columnist, who left Saudi Arabia for the US last year after growing fearful for his safety in his home country, was killed shortly after arriving to pick up paperwork needed for the couple’s upcoming marriage on 2 October.Cengiz, who waited outside until about 1am on the day that Khashoggi disappeared, said he had been treated well during an initial visit to the consulate the previous week.Riyadh’s varied and changing explanations for what happened to the writer have been met with international outrage, sparking the biggest diplomatic crisis for the kingdom since the 911 terrorist attacks and throwing an unwelcome spotlight on newly appointed powerful crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.Cengiz, a Turkish academic who became engaged to Khashoggi four months ago, said she has “found myself in a darkness I cannot express,” since her fiance was killed. She had asked US secretary of state Mike Pompeo, who recently called her about the case, whether he had any news that would make her happy, “but he said he didn’t”.She has not received a condolence call from Saudi officials, Cengiz added.Istanbul police said Cengiz had been placed under 24-hour police protection this week, without elaborating on the reasons why.Riyadh said for the first time on Thursday that the evidence in the criminal investigation pointed to a “premeditated” killing of the dissident journalist.The same day, Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu spoke on the phone with his US counterpart Mike Pompeo, although Ankara did not comment on the content of the call.Police in Istanbul are now focussing the search for the journalist’s remains on a well in the garden of the nearby consul general’s residence and woodland areas outside the city, but have not made progress so far.Saudi investigators have delayed their Turkish counterparts inquiries several times, notably blocking police from investigating a well on the Saudi consul general’s property. There are several avenues of investigation that have yet to be explored, Erdoğan told members of his AK party in Friday’s address.Riyadh is sending the Saudi public prosecutor to Istanbul on Sunday to assist the investigation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/039d26990ff53faf6c84a2571dbc3617fb40f112/1124_444_6185_3711/master/6185.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5a98b4de28310790e7d0a1901005fd7","title":"karen pierce uk ambassador un","story":"The first woman in the role has made headlines for her informal but frank style. As she contends with the threat of Russia and crises in Syria and Yemen, her message is clearThe lights are being switched off on the world’s stage. The United Nations security council has heard the latest horrific news from Yemen and is shutting up for the evening as the sunset reflects pink off New York’s East River. Karen Pierce, the UK’s ambassador, who fights the country’s diplomatic battles in the cockpit of the council, has just stepped away from the chamber’s famous C-shaped negotiating table and has a gap between the Yemen session and a dinner event on nuclear disarmament. Pierce tells an aide she will go to the dinner, but will not be eating. “I will, however, need a stiff drink.”While the political class back home is consumed with Brexit and finds itself derided and increasingly ignored in Europe, Britain still wields the clout of a major power at the UN. The privileges the UK acquired when it emerged as a victor of the second world war – permanent membership of the security council and the veto power that comes with it – cannot be taken away without Britain and the four other permanent members – China, France, Russia and the US – voting for it.It is Pierce’s job to wield that clout. She is the first woman to do so, a reflection of the glacial pace of change at the Foreign Office, where women have only recently been given a shot at the plum ambassadorial posts. Diplomats and observers agree she has been a robust presence since starting the job in March. Her style is resolutely direct and informal. At a climactic security council session, she wore a leather jacket and a red-and-black boa. While many British diplomats have become more taciturn as the Brexit saga has worsened and the treasured “special relationship” has become hostage to Donald Trump’s antics, Pierce has remained garrulous and relaxed around journalists.Unusually for a permanent representative, as ambassadors to the UN are called, she often addresses the security council without notes and has engaged in pointed ad lib exchanges with her Russian opposite number, Vassily Nebenzia, over Syria and the nerve agent attack on the Skripals in Salisbury. In a surreal encounter in April, the two diplomats traded barbed cultural references. Nebenzia scorned the idea that the Russians would do anything as blatant as using novichok poison in broad daylight in an English city. Anyone who watched Midsomer Murders could do better, the Russian envoy sneered. Pierce struck back with Sherlock Holmes. Allowing the Russians to take part in the Skripal investigation, she said, would be like “Scotland Yard inviting in Professor Moriarty”. Nebenzia – whose mirthless grin and shiny, bald pate would make him a passable Blofeld in any UN-themed Bond remake – countered by reading a passage from Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland in which the queen demands “sentence first – verdict afterward”. Pierce quickly retorted that her Russian colleague might be better served by the quote: “Sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.”Speaking in a small, plain room in the UN headquarters, Pierce says: “There’s a little bit of theatre in it. It’s partly about showing the Russians we can’t be pushed around. It’s good to be able to be seen to stand up to them in public in the security council and show them that the arguments don’t go their own way and that there’s a pushback on the stories and lies that they try to tell.”It is diplomacy almost as a contact sport. A week after the literary skirmish, the Russians suffered an embarrassing defeat, mustering only two other votes – from China and Bolivia – in the 15-member security council for a resolution condemning US air strikes to punish the Syrian regime for using chemical weapons. Pierce called over one of Nebenzia’s deputies, Vladimir Safronkov, a burly man who towered over her, and gleefully held up three fingers to his lapel. “Three again. You only got three,” Pierce taunted. “Just like Kosovo.” Pierce was rubbing salt in the wound. Almost 20 years ago, Safronkov was involved in a Russian effort to stop the Nato intervention in Kosovo, one that mustered the same paltry tally of votes. “It just helps the Russians to be reminded of where the bulk of UN opinion is,” Pierce says. “It’s quite an interesting indicator of where the true centre ground lies.”She adds that Safronkov took her three-fingered challenge in good humour and that she maintains a polite working relationship with her nemesis on the council, Nebenzia. “On the whole, at the moment, most of the council members get on reasonably well personally and that helps,” Pierce says. There is no point in bearing grudges, as the next day there could be a debate on another crisis where “we might want to have unity on the council so that we can help make something positive happen”.The positives have been hard to come by at the security council, the job of which is to confront the worst that humanity has to offer. It hears daily reports of barbarity in Syria or the man-made famine in Yemen. In April, the permanent representatives went to Myanmar and visited the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh, where they were plunged into a scene of human misery. “I had one girl throw herself on me. All her family, her parents and uncles and aunts, had been killed in front of her,” Pierce says. They met young boys who had been crippled by mines and were too traumatised to remember what had happened to them.She had been sceptical of the practice of security-council excursions, suspecting they were no more than diplomatic tourism, but the brutal realities of the atrocities perpetrated on the Rohingya changed her mind. “The scale was just unimaginable,” she says. At least one of the ambassadors broke down in tears. When they went to visit Aung San Suu Kyi, “she didn’t seem to comprehend the scale of what needed to be done to put this right. Accountability seemed to be something that could be dealt with in a very leisurely fashion to her,” Pierce says. Her ministers blamed the refugees for their predicament, saying they had failed to fill in their repatriation forms correctly. Pierce had met Aung San Suu Kyi years before in Switzerland and had been struck by her calm charisma. This time, she says ruefully: “I think everyone was just bitterly disappointed.”The founders of the UN envisaged the security council as a keeper of global peace, but it is an ideal that has rarely been lived up to. In almost every mass killing of recent decades, one or more of the permanent council members has been friend and protector of the killers. In Myanmar, it is China in Syria, it is Russia. In Yemen, the US, France and the UK are serving as quartermasters for the coalition, led by Saudi Arabia, whose relentless aerial bombardment has caused most of civilian deaths. The UK continues to sell arms to Riyadh through one outrage after another, including the bombing of a bus that killed 40 boys going on a school trip. For all the uproar over the cold-blooded murder of the dissident writer Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul, there are no signs that the UK will suspend sales of arms and military hardware, which were worth more than £1.1bn in 2017.“The Saudis buy their weapons from a range of countries,” Pierce says. “They would simply buy more from Russia and China if the west did not supply them with arms. But, in any event, the UK has a very strict code of conduct when it comes to arms sales to Saudi Arabia certain criteria must be met.” Ministers have to certify that Saudi Arabia is trying sufficiently hard not to kill innocent people, she adds.UK ministers, as with those in the Trump administration, have found ways to continue certifying weapons sales to Saudi Arabia in the absence of evidence that the civilian death toll from the bombing is coming down. Saudi Arabian investigators find their armed forces blameless in the overwhelming majority of cases. Britain’s role in Yemen has been condemned in parliament and by human rights groups, but the official line goes largely unchallenged at the UN, where Russia and China are reluctant to put human rights high up the agenda.The security council has remained fairly united on Yemen by focusing on humanitarian aid issues and pushing for UN-brokered negotiations. Pierce makes the distinction between Syria – which she describes as “a great power question” between Russia and the US – where the security council is ided and paralysed, and Yemen, which Pierce says is “a test case for the UN”, as its role as a potential peacebroker is acknowledged by the coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the Houthi rebels, who are backed by Iran.In the breadth and global importance of the issues covered, and the daily necessity to negotiate alliances and do diplomatic battle with adversaries, there is no job in British diplomacy like permanent representative to the UN. Pierce has served as special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, ambassador to the UN and other international organisations in Geneva and director general for political affairs at the FCO. But this job, she says, with all its raw geopolitics, is the summit. It is a role she has been preparing for for a long time. She grew up in Preston in Lancashire, “reading boy’s books and drawing fighter jets in art class”. Her northern accent was stripped away at a young age by elocution lessons. “My mother says that’s because I stammered when I was a little girl,” Pierce says, although she sounds sceptical of the explanation. In those days, having a strong regional accent was not seen as the way to get on in life.Pierce identifies the decisive moment in her early life as sitting at the breakfast table aged about 11 and staring at a photograph of an African American diplomat boarding a battleship in some sunny, foreign place. That woman was almost certainly Eleanor Hicks, an extraordinarily charismatic figure and one of the very few African American women who served in senior roles abroad for the US state department in the early 70s. Hicks was the US representative in Nice and her wit, beauty and fashion sense made her a sensation in colour magazines around the world.“I definitely remember being attracted by the blue of the sky, the white of her suit and her black skin, the grey and the whites of the sailors,” Pierce says. “It was a stunning photograph. I didn’t understand where it was, but it wasn’t Preston.”Now that Pierce has broken through all the glass ceilings of the FCO to reach the UK seat on the security council, there is a danger that she has arrived at the moment the country she represents is about to plummet in its global influence. After Brexit – the economic consequences of which could be disastrous – Britain will not be able to claim to be a bridge between the US and the EU. France will be the sole representative of the EU on the security council and therefore take the lead in most collective action the EU attempts in the council and in the UN as a whole.Pierce argues that European countries will continue to support each other at the UN on the basis of common values, rather than EU membership. “As we leave the EU, the UN will be an even bigger stage for the UK to be an active, independent force – hopefully a force for good,” she says. She can see the UK fighting to preserve a rule-based international order in the face of assaults from Russia and its allies. “I think, without blowing our own trumpet too much, most people here would think that was a good role for the UK.”And what if Brexit triggers Scottish independence and the implosion of the UK, which would presumably put its privileged seat on the security council under threat? “We’re not planning on that,” Pierce says briskly. “We’re not thinking that will happen.” Brexit has not come yet and the kingdom remains united, for now. Britain still has its little suite of rooms tucked away in the eaves of the security council and most denizens of the UN headquarters agree that Pierce has brought some much-needed confidence and flair to arguing Britain’s corner in the world’s biggest arena.Meanwhile, the sun has gone down on the East River, but Pierce still has another two events to attend before that stiff drink."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0748ac7875a6168ca31d0de6f58f406a8bd48aae/8_0_3726_2236/master/3726.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df3a70120d53f8897b026968be8b9bee","title":"party island of boracay reopens minus drinking smoking and raw sewage","story":"Philippines tourism hotspot limits visitor numbers and clears out casinos and beach vendorsThe Philippines has reopened its famous holiday island of Boracay – spruced up and newly regulated after it was closed to mend decades of harm caused by unchecked tourism.The sandy idyll was closed to visitors in April after President Rodrigo Duterte called it a “cesspool” tainted by raw sewage flowing from hotels and restaurants straight into the sea.But the rechristened resort has a slew of new rules that restrict drinking on the beach, limit the number of tourists and hotels, all while renovations continue.Under the new regime, the beachfront has been cleared of the masseuses, vendors, bonfires and even the builders of its famous photo-op sandcastles. Buildings have been bulldozed and businesses pushed back to create a 30-metre buffer zone from the waterline.All water sports, including scuba ing, jet skiing and kit-boarding, have also been banned for the time being while a marine assessment is carried out by ers and marine biologists this week.Boracay’s three casinos have also been permanently closed, in line with Duterte’s wishes.Years of overdevelopment on the tiny island – which previously handled 2 million tourists a year – had left it soiled, crowded and pushed to its limits.Cabinet and local government officials unveiled a billboard-size image of Boracay’s Puka Beach on Friday, before declaring the island “officially open to all”.\u0026nbspMichael A Martillano, the president of the island’s ing association, who is taking part in the marine assessment of Boracay this week, told the  the water quality, corals and marine life had “really improved” in the past six months.But he admitted that some of the new restrictions, particularly on parties, would be a “big adjustment for all of us”.Drinking and smoking are banned on the beach and the huge multi-day beach parties dubbed “LaBoracay” that drew tens of thousands of tourists during the 1 May labour day weekend will be a thing of the past.“Boracay has been known as one of the best destinations for a laidback island where you could party any time you want, often on the beach, but now that won’t happen in the same way,” said Martillano. “It’s still going to be fun but the old habits of doing whatever you want, whenever you want to party, that will be the biggest change and probably tough for some people.”The fact that ing and water sports remained suspended was “ a bit of a bummer for us, very frustrating”, said Martillano, but overall he was optimistic about the future of Boracay.“It’s now going to be a different mentality for everyone who will enter Boracay, whether you are a tourist, or a local or a worker on the island,” he said. “Have a good time but also take care of mother nature.”Boracay, which major tourist magazines consistently rate as among the world’s best beaches, measures a mere 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres).At peak times there would be 40,000 visitors there, spending $1bn a year but also leaving mountains of garbage and an overflowing sewer system.The new rules say 19,200 tourists will be allowed on the island at any one time, with the government aiming to enforce that by controlling the number of available hotel rooms.Nearly 400 hotels and restaurants deemed to violate local environmental laws have already been ordered closed and airlines as well as ferries have been told to restrict services.Thirty-year-old tourist Roan Tadle from Manila said: “Even if there are many renovations and it’s not yet perfect, when you go to the beach you realise that closing it for six months was worth it.”Tourism secretary Bernadette Romulo-Puyat says she hopes the new Boracay will be the start of a “culture of sustainable tourism” in the Philippines, adding other tourist destinations will be next.The Boracay Foundation, the main business industry group on the island, has not commented on the restrictions but welcomed the return of tourists.Tens of thousands of workers were left unemployed when the island’s tourism machine was deprived of visitors.“Life will go back to normal. We will have money and work again,” said Jorge Flores, 45, a hotel worker. “In the past six months, hotels here were like … a ghost town.”Other places in the region strained by mass tourism have also used closures as a tactic to protect the sites from destruction.Thai authorities announced in October that the glittering bay immortalised in the movie The Beach will be closed indefinitely to allow it to recover from the impact of tourism."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3676898.1540562730!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"builder publishes completion certs from department over unsafe schools","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Taoiseach Leo Varadkar  with Vivienne Bourke, principal of St Luke’s National School, and Tim Stapleton, principal of Tyrrelstown Educate Together, during a visit to the two schools which were closed this week over structrual concerns.

It said the role of department representatives during periodic site visits was as “client liaison”. “This should not be construed as removing the responsibility from the contractor and its design teams for detailed quality control and certification of the buildings,” it said.A spokesman said the certificates of substantial completion issued on behalf of the department were on the basis of assurances provided by the builder.Safety checks, meanwhile, are being conducted over the coming days on more than 40 schools built over the past decade or more by WBS.Officials working on behalf of the department are currently assessing the structural integrity of Letterkenny Educate Together national school.It has not publicly disclosed when checks will take place on remaining schools, though the department is aiming to complete this before the end of the mid-term breakConcerns first arose over schools built by the WBS in 2015 when fire safety defects were uncovered.

Photograph: Fianna FailPA WireSorcha McAnespy was announced as a Fianna Fáil candidate last night for the local elections in the North next May by party veteran and director of elections Éamon Ó Cuív and Senator Mark Daly. The announcement was made at a party event in Omagh, Co Tyrone, with Mr Ó Cuív and Mr Daly unveiling Ms McAnespy’s election poster. The pair also circulated a press release detailing the announcement. However, shortly afterwards the Fianna Fáil Twitter account said the party had not made a decision to contest the Northern Ireland local elections. “Despite some reports, the party has made no decision with regard to contesting the 2019 NI local elections. The party is continuing its discussions with the SDLP,” the tweet said. Fianna Fáil and the Social Democratic Labour Party (SDLP) have been in discussions about a potential merger in Northern Ireland. Options being explored include the parties running candidates on a joint ticket for the upcoming local elections and later running under the Fianna Fáil banner. On Friday a party spokeswoman said Fianna Fáil “has made no decision on whether or not it will contest elections in the North. It follows then that it has selected no candidate to contest these elections.” Ms McAnespy is a member of Fianna Fáil’s national executive, and is an independent councillor for Fermanagh and Omagh District Council.The press release detailing Ms McAnespy was to stand for Fianna Fáil in the elections stated she had been informed of the decision by party leader Micheál Martin.The confusion over Ms McAnespy’s candidacy played out on social media last night. Ian Woods, chair of party youth branch Ógra, said he was at the national executive meeting where Ms McAnespy was informed by Mr Martin that she would be contesting the local Northern Irish elections for the party. The event on Thursday was not advertised as the launch of Ms McAnespy’s campaign. Instead it was billed as a discussion on Brexit, and its consequences for the Belfast Agreement, and a potential united Ireland. Ms McAnespy was listed as chair of the discussion, which posters said would also feature Mr Ó Cuív and Mr Daly. Speaking on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland, Mr Daly denied he and Mr Ó Cuív “went rogue” in announcing the party’s first-ever candidate in Northern Ireland.“We were invited, I’m her director of elections. I was invited to launch the campaign as a public representative,” he said. “There is no procedure that announces candidates,” he added. However, one party source described the incident as a “solo run,” which “does not help” ongoing negotiations with the SDLP over a mooted merger. The final decision to approve Fianna Fáil election candidates is made by the party national executive. Commenting on the official party tweet that appeared to pour cold water on her candidacy announcement, Ms McAnespy said she was “dismayed” and “not sure what that is about”. Speaking on RTÉ’s Today with Sean O’Rourke show on Friday, she said party discussions with the SDLP had “nothing to do with me”.“We’re an all-island party, I can’t not run as a party candidate,” she said. When asked if she was officially told she would be a candidate, she said: “yes, I was told I would be a candidate at the national executive meeting”.Ms McAnespy said she spoke with Mr Martin in April when “he offered me party support”.Ms McAnespy acknowledged she was previously a member of Sinn Féin, but said Fianna Fáil was her “natural home”."},{"url":null,"title":"president higgins defends use of government jet on rt%C3%A9 debate","story":"  October 23, 2018Casey accuses incumbent of telling \u0026lsquolies\u0026rsquo as candidates trade criticisms in heated discussion   October 24, 2018Viewers of RT\u0026Eacute presidential debate got an even-handed free for all   October 24, 2018Prime Time\u0026rsquos presidential debate had no winners \u0026ndash and the big losers were its viewers   October 24, 2018RT\u0026Eacute figures show high levels of interest in final TV debate featuring all six candidates "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3675936.1540538044!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"presidential election everything you need to know before voting","story":"President Higgins casts his vote as the polls open in the 2018 Presidential election.  \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMarian Roarty presiding officer and Garda Eamonn McGinley after arriving by helicopter on Tory Island, off the coast of Co Donegal, with a ballot box for the presidential election and referendum on blasphemy. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WirePolls opened at 7am on Friday for the presidential election and a referendum on removing the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution.When you arrive at your polling station you will be asked to state your name and address. You may be required to produce evidence of identity, and may not be permitted to vote if you fail to do so. Where the presiding officer is satisfied as to the elector’s identity, a ballot paper is stamped and handed back to the person voting.On Friday there will be two ballot papers, one for the presidential election, which will have six candidates on it, and a second ballot for the referendum, which will have a Yes or No option. Polling stations will remain open until 10pm.On the ballot paper for the presidential election, the six candidates will be listed in alphabetical order according to their surname Peter Casey, Gavin Duffy, Joan Freeman, Seán Gallagher, Michael D Higgins, and Liadh Ní Riada. The voting system used in Ireland is called proportional representation - single transferable vote (PR-STV). Under this system the voter marks the candidates in order of preference, placing a number 1 in the box beside the candidate they wish to vote for, and then a number 2 beside their second preference, and so on. Voters do not have to fill in the entire ballot, and if they wish can mark the box beside their preferred candidate, and leave the rest blank. When the votes are being counted, if no candidate has secured enough first preference votes to be elected after the first count, the candidate with the least amount of votes will be eliminated. The eliminated candidates’ votes are then redistributed in the second count. If the candidate you voted for with your first preference is eliminated, your vote is then transferred to the candidate you gave your second preference to, during the second count. A candidate is eliminated after each count until one candidate reaches the quota and is deemed elected. The quota is half of the number of valid votes plus one. The other ballot that people will be asked to vote on is a referendum on whether to remove the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution. Blasphemy is defined as “the action or offence of speaking sacrilegiously about God or sacred things”. The last criminal prosecution for blasphemy in Ireland was in 1855.The referendum is proposing to remove the offence from the Constitution. Voters will receive a ballot paper that says “Do you approve of the proposal to amend the Constitution contained in the undermentioned Bill?”. Below this will be the name of the Bill: “Thirty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution (Repeal of offence of publication or utterance of blasphemous matter) Bill 2018.” The ballot paper will have two options, Yes or No. If you wish to vote to remove the offence of blasphemy, vote Yes. If you wish to vote against the proposal and keep the offence in the Constitution, vote No. The vote count will begin on Saturday morning, in centres across the country. You can follow the Presidential election and blasphemy referendum counts live with The  all weekend. We will have live results as they come to hand across Saturday and Sunday as well as expert analysis and commentary.Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3676984.1540565017!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"presidential election figures indicate low turnout for voting","story":"President Higgins casts his vote as the polls open in the 2018 Presidential election.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            LJ McAlevay casts her vote at St Laurence O’Toole CBS in Sherrif Stree with her daughter Maisie (5).

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireVoter turnout in the presidential election and the blasphemy referendum is reported low in many parts of the country so far. Turnout in the election by lunchtime today was deemed sluggish with few polling stations reporting double figures for voters.The Dublin city returning office, which covers five constituencies, said turnout at 12pm was slightly more than 10 per cent. Dublin Bay North had the highest turnout at 13.8 per cent, and Dublin Central the lowest with 7 per cent. Turnout in a polling station in Tallaght was 10 per cent Blanchardstown (14 per cent), Tyrrelstown (4.7 per cent), Skerries (11.4 per cent), Clonsilla (8 per cent). Polling in Cork was also slow with polling stations in both the city and county constituencies reporting low turn outsIn Roscommon turnout was similar across polling areas, from 11 per cent in Roscommon town, to 12.5 per cent in Castlerea, and 12 per cent in Boyle. In east Meath polling stations, turnout shortly after noon was over 12 per cent, compared to west Meath, where turnout ranged from 6.5 to 9.5 per cent. In Co Mayo, voter turnout was below 10 per cent in all polling stations except Morris Boys New School where it was 11 per cent at 11.30am.Turnout in Gorey, Co Wexford was at 9 per cent at 12.30pm, compared with 21 per cent at the same time during the abortion referendum, according to local councillor Malcolm Byrne.In the Cavan-Monaghan constituency, turnout was at only 9 per cent at lunchtime, according to local radio.Voter turnout was 13 per cent at lunchtime at CBS Primary School in Co Kilkenny. Early voter turnout for the presidential election is significantly lower than the the abortion referendum in May, figures show. The presidential election turnout may fall well short of the 56.11 per cent turnout when Michael D Higgins was elected in 2011.Turnout may be even less than the 46.7 per cent of the electorate who voted in 1997 when Mary McAleese was elected as one of five candidates.Before that in 1990 Mary Robinson, one of three candidates, won the election on the basis of a 64.1 per cent turnout.Polling stations opened at 7am on Friday on the mainland and will remain open until 10pm to give people the opportunity to cast their ballot.The  will publish an exit poll on Friday evening which will give the projected results of the presidential election and the referendum on blasphemy.Turnout in wealthier areas is higher than in working-class neighbourhoods, according to the lunchtime turnout estimates for Dublin Bay South.Ailesbury Road was at 18 per cent, Ballsbridge at 12 per cent and Sandymount at 15 per cent but Pearse Street was at 9 per cent turnout and Ringsend figures showed just 8.5 per cent of voters went to the polls.Labour Senator Kevin Humphreys said: “It seems the more affluent the area the higher the turnout.”Mr Humphreys said the turnout for those on the supplementary register was very low in the Dublin area.Returning officers believe that the holding of polls on the Friday of a bank holiday weekend may also have an impact, with no major increase in turnout expected at teatime because voters may be away.The last presidential election was held on Thursday, October 27th, 2011.Presidential candidate Seán Gallagher attended a polling station in Greystones, Co Wicklow, with his wife Trish to vote in the election early on Friday morning, while President Michael D Higgins casts his vote in St Mary’s Hospital, Phoenix Park, Dublin.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar voted at Scoil Thomais, Castleknock in Dublin.Six candidates are vying for the highest office in the State: incumbent President Higgins Senator Joan Freeman Sinn Féin MEP Liadh Ní Riada and three businessmen - Mr Gallagher, Gavin Duffy and Peter Casey. The electorate is also being asked on the ballot paper whether or not they want to remove the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution.Voting got under way on 12 islands off the coast of counties Donegal, Mayo and Galway on Thursday.Turnout percentages ranged from 4 per cent to 50 per cent, with Mayo islanders appearing to be the among the most engaged and Donegal voters least so.Count staff will begin sorting and collating the ballot papers at count centres across the country from 9am on Saturday. A result is expected by Saturday evening, or by early Sunday at the latest.– Additional reporting from PARead more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3676056.1540493917!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"lack of trust between eu and britain emerging as issue in backstop talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWhen EU leaders discussed Britain’s departure in Brussels last week, they were happy to continue delegating the negotiations to Michel Barnier. This is partly an expression of Brexit fatigue, which may also explain why the leaders are relatively relaxed about the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. Photograph: APThis was supposed to be “hell week” for Theresa May after mutinous Brexiteers foretold her political assassination in grisly metaphors in last Sunday’s papers. But after surviving a Brexit statement in the House of Commons on Monday, a fiery cabinet meeting on Tuesday and an appearance before the 1922 Committee on Wednesday, the prime minister ends the week in a stronger position than she began it.But May still faces the challenge of agreeing a Brexit deal with the EU that is acceptable to her cabinet, her party and to parliament. Negotiators on both sides have had informal contacts this week but the EU will not restart formal negotiations until Britain is ready to come back with a proposal to break the deadlock.The prime minister’s statement on Monday, when she set out four tests for a deal on the Northern Ireland backstop, persuaded backbench Brexiteers that she was hardening her position in the negotiations.Downing Street sent out a similar message, signalling that May was ruling out any Northern Ireland-specific backstop appearing in any form in the withdrawal agreement.What she said was that “we must make the commitment to a temporary UK-EU joint customs territory legally binding, so the Northern Ireland-only proposal is no longer needed”. She also insisted that neither the temporary customs arrangement, an extension of the transition period nor the backstop itself could last indefinitely.The EU agrees that the temporary customs arrangement and the transition period must be time-limited, not least because the European Court of Justice is likely to rule that anything else is unlawful.The backstop, on the other hand, is an insurance policy that must, in Michel Barnier’s phrase, be “all-weather” and must remain in place “unless and until” a permanent solution is found to ensure that the Border remains open.The EU remains firm in its demand that the Northern Ireland-only backstop must remain in the withdrawal agreement and that a UK-wide customs arrangement cannot replace it but can mitigate it.When they met in Salzburg last month, EU leaders expressed concerns about a customs arrangement that would allow British goods free circulation around the EU without Britain having to comply with EU environmental and other standards.An ambitious free trade agreement could make many elements of the backstop unnecessary through measures such as a comprehensive veterinary agreement and customs facilitation. Both sides are looking at an improved version of Turkey’s customs union with the EU which would remove some of the asymmetries that disadvantage Ankara.At the heart of the dispute over the backstop is the issue of trust, with the EU asking Britain to agree to a legally binding Northern Ireland-specific backstop with the promise of a UK-wide version in the political declaration.Attorney general Geoffrey Cox, who has emerged as the cabinet’s Grand Brexit Poohbah, wants a stronger legal guarantee and the final stage of the negotiations will centre on how to reconcile the two positions in a legal text.EU negotiators are willing to come up with language that offers reassurance of their good faith and with compromises that make the backstop more acceptable to Britain. But in the political environment at Westminster, there is no guarantee that such compromises would persuade sceptical MPs to back a Brexit deal that includes the backstop.When EU leaders discussed Britain’s departure over dinner in Brussels last week, they were happy to continue delegating the negotiations to Barnier. This is partly an expression of Brexit fatigue, which may also explain why the leaders are relatively relaxed about the prospect of a no-deal Brexit.European businesses are less sanguine about the economic cost of a cliff-edge Brexit next year without the buffer of a transition lasting at least 20 months. If negotiations resume after budget votes at Westminster next week, a special summit could be convened in late November to sign off on a deal.If November slides into December, pressure for a deal could raise the question of whether the backstop has to be in the withdrawal agreement. Instead of asking Britain to trust the EU, could Ireland be asked to trust both Britain and the EU to deliver a guarantee against a hard border as part of the future framework?There is no sign that other member states would agree to such a change of sequence, partly because of solidarity with Ireland but chiefly because they fear that Britain would seek to weaponise the Border in the next stage of negotiations to gain competitive advantage in a future trade deal."},{"url":null,"title":"picture editors 25 favourite images princess eugenies royal","story":"Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank kiss after their wedding on the steps of St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor CastleBrexit latest: Allowing EU citizens to vote would push \u0026#39self-destruct button\u0026#39 on Tories, MEPs claim - live updatesWhat the House of Representatives means in US politics - and how it could change at the midtermsUS Midterm elections 2018: Why this year\u0026#39s congressional elections matterUS Senate: responsibilities and powers - and how it could change in the midtermsUS midterm elections 2018 poll tracker: Who will win the Congress?Queen\u0026#39s last corgi dies, ending her 74 year connection with the breedComment: A Norway-style Brexit should be enough for a country as ided as oursRuth Davidson gives birth to a baby boy, announcing on Twitter: \u0026#39Welcome to the world, little one\u0026#39US mail bomb suspect arrested in Florida after two more packages targeting Trump critics discovered\u0026#39The public need to know the reality of NDAs\u0026#39-  readers react to the week\u0026#39s top stories  invites Sir Philip Green to drop the #MeToo injunction Sydney\u0026#39s same-sex penguin couple Sphen and Magic become parents after adopting eggJapan and China ties at \u0026#39historic turning point\u0026#39 though both sides remain waryMeghan and Harry\u0026#39s wedding outfits go on display at Windsor CastlePrince Harry pays tribute to Prince Charles\u0026#39 fight to save environment and vows to continue his work Virgin Atlantic to fly non-stop to Australia \u0026#39as soon as possible\u0026#39Queer Eye: season three will feature a lesbian makeover as the Fab Five take on womenComment: Plenty of Tories want Theresa May\u0026#39s job, but could they secure a better Brexit deal?We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000177653497_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqrpfQw2hJyG_yckwxPAr0go9KzD8cVu9iguqnaKUswZA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"bbc legal correspondent wrong say nda signed freely","story":"BBC legal correspondent criticised for saying NDA was signed freely Court of AppealThe BBC has been told it is “inaccurate” to claim that women who entered into non-disclosure agreements after they had made allegations about sexual harassment did so “freely”.Media and employment lawyers have said it is likely there would be an “imbalance of power” during negotiations to settle a claim and therefore it was incorrect to view these contractual relationships as free of “abuse”.Yesterday, a BBC journalist claimed the judgment by the Court of Appeal “made clear that there was no evidence any of the NDAs resulted from bullying, harassment or undue pressure”.

One dimensional and simplistic but set against what would otherwise have been one of the great stories.\u0027Made it feel incomplete\u0027It was very clunky. Top heavy.

Look at the early Dr Who for inspiration!Charlotte Runcie\u0027s relief at the news that BBC Radio 2 will be parting ways with drivetime hosts Simon Mayo and Jo Whiley provoked a strong reaction from  readers. The prevailing view amongst readers was that allowing Simon Mayo to leave would be a big mistake in the long run.I suspect the BBC lumped Wiley with Mayo because they thought he was such a nice guy that he wouldn\u0027t complain. They were right, but fortunately the listeners did.Such a shame, two good broadcasters, one show ruined.\u0027Shame on you BBC\u0027I reckon Suzi Quatro would be a great drivetime replacement.\u0027Sad to see Simon go, it just didn\u0027t work adding Jo even tho\u0027 she is a great DJ.

Posing with a recently killed animal as if they have done something special or unique. I find it vulgar.\u0027 I do not see it as the same as legal hunting and culling.\u0027I bet quite a large number of people who protested have taken a picture of food they\u0027ve eaten and posted it on social media - much of it containing meat and fish.Rather hypocritical - just because you are proud to eat the animal after it\u0027s been culled, skinned, hung (maybe) and butchered by someone else, rather than doing the process yourself.I enjoy meat, but have also culled and butchered it myself and in doing so I believe you have far greater respect for the animal and the slaughter process.\u0027Killing for the pleasure of killing is dubious\u0027Killing out of necessity, either for food, personal survival or for control is one thing.

I\u0027m not a racist person by any means and it\u0027s just a fit of temper at the time, I think.I apologise for all the distress you\u0027ve had there and since.Footage posted on social media appeared to show a plane passenger calling Delsie Gayle an ugly black b-----d and telling her don\u0027t speak to me in a foreign language, you stupid, ugly cow.But Ms Gayle and her daughter Carol Gayle rejected the apology over the language used on the plane from Barcelona to London on October 19.Asked if she accepts the apology, Delsie Gayle said: I don\u0027t think so. You must forget and forgive but it\u0027s going to take a long time for me to get over what he has done to me.Her daughter added: He says he wasn\u0027t racist, he wouldn\u0027t be saying words like that if he wasn\u0027t racist.The incident took place on Ryanair flight FR015 at Barcelona Airport on October 19, before it left for London Stansted.Ryanair passenger (pictured) filmed racially abusing woman on flight is identified by policeMr Mesher was was questioned by police for the first time on Wendesday as officers visited the 75-year-old at his home in Birmingham as part of a criminal investigation into the incident.Officers spent just under an hour at the sheltered housing flat before leaving without him.Before his retirement Mr Mesher is understood to have worked as a train announcer for London Midland Railways, and as a booking clerk at Waterloo station.He has never married, and lived with his elderly mother until her death in the late 1980s.On Wednesday night a relative, who did not wish to be named, said he hoped Mesher would be sent to prison if found to have committed a crime.“I saw that video and I would have stepped in to help that woman,” he said.“Someone on that plane should have done something. I don\u0027t care if he\u0027s blood. He should be put in a Spanish jail, I reckon.However a former colleague said Mesher’s outburst was out of character for the man he knew.“David worshipped his elderly mother, so he was always respectful and polite to older people,” the former railway worker said.Barcelona city council has said it will report the incident as a possible hate crime.Ryanair has been criticised for its handling of the incident as Mesher was not kicked off the flight. Instead, Mrs Gayle was moved to another aisle while Mesher was allowed to stay in his seat.Earlier this week, Mrs Gayle, 77, from east London, told ITV: I feel very low. He pays his fare, I pay mine. So why did he abuse me for that? Because of the colour of my skin.If I had done that to him, I\u0027m sure they would have called the police.Ms Gayle is due on Good Morning Britain to respond to Mr Mesher\u0027s apology. Ryanair issued a lengthy statement on Friday making a series of points to clarify the following facts, to prevent any further inaccurate andor unfounded media reportage.The airline defended its response, saying it has a long record of not tolerating disruptive or abusive passenger behaviour.Brexit latest: Allowing EU citizens to vote would push \u0026#39self-destruct button\u0026#39 on Tories, MEPs claim - live updatesWhat the House of Representatives means in US politics - and how it could change at the midtermsUS Midterm elections 2018: Why this year\u0026#39s congressional elections matterUS Senate: responsibilities and powers - and how it could change in the midtermsUS midterm elections 2018 poll tracker: Who will win the Congress?Queen\u0026#39s last corgi dies, ending her 74 year connection with the breedComment: A Norway-style Brexit should be enough for a country as ided as oursRuth Davidson gives birth to a baby boy, announcing on Twitter: \u0026#39Welcome to the world, little one\u0026#39US mail bomb suspect arrested in Florida after two more packages targeting Trump critics discovered\u0026#39The public need to know the reality of NDAs\u0026#39-  readers react to the week\u0026#39s top stories  invites Sir Philip Green to drop the #MeToo injunction Sydney\u0026#39s same-sex penguin couple Sphen and Magic become parents after adopting eggJapan and China ties at \u0026#39historic turning point\u0026#39 though both sides remain waryMeghan and Harry\u0026#39s wedding outfits go on display at Windsor CastlePrince Harry pays tribute to Prince Charles\u0026#39 fight to save environment and vows to continue his work Virgin Atlantic to fly non-stop to Australia \u0026#39as soon as possible\u0026#39Queer Eye: season three will feature a lesbian makeover as the Fab Five take on womenComment: Plenty of Tories want Theresa May\u0026#39s job, but could they secure a better Brexit deal?When do the clocks go back, why do we use GMT – and will the EU soon put an end to \u0026#39falling back\u0026#39?We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/25/TELEMMGLPICT000178895606_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bql2neoDcPjX0ArggwHbAGweiT3KF7Y9Wo3Dxqh0e8I-Q.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"stonehenge irresistible unknowable","story":"Stonehenge was gifted to the nation on 26 October, 1918One hundred years ago today, Cecil Chubb gave Britain the best present in its history.

Job cuts would probably affect Asda’s petrol, bakery, back office and “hosting” operations, as well as roles in its clothing arm, George, according to Press Association. In a statement, the company said: “In a competitive retail market, where customers rightly expect great value and ease of service, we must always look at how we can work more quickly and efficiently for them\u0026nbspand, inevitably, that means we need to consider changing the roles we need our colleagues to do, or the hours needed in particular parts of our stores.Asda cuts price of petrol by 2p a litreAsda customers steal shopping baskets to avoid paying for bags What removal of Asda price guarantee scheme will mean for shoppers“We believe the proposed changes we are consulting on would allow us to do a better job for our customers.“We also recognise that discussions about potential change aren’t easy. If the decision is taken to implement the proposed changes, we would work with our colleagues to look at the potential impact of these proposals on them.”The GMB union said Asda’s decision to announce potential job cuts just two months before Christmas was a bad one. Gary Carter, the union’s national officer,\u0026nbspsaid: “These proposed redundancies are a hammer blow to Asda workers. The timing of this announcement, in the run up to Christmas, is doubly appalling.”He added: “Asda is performing well and is highly profitable because of the hard work of our members, who are the backbone of the company. “These cuts make no sense whatsoever – slashing our members’ jobs would hurt the service ASDA customers receive. GMB will fight tooth and nail for every single job.“With all the speculation surrounding the proposed Sainsbury’s merger and potential sell offs of stores – this news will not put anyone’s mind at rest.”Asda and Sainsbury’s announced plans for a £10bn tie-up in April\u0026nbspand the deal is being scrutinised by the competition watchdog.Last month, Asda announced it was scrapping its price guarantee scheme, which gave customers money off if the cost of their shop was not 10 per cent cheaper than if bought at a rival chain. The company said at the time: “It’s a decision we’ve not taken lightly because we love it dearly, but in reality, we know our customers don’t love it enough for us to keep it.“Instead they want us to focus our investment on lowering our prices, and they’ll let us know if we’re falling out of step with the competition.”In July, the supermarket said it was entering into consultation with colleagues at its Enfield Home Shopping Centre in London, putting 261 jobs at risk.

He later rescinded the claimOn 1 August, 2017, an unresolvable dispute within the bitcoin community saw the network split. The fork of bitcoin\u0027s underlying blockchain technology spawned a new cryptocurrency: Bitcoin cashTowards the end of 2017, the price of bitcoin surged to almost $20,000. This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearWhile bitcoin has taken off and is seen as the leader of the cryptocurrency market, it’s been adopted by the few not the many, said Chakib Bouda, chief technology officer at US-based payments firm Rambus.Confusion amongst users has played a part, but arguably the biggest failings for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies over the past years lies with security, in the first six months of 2018 alone over $761 million bitcoin was stolen, with experts predicting that the amount stolen from exchanges will top $1.5 billion by the end of the year.The key to overcoming this issues, Bouda\u0026nbspsuggested, is keeping the private keys needed to access and use cryptocurrency funds both secure and easy-to-use.\u0026nbsp One way of doing this would be adopting technology used within the traditional financial sector to bring cryptocurrencies up to the levels of security and usability that people expect of a modern currency.Once this secure ecosystem is in place, it’s going to transform how many sceptics view bitcoin transactions, Bouda said. So whilst cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have been described as the ‘Wild West’ by the UK treasury, we expect that in 10 years’ time, bitcoin will become mainstream and have a remarkably different reputation.If bitcoin is able to transform its reputation in this way, bitcoin could find its way into everyone\u0027s pockets through mobile wallets –achieving\u0026nbspmainstream adoption\u0026nbspin time for bitcoin\u0027s next\u0026nbspbirthday.It\u0027s a view shared by Iqbal Gandham, the UK managing director of the online trading platform eToro. The next decade could see bitcoin being accepted as the norm when it comes to money transfer and payments, he said. As with any startup idea, early days are always risky, but I feel these are now few and far between.Alternatively, if another cryptocurrency is able to become a safe and\u0026nbspconvenient payment method\u0026nbspbefore bitcoin developers implement the necessary technology, bitcoin\u0027s place as the world\u0027s most popular cryptocurrency could be usurped.This is the view of Nigel Green, founder and CEO of the deVere\u0026nbspGroup, a financial consultancy firm based in London. Mr Green suggested that bitcoin\u0027s influence will drastically reduce in the cryptocurrency sector, however the overall crypto market will expand by at least 5,000 per cent.“Bitcoin is what kickstarted the crypto revolution and it has changed the way the world handles money, makes transactions, does business, and manages assets, amongst other things, forever.\u0026nbsp It all began with bitcoin, Mr Green said.\u0026nbsp“However, whilst I don’t wish to rain on anyone’s parade, I believe that\u0026nbspbitcoin’s influence and dominance of the cryptocurrency sector will drastically reduce in its second decade.\u0026nbspThis is because as mass adoption of cryptocurrency grows, more and more digital assets will be launched – by organisations in both the private and the public sectors. This will increase competition for bitcoin and dent its market share.He continued: “In addition, it is likely that bitcoin will be hit by the superior technology, features, and problem-solutions, offered by existing and yet-to-be-released cryptocurrencies.”If the deVere\u0026nbspCEO\u0027s forecast is correct, the boost from\u0026nbspmajor institutional and retail investors will see the cryptocurrency market rocket towards\u0026nbspthe $20 trillion mark by 2028.Financial institutions and regulators, amongst others, understand that cryptocurrencies are the future of money, he concluded.\u0026nbsp“As such, the market will have grown beyond recognition when bitcoin celebrates its 20th anniversary.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

And what does this turmoil mean for Saudi’s economic modernisation dreams? Ben Chu reports from the Future Investment Initiative in RiyadhClick to followThe IndependentThe Saudi delegates, many of them working for state companies, were on message about the regimeIf you wanted to build a room in which to conceal an elephant it would probably have the dimensions of\u0026nbspthe opulent main hall of the King Abduaziz International conference centre in Riyadh.The neoclassical marble columns framing the rectangular space must be at least seven\u0026nbspmetres high. Crystal chandeliers hang from the stuccoed ceiling like enormous frozen explosions of bling. Everything is almost comically oversized.Everything we know about the death of Jamal KhashoggiBut even this aircraft hangar-sized Saudi Arabian ballroom could not hide one pachyderm this week: the killing of the dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom’s embassy in Istanbul earlier this month.Few spoke about it, but everyone was staring at it.The Saudi “Future Investment Initiative” – the\u0026nbsp“Davos in the desert” – was conceived as a way to suck foreign investment into the Saudi economy and to make a reality of the 33-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s “Vision 2030” economic reforms.But while “MBS”, as he is known, wants to attract foreign cash and foreign technical expertise he also wants foreign interest, foreign enthusiasm for a modernising Saudi Arabia.Before the conference began that seemed to be a dream that had been extinguished, along with the life of Khashoggi.Bosses from some of the world’s biggest corporations and financial companies – Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan, Stephen\u0026nbspSchwarzman of Blackstone, Larry Fink of BlackRock, Masayoshi Son of Softbank to name but a few – dropped out in the wake of Khashoggi’s killing and the global wave of abhorrence about an act apparently ordered from Riyadh. Politicians did the same, from the US Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, to Christine Lagarde of the IMF, to our own trade secretary, Liam Fox.It was one of the most impressive no-show\u0026nbsplists in the history of parties.Yet anyone who had assumed that the conference\u0026nbspin the heart of the Saudi capital, which began on Tuesday,\u0026nbspwould have been a purely domestic, or regional, affair was mistaken. Chinese money managers and Indian business people had either not got the memo about the boycott, or did not care to join.\u0026nbspAnd there were a fair number of Western business delegates here in the sprawling Riyadh conference centre, although they tended to have less exalted titles such as “chief scientific officer” and “vice president international ision”. \u0026nbspMany were keeping a low profile and spoke about the Khashoggi case only obliquely as “the political situation”.“It’s not a good situation if the facts are as they seem,” said one Indian private equity magnate, sucking his teeth.Yet others were privately less concerned. “Look it was a mistake – but China does this kind of thing all the time and yet they get praised\u0026nbspfor being a huge infrastructure investor across the world,” complained one American. The Saudi delegates, many of them working for state companies, were on message.Most of the sessions, despite the lavish video presentations that accompanied them, were rather sparsely attended, with people preferring the mingle in small groups over Arabic tea in the\u0026nbspcorridors of the centre.But the 1,400 capacity hall was packed for the crown prince’s panel, where he would make his first public remarks since Khashoggi’s death.The stage management was not very subtle. Many of the delegates were wearing the traditional Saudi ankle-length white shirt and red-patterned headdress and a glance at their ID lanyards showed that many worked for state – or state-linked – Saudi firms. They cheered loudly\u0026nbspthe prince’s rather defiant statements and responded to his\u0026nbspjokes with ostentatious laughter.The\u0026nbspmotivation for the defiance was clear.\u0026nbspThe US and Turkey have brought extreme pressure on MBS over the killing. But there was also a clear domestic message too: “I’m not going to be toppled.”It’s not a fantastical proposition. The crown prince has alienated a lot of powerful Saudis – a year ago he locked dozens of them, including princes, in the Ritz-Carlton hotel, right next door to the very conference centre in which he was speaking, until they agreed to hand back assets to the state which they were accused of corruptly appropriating. Whatever the truth about the legitimacy of their claims to those assets, this was hardly a model of open justice and transparent government.Will it work? Did bin Salman shore up his position with his words?But, despite reports from Turkey this week that President Recep\u0026nbspTayyip\u0026nbspErdogan\u0026nbspis not set on regime change in Riyadh, Ankara seems determined to turn up the pressure on MBS\u0026nbspfurther over the killing. And, of course, nothing said before a friendly audience in Riyadh is likely to sway the White House and its erratic occupant.It seems fair to say that the fate of the crown prince remains in the balance.And so, inevitably, does that of his ambitious economic reforms, which include building a $500bn high-tech city in the desert and turning the kingdom into a tourist hub to rival Dubai.The crown prince boasted of $50bn of inward investment deals signed with Western energy and infrastructure firms at the conference. But there was little detail and some analysts said some were likely to have been projects that had already been announced.We will likely not know for many months how much damage has been done by the Khashoggi affair to the appetite of Western firms to invest in the kingdom. The irony is that few would deny that bin Salman has identified the right economic strategy – ersification away from the liquefied dinosaur export business known as oil. Around 40 per cent of the kingdom’s GDP and 90 per cent of Riyadh’s\u0026nbsptax revenues come\u0026nbspfrom fossil fuels at present. That is a precarious position in a world in which there is now a broadening (if not total) consensus that decarbonisation is environmentally and economically necessary. Jamal Khashoggi death ‘the worst cover up ever’Another rather bitter irony is that MBS’s\u0026nbspsocial reforms seem genuinely popular, especially among younger people.One single female Saudi economic consultant stressed to me over lunch in the heaving dining room of the Ritz-Carlton how important the granting of the freedom for women to drive cars was.“Before I had to have a driver. Now I can travel to meetings on my own. And it’s changing attitudes too. Men must now look at us as human beings not objects,” she said.“It’s a sexual revolution – I’m not joking,” said one European-based energy executive who comes to Saudi around 100 days every year. “You should tell your readers about that!”Yet MBS has not been a political reformer. Most non-partisan observers agree that the political realm is now\u0026nbspslammed shut. And the Khashoggi killing has sent a terrifying message to those who might have been minded to criticise the\u0026nbspregime.Another irony is that amid the uproar over the killing of Khashoggi another story has gone ignored. The United Nations warned this week that Yemen, where Saudi forces are attempting to suppresses a Houthi insurgency through a blockade, is on the brink of a “massive loss of life” due to famine.That, alas, was an elephant in the room that everyone at this week’s tense conference in the Arabian desert seemed to manage to ignore without any difficulty at all.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He was born in the Kerala region of southern India and his parents roamed the country working for the government as part of the rubber board. Then his father decided to go into the private sector, setting up as a producer of adhesives. “My dad wasn’t the best entrepreneur,” Janardana says. His father had no difficulty obtaining a line, or lines,\u0026nbspof credit – but not from entirely reputable sources. He was being charged 10 per cent per week i.e. a higher rate of interest than Wonga\u0026nbspused to levy. Labelling his father’s lenders\u0026nbsploan sharks is unfair to sharks. “Debt collection is not exactly regulated in India,” says Janardana the younger. “People were lining up outside the house screaming at us to give them their money back.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIt was the son who paid them all off in the end. He studied engineering, worked in telecoms, rolling out the network in India, then went to business school, was hired by Capital One, and started in its credit card office in Washington DC. Fortunately the exchange rate of dollars to rupees was favourable at the time. Junior, then aged 24, salvaged the family finances. In April 2008, I was labelled a party\u0026nbsppooper. People said ‘it’s only a Wall Street\u0026nbspcrisis. It’s a US thing. We’re not in the\u0026nbspsubprime\u0026nbspmortgage business’“It’s more about reputation – face and respect – in India,” he says. “Sometimes your parents’ social security is you. To be fair, they wouldn’t have incurred so much debt if not for me. I was living off them for a long while.” In the wake of that traumatic experience, and while working for Capital One, lending to consumers, and having responsibility for collections and defaults, Janardana could feel defaulters’ pain. He was abnormally sensitive to any looming crisis. The year 2007 found him based in London. “We were all gung-ho for growth,” he says. But Janardana pointed out even when the economy was doing well, losses were piling up, and he forecast rocky times ahead.“In April 2008, I was labelled a party pooper. People said ‘it’s only a Wall Street crisis. It’s a US thing. We’re not in the subprime mortgage business’.” But Janardana’s warning was heeded and by September 2008, when everything unravelled, Capital One\u0026nbsphad a head start of three or four months, and had already shut down new custom\u0026nbspand reduced exposure. Still, “it wasn’t a fun time. Most of 2008 was spent just trying to survive.” By that\u0026nbsptime,\u0026nbspJanardana had decided not to return to the US, and to become a British citizen. Zopa attracted him because it was something completely different: a\u0026nbsp“peer-to-peer” system\u0026nbspin which investors and borrowers are brought together for mutual advantage, with Zopa in the middle, like the shaded area of a Venn diagram. One person’s loan is another’s investment. Investors do better than they would by parking money in a bank – albeit with higher risk – and borrowers get a much better deal than Janardana’s entrepreneurial father ever did. The typical borrowers are teachers and nurses in their mid-30s, often for the purpose of home improvements or buying a car. The average loan size is just under £10,000. With his engineering background, the thing that particularly pleased Janardana was how Zopa had managed to speed up the process of obtaining a loan. The business does its own risk assessment. But what really concentrated minds, was the question of comparison sites. Zopa had previously informed applicants if they could get a loan in 27 seconds flat. But Money Supermarket said approval had to be 12 seconds for it to show up on its site – Zopa got it down to seven. The exact rate is outlined within three minutes. “The real rate,” stresses Janardana, “not the ‘lowest rate’ – which is so misleading.” Janardana has been CEO since August 2015. “We’ve had a charmed four years,” he says. The business\u0026nbsphad a turnover of £265m in 2014-15, now it’s more than £1bn. Revenue has gone up from £11m to £45m. Customer satisfaction, according to Trust Pilot, hits 4.8 or 4.9 out of 5. Now Zopa is two years into building a fully-fledged online bank, and is running the registration gauntlet, performing the required stress tests. It\u0026nbspwants to “extend the ethos of peer-to-peer into retail banking”.The average amount people borrow from ZopaWe are sitting in the Zopa HQ on the south bank of the Thames, looking out at the river flowing languidly by, with the towers of the City leaning over it. It’s probably something to do with his personal history, and his mum and dad nearly going under, but when Janardana speaks of “giving customers more control”, it’s easy to feel the passion and conviction beyond the expression of good intentions. He objects to what he calls “the winlose model”. He ought to get a job as chancellor of the exchequer. In fact, he comes out with a line neither the chancellor – nor anyone else, other than Jeff Bezos\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspgets a chance to say very often. “We had too much money”. In other words, there was more lending than borrowing. Citizens Advice\u0026nbspknows\u0026nbspcustomers who renew loans generally get a worse rate than those who switch. Banks make money by upping the rate. “We could have pulled the same trick, but we don’t want to do that,” says Janardana, sounding a bit like Chris Tarrant on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. “With us you always get the same rate as a new customer. A bank where we win, and our customers win.” Even if he is CEO, Janardana still talks regularly to the guy who handles “complaints”. He wants people to be happy and sometimes Janardana speaks more like a yoga teacher than a money expert. It’s rather zen and soothing. “I want,” he says, “to take away the points of tension.”A View from the TopShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Job cuts would probably affect Asda’s petrol, bakery, back office and “hosting” operations, as well as roles in its clothing arm, George, according to Press Association. In a statement, the company said: “In a competitive retail market, where customers rightly expect great value and ease of service, we must always look at how we can work more quickly and efficiently for them\u0026nbspand, inevitably, that means we need to consider changing the roles we need our colleagues to do, or the hours needed in particular parts of our stores.Asda cuts price of petrol by 2p a litreAsda customers steal shopping baskets to avoid paying for bags What removal of Asda price guarantee scheme will mean for shoppers“We believe the proposed changes we are consulting on would allow us to do a better job for our customers.“We also recognise that discussions about potential change aren’t easy. If the decision is taken to implement the proposed changes, we would work with our colleagues to look at the potential impact of these proposals on them.”The GMB union said Asda’s decision to announce potential job cuts just two months before Christmas was a bad one. Gary Carter, the union’s national officer,\u0026nbspsaid: “These proposed redundancies are a hammer blow to Asda workers. The timing of this announcement, in the run up to Christmas, is doubly appalling.”He added: “Asda is performing well and is highly profitable because of the hard work of our members, who are the backbone of the company. “These cuts make no sense whatsoever – slashing our members’ jobs would hurt the service ASDA customers receive. GMB will fight tooth and nail for every single job.“With all the speculation surrounding the proposed Sainsbury’s merger and potential sell offs of stores – this news will not put anyone’s mind at rest.”Asda and Sainsbury’s announced plans for a £10bn tie-up in April\u0026nbspand the deal is being scrutinised by the competition watchdog.Last month, Asda announced it was scrapping its price guarantee scheme, which gave customers money off if the cost of their shop was not 10 per cent cheaper than if bought at a rival chain. The company said at the time: “It’s a decision we’ve not taken lightly because we love it dearly, but in reality, we know our customers don’t love it enough for us to keep it.“Instead they want us to focus our investment on lowering our prices, and they’ll let us know if we’re falling out of step with the competition.”In July, the supermarket said it was entering into consultation with colleagues at its Enfield Home Shopping Centre in London, putting 261 jobs at risk.

Lady Green owns all of the shares in their company, Taveta, which is registered in Jersey and controls Arcadia.\u0026nbspSir Philip has claimed he chose to live in the principality\u0026nbspbecause of a “heart scare” he had twenty years ago.Lady Green has pointed out other benefits to tax havens: “My understanding is that jurisdictions such as Jersey and the British Virgin Islands are commonly preferred for their strong regulatory regimes,” she wrote to MPs\u0026nbspin 2016.The Arcadia Group is the clothing empire that made Sir Philip’s reputation as a retail king and remains the source of much of his wealth. It boasts some of the biggest names on the high street: Dorothy Perkins, Miss Selfridge, Wallis, Evans, Burton and - the jewel in the crown - Topshop, which has successfully expanded into the US in recent years.But the rapid upward trajectory has recently reversed with the Arcadia’s value being slashed by half in just a year. Topshop’s revenues dropped 5.6 per cent last year, in spite of a jump in online sales.Topshop lost £10.9m in the year to August 2017, compared with a £59.4m profit in the previous 12 months. It also has a worrying pension deficit of up to £1bn - not the first time one of Sir Philip’s companies have experienced problems in that regard.The tycoon bought BHS for £200m in 2000 and took it back into private ownership. He rebranded it as British Home Stores and brought it under his Arcadia umbrella before ridding himself of it in 2015, by which time it had racked up £1.3bn in debt including a large pension deficit.\u0026nbspUntil the recent sexual harassment allegations it was Sir Philip’s conduct during and after the disposal of BHS that had most tarnished reputation.Pensions committee chair Sir Frank Field summed it up succinctly earlier this year: “Sir Philip Green stripped BHS bare and then left it for dead, with contemptuous disregard for the pensioners.”\u0026nbspPhilip Green\u0027s case is proof that we need to get rid of NDAs for good£500,000 in 28 seconds is the fastest money Philip Green has ever lostPhilip Green named in parliament as businessman who gagged mediaSurrounding himself with \u0027yes\u0027 men was Philip Green’s undoingAre Sir Philip Green and Frank Field up for a rematch? Let\u0027s just seeThe businessman sold BHS for £1 to a company controlled by a Dominic Chappell, a man who had been declared bankrupt three times and had no retail experience.\u0026nbspThe chain collapsed into administration a year later, with 11,000 jobs lost and a £571m deficit in the pension scheme.\u0026nbspThe Pensions Regulator found that the “main purpose” of the transaction was so that Sir Philip could avoid liability for the fund which contained 22,000 people’s retirement savings.Sir Philip came under heavy and sustained fire from the regulator and MPs, before eventually making a voluntary payment of £363m to help make up the deficit.\u0026nbspMPs recommend former BHS owner Sir Philip Green is stripped of knighthoodSir Philip owns three luxurious yachts including the 295ft Lionheart which he bought for £100m at about the same time as he took collection of a £46m Gulfstream private jet and offloaded BHS.He was believed to be holidaying on the Lionheart in the Mediterranean when he stated in September 2016 that he was “working every day” to save the stricken retailer’s pension scheme.\u0026nbspThe previous month he was filmed\u0026nbspon the Greek Island of Ithaca attacking a reporter who tried to question him about BHS’ demise. “That’s going in the f***** sea,” Sir Philip shouted while pointing towards the reporter’s camera equipment.The Pensions Regulator said at the time that the vessel could be seized in order to generate cash to pay into the BHS fund. In the end he kept both the yacht and his knighthood, though there will now be renewed calls for him to be stripped of the latter.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Amazon shares dropped as much as 8 per cent in after-hours trading after it reported quarterly sales of $56.58bn (£44.16bn), missing expectations of $57.1bn. Alphabet’s stock fell 4.7 per cent after it posted revenue of $33.74bn, missing Wall Street’s target of $34.04bn, although earnings of $13.06 per share came in well ahead of the expected $10.42 per share. Google reveals it has sacked 48 employees over sexual harassmentGoogle leak reveals plans for censored search engine in ChinaEbay sues Amazon, accusing rival of illegally poaching sellersAmazon wage increase could result in lower pay for some employees“Google’s earnings momentum remains strong,” said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at Investing. “But if you dig in a little deeper, there are cost pressures which are building up and are mainly responsible for this period’s disappointment.”Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said the “poorly received” earnings from Alphabet and Amazon had “soured the mood on what had been a rebounding US session”. However, Christopher Rossbach, CIO of investment firm J. Stern \u0026amp Co, said the companies both remain fundamentally strong, despite missing market expectations. “While their revenues were both slightly lower than expected, with Amazon additionally guiding slightly lower than street expectations for the next quarter, they still both show good profitability,” he said. \u0026nbsp“Alphabet is the leader in search and advertising, and Amazon is the leader in e-commerce and cloud computing, and increasingly benefits from advertising too. The fundamentals of both companies are intact and we believe that any significant weakness is a buying opportunity for long-term investors.”Other tech stocks that dipped in after-hours include Apple, which fell 1.6 per cent, and Twitter, which was down 2.5 per cent.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It’s not a particularly special sofa: it’s navy blue, from John Lewis, and lumpy from years of people wedging their arses into the cracks between the cushions. If you sit on the chaise longue too hard, it flips like a seesaw.For three and a half years, this sofa was a sort of talisman representing everything that I loved about my old life: home, comfort and belonging.I’ve just moved back to London from Hong Kong, that rocky, typhoon-drenched island off the coast of southern China. It’s nice to be home. I’ve gone from being Theresa May’s “citizen of the world as\u0026nbspa citizen of nowhere” to being a somewhere person again.And what a strange time to be back. The irony that I moved home desperate to belong somewhere again at precisely the same time that the UK is figuring out where and how it belongs itself, is not lost on me.I left the UK at the start of 2015 with my now husband. He’d transferred with his company (HSBC – it seemed obvious we’d end up in Asia), and I’d jacked in my lovely job as an editor on a travel magazine. We’d been living in London for years since graduating and just wanted a change of scene. Friends had started to inch down the aisle and I couldn’t bear many more winters of X Factor. My East Asia experience was limited: I’d been to Shanghai in 2011 to meet a friend and had come back with an unshakeable sense that Asia was where things were moving forward, rather than stalling in Europe.Hong Kong seemed a good choice. It was exotically far-flung, but at only (only!) 6,000 miles away it was close enough to be home in 15 hours and as a former British colony, it had a reassuring vein of home running through it (crucially, the plugs were the same). Plus, as a travel editor, the prospects for fun weekends away in cities like Tokyo, Bangkok and Beijing was intoxicating. Hong Kong was hot, humid, hedonistic and so fast-paced I figured I’d have to sprint to keep up.\u0026nbspThe problem? I’m a somewhere person. I never knew how much I relied on my emotional connection to my home city to inform much of my character until I left it.Hong Kong –\u0026nbspswaggering, sweaty, bombastic Hong Kong –\u0026nbspis an anywhere kind of place. The friends I made came from erse backgrounds and nations, with friends, ties and cultural touchpoints all over the world. By contrast, I came from a world of single culture: most of my family lives within two hours of each other (except one rogue uncle who lives in Malawi) and my close friends are the ones I’ve had since school. I first went on a plane at the embarrassingly old age of 15 (I don’t think anybody, least of all my Eurocamp-loving parents, thought I would end up flying a lot for work).Expat\u0026nbsplife was like being back at university, but with a lot more cashThe first year in Hong Kong was tough as I clung to my Britishness, my London-ness, like a comfort blanket. In my 350 square foot, two-bed flat in Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong, I felt not so much fresh off the boat but flung sharply off it. The sights and smells of my new neighbourhood were almost literally intoxicating, and I couldn’t understand why the supermarket opened, begrudgingly, at 8.10am. I never knew where I was going, and I lost all the swagger I had in London about knowing the coolest, newest places to go. I missed my default lazy Sunday afternoon walking along the South Bank, popping into Tate Modern –\u0026nbspin Hong Kong, there didn’t seem to be any museum really worth a repeat visit. (This is a well-known problem –\u0026nbspfor a global city, Hong Kong doesn’t have any world-class institutions, although the recent opening of the Tai Kwun arts complex and the upcoming opening of the M+ visual arts centre is changing that.)In the UK, I fitted in. I knew this retrospectively because I’d never even considered that I hadn’t. It was a natural sort of belonging. My life revolved around the reassuring timestamps of ordinary British life: Strictly Come Dancing,\u0026nbspthe weird April heatwave\u0026nbspand the John Lewis Christmas ad. I still counted down to Christmas based on that the release of that ad.Eighteen months after we moved, Brexit happened.I can still remember the exact moment I found out that the UK had voted to leave the European Union. It was mid-morning in my glassy office block, and colleagues and I had stayed up watching the count. Hong Kong felt very far away from it all, and to be honest Brexit gave us an excuse for a boozy lunch in some drab Belgian-themed pub and the opportunity to use the suffix “exit”\u0026nbspto describe the leaving do of a friend moving away from\u0026nbspthe city.Created with Sketch.In pictures: The coffin homes of Hong Kong Show all 19Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A general view of residential and commercial buildings in Yau Tsim Mong District which is a popular location for the \u0027subided units\u0027 in Hong KongA five year-old boy plays outside his tiny home, which is made of concrete and corrugated metal on the rooftop of an apartment block as he lives with his parents in an illegal rooftop dwellingA resident walks outside his illegal rooftop dwelling, which is located next to a public housing estate, in the backgroundLi Suet-wen and her son, 6, and daughter, 8, live in a 120-square foot room crammed with a bunk bed, small couch, fridge, washing machine and small table in Hong Kong.

In wealthy Hong Kong, there\u0027s a dark side to a housing boom, with hundreds of thousands of people forced to live in partitioned shoebox apartments, \u0027coffin homes\u0027 and other inadequate housingMy friends and family back home were at the coal face of it. My parents were sending me angry face emojis and announced they were moving to France (two years on they’re still in Essex – their plans to move are about as far along as Theresa May’s). Other friends who’d been up all night sent me bleary-eyed emojis and lightly indignant Whatsapp messages –\u0026nbspwasn’t I glad I lived all those miles away?At that point, the 6,000 mile chasm did feel just that: thousands of miles away. In Hong Kong, a very different type of politics talk was on the agenda for dinner-party conversation –\u0026nbspwould Hong Kong keep its independence or be squashed by China? –\u0026nbspand I sort of hoped Brexit might have collapsed under the weight of expectation by March 2019 anyway.Although in the year after it happened, I was glad to live away from the machinations and non-decisions and dreary refrains of “Brexit means Brexit”. Besides, as sterling fell through the floor, I’d managed to cream off more pounds for my Hong Kong dollars that ever before. I even tentatively posited that if the UK did leave the EU, I might as well set up home in Hong Kong instead.Theresa May’s 2017 speech, in which she derided the anywhere people who felt at home across the world, put into words the crude, untrue split between Leavers or Remainers. It was a defining moment for Brexit, and it was a defining moment for me. At the time, I was an “anywhere”\u0026nbspand couldn’t understand how people like me had become anathema to the national feeling. Most worrying was realising that the UK I ached for was not the UK I would find myself in if I moved back.And how I wanted to move back.\u0026nbspAround the time that May made her “citizen of nowhere” speech, I started to grudgingly accept that I must rather like living in Hong Kong –\u0026nbspafter all, I’d been there for two years. It was probably something to do with the lifestyle, which was hard not to love. Champagne brunches in the winter all-you-can-drink junk boat outings in the summer. Life was just easier: the subway always ran on time and you never woke up to a cold floor in the mornings, even in winter. I made true friends that put up with my constant existential whining about Hong Kong (if you’re reading: I’ll always be truly grateful).Plus, there were the opportunities. Expat life was like being back at university (when was the last time you heard a journalist compare Nottingham with Hong Kong?) but with a lot more cash. The people you met for drinks could introduce you to their entire network, and I met an average of six new people a week (in my six years in London, I think I met six new people in total). Somebody you knew was always doing something entrepreneurial –\u0026nbspthanks to the city being one of the most open places to do business in. Everybody knew everybody, which was comforting, until it started to feel suffocating. I couldn’t escape my job, even though I adored it.Eventually I came to realise that champagne brunches and low tax rates and the indifference I had for Hong Kong weren’t the things I wanted from my life or at least not one full enough for me to accept. The fact I lived 12 flying hours away from family and my closest friends, who were getting married and sprogging with alarming briskness, weighed on me heavily. I had planned my own wedding long-distance and it felt like it was happening to somebody else during much of our 18-month engagement.\u0026nbspIn Hong Kong, I always felt hollow at the fact that I didn’t speak the same language, or share the same culture –\u0026nbspor even the adopted expat one. In Asia, I felt more British and stuck in my ways than ever, which seemed like the opposite of the person I thought I was in Britain.And so the decision to move back wasn’t the proverbial lightning bolt. It was a slow blistering of the feeling that me, living in Hong Kong, wasn’t quite right. I frequently felt angry and upset and weak that I couldn’t settle in this most intoxicating of cities. The longer it went on, the more the issue of Brexit started to feel more and more abstract, and in some ways I was grateful for it happening: weren’t we lucky to live in a place that had at least some autonomy, however blunt, over the way the country was run?And so three and a half years almost to the day after setting foot on Hong Kong Island, I ditched the territory for Gatwick Airport (maybe the most British of all airports –\u0026nbspchaos inside, then surrounded by the gorgeous South Downs outside). I even left without my husband, such was my rush to move back.I’ve been home for around two months now, working for The Independent, where I don’t need to be careful about how I talk about China’s nationality complex: I can now write the words “Taiwan”\u0026nbspand “country”\u0026nbspnext to each other. I’ve realised that democracy means more than just voting for my next leader. It means being able to live in a place where I can speak freely, and be part of a dynamic and shouty media landscape unafraid to say what it thinks.The first night I was back, jet lagged and drunk after a bottle and more of wine, I cried in front of my friends about it being “the end of an era” –\u0026nbspand it is. I’ve transitioned with frightening ease back to my old life: I’m living in the same flat, I have the same friends, and I’ve gone back to eating the same thing for dinner. It’s almost like my three and half years abroad never happened.\u0026nbspThe crude difference is that I’ve reacquainted myself with the UK’s sluggish public services and an increased level of danger –\u0026nbspessentially the spoils that come with an open nation.Tangibly, plenty has changed. In the three and a half years I was away, my London neighbourhood, SE1, has sprouted an outdoor food market, and some hip performance space in what was a car park. The UK has its second female prime minister. I can pay for the Tube using Apple Pay, and everybody uses Uber\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspif they’re not getting on the Night Tube. Half the high street has disappeared and isn’t it great I can pick up my Amazon parcel from a locker?China defends decision to deny work visa for Financial Times editor Bus travel hits 12-year-low as prices rise and services axedWhere do the limits lie for ultra-long-haul air travel?And intangibly, plenty has changed. I feel like a different person. I’ve visited some of the most densely populated cities on earth that aren’t well-known (yet) in the UK. I’ve embedded myself into a culture completely separate from my own and seen how the developing world views the UK. I’ve learned\u0026nbspscraps of Mandarin and known bone-crushing loneliness. I’ve transitioned back to being the well-travelled one among my friends, whereas in Hong Kong I felt like the polar opposite.I can’t say it wasn’t gut-wrenching to leave a life and friends I loved, although the idea of not living in my home country again tore at something even more primal –\u0026nbspBrexit or no Brexit. I’ve at last accepted that I just didn’t like Hong Kong that much, however much I enjoyed the lifestyle.Now, back in London, I have moments of such vibrating happiness to walk along some dingy street in Elephant and Castle I feel I might burst. I wait for a delayed train and my heart feels full (I know, weird).\u0026nbspI’m back in my city, and I’m back on my sofa.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Used for conditions such as myopia and cataracts.“It is unlikely that other animals would be affected because pheromones are so species specific,” said Professor Kazushige Touhara from the University of Tokyo, who led the project.“The sex-rejecting behaviour is an innate instinct, so it’s also unlikely that the mice will learn to change their behaviour.”A similar pheromone called ESP1 is produced by male mice to encourage sex, and the scientists found that ESP22 signals essentially replace these signals in the females’ brains.“ESP22 is difficult to artificially synthesise, so we want to find a smaller portion of the pheromone molecule that could be added to mouse drinking water,” said Professor Touhara.“This could prevent mice breeding in areas where they are pests.”The scientists noted that due to pheromones being highly species specific, direct connections between human and mouse behaviour could not be made in this case.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Lady Green owns all of the shares in their company, Taveta, which is registered in Jersey and controls Arcadia.\u0026nbspSir Philip has claimed he chose to live in the principality\u0026nbspbecause of a “heart scare” he had twenty years ago.Lady Green has pointed out other benefits to tax havens: “My understanding is that jurisdictions such as Jersey and the British Virgin Islands are commonly preferred for their strong regulatory regimes,” she wrote to MPs\u0026nbspin 2016.The Arcadia Group is the clothing empire that made Sir Philip’s reputation as a retail king and remains the source of much of his wealth. It boasts some of the biggest names on the high street: Dorothy Perkins, Miss Selfridge, Wallis, Evans, Burton and - the jewel in the crown - Topshop, which has successfully expanded into the US in recent years.But the rapid upward trajectory has recently reversed with the Arcadia’s value being slashed by half in just a year. Topshop’s revenues dropped 5.6 per cent last year, in spite of a jump in online sales.Topshop lost £10.9m in the year to August 2017, compared with a £59.4m profit in the previous 12 months. It also has a worrying pension deficit of up to £1bn - not the first time one of Sir Philip’s companies have experienced problems in that regard.The tycoon bought BHS for £200m in 2000 and took it back into private ownership. He rebranded it as British Home Stores and brought it under his Arcadia umbrella before ridding himself of it in 2015, by which time it had racked up £1.3bn in debt including a large pension deficit.\u0026nbspUntil the recent sexual harassment allegations it was Sir Philip’s conduct during and after the disposal of BHS that had most tarnished reputation.Pensions committee chair Sir Frank Field summed it up succinctly earlier this year: “Sir Philip Green stripped BHS bare and then left it for dead, with contemptuous disregard for the pensioners.”\u0026nbspPhilip Green\u0027s case is proof that we need to get rid of NDAs for good£500,000 in 28 seconds is the fastest money Philip Green has ever lostPhilip Green named in parliament as businessman who gagged mediaSurrounding himself with \u0027yes\u0027 men was Philip Green’s undoingAre Sir Philip Green and Frank Field up for a rematch? Let\u0027s just seeThe businessman sold BHS for £1 to a company controlled by a Dominic Chappell, a man who had been declared bankrupt three times and had no retail experience.\u0026nbspThe chain collapsed into administration a year later, with 11,000 jobs lost and a £571m deficit in the pension scheme.\u0026nbspThe Pensions Regulator found that the “main purpose” of the transaction was so that Sir Philip could avoid liability for the fund which contained 22,000 people’s retirement savings.Sir Philip came under heavy and sustained fire from the regulator and MPs, before eventually making a voluntary payment of £363m to help make up the deficit.\u0026nbspMPs recommend former BHS owner Sir Philip Green is stripped of knighthoodSir Philip owns three luxurious yachts including the 295ft Lionheart which he bought for £100m at about the same time as he took collection of a £46m Gulfstream private jet and offloaded BHS.He was believed to be holidaying on the Lionheart in the Mediterranean when he stated in September 2016 that he was “working every day” to save the stricken retailer’s pension scheme.\u0026nbspThe previous month he was filmed\u0026nbspon the Greek Island of Ithaca attacking a reporter who tried to question him about BHS’ demise. “That’s going in the f***** sea,” Sir Philip shouted while pointing towards the reporter’s camera equipment.The Pensions Regulator said at the time that the vessel could be seized in order to generate cash to pay into the BHS fund. In the end he kept both the yacht and his knighthood, though there will now be renewed calls for him to be stripped of the latter.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable said following a meeting with Mr Barnier on Thursday: “My message to Michel Barnier was clear: it’s time to start serious contingency planning for a People’s Vote. We know the UK government has started making such plans as a result of the growing demand for such a vote, demonstrated by last weekend’s march,”\u0026nbsp“The EU should do the same, because MPs who back the People’s Vote are fast forming the biggest and most cohesive bloc in Westminster.UK-EU transport links after Brexit \u0027increasingly a cause for concern’MPs \u0027far more likely to reject Brexit deal\u0027 if unable to amend itPound sterling falls to six-week low as Theresa May faces Brexit backlPlaid Cymru Westminster group leader Liz Saville Roberts, who also met with Mr Barnier said she had used the meeting to push for an extension to the negotiation period to accommodate a referendum.“I pressed Michel Barnier on protecting Wales’s interest through the extension of Article 50 and a People’s Vote,” she said.“In Westminster, with the Prime Minister’s proposals amounting to nothing more than a mix of fudge and fantasy, a People’s Vote is more likely than ever.”The EU has previously reacted cooly to suggestions that the period could be extended, but has not ruled it out. An extension would require the unanimous approval of all 28 EU leaders on the European Council.\u0026nbspSadiq Khan visited Brussels on Friday\u0026nbsp(Getty)Brussels is particularly wary about extending the transition into May, when Britain would have to take part in the next European Parliament elections if it was still in the EU.Mr Khan, speaking after a separate meeting on Friday, said: “The point I made to Michel Barnier, really quite forcefully, is that there is a possibility of the British parliament rejecting the deal that Mrs May secures from the EU.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in LondonDemonstrators pass Trafalgar Square as they take part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.Demonstrators wave Union and European flags and hold up placards as they pass Trafalgar Square, taking part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.

In those circumstances I suggested the EU should begin preparatory work on the extension of article 50.“Because what would not be a good thing in my view is if we managed to get a referendum but it was too late because we had left the EU or the EU had not made preparations for an article 50 extension.”Mr Khan added: “Whatever Theresa May brings back will probably be rejected by cabinet, almost certainly rejected by the party, and if not will definitely be rejected by parliament.“That’s why I said to Michel Barnier: listen, you need to start preparing for the possibility of extending article 50 because if that is the case we will need time to have a referendum.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We will take responsibility and sort out this mess with a people’s vote.”Speaking to The Independent beforehand, she said many Tory MPs were privately supportive of a second referendum amid bitter isions in the party.Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said the sheer scale of the event showed that “confidence is growing” in the fight for a fresh vote.To huge cheers, London mayor Sadiq Khan said the march marked a\u0026nbsp“historic moment in our democracy”.Over 700,000 protesters’ call for second Brexit referendumTheresa May told she’s ‘heading for dead end’ in Brexit talksThe collective spreading cheer to Brexit-weary BritsEx-cabinet secretaries condemn Tory Brexiteers for undermining MayFinal Say: Meet some of the people marching a fresh Brexit vote He told protestors: “We’ve heard some complain that a public vote would be undemocratic and unpatriotic. But the opposite is true.“There’s nothing more democratic – nothing more British – than trusting the people to have the final say on our future.”MPs from across the political spectrum addressed the rally, including Green MP Caroline Lucas, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, Labour’s Chuka Umunna and Tory MP Dr Sarah Wollaston, who drew huge cheers when she compared\u0026nbspBrexit to a botched operation.Christian Broughton, editor of The Independent,\u0026nbsptold the crowds: “Theresa May says that the Final Say referendum will be a politicians’ vote, not a people’s vote, but we can all remember what some politicians told us in 2016.“We, the people, can all now see what’s really coming. And from where I’m standing it looks like a people’s vote to me.”He revealed that The Independent’s petition for a Final Say had achieved more than 940,000 signatures, adding: “We have to keep on showing up and signing up.”People did show up in their thousands for the march, which was extremely cheerful, except for a handful of Ukip protestors who screamed\u0026nbsp“Losers”\u0026nbspat passers-by from outside Downing Street.An army of students, college pupils and young activists led the march in a sign of the impact of the Brexit vote on the younger generation, some 1.4 million of whom have become eligible to vote since the referendum.Femi Oluwole, from the youth group Our Future Our Choice, told The Independent: “What we are trying to do is bring people together, as nobody has any confidence in what the government is doing.”He said young people were going to be hit hardest by Brexit, both economically and in the opportunities to live and work abroad.Among the crowds was Piero Passet, a 71-year-old restaurant owner from Turin, said he was marching because he was concerned for the future of the younger generation.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in LondonDemonstrators pass Trafalgar Square as they take part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.Demonstrators wave Union and European flags and hold up placards as they pass Trafalgar Square, taking part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.

This is my firm belief and this is my understanding of democracy.”Mr Bullmann’s intervention is particularly significant because EU figures have so far been reticent to call for a second vote – for fear they might be seen as interfering in Britain\u0027s\u0026nbsppolitics.But the vast show of support on the streets of the capital has apparently encouraged some in Brussels and Strasbourg to break cover and speak out.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in LondonDemonstrators pass Trafalgar Square as they take part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.Demonstrators wave Union and European flags and hold up placards as they pass Trafalgar Square, taking part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.

It is only right that they have a say in their nation’s future.”Mr Hutton added: “This careful analysis shows just how badly young people – already disadvantaged by the breakdown of career structures and high housing costs – will be further hit by Brexit.”And Mr\u0026nbspOluwole said: “Now that the implications for our generation have become clear, we need a People’s Vote on the government’s Brexit deal.”The research comes as the Brexit talks remain deadlocked over the issue of the Irish border backstop – with just five months until departure day next March.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Understanding the ‘clans’ offers valuable insights into who might want what from Brexit and how this might affect future elections, or indeed referendum outcomes.”Between the 2015 and 2017 election both Labour and the Tories increased their share in many of the groups, squeezing out smaller parties.Created with Sketch.How big are the UK\u0027s voter clans and how do they vote?

Amazon shares dropped as much as 8 per cent in after-hours trading after it reported quarterly sales of $56.58bn (£44.16bn), missing expectations of $57.1bn. Alphabet’s stock fell 4.7 per cent after it posted revenue of $33.74bn, missing Wall Street’s target of $34.04bn, although earnings of $13.06 per share came in well ahead of the expected $10.42 per share. Google reveals it has sacked 48 employees over sexual harassmentGoogle leak reveals plans for censored search engine in ChinaEbay sues Amazon, accusing rival of illegally poaching sellersAmazon wage increase could result in lower pay for some employees“Google’s earnings momentum remains strong,” said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at Investing. “But if you dig in a little deeper, there are cost pressures which are building up and are mainly responsible for this period’s disappointment.”Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said the “poorly received” earnings from Alphabet and Amazon had “soured the mood on what had been a rebounding US session”. However, Christopher Rossbach, CIO of investment firm J. Stern \u0026amp Co, said the companies both remain fundamentally strong, despite missing market expectations. “While their revenues were both slightly lower than expected, with Amazon additionally guiding slightly lower than street expectations for the next quarter, they still both show good profitability,” he said. \u0026nbsp“Alphabet is the leader in search and advertising, and Amazon is the leader in e-commerce and cloud computing, and increasingly benefits from advertising too. The fundamentals of both companies are intact and we believe that any significant weakness is a buying opportunity for long-term investors.”Other tech stocks that dipped in after-hours include Apple, which fell 1.6 per cent, and Twitter, which was down 2.5 per cent.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The Sea Shepherd Cove s group says the 2018-19 quota is 2,040, although most years fewer than 1,000 animals are usually taken. Critics say the cap is set high to make the real number killed appear low.Nikki Botha, from a group called Women of the World United Against Taiji, and who is often based at the port monitoring the hunt, told The Independent the world would be horrified if people knew how babies are regularly thrown back into the sea just to die.“These young animals are separated from their mothers and pod mates as hunters don’t want to waste their self-imposed quota on such a small amount of ‘product’,” she said.“The chances of survival of these young animals are extremely slim without the protection of their pod and their mothers’ guidance in survival.She said she had seen\u0026nbsphunters laughing at the animals’\u0026nbspdistress.Once the cove went silent and the tarps were fully drawn back, our team got a glimpse of bright red blood in the shallowsIn the wild, dolphin calves consume their mothers’ milk for about the first two years of life, then stay with them for up to six more years.Campaigners say that even if a youngster was able to survive physically being orphaned, seeing its family slaughtered would leave it highly traumatised.The port of Taiji has become a byword among campaigners for the “barbarity” of devastating dolphin families and turning the ocean red with blood.Sea Shepherd has this season counted four captives, four juveniles returned to the sea and 18 adults slaughtered, across four hunt drives.Last month, the Ric O’Barry’s Dolphin Project group, which also has volunteers in place, reported how a pod of Risso’s dolphins was driven into the cove “where they met a heartbreaking fate”.“Among them were two traumatised juveniles, which were taken from their mothers’ sides and dumped back out at sea,” the group said.“The remaining ones were dragged under the cove’s tarps and slaughtered. A skiff went under the tarps and came out dragging the carcasses of the five remaining Risso’s, under a grey cover.Taiji harbour (Ric O’Barry’s Dolphin Project)“Once the cove went silent and the tarps were fully drawn back, our team got a glimpse of bright red blood in the shallows.”Dolphin drive hunts are carried out by fleets of boats that chase pods on migration routes by banging on metal poles placed in the sea to create a wall of sound that drives the mammals towards the shore.Dolphins depend on echolocation – using sound waves that bounce off objects – to navigate under water, so are susceptible to the technique.Once cornered, they are killed for meat – despite warnings that their flesh is contaminated with mercury – or held in pens and sold to dolphinariums where they spend their lives in pools that are condemned for being just a fraction of the size of the oceans they would use in the wild.Hunters receive about $500 (£380) for a dead dolphin sold for meat, but the Taiji Whale Museum, which buys them live from hunters and holds them in pens at the harbour, receives more than $150,000 from aquariums for one that has been trained, according to Ric O’Barry’s Dolphin Project. The museum subsidises the drive hunts for that reason.Last week monitors photographed a trainer inserting a tube into a “seemingly unwilling” dolphin. “Captured dolphins are conditioned to accept these unpleasant sensations on a regular basis to prepare them for procedures such as force feeding and blood draws,” a volunteer said.\u0026nbspThe group also reported how three Risso’s dolphins held in Taiji’s harbour were reluctant to eat after being caught. After a few days they started to accept squid thrown in the water by trainers.\u0026nbspBut the Cove s reported that one in particular was in trouble. Niji was completely uninterested in food and her behaviour had changed.Niji\u0026nbspwas uninterested in food and is clearly depressed“In previous days, her surface time and location were steady, predictable and repetitive. This morning her surfacing pattern was erratic – anywhere from 7 to 34 seconds.“This afternoon, however, we noticed something worrying. Each time Niji surfaced, she was lopsided, favouring her right side. This is not a good sign. It is clear that she is depressed and struggling to adjust to her new circumstances.“Needless to say we are very, very worried about her.”Niji was not fed at all today, they said.On another occasion, witnesses saw a pod of eight driven into the cove where five adults were slaughtered, a juvenile was taken into captivity and two others were dumped back at sea.Three\u0026nbspweeks ago four dolphins owned by the Taiji Whale Museum and held in harbour pens died in the typhoon that swept Japan.Created with Sketch.Dying to make us happy: The bloody truth behind the dolphinarium Show all 5Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.At least one died of respiratory failure, and it’s feared others were injured.Anna Oliver, of Sea Shepherd UK, said they might have been hit by flying debris or died of stress or dehydration if they were not fed during the storm.Taiji’s mayor has said in the long term he wants to convert a bay into a massive dolphin pool as a “research centre”, suggesting he has no intention of heeding calls for the hunting to end.Annual dolphin catches have declined, in part because of growing awareness of international distaste for the hunt and alarm over mercury poisoning, and in part because of 2009 documentary The Cove, in which Ric O’Barry revealed the practices used at Taiji.The Japanese embassy in the UK declined to comment when contacted by The Independent.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

How to get to sleep when the clocks go back this weekend: Six tipsAs well as a good nights sleep, Dr Sarita Robinson, principal lecturer in psychology at the University of Central Lancashire said one way to embrace the darker mornings and nights is to get organised.Dr Robinson said: \u0026ldquoGetting organised now for the impact of colder weather can take a significant amount of strain out of the autumn and winter period.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoBuying de-icer for the car, grit for the driveway or even getting a few Christmas presents now can help reduce stress and mean that you\u0026rsquore not faced with the last minute rush for the festive season.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoPeople can also feel stressed out by work or family life when they try to do too many things at the same time.\u0026nbspGetting organised is one way to be ready for winter (Image: )\u0026ldquoDuring the winter season, it\u0027s important to try and get things back into balance.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoThere are a few simple changes that can be made to help do this, including monotasking, which involves focusing on one activity at a time, such as going to a museum and enjoying your visit at a slow pace.\u0026ldquoAs the days get shorter, we often feel like crawling under the duvet, but getting some exercise and daylight can help us to maintain a healthy sleep pattern.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoGoing for a walk in a local park for a couple of hours is one way to help kids get out and about, and tire out the ones who are poor sleepers.CLOCKS CHANGE: Keeping active and heading out for a walk can get rid of winter tiredness (Image: )Another tip is to invest in a clock with a light feature, which on dark mornings will wake you up with light rather than a blaring alarm.\u0026nbspHealthy eating and exercise could also stave off illnesses associated with the winter months.The NHS advises regular consumption of fruit, vegetables and dairy products will help to boost your immune system.To keep winter tiredness at bay, the NHS also suggests getting outdoors in natural daylight as much as possible.

None detonated and no one has been hurt.The devices were thought to have been fashioned from bomb-making designs widely available on the internet, a federal law enforcement source told Reuters.Still, investigators are treating the devices as live explosives, not a hoax, said James O\u0027Neill, the New York City police commissioner. Two of the parcels surfaced there.William Sweeney, assistant director of the FBI, told a news conference in New York: It does remain possible that further packages have been or could be mailedInvestigators have declined to say whether the devices were built to be functional. Bomb experts and security analysts say that based on their rudimentary construction it appeared they were more likely designed to sow fear rather than to kill.The parcels each consisted of a manila envelope with a bubble-wrap interior containing potentially destructive devices, the FBI said. Each was affixed with a computer-printed address label and six U.S. Forever postage stamps, the agency said.Others who received the bombs were former Attorney General Eric Holder, former CIA director John Brennan, U.S. Representative Maxine Waters of California, and actor Robert De Nero. Two packages were sent both to Waters and Biden.Brennan\u0027s package was sent in care of the New York bureau of CNN, where he has appeared as an on-air analyst.The episode sparked an outcry from Trump\u0027s critics, who charged that his inflammatory rhetoric against Democrats and the press has created a climate for politically motivated violence.After first calling for unity and civil discourse on Wednesday, Trump lashed out again Thursday at the hateful media. His supporters accused Democrats of unfairly suggesting the president was to blame for the bomb scare.Mr Trump wrote on Twitter in the early hours of this morning: Funny how lowly rated CNN, and others, can criticise me at will, even blaming me for the current spate of Bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th and the Oklahoma City bombing, yet when I criticise them they go wild and scream, \u0026lsquoit\u0027s just not Presidential!\u0026rsquoTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS STORY.

So is Hammond’s next door.Whoever takes over — Boris, David Davis or Jeremy Hunt — needs an emergency clear-out.The big guns of the Treasury need to be pointed at the “enemy” not its own side.After two long, wasted years, Britain is engaged in an unexpectedly desperate fight, not just to salvage Brexit but to save British democracy.Weekend crowds demanding a second referendum seem oblivious to the threat such a crazy re-run would pose to this nation’s centuries-old stability, ironically the envy of Europe.We cannot reverse the  referendum without turning Brexit into a perpetual running sore. And Britain can never rejoin the EU except on its knees.The only way to put this corrosive issue to bed is for Brexit to succeed — as it will, despite treacherous Tony Blair and Facebook hypocrite Nick Clegg.To succeed as we must we need a new chancellor as well as a new prime minister.Diehard Remainer Phil Hammond should be first out the door.It was Spreadsheet Phil who vetoed vital preparations for No Deal — now a better-than - prospect with time rapidly running out.And it was Hammond who surrendered the one negotiating weapon Brussels fears most — a thriving, low-tax Britain competing with the EU on its doorstep.Our economic fate is entirely in our hands. We can make taxes and tarfs as competitive as we like.Better investment incentives and lower corporation tax rates would trigger a flood of foreign investment in UK plc — and ensure car makers like Nissan and Toyota never leave our shores.Yet the British Chancellor of the Exchequer has ruled them out.“Phil is like those Harry Potter Dementor creatures,” says a top Tory. “He sucks the le out of any room he happens to be in.”Hammond is easily replaced. Michael Gove, an ex-future PM but a formidable Cabinet minister, has the drive and imagination to take on the Treasury “Blob”.There is no shortage of Brexit talent on the Tory benches.Just compare thundering Attorney General Geoffrey Cox QC with prissy dried-stick predecessor Dominic Grieve.Grieve is busy sabotaging Brexit. Cox finds ways to make it work.He is now “marking Number Ten’s homework” on Mrs May’s wretched Northern Ireland “backstop”.Some even tip him as a dark horse in the leadership stakes.There is one other big change needed at the heart of Britain’s Brexit team.Our next PM must have a new EU negotiator.Nobody could be worse than Olly Robbins, already reportedly eyeing up a £m-a-year golden parachute into a top City job.Lelong Europhile Robbins has led Mrs May into so many disastrous EU traps — especially her humiliation in Salzburg — he is often cast as an EU “double agent”.It was Robbins who told EU negotiator Michel Barnier that Britain might stay indefinitely in “transition” while the fantasy Northern Ireland backstop was sorted out.And pay £bn more on top of the £bn ransom for the privilege.The idea that Robbins is the “EU’s man in Whitehall” is not such a stretch when you consider his Jeremy Corbyn-style applause for Communist Russia.Kremlin leaders, he told fellow Oxford students in , “changed Russia from a backward peasant autocracy, despised by the West, into a technological giant at whom the world cowered in fear for half a century.”Everyone is entitled to youthful naivety.But can anyone imagine Olly Robbins fighting our corner for EU democracy and accountability, let alone the referendum verdict of .m Brexit-voting Brits SAUDI Arabia’s rulers must be really annoyed with dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.This elderly trouble maker walked alone into his country’s Turkish consulate knowing he might never emerge alive.He was clearly looking for trouble.Once inside, using his bare hands, he attacked a gang of  innocent Saudi torturers who had just flown in for a couple of hours’ holiday armed only with a bone saw and a hypodermic syringe.Then, to the embarrassment of kindly Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, he went and hid his own body.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Smoking tobacco is bad news.But vaping is dferent.You heat up a solution called an e-liquid, which typically contains nicotine, a propellant called propylene glycol and or vegetable glycerin and flavourings.What you don’t do is burn tobacco or produce tar or carbon monoxide — two of the most harmful elements of all in tobacco smoke.Sure, some vapes may contain a fraction of some of the harmful chemicals found in cigarette smoke, but they are present at much lower levels,detectable at all.So are they safe  According to all the international medically-reviewed evidence from such expert organisations as Public Health England, the Royal Colleges of Physicians and General Practitioners, the British Medical Association and Cancer Research UK, e-cigarettes are at least  per cent safer than traditional cigarettes.The American Cancer Society and the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine both agree with them.Yes, the nicotine, of course, is addictive. But so what  So is caffeine, even eating.Contrary to popular belief, nicotine does not give you cancer and it is relatively harmless generally.Apparently only  per cent of the population know this.Happily, there is no evidence of harm to other people from vaping and,used instead of nicotine replacement gum or patches, may even help expectant mums remain smoke-free in the long term.As a doctor I don’t want any young person or non-nicotine user to try vaping. Ever. Period.As it happens, regular use of e-cigs among “never” smokers is still very rare at just . per cent.But look at what they’ve done to help tobacco smokers quit.In the UK, .million vapers have quit smoking completely and more than , have given up both smoking and vaping.In fact, this is Britain’s most popular method of quitting with two-thirds stopping successfully when used alongside professional stop-smoking NHS support.In this country we have some of the strictest regulations in the world.E-cigs are subject to minimum standards of quality and safety as well as clear packaging and labelling requirements.All ingredients have to be notied, advertising is prohibited in media such as television, newspapers and magazines, it is illegal to sell them to under s and to adults intending to pass them on to under s.That is responsible regulation whichever way you look at it.This month’s national Stoptober campaign recommends using e- cigarettes as a stop-smoking aid andit helps some of the million smokers in the UK kick the habit for good then perhaps doctors like me will see fewer people in our surgeries struggling to breath or devastated by a cancer diagnosis.AndI see any ex-smoking patients of mine having a quiet vape outside my surgery door, I shall give them a heartfelt pat on the back and cherish the fact that there will be one less nasty fag end polluting the street.NICOTINE contained in e-liquids is a highly addictive substance that raises blood pressure and spikes your adrenalin, increasing the chances of having a heart attack.This is particularly worrying as we see a number of iniduals who are constantly vaping, especially as it is seen as more convenient and cost-effective than lighting up a cigarette, as well as being considered more socially acceptable to vape indoors.While vaping appears to be safer than cigarettes, the truth is that it hasn’t been around long enough for us to know the potential damage it can cause to our health.The long-term effects of the chemicals contained in e-liquids haven’t been examined.However, I have looked into ious research that has been carried out on certain e-liquids that were found to contain substances that can cause damage to the immune system and are linked to other health conditions such as cancer.Vaping isn’t great for your oral health either.It’s common for vaping to cause a dry mouth, and I’ve met a number of iniduals who have developed oral thrush, most likely caused by vaping.Although nicotine does not have a colour, it becomes yellow when combined with oxygen which could lead to tooth discolouration.As nicotine is a vasocon-strictor, it limits blood flow in oral tissue, which can cause gum disease and bad breath.As time goes on, I am reading new research which proves vaping has a negative effect on health.To what extent, only time will tell.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Why do they not get paid what they are worth to their company, and why are so many overlooked for promotion The sad fact is that for every £ men earn, women make just  pence.Just over one in ten women negotiated their starting salary, while more than half of all men haggle with their boss before they have even started work.When women do ask for more pay, they are  per cent less likely to get a raise. Andthey do receive a wage increase it will be  per cent less than men get.Sadly, it is common in business that women are often viewed as weak or unable to cope. And once we think about or start a family, we become toxic to employers.I receive hundreds of direct messages on social media from women asking: “How do I get a pay rise  How do I get noticed at work  How can I get promoted  How can I get on after maternity leave ”So now I am launching Get What You Want, a series of online masterclasses and podcasts covering everything from getting promoted to dealing with the word no, overcoming challenges, negotiating pay, writing a fantastic CV and nailing an interview.It will also cover baby-proofing careers, as well as becoming a super-mum after maternity leave.A lot of women have skills but just lack confidence. As women, we don’t shout about our wins enough for fear we will appear arrogant, even though men talk about them all the time.Here are some of my tips to winning at work.When people say: “I hate my job” I always ask: “Why are you telling me  I can’t do anything about it.”YOU have to do something. Sit down and work out what it is you don’t like about the position and set yourself a task of getting a new one.Be very dedicated and very professional and excel when you get to the interview.Many people don’t realise that when you are invited for an interview it is because they believe you can do the job.The secret is convincing them that you can do the job better than anyone .You should be able to talk about your specialist subject, which is yourself.People find it very dficult to list all the things they have done really well in a professional way to show good examples of why they can do the job.Opening a negotiation is all about knowing your worth.And knowing your value is really about your self-worth. They are totally linked.Write down all the things where you have made a big ­contribution, all the things that you have changed and made a dference, how you have added value. Put together testimonials to really back up what you have done.Then work out what more you want to do, because going above and beyond your job description is very important.Take out all the emotion, go in and lay out for your boss the facts of what you’ve contributed to the organisation.Sometimes people can be very passive. They say: “I’ll go along with what everyone  agrees with.”They want to avoid conflict. They don’t really think their opinion is as important as other people’s, so they are simply giving others a licence to ignore them.Learn to say no. Say: “I don’t really have the time butI can make the time I can do it for you.” Otherwise you become like a human sponge. Don’t let them take advantage.Employers take advantage of women’s lack of confidence, especially a mother ing from maternity leave. Many feel so grateful to have a job that they tend to put up with almost anything.Eleven per cent of new mothers report that they have been dismissed or made redundant where others in their workplace were not, or were treated so poorly they felt they had to leave.That means as many as , women are losing their jobs each year.Have a really clear plan of how you will manage at home and manage work.

Ms Knightley, who adds, “Rescue yourself,” clearly feels she is protecting daughter Edie by banning something that doesn’t concur with her own off-the-shelf, Poundland version of what feminism should be.But what she’s in danger of doing is wilfully nurturing a potential “snowflake” who, rather than develop the critical thinking skills that allow healthy debate, will simply stick their fingers in their ears and cry foul when they see or hear something that dfers from their own world view.Keira, tonight’s homework is to really readCinderella and analyse it.Look past the Disney-esque cute rodents, pretty frocks and glass slippers and instead dig a little deeper to ­appreciate the original’s narrative of how hope can turn unjust oppression into ­triumphant reward.Cinderella is a young woman who has not only suffered the loss of her loving father, but now faces a letime of abuse from an uncaring stepmother and her equally unpleasant daughters.But instead of sitting in the ashes ­waiting unquestioningly for whatever fate might have in store for her, she remains resolutely ­optimistic and decides to secretly defy her nemesis by gatecrashing a hot-ticket party to which she hasn’t been invited.Now that’s girl power.Ultimately, she “‘rescues” herself by proactively going to the ball where, instead of abuse, she experiences the redemptive qualities of love and kindness.They just happen to come in the form of a handsome prince.In the same week, Kristen Bell — who coincidentally voices Anna in the Disney film Frozen — found herself caught up in the slipstream of Keira’s PC virtue signalling after reportedly saying that Snow White gives young girls the wrong ­message about consent “because you cannot kiss someonethey’re sleeping”.Except Kristen’s comment was taken out of context and she’s got the balance right.Because what she actually said was that she reads the story with her two ­daughters, aged five and three, then asks them: “Don’t you think it’s weird that Snow White didn’t ask the old witch why she needed to eat the apple ” before starting up a conversation about the dos and don’ts of taking food from strangers.Or, “Don’t you think that it’s weird that the prince kisses Snow White without her permission ” to float an almost subliminal, age-appropriate understanding of what does and doesn’t constitute ­consent.Kristen isn’t banning tales of old, she’s using them to stimulate discussions.In other words, teaching her children the vital le skills of critical thinking — dictionary definition: “the objective analysis and evaluation of an issue in order to form a judgment” — and being able to rationally debate that judgment with someone whose view might dfer from your own.Attempting to sanitise a child’s world by airbrushing history will hinder, not help them.Instead, wield history’s lessons as a tool to educate.Cinderella was of its time and now the Disney pendulum has seemingly swung the other way to depict a world where all the central characters are feisty, opinionated young women who power-kick their way through le.But how will Keira’s daughter know how far the depiction of Disney ­princesses has comeshe’s not allowed to see where they’ve been ONE morning last week, I spent a glorious couple of hours walking around Westminster Abbey.Buried or commemorated there are, among others, more than , great Britonsincluding Sir Isaac Newton, Jane Austen, Noel Coward, Charles Darwin, the Bronte sisters, Clement Attlee, Charles Dickens, David Livingstone, Stephen Hawking and, of course, the grave of the unknown warrior, buried on November ,  “in honour of the many multitudes who during the Great War of - gave the most that man can give . . . le itself.”My mother works at the Abbey as a “blue-gowner” – the volunteer guides there to answer any questions not covered by the electronic headsets – and, while showing us the ft by ft grave of poet Ben Jonson, who is the only person there to be buried upright, she was approached by a couple of earnest-looking women in their early twenties.Amid such a rich seam of history, rigorous intellect and achievement, what did they ask “Excuse me, where did David Beckham sit for the royal wedding ”THE number of stay-at-home dads has dropped to the lowest level in five years.Experts reckon it could be due to men “growing tired” of the tough job of raising kids.Proof,needed, might be the glassy-eyed expression of Bond actor Daniel Craig,  just six weeks after we Rachel Weisz gave birth to their daughter.He never looks this knackered when he’s jumping off buildings and dodging bullets.Stay-at-home parenthood can be isolating, sometimes dull, frequently thankless and relentlessly bloody exhausting. Only the strong survive it.THANKS to Ryanair’s ­astonishing failure to act when a passenger racially abused Windrush immigrant Delsie Gayle on one of its flights, the man will likely escape prosecution because of jurisdictional issues once a plane takes off from one country’s airspace to another.Instead, he is likely only to be banned from ever travelling on Ryanair again.Which, as plenty of the budget airline’s past ­customers might tell you, could equally be regarded as a blessing rather than a punishment.COMEDIAN Seann Walsh and his Strictly partner Katya Jones have survived the dreaded dance-off to, presumably, jive another day.Because, let’s face it, since that snog, the Strictly bosses are ­rapidly running out of drearily chaste dances to give them.Last weekend it was the unsexy Charleston, ­performed in equally unsexy “Where’s Wally” outfits that virtually screamed “nothing to see here”. Then this weekend it was a faintly ­ludicrous, undeniably platonic quickstep that saw them trotting around the floor like a couple of hyperactive show ponies.Assuming the sizzling Argentine tango is, er, strictly no-go, whatever next  A jive in burkas  A Viennese waltz in sackcloths Not least from Tom himself, perhaps, whose first we Mimi Rogers bemoaned the lack of intimacy in their union because, she claims, he wanted to be a monk and “thought he had to be celibate to maintain the purity of his instrument, but my instrument needed tuning, and we had to split.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Sorry, do you just want to stare at me, it’s making me uncomfortable that’s all.”Mr Fuller replied: “I wasn’t quite just staring at you but I don’t want to make you uncomfortable.

He got on his satellite phone and called for a tender to come and meet him.Seeing that I had blood pouring from my mouth me he ran quickly and escaped onto a tender to his boat.The photographer added: Had he have asked in a civil manner I would have just deleted the pictures.He didn’t even ask he just attacked me from behind in a thuggish and brutish way.

Ultimately its a decision for the Honours Forfeiture Committee.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said Sir Philip narrowly and luckily escaped losing his knighthood over the pensions scandal.And he added: If these allegations are correct, he should certainly be stripped of his knighthood.Mr Field said he would push for the creation of a new procedure allowing MPs to raise abuse cases in Parliament.I am seeking to raise urgently with the Government the importance of having a mechanism in Parliament through which the voices of victims of abuse can be heard, said the Birkenhead MP.This would develop the role of the House of Commons in a way which stands up for people who have little money, against those who have much.Lord Hain said he had received overwhelming support - particularly from women after making his shock statement to the House of Lords.The recent allegations against Sir Philip do not mark the first time workers have spoken out about his alleged conduct.An anonymous employee in  wrote for the : Hatred is a terrible thing, but I have no idea what other response there could possibly be to a man such as Philip Green.The man is like a cancer: seemingly determined to grow and spread his little empire with no concern whatsoever for the effect that it may have on others.Sir Philip was unmasked yesterday by former cabinet minister Lord Hain, who used the protection of parliamentary privilege to identy the Arcadia chairman as the inidual behind a legal injunction preventing The Dailyfrom publishing confidential information from five employees.The paper reported that the tycoon is a the centre of #MeToo allegations including sexual harassment and racial abuse.He he said he categorically and wholly denied being guilty of any unlawful sexual or racist behaviour, in a statement issued hours after the Labour peers dramatic intervention in the House of Lords."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT0004308205801.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"people wont be putting clocks back","story":"Many don’t even realise they will wake up on Sunday morning after getting an extra hour of sleep.That is because more than half of UK adults,  per cent, no longer use analogue timepieces or technology.Brits will be waking up on Sunday morning to a home full of digital devices and Internet-connected phones, computers, TVs and appliances that will automatically reset the time themselves.The research was carried out by OSS Technology and it gives an insight into how physically winding the clocks back and fiddling with our watches will soon be a thing of the past.For the  per cent of Brits who say they still own analogue devices, at least  per cent of them have at least one device at home that is an hour out.And for a third of those polled, ignorance is bliss because they don’t even know that British Summer Timeis going to end.OSS Technology surveyed , adults across the UK to find out how they are preparing for the time change this Sunday.This year, Sunday, March , marked the start of BST and clocks went forward by one hour.The change ensures that there is more daylight in the evenings and less in the mornings.Greenwich Mean Timewill resume from the last Sunday in October– when the clocks go back one hour again.To avoid confusion, many use the phrase spring forward in spring, fall back in fall to remember when the clocks change.Clocks around Britain will go back at am on October , this is when BST goes and weto the classic GMT."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000444557723.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"used condom co op fridge","story":"Kenny Moore and friend Michael Bradshaw were disgusted when they made the discovery while on their lunch break in Holton-le-Clay, Lincs.And the pair claim workers had rled through the fridge and discovered another contraceptive.Kenny, , said: I went into the shop to get a meal deal out of the fridge.I got my sandwich, my pork pie, went to get my drink.

Number Two: Do some good with it.Matt stashes the cash in creative spots across the cities, including in bicycle wheels and on roadworks signs.He tries to place them in spots close to charity shops as a nudge to people who pick them up.In one instance he hid an envelope outside a childrens hospital under a bench.Matt told the Huffington Post: “[A man who works in the hospital] saw the envelope, went back in to the workplace, told them the story and they all started chipping in tenners.“He got to £ and he thought: what can we do for the kids They turned it into  Easter eggs and he went back dressed as a bunny and delivered all the eggs to the kids in the hospital.”He added: “I love that domino effect that you can create.“I think my favourite one that’s come out of it, there was this guy in Bristol and he didn’t find any of the tenners but he heard about it and wanted to do his own.“He brought this homeless guy into his house, listened to his story, gave him a cup of tea and on the way out gave him a couple of tenners, wished him well, and then the guy got back in touch with him a few weeks after that and said that he’d now got his benefits sorted, a job sorted and a house sorted.“And it was all because this guy Ben had given him his time and made him feel valued. That was just a lovely outcome.”Matt also teamed up with a local troop of Brownies to deliver thank you cards to doctors and nurses at a local hospital.He said: “And apparently all of these doctors and nurses ended up bursting into tears because it was just such a kind thing for these young girls to do for them.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000440969689.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"ftse 100 share price drop amazon google plunge","story":"And the pound looks likely to be on course for its worst week since February, say reports.Markets across the world are heading for their longest losing streak in five years, warned .Meanwhile, thesaid that the FTSE  briefly dipped to its lowest level in two years after the “stocks recovery was derailed by tech titans Google and Amazon, reigniting fears of deteriorating corporate earnings.It added that the pound’s drop to a two-month low “is helping the FTSE  escape the worst of the tech turmoil gripping markets.“Sterling is on course for its worse week since February as the impasse in Brexit talks drains the city’s confidence in the currency.”The pound fell . per cent against the dollar this week to ., “helping the FTSE  pull back to a pc loss,” the paper explained.Reuters reported that US stocks opened lower on Friday, as “disappointing earnings from Amazon and [Google parent company] Alphabet rekindled a rush to dump technology and high-growth stocks.“But losses were limited by data that showed economic growth slowed less than expected last quarter.CNBC reported that US stocks “fell sharply” following disappointing quarterly results from prominent tech firms, despite strong economy data.The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped  points at the open, with the DowDuPont lagging, it added.Amazon and Google-parent company Alphabet fell . per cent and . per cent respectively after they published their latest quarterly results.King Lip, chief strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management, told CNBC: “The earnings are not coming in as great as people had suspected.

That means theres one worry over with - but nothing has cha-cha-changed where. Talks with the EU are still in deadlock. The Prime Minister reportedly cancelled a meeting with ministers yesterday as plans werent ready, and there are warnings it will all cost Britain billions of pounds. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable - who appeared on a Strictly Christmas special in  - had claimed immigration restrictions could deprive the show of talented foreign professional dancers.Sir Vince warned that a “cack-handed” immigration policy could prevent dancers from European Union states appearing on the show after Brexit .But he was mocked and the Prime Minister’s deputy official spokeswoman said: “I think Strictly will be fine.”  During a visit to Brussels on Thursday for talks with EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, Sir Vince said: “As British society falls apart it could pose a risk to Strictly.” Sir Vince, a keen ballroom dancer, said: “If we have a cack-handed immigration policy like what we have for non-EU citizens, all kinds of perverse decisions could be made.”It came as Sadiq Khan today urged Brussels to begin preparations to delay Brexit.The Mayor of London said this would allow time for a second referendum on membership or a change of government to negotiate a “good deal”.The Labour mayor held talks with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels, saying he wanted to avert a “political and economic crisis”. Mr Khan’s visit was the latest by a politician to Brussels for talks with the EU as the two sides seek a workable Brexit Withdrawal Agreement. Britain is currently due to leave the EU next March. It means there is just five months left to complete a workable Withdrawal Agreement and have it ratied by national parliaments. And talks are still deadlocked over the thorny issue of the Northern Irish border. An EU summit fell through with no deal last week, with another summit with  leaders not scheduled until mid-December. To break the deadlock, Mrs May offered to either extend Britains transition period beyond December  - or accept a backstop plan with no end date that would keep EU customs rules across the UK.  Both plans enrage Brexiteers. More than  Tory MPs have demanded Mrs May drop key aspects of her plan. And today Sir William Cash, chairman of the Commons European Scrutiny, warned Mrs May extending the transition period could add billions of pounds to the poundbillion Brexit orce bill. After talks that lasted an hour in Brussels, Mr Khan said that Mr Barnier had been “willing to listen” to concerns about the negotiations. The mayor said: “I made the point that a bad Brexit deal, or even worse no deal whatsoever, it’s bad for London, it’s bad for our country but it is bad for the EU as well.

The six-in-one benefit is meant to make welfare easier and fairer, but its been bundled up with cuts that MPs warn cause unacceptable hardship.The Department for Work and Pensionshas been blasted for being in denial about the problems by Parliaments public spending watchdog. Meanwhile Christmas is fast approaching - and thousands of families face the risk of a financial gap over the holiday season. Thats because there is a standard five-week wait for your first payment when you start claiming Universal Credit.  Soyou start claiming at the end of November or midway through December, you are unlikely to get your first payment until the New Year. And to make matters worse, UC is being introduced in more than  Jobcentres in a final two-month rush before the end of the year. Redcar and Clevelands council leader Sue Jeffrey has claimed up to  families moving to Universal Credit face Christmas without money in her area alone. She told the Teesside Gazette: They will also not have access to the services who might be able to support them.  “This council, for example closes down over Christmas, and there are range of other organisations that will do the same.” But there is a way to avoid being high and dry, and not everyone is affected. So how do you knowyoure hit, and what action should you take  Heres a guide. What is Universal Credit   One system to replace six benefits: Child Tax Credit, Working Tax Credit, Jobseekers Allowance, Income Support, Employment Support Allowance and Housing Benefit. Tory minister Iain Duncan Smith launched it in  to make work pay, by ensuring your benefits taper away slowly as you earn more salary, rather than vanishing in one go. Am I being moved on to Universal Credit   If you are on one of the above benefits, then yes. But this article only deals with people who are being moved onto Universal Credit at the moment. Universal Credit is rolling out in two phases, and its important to know which one youre in. The first phase is already happening now - the second phase isnt. The first phase - people who ARE affected New claimants and existing claimants whose circumstances change are being put on the benefit right now. This process started in one area at a time, with each Jobcentre having its own launch date. The first Jobcentre launched UC in November . Now its in almost every Jobcentre, and the final  will launch it in November and December . That means that by this Christmas, anyone who makes a new claim anywhere in Britain will be put on Universal Credit. There were already .million people in this position by September . By May  it will be million, and by December  itll be million. The second phase - people who ARENT affected Up to million existing claimants will move onto UC later through a process called managed migration. They are not affected by the issue in this article. Unlike in the first phase, they will be able to access a poundbillion transition fund to ensure their benefit payments dont suddenly drop. They will also mostly not start moving over until summer .Only , people are being moved over in the first year from July  after Tory ministers slowed the process down. But beware - evenyoure an existing claimant, you could still be moved earlierthe DWP decides youve had a change of circumstances. So why the focus on Christmas   Campaigners fears are greatest when Universal Credit is new to an area. It means Jobcentre staff are dealing with their first cases under the new benefit, which its claimed could lead to teething problems and delays. So while anyone who claims from late November faces a wait over Christmas, its those in new Universal Credit areas who are being highlighted. There will be  Jobcentres launching Universal Credit in November and December. We have listed those areas in full at the bottom of this article. How do I ensure Im not left high and dry   Its important to know the DWP has a system to ensure your money is not cut off. Its called an advance payment. As soon as you make a claim for Universal Credit, you can apply for % of your first months payment. You apply through your online account or Jobcentre work coach, and it should arrive within five days. If you need help applying, call  . But theres a huge drawback - you have to pay the advance back out of your future benefits. The repayments can be spread over  months and there is no interest. Elsewhere, housing benefit will also keep being paid for the first two weeks of a Universal Credit claim, to help bridge the gap. The Mirror are demanding a halt to the expansion of Universal Credit and for a review to take place. We say there are three options:Redesign UC to be fit for purpose Axe it in favour of the old systemUC is unfixable Introduce a brand new systemSign our petition to stop the rollout of Universal Credit across Britain and to replace it with a fairer system by signing our petition.

David Ferguson, from Bangor in Northern Ireland, was flying back to Belfast with his dog Jamie following a trip to southern Portugal. The pair were scheduled to take the .pm easyJet flight from Faro to Belfast City Airport on theirjourney home when they encountered problems. After boarding the aircraft, David says a flight attendant demanded he attach a seatbelt extender to his dog Jamie - something which David deemed unsafe as it was made for humans and not for dogs. The retired -year-old refused to use the extender because he feared for Jamies safety in the event of a crash.  David and Jamie have previously boarded flights to Gatwick and Spain without issue using a cushioned harness he provides for plane journeys. The safety harness is approved for use on airplanes by the Civil Aviation Authority, David says. David suffers from Usher syndrome, a disorder that causes loss of both hearing and vision, and says he struggled to understand the companys staff.The flight was held up for  minutes while he negotiated with crew - but was eventually booted off the plane. At one stage, a pilot for the airline intervened in the dispute but found nothing wrong with seat belt extender. I was humiliated in front of the people on that aircraft, he said. Ive been with my dog  hours a day since I got him six years ago and as blind people were told to always know where our dogs are at all times.  Theres no way I would put him in danger or allow anyone to put him in danger. The airline effectively left a blind person stranded in the airport with almost no way of getting home. David originally booked his holiday with Thomas Cook and says he was surprised when he discovered that he would be flying with easyJet. After being kicked off the plane, David was left with no alternative but to fork out €for a Ryanair flight back to Dublin. Once there, had to endure a two-hour bus trip to Belfast from the Irish capital. David arrived home at .am thanks to help from his good friend Kenny Tosh who drove him back from the airport. He says his quality of le has improved dramatically since he was given the eight-year-old Labrador back in . He has literally changed my le, David said.  Before I had Jamie I was afraid to leave the house on my own unless someone picked me up. At one stage I walked into a lamppost and I was nearly knocked over. David has demanded airline staff be better informed about the challenges faced by blind people when travelling on their aircraft. If this is how they treat blind people Id be amazed to see how they treat able-bodied persons, he said. An easyJet statement toread: Unfortunately Mr Ferguson and his guide dog were not permitted to travel from Faro to Belfast on September  as he failed to comply with on-board safety regulations surrounding the securing of his dog for take off and landing. “Our policy makes it clear that dogs must wear a standard identying jacket or harness which is provided by the owner, which must be attached to the owners seat belt via the use of an extension seat belt in order to provide an effective level of restraint. “The safety and wellbeing of passengers and crew is always easyJets highest priority.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle curtsy queen tonga","story":"NewsMeghan Markle curtsies to Queen of Tonga as she and Harry bid farewell before ing to SydneyThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex visited the Royal Palace for an audience with King Tupou VI and his we Queen Nanasipau’uShareCommentsByRussell MyersAnn GripperExecutive EditorNatalie Evans:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video meghan-opts-bold-blue-dress-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,video.header.bidding.enabled:true,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,video.header.bidding.enabled:true,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailShes the actress who became a princess, but Meghan Markle still knows how to show respect to royalty. The Duchess of Sussex politely curtsied as she greeted the Queen of Tonga following a whistle-stop stay on the island. Before heading back to Sydney for the Invictus Games, Harry and Meghan were driven to the Royal Palace for an audience with King Tupou VI and his we Queen Nanasipau’u. The couple entered the wooden, whitewashed palace and spent around  minutes inside with the royals.  The Duke and Duchess signed a visitor’s book before they left and then posed outside with the king and queen for photographers. They also shook hands with the Tongan ruler and his we, Meghan, noticeably curtsying to the Queen. Meghan injected a splash of colour into Friday afternoons royal engagements with a bold blue dress. She had a quick outfit change, ditching her earlier striped frock for a pound shirt dress by American designer brand Veronica Beard.  The royal couple visited Tupou College, where they dedicated two forest reserves to the Queens Commonwealth Canopy. The QCC is a project which sees countries of the Commonwealth designate areas of indigenous forest to be preserved in perpetuity, with  of the  member countries already taking part.  Speaking at Tupou College, the duke said: Tonga is leading by example and understands deeply the impact of environmental changes because they directly affect these islands. Planting trees and conserving forests helps us in so many ways. It is a simple but effective way to restore and repair our environment, clean the air, protect habitat and enhance our health and wellbeing.  We are so very grateful to you for this contribution of the Toloa Forest Reserve and the Eua National Park Forest Reserve. During a ceremony which featured hymns, with Harry appearing to sing along to Guide Me O Thou Great Redeemer, the duke and duchess smiled at each other. Harry was then taken on a tour of the forest while the schools band and pupils continued to sing.  Earlier on Friday, Meghan wore a Martin Grant dress with a large bow covering her baby bump as she joined Prince Harry to meet the Tongan Prime Minister. The couple were met by more than  civil servants wearing red and black shirts and traditional outfits, as they entered the St George Government Buildings for a meeting with PM ʻAkilisi Pohiva and his cabinet. One child held a sign saying free hugs which Meghan spotted and smiled. The couple then took the lt to meet the Prime Minister, who was at last nights black tie banquet with the Tongan royal family and the Sussexes, with Harry asking Did you enjoy last night  The entertainment was very good. The remainder of the meeting was held in private.  Meghans pound, cotton dress is from the SS  Resort Collection. It is described as having a button-down silhouette, mandarin collar, circle skirt and belted accent at the waist. Meghan has previously worn a trench coat from the collection during this tour. The couple later had floral garlands placed round their necks as they arrived for a noisy celebration of Tongan youth and culture. Harry and Meghan joined Princess Angelika and Prince Ata, Kings Tupou VIs son and daughter, at the Faonelua Centre, showing products such as traditional mats and tapa cloth, carvings, bracelets made from whale bone and wood. Inside, they sat on two throne-like chairs in the centre of the room, while Princess Angelika delivered a short address and called the couple an inspiration to the youth of the Commonwealth for shining a light on youth empowerment.  She said: Your visit today draws attention to the fundamentals of todays youth, youth leadership, youth empowerment and addressing the social, economic and environmental challenges of our region. Your visits inspires and has been an inspiration for the youth of Tonga to be the best they can be. You are a beacon of hope to us all. Outside, the couple were given a Taovalawhich signies Tongan respect to the higher ranks. They met local Tongan traders and craftsmen as the Masani group of singers and dancers performed island music and songs. Harry appeared to do a little jig as the music started. The Sussexes will also visit the oldest secondary school in the Pacic where two forest reserves will be dedicated to the Queens Commonwealth Canopy Project.  They will then fly to Sydney from Fuaamotu airport in the afternoon. And they are straight back into engagements in Australia as they attend the Australian Geographic Society Awards at the Shangri-La Hotel in the evening. At last nights banquet with King Tupou VI and Queen Nanasipau’u Nuku’alofa, Harry said he felt ashe was visiting an extended family and delivered a message from the Queen. Her message was: Your Majesties, it gives me great pleasure that my grandson and his we are visiting The Kingdom of Tonga. Our two families have enjoyed a deep and warm friendship over many years, and I hope that our close relationship continues with the next generation. To this day, I remember with fondness Queen Salotes attendance at my own Coronation, while Prince Philip and I have cherished memories from our three wonderful visits to your country in ,  and . In the months and years ahead, I wish Your Majesties and the people of Tonga every good fortune and happiness.  The duke had high praise for Tongas talents in many dferent fields. He said: Tongan soldiers served with our allies during the First and Second World Wars and later independently to offer support in Iraq and Afghanistan. Tongan hospitality is world renowned your islands are stunningly beautul offering tourists rugged coastlines, humpback whales and coral reefs. Tongas sporting prowess is legendary you are formidable on the rugby pitch , and you were the first Pacic island nation to win a medal at the Olympics! Is there no end to your talents  Tongan artists such as Uili Lousi are winning international awards and your magnicent artefacts were a highlight at the recent Oceania exhibition in London, which my we enjoyed very much when she opened it. For a small population you have a very large presence on the world stage - a product of your talent and drive. We are both so looking forward to meeting many of you tomorrow- learning more about your culture and development as a strong and independent country.

The Duchess tiara will also be on show, and she has revealed the story of how she chose the stunning headpiece, the Queen Mary Diamond Bandeau.  Meghan and Harry recorded a chat for the multimedia guide, which visitors can listen to as they walk around the exhibition. In it, she describes how she went to Buckingham Palace with Harry - who admits he shouldnt really have been there - to meet the Queen and try on lots of tiaras. It sounds like the dream of any young girl wishing she were a princess.  She says: When it came to the tiara on the day, I was very fortunate to be able to choose this gorgeous art deco style bandeau tiara. Harry and I had gone to Buckingham Palace to meet with Her Majesty The Queen to select one of the options that were there, which was an incredibly surreal day as you can imagine. And that [tiara] was one that, I think, as we tried them on, stood out...  I think it was just perfect because it was so clean and simple, and I think also, to that point, an extension of what Clare [Waight Keller] and I had been trying to do with the dress which was have something that could be so incredibly timeless but still feel modern... Harry responds: Every girls dream to be able to try on a tiara and, funnily enough, the one that suited the best, the one that looked best on you without question.

Meghan Markles wedding dress and a replica of Prince Harrys unorm go on display at their wedding venue today, and will remain there for the public to view until January  before being moved to Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh. Speaking on a multimedia guide given to visitors on their tour of the castle, Meghan and Harry spoke for the very first time about how they chose music, flowers and even the brides tiara. Meghan revealed a lovely little gesture Harry made on the morning of their wedding which added a very personal touch to their nuptials. The bouquet was comprised of flowers that we really love, she said.  But they didnt just really on an expensive florist to provide the arrangements. Harry got involved, too, with a romantic gesture. We have a very small garden here that we had been planting things in the Fall for and what was really special, I think, was that the morning of the wedding Harry went in and he picked some flowers to go into my bouquet, which was really beautul and something that makes it sentimental and really meaningful. Harry adds: We didn’t have as many flowers in our little garden as we had hoped for because I think it snowed at Easter!The Duchess laughs and says: Thats true!Harry then confirmed that the bouquet included a tribute to his late mother, Princess Diana.  He continues: That kind of ruined the whole thing! But, they’re very much a bouquet of wild flower, wild flower meadows and making sure that we had forget-me-nots in as it was one of my mother’s favourite flowers. The great thing is that the day after the bouquet ended up at Westminster Abbey on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier as, again, very traditional rather than throwing it over your head, I think it was the perfect place for it to be laid at rest.  Meghan and Harry married in a fairytale wedding in St Georges Chapel, Windsor Castle, on May . On display at the exhibition are Meghans dress, designed by Clare Waight Keller for Givenchy, and her veil - which included  embroidered flowers representing countries of the Commonwealth.

At  years of age and not five feet tall, she’s the closest thing you’ll find to a real-le superhero. She works for a charity called TRAC out of a small shop in Trevethin, Gwent. Trevethin has it harder than most, but it’s not unlike far too many other communities across the country that would recognise what’s happening there. Council budgets slashed, public services decimated, foodbanks, mental health issues, domestic violence, the effects of Universal Credit. “I don’t want to swear”, says Sue, “but, you know, we’re saving lives here because others have given up on the people that get referred to us.”  With a small team of staff and committed volunteers, Sue makes sure the basics are there for people who need them – furniture, clothing, food, fuel, white goods. Some of them are reclaimed from landfill, others are donations from all over the area. Care agencies refer people who need help to TRAC, and within hours provisions are on their way. Sue delivers them herself, her head just visible above her van’s steering wheel. “We’re trying to prevent them from going to doorstep lenders and shycompanies like BrightHouse,” she says. “I’m paying out on the van now and it’s not going to last much longer.” With so many services in the area being cut back – mental health services, hostels, council support and welfare – the need for Sue’s help is only increasing.

Amanda Smith used to run a company inspecting buildings before she became a sex toy designer for a British firm. Her business meetings now usually involve penetrating discussions about sex, fetishes and fantasies. The -year-old says the saucy job suits her far better and shes become a sexologist to her friends thanks to her fantastic role in a highly-competitive market. This week, Sainsburys has announced it is going to start selling vibrators prices from just pound alongside groceries.  Amanda, of Royston, Herts, said: Basically, I sell orgasms for a living and, in business meetings, the topic of conversation can go anywhere - we discuss every fetish and fantasy. “I was talking to an accountant two weeks ago and had to explain to him how a willy ring worked while discussing budgets. Just another ordinary day.” As head of buying at Essex firm Bondara - an online adult sex shop - Amanda is responsible for everything from organizing testing  to designing the saucy toys. She said: “Designing a sex toy is like going back to a biology lesson, I have to think about dferent nerves, dferent areas, and ways to stimulate them - this helps determine a lot about a toy.  “Once I get the basic biology side of things sorted, that’s when I start to put fun add-ons onto the toys, like vibrations and rotations and dferent textures to create new sensations. “I have to cater to a huge market. Dferent interests, fantasies and fetishes are always on my mind. I focus on the G spots, C spots and P spots - a lot of spots to think about.” Amanda, whose daughter Kayla is  years old, swapped the nine-to-five - running a company inspecting buildings - for her current role in . She had previously worked as senior buyer for sex toys and lingerie firm Ann Summers. She said: I left this kind of business for a while, as, a single mum, it gave me flexibility to look after my daughter, who thinks its great that her mum works so independently. But, working in property, I spent too much time alone and Im a gregarious person. This suits me far better.  Amanda said shes never looked back and her friends love her new role. She laughed: They envy me having such a fantastic job. I am their sexologist and relationship expert in the psychology of sex and intimacy. As for meeting new people, when they find out what I do, theres often an immediate outburst of excitement, followed by a download of their sexual experiences and questions about their curiosities. Meanwhile, her partner of two years, Tony, a -year-old luxury car firm director, is unfazed by her saucy line of work. She said: Hes interested in who I am, not what I do. But men Ive dated before him have assumed I was promiscuous and have overstepped the mark very quickly.  One ex even introduced me, saying, This is my girlfriend and she works as a buyer for Ann Summers. After that, people were more interested in my job than getting to know me for who I am. Amanda says nothing related to sex shocks her anymore, given her line of work. She added: “I have so much exposure to the sex industry that there isn’t much I haven’t seen. The world of online porn has meant there isn’t a corner or crevasse which I haven’t seen for my research. “Some things have made me more curious about what people want but, so far, nothing has taken me by surprise - other than bondage, which can be a bit out there.  When the  Shades of Grey trilogy hit screens we saw an overnight boom in demand for sex toys. “After viewers saw the scene which features the spreader bar - a piece of bondage equipment - the toy completely sold out. There was a  Shades effect across the whole market place, from MS to the likes of us.” But designing sex toys is not all about thrills - as it can be deeply demanding in a highly competitive market. She said: “Our toys need to be able to give people a climax and thats a lot to ask. We also have to try and spot the next new thrill I try to see the new popular toy design before the customer knows they even want it. “For example, suction toys for ladies are the new thrill - they feature suction and vibration, working together. This new technology could come out later this year - and I hope it will be the next step for women’s toys.” Selling orgasms comes with the additional perk of creating true happiness for some couples, according to Amanda.  She explained: “It’s great, I’ve been able to help couples restore relationships with the use of sex toys. Although my job is all about making sure customers have sexual pleasure, it’s also about helping people mentally, by making them feel happier, too. “I’ve had reviews from customers saying they hadn’t had sex in  years, but one of my toys helped them break through. When I go home after reading comments like that I think, ‘I’ve done my job well today’.” And, like any true professional, Amanda happily practices what she preaches. She said: I enjoy a ied and dynamic sex live with my partner and am never too shy to push a boundary … it makes le exciting, doesn’t harm anyone and certainly increases the bond between us. And yes, I try the products myself. I love trying new toys and have favourites for dferent moods or occasions - whether its for solo play or with my partner. AndIm confident about the product we sell, then it’s a win win situation. Le is short and people should embrace their sexuality. Toys will not hurt or harm, but will bring pleasure and fun. Why have plain, boring old vanilla ice cream, when you could add some exciting sprinkles and turn it into a delicious experience youre unlikely to forget.

Iraq got bombed back to the Stone Age. North Korea was invited to tea. Into the void where the Axis of Evil once terried the world, a new existential threat to civilisation has been born. And it has a spire  metres tall. Unbeknown to the , tourists who visit it each year, it seems that Salisbury Cathedral is built on an inter-dimensional whirlpool which sucks evil down towards hell like sand in an hour-glass. The presence of these unwitting pilgrims, walking widdershins around the cloisters, merely speeds up the spiritual centruge.Hence the bemusement of Russian spies who, on an entirely-heterosexual visit under  names to the East End of London, found themselves dragged towards the bewitching building. They broke free of its unearthly tractor beam only when they dropped a bottle of perfume that Ruslan had bought as a gt for his mother, and was unfortunately past its sell-by date.Caught in the Salisbury swirl, the liquid mutated into a battlefield nerve agent with unforeseen deadly consequences when it was dropped on the doorstep of a building that happened to be home to a Russian defector. They didnt get to see the spire. Which is a shame, because theyd heard it was the tallest in Britain.  The vortex is felt across the world. It drew a team of  assassins from Riyadh to Istanbul, where CCTV was disabled when an unfortunate journalist tripped and fell over a discarded bone saw, several times, and then cut off his own face and thew it down a well. It also compelled his accidental murderers to flee before the Turkish authorities could persuade them to headbutt a bullet, develop a sexual attraction to mincers, or perhaps most suicidally of all, announce they were taking up careers as journalists.The evil eddy even forced an otherwise-gentle and liberal soul entirely in tune with st century social norms to scream UGLY BLACK B******! at a Windrush migrant.The more cynical corners of the internet have whispered that Ryanair flights are the twisted children of Salisburys malevolent maelstrom, producing miniaturised tides of despair and misery, but the companys official ouija board insists in the face of all the evidence that it is just a coincidence.  Now it appears Salisburys undertow to the underworld has drawn someone all the way into the cathedral itself, there to smash two holes in the specially-toughened glass box in which lies one of only  remaining original copies of the Magna Carta.At time of writing no-one has been charged in relation to the Get Carta incident, but there are three madcap theories of who could be responsible:. A grammarist insistent on adding the definite article to the documents customary description, becausethe is written on the bloody thing people cant not use it . The ruler of a nation in political crisis who wants to add a th clause stating Brexit means Brexit on the basisthey didnt know what it meant in the th century she cannot be blamed for making it up as she goes along in the st . Nicholas Cage on one of his many flights of fancy, trying to crack a hidden medieval code that links the Founding Fathers to Jesus secret lovechild, whose ultimate descendant turns out to be Indiana Jones dad.  Of course, thats all ridiculous, isnt it  As mad as finding someone in Old Sarum wants planning permission for an underground shark tank, or that Kim Jong Un has moved his embassy to Middle Wallop. Or genuinely thinking that because both Porton Down and a village called Palestine are in the vicinity, Salisbury must be on speed-dial to the Devil himself. There are no forces of evil. Salisbury is no more be a wormhole to the netherworld than it is a coral atoll in the South Pacic. Whoever tried to steal the Magna Carta was too dumb to realise it was alarmed, it would disentegrate within  minutes and would be harder to sell on than Philip Greens used undercrackers. Evil is a supernatural force which means some people are born beyond redemption - destined for corruption and amorality, and liablecaught to be crucied, electried, poisoned or shot because theyre something other than human. But evil is just an excuse.Humans are merely bad. They make bad decisions and do bad things, making bad excuses along the way. Vladimir Putin ordered the elaborately-dficult murder of Sergei Skripal because he thought the defector was evil, and evil deserves the effort. The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia ordered the elaborately-messy murder of Jamal Kashoggi for the same reason. And people like the Ryanair racist arent evil, either. Theyre angry, ignorant, unsocialised outcasts, often sick and usually screaming at the world for not being nicer to them. When we say something is evil we refuse to take responsibility. We say it was out of our hands when the Twin Towers fell or the policeman was kned or the terrorists got through. We dont say: How did we make that terrorist  Why dont we spend money on people who do bad stuff  What has to change before we accept that guy other there goes to the toilet just like I do Whoever tried to steal the Magna Carta, whoever is sending bombs to Donald Trumps enemies, whoever strokes Tommy Robinsons cancerous ego is not evil.

The cold snap will bring an end to the largely mild start to autumn, with people advised to dig out their warm winter clothes over the weekend. A yellow warning for snow and ice is in place for northern Scotland from pm on Friday, while another for ice takes effect in Northern Ireland from am on Saturday. Even in southern parts, where temperatures are forecast to be around C , the wind chill factor means it will feel several degrees cooler, forecasters said.  Forecasters warned of patchy ice and slush affecting some upland routes as well as rail and road disruption. Snow may dust the tops of hills in the Pennines in northern England, Snowdonia in north-west Wales, the North York Moors, and across the Scottish Highlands. Met Office meteorologist Aidan McGivern said: Snow building up over the higher routes, some icy patches for the north of Scotland as well as Northern Ireland to watch out for first thing Saturday.  It will be a fairly chilly start, with temperatures widely close to freezing and that means youll perhaps have to scrape your car windscreen and youll see a frost in place first thing. Eastern parts are likely to see hail, showers and strong winds throughout Saturday, with the odd chance of a thunderstorm. Gritters are on standby across the country, with a number of councils posting pictures of their fleets online. Motorists have been warned to take extra care on the roads and anticipate widespread frost as thermometers drop to - Celcius overnight in higher parts.  Met Office forecaster Bonnie Diamond added: We have had a pretty mild October so far and a warm start to autumn in places so it will be a big change for everybody as we go through the weekend. Certainly its time to get the warm winter clothes out.

Pearl, aged  months, died after the brick wall hit by the Range Rover collapsed on top of her as she walked to the park with her father and baby brother. Lorry driver Andrew Williams, , had been driving his Range Rover before leaving it on a steep driveway. But an inquest yesterday heard Mr Williams did not fully apply handbrake - and the automatic vehicle was not left in park.  Pearls devastated parents Paul and Gemma Black spoke out after coroner Andrew Barkley ruled Pearls death was accidental. Paul, , said that due to a legal loophole in the law Mr Williams could not be prosecuted. But a CPS spokesman has now stated that the decision not to charge Mr Williams came following a thorough review.  The spokesman said: The CPS carried out a thorough review of the evidence and concluded the case failed to meet the evidential test for prosecution. We have explained the reasons behind this decision to Pearls family and our thoughts remain with them. After the inquest Mr Black said he would walk to London to get a bill passed to change the law. He said: The vehicle was mechanically sound. It would not have movedit had been properly secured. Yet a simple loophole of law – that it started its descent on private rather than public land – has stopped us getting justice for our daughter. We shouldn’t be here at the coroner’s court today. We should have been given the justice we deserve at criminal court instead, the law as it stands has prevented any repercussions for what was not a fluke accident and could have been completely avoided had the handbrake been fully applied and the automatic transmission correctly placed in park. This is why we are now calling on the Government to change the law so that no other family has to suffer as we have.  The inquest, in Pontypridd, heard Pearl was with her singer father Paul and her eight-month-old brother Acer when the tragedy happened in August . Mr Black screamed: Shes gone. The wall has crushed her, after the Range Rover ploughed into it in Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales. Tests were carried out on the .-tonne Range Rover after it was recovered from the scene. Investigators found the handbrake of the x had been only been applied two notches - out of a possible six.  The gear lever was between park and reverse. Coroner Andrew Barkley gave a conclusion of accidental death. He said: “Mr Williams said he assumed the gear lever was in park. As far as the application of the brake is concerned, he did not count the number of clicks. Sadly, as we know, that was insufficient. It seems the issue here was very much driver operation.” "},{"url":null,"title":"you could paid 250 eat","story":"NewsYou could get paid £ to eat Yorkshire puddings - heres howA pub is looking for a Yorkshire pudding expert to help them perfect their Sunday roastShareCommentsByRobyn DarbyshireAudience Writer:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsDo you love Yorkshire puds  Read on...\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailYorkshire puddings are arguably the best bit of a roast dinner, but mastering them is a fine art.

Mexico-based Thomas Markle, , is said to be desperate to reconcile with Meghan, , before she gives birth so that he can visit his grandchild. Royal sources claim he has spoken of his “rights” and how the tot will be part of his family too, having “Markle blood” as well as “blue blood”. Thomas has made more approaches to Kensington Palace and even appealed to Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, who married Prince Harry and Meghan, for help. And sources say his anger at being cut out of his daughter’s le is such that he may even hire a legal team to force visits through the courts.  A source said: “The palace is acutely aware of what problems could lie ahead with Thomas. He strongly believes the baby should be as much a part of his le as they will be Prince Charles’s. “Thomas says the Markle blood will be as much in the child’s veins as the ‘blue blood’ of the royals and he has ‘rights’. He admits mistakes but with Meghan pregnant, he is desperate to heal the rt. Thomas has reached out to Kensington Palace more so since news of Meghan’s pregnancy broke, hoping the baby will be what finally breaks their estrangement.” He has offered to fly to the UKhe can sit down with Meghan and Harry, , when theyfrom their royal tour of Australia. His push comes as Meghan’s mother, Doria Ragland, may be poised to move from Los Angeles to be nearer during the pregnancy. Thomas learned Meghan was expecting when he heard it on his car radio.  He said: “The first thing I thought about was holding Meghan as a newborn. I thought, ‘My baby is having a baby’. A baby is a blessing and I look forward to seeing a little Meghan or a little Harry.” Friends of the retired film lighting technician claim he would even like the baby to be called ThomasMeghan has a boy. His only son is also called Thomas.  Meghan has not spoken to her dad since her wedding in May. Thomas failed to attend after being declared too unwell to travel following heart palpitations.

Body modication fanatic Paulina Casillas Landeros, from Jalisco, Mexico, underwent numerous surgeries such as a back corset - which involves piercings on either side of the spine - and a split tongue. She later decided to remove her belly button as it is what makes us human before giving it as a present to her then boyfriend Daniel Ramirez, in . But following the removal three years ago, she says she ultimately regrets her decision describing it as reckless and impulsive.  The HR intern and tourism student said: I have always had problems with my family, I was not very close to them at the time. Body modications fascinated me, there is something very transcending about them. I was very angry, I wanted to cut all unions from everything and everyone. I wanted to dehumanise myself in a symbolic way, I wanted to do something controversial. I underwent an operation done by a professional but he gave me very bad advice on how to take care of the trauma so it got infected. I was suffering, I spent days in bed asI were quarantined, I couldn’t stretch, push, stand up or laugh. It gradually healed itself but not  per cent - it will never close entirely.  Paulina said she knew she wanted to give the body part to Daniel as an ultimate token of love. She said: I was very much in love with my then boyfriend, he supported me through many dficult times, and he is one of the most influential people in my le. It was something I did in the spur of the moment, we were young and stupid but that’s the way I felt. I put it in a small bag along with a note saying I love you, it was very emotional. He has kept it and he will keep it forever because he knows the meaning behind it. We are good friends now but we will always love each other.  Paulina says her relationship with her family has now improved. I do regret it when I put myself in my mum’s position, it must have been devastating for her, she was so sad, she said. I can’t imagine how it must feel, your own child wanting to break all their connection to you. If I could go back in time, I wouldn’t do it again, it was impulsive, reckless and I hurt a lot of people. Even though I did it for the wrong reasons, it has now taught me I should think things through before acting and it’s a nice reminder that characterises me.

The Duchess stunned guests as she arrived at the ball in a pound, monochrome Oscar de la Renta dress - described as a white tulle gown with black bonded looped ribbon tweed laser cut birds . The annual gathering, which was hosted at the Grand Ballroom at the Shangri-La Hotel, recognises feats of excellence in adventure, science and conservation. The royals presented awards to young people who have made considerable contributions to the field and both gave an address to attendees. The Queen was given a special environmental award by the Society for the Queen’s Commonwealth Canopy, a worldwide campaign to boost forest conservation. Harry accepted the award on her behalf and paid a touching tribute to his father, the Prince of Wales.  He said: There was a time, when as human beings we thought the world belonged to us. Now we are beginning to realise that we actually belong to the world. We are responsible to it, and to each other. My father and others have been speaking about the environment for decades - not basing it on fallacy or new-age hypothesis, but rooted in science and facts, and the sobering awareness of our environmental vulnerability.And while those speeches would sometimes fall on deaf ears, he and others were unrelenting in their commitment to preserve the most valuable resource we have – our planet, he said. Harry and Meghan were involved in a mid-air scare earlier today when their Qantas plane was forced to abort a landing as it approached Sydney Airport.  Harry, , and pregnant Meghan, , were pictured smiling as they walked off the plane and left in a car after flying to Sydney from Tonga. Captain Nigel Rosser described the incident as a “missed approach” over the tannoy because there was another jet on the runway which was too slow to move. The royal couple were in business class and the their royal team and travelling press corps on board too when it was decided to scrap the landing on safety grounds. Captain Rosser of Qantas special charter flight QF from Tonga to Sydney announced, “Unfortunately there was on aircraft that was a little bit close too slow to roll.  “The decision was decided to abort the landing,” he said. Mirror photographer Ian Vogler, who was on the plane said: We were coming down to land, having come in via Sydney Harbour, just seconds off actually hitting the runway, when the pilot had to pull the plane back up and we were rising again. There were a few nervous flyers on board so it must have been concerning for them but it was all handled very well by the pilots on board.  Earlier in the tour, Harry praised the conservation work of Tonga in its efforts to combat deforestation. Speaking at Tupou College, the duke said: “Tonga is leading by example and understands deeply the impact of environmental changes because they directly affect these islands. “Planting trees and conserving forests helps us in so many ways. The Duchess of Sussex skipped a trip to the rainforest for a second time due to the threat of the Zika virus.  Instead, schoolchildren performed a special dance to ward off mosquitoes and keep the mum-to-be safe, to the delight and laughter of the royal couple. Meghan had originally planned to walk through the Tuloa forest on the island of Tonga but Prince Harry went alone as his we is  weeks pregnant with their first child.

More than , people signed the petition.The Tele took those signatures to Indigo’s headquarters in Watford, accompanied by a letter from Tele editor Andrew Kellock, and submitted them to the company.The letter, addressed to the firm’s directors, read: “Although we appreciate that it is your right to review charges on an annual basis, through the terms of the contract you signed some  years ago with NHS Tayside, we believe that adding further cost to what is already an expensive and potentially worrying time for people visiting the hospital, is unacceptable.“Your company records show that you made a profit of more than £ million last year, which is directly attributed to a previous rise in parking fees.“Given these profits, we do not feel that a further rise is justied, at a time when most household budgets continue to be squeezed and people’s ability to pay such charges is diminished.“When we were informed of your plans to raise parking fees, we launched a campaign, backed by a petition, called Freeze the Fees. This is calling for your company to keep parking charges at Ninewells Hospital at existing levels – set in November last year – until at least November next year. A total of , people signed this petition, via our website and through forms we included in recent editions of our paper. I enclose a list of the names we received – some chose to remain anonymous.“We feel this sends a strong message to your company that this proposed rise should not take place.“It is also our understanding that the Scottish Health Secretary, Jeane Freeman, is writing to you to ask for a rethink.“The will of the general public and our country’s top politicians is clear – a rise in parking fees at Ninewells Hospital should not go ahead on November .“We urge you to take these views into consideration and do the right thing by the people the hospital serves – and Freeze the Fees for the coming year.”Ms Freeman’s letter, sent to Indigo managing director Phillip Herring, read: “As you will be aware, the Scottish Government abolished car parking charges at all publicly-owned NHS hospital car parks from December  .“Hospital car parking charges put an unnecessary financial burden on those attending hospital for treatment, their families and hospital staff.“Increases of any size add to this burden and I therefore urge you to reconsider the decision to increase car parking charges at Ninewells Hospital and to commit to freezing parking charges at existing levels, as set in November .”Indigo has refused to answer questions from the Tele on its plans, but claims the fees are governed by its contract with NHS Tayside."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/5bcee1f8093d1-e1540285944998-785x564.jpg ","title":"george cran roles reversed as pressure now on dunfermline and allan johnston as dundee united look to gather momentum","story":"With the first quarter of the season behind them, it’s fair to say it’s been a bumpy ride so far for Dundee United.Often coaches will use this point of the campaign as the first real chance to assess how things are going as they prepare to meet sides for the second time in the league.For the Tangerines, though, a report card right now can’t possibly tell the whole story with Csaba Laszlo not even lasting to this marker in charge of the team.And to judge his replacement Robbie Neilson after just two matches in charge wouldn’t be fair.However, comparing the fortunes of their next opponents Dunfermline since they met on the opening league match of the season makes for interesting reading.That’s because the atmosphere around Allan Johnston’s Pars since they finally overturned a -match winless run against the Tangerines to continue a lightning-fast start to the campaign has flipped almost completely.While the Tangerines struggled and stumbled under Csaba’s reign at the start of the season, Johnston was enjoying seeing his side inflict a - win at Tannadice to make it five wins from five games played after a % record in their Betfred Cup group.That was with an impressive  goals scored and included a deserved - win at Premiership Dundee.Now, though, Johnston faces a new man in the other dugout with intense scrutiny from fans now on him rather than his opposite number.After their perfect start to the campaign, it took Dunfermline another five matches to register a second victory in the Championship and have only racked up eight points from eight matches since.In the process they only managed six goals, conceding  and being dumped out of both the League Cup and Irn-Bru Cup on penalty shoot-outs.Going into Saturday’s game at East End Park, the Pars sit adrt of the play-off places, four points behind United in fourth place.Another poor result, after their - home defeat to Queen of the South at the weekend, will leave them well behind in the race for the top four, heaping all the pressure on Johnston and his side.And the contrast with Neilson, his United players and the atmosphere among the support is stark.After kicking off his reign with a - victory at Partick Thistle, the new gaffer led the Tangerines out for the first time at Tannadice at the weekend.Despite not managing to make it two wins from two, drawing - with Inverness CT, the players were boosted by the biggest home crowd of the campaign.The belief that Neilson can repeat the feat of promotion to the Premiership he achieved at Hearts is clear among the United support.Optimism throughout the stands has been almost completely absent over the past couple of seasons but the hope is now with former chairman Stephen Thompson having departed, and Neilson taking the reigns, good times might be on the horizon.And the ideal time to fuel that fire is now with games against sides below them in the table coming up – Dunfermline this weekend and then Queens the week after.With both the sides coming up in indferent form, points are a must to keep the good feeling flowing.Because what Dunfermline did show the last time the teams met, despite what’s happened since, is they can actually beat their bogey side United.What Neilson can’t afford now is to let the early momentum slip away, something that happened with both Ray McKinnon and, more obviously, Csaba Laszlo.Preventing that could well show the fans’ early optimism is justied come the season end."},{"url":null,"title":"jim mcintyre expected to make first dundee signing ahead of celtic clash","story":"Dundee boss Jim McIntyre is swtly set to bolster his options by adding free agent Martin Woods to his squad.The former Ross County midfielder has been without a club since leaving Partick Thistle after their relegation last season and is set to be re-united with his former gaffer.McIntyre signed Woods twice while gaffer in Dingwall, the first a month after taking charge before the -year-old had a spell down south with Shrewsbury before ing north.Woods has been training with the Dark Blues since last week and was present at last night’s -

bring affordable, well designed, high-quality homes to people and families from both within the local area and those wishing toto the region.\"The alliance has stated the properties will be included in a so-called mid-market initiative which is specically targeted at people working in the region, adding rents will be below current private rental levels for similar properties in the area.Melissa Kirby will be a resident at Rainingrsquos Close.\"After living in a modern apartment in London, I am absolutely thrilled to move into a new home that brings modern city living to the Highlands,\" she said. \"It is very central with access to everything from restaurants, shopping and travel right on my doorstep.\"I am really looking forward to meeting my neighbours as well as enjoying the amazing views from my apartment across the city.\"The alliance currently manages  mid-market properties through schemes to help people become home owners and this figure is set to rise with completion of a

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

So many of our players have had really big matches for their clubs in the lead up to the international but they are done now and our total focus is on Ireland this Saturday.#The spine of the squad is from Newtonmore and that should not be any surprise given they have just won the treble.#There are a few Argyll representatives aside from the team captain. Irvine#s Kyles team-mate Roddy MacDonald has also been selected and there are places for Oban Camanachd duo Lorne Dickie and Andrew MacCuish.The Scottish mantra in recent games has been to keep the ball on the ground and to use the wide open spaces to stretch the Irish defence and not allow the hurlers to build up a head of steam with their aerial game.Caberfeidh’s dead-ball expert Kevin Bartlett will again be key and he scored twelve of Scotland’s eighteen points a year ago.There are no rule changes as such this year but there will be an Irish referee, John Keane, which brings its own dimension.Garry Reid added: #The interpretation of the rules will be key. In general, Irish referees tend to let more go and there may be more of a tendency to get away with hands on the back and perhaps more pulling and shoving.#We’ll just need to be careful and concentrate on our game. However there’s no doubt this will make for a fast pace as it will let the game flow and that’s important for the international to remain a spectacle for the supporters.#Scotland squad:Stuart MacDonald Glen MacKintosh The match, which starts at pm, will not be broadcast live this year but the match will be shown in full on BBC ALBA from pm on Saturday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"mum gets ready for a new year dooking","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowShe hates the water and is none too fond of the cold, but one Mid Argyll mother plans to throw herself into the icy sea on New Year#s Day.Joan Williamson is taking part in the traditional Loony Dook at South Queensferry for a cause close to her heart.When her twin daughters Star and Angel were born two months premature at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary after an emergency Caesarean section, mum and babies were in a bad way.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields.

And the busy dad-of-three apparently had no idea that the arrival of the President of the United States was imminent. By the time he’d come out of the shop with his shopping, police were taking no chances and had removed his car from Maybole High Street. And Peter Goudie, , came face to face with officers, including armed police, who were twitchy that his Volkswagen Golf was in the way.  Donald Trump had already touched down at Prestwick in Air Force One and his cavalcade was heading to Maybole, en route to a weekend of golf and talks at Turnberry. And the convoy of the most powerful president on earth wasn’t going to be impeded by a naughty parker. The astonishing tale unfolded at Ayr Justice of the Peace Court last week. Goudie’s lawyer Peter Lockhart just managed to keep his client on the road, and he left with eight penalty points on his driving licence and a pound fine. Goudie, of The Loaning, Maybole, admitted stopping on a zig-zag line at a pelican crossing, having no insurance, taking his we’s car without permission and not having a full licence.  Depute fiscal Ed Sheeran told the Justice on the bench that at around pm on Friday, July  there was a major police operation on-going on the A. He said that it was part of a management plan due to the visit of the president of the United States of America. The court was told that there was a large police presence in Maybole High Street and that they had noticed the grey Golf was stopped on the zig-zags. They found Goudie inside the shop and the offences unfolded.  Mr Lockhart told the court Goudie’s we was out and he had decided to pop down to the Co-op to get some milk. The solictior added: “My client had not noticed the high police presence. “He was alarmed when he was approached by the police in the shop and even more alarmed when he came out and saw more police, including armed police in the vicinity.” Mr Lockhart explained that it had been a costly exercise as the police had removed and impounded his car. He added: “His we was furious when she found out as it cost pound to get the car back the following day. “He was in the dog house for his stupidity.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEd SheeranVolkswagenJusticePrestwickDonald TrumpAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayrshire vets reveal cases sedated","story":"NewsAyrshire vets reveal cases of \"sedated\" and \"drowsy\" dogs on our beachesWidespread reports of dogs falling ill have sparked panic among pet owners in the region.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsAyr beach \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailVets have been inundated with sick dogs on Ayrshires coastline, the Post can reveal.

have led to many people falling into hardship or dropping out of the benefit system altogether.The introduction of the two-child benefit cap, limiting tax credits and Universal Credit to a familys first two children has also been attacked.And the Tory list MSPs attempt to justy the two-child cap this week was met with anger and disbelief.Ms Ballantyne told Holyrood: \"The two-child limit is about fairness.\"It is fair that people on benefit cannot have as many children as they like while people who work and pay their way and dont claim benefits have to make decisions about the number of children they can have.\"Universal Credit may have its flaws, but the thinking behind the system is sound.\"It is about making it better to be in work than not to be in work.\"MSPs were debating

The rampant home side completely outplayed the visitors who looked out of sorts and overwhelmed by the occasion.For those who witnessed the second half, what followed was one of the finest and most unlikely comebacks they will ever experience.Claremont blitzed the unsuspecting Pupils from the outset, scoring in their first attack of the match.Before a breath was drawn, a surging run and cross by Claremont’s tall centre-forward was promptly dispatched into the back of the net at the back post.It was a case of backs to the wall for the visitors who, after a number of close shaves, found themselves two behind midway through the first half.This time the damage was self-inflicted, when an innocuous cross from the left was palmed into the path of the incoming striker who scored with ease from close range.The alarm bells now ringing loudly, with  minutes of the half remaining the visitors somehow conjured a goal against the run of play.A breakout by Ryan Deans ended with a fine pass to set up Sary Rhama, whose pace and parting shot almost took the net away.The home side, however, were unrelenting in their efforts and deservedly restored a two-goal cushion with a goal just before the break.A reading of the riot act at half time appeared to have the desired effect as, after a number of changes, both positional and to personnel, the second period produced a whole new ball game.Leading the line from the front, the introduction of Cameron Wylie was the key to the comeback, his unrelenting efforts to close space soon rewarded as his team responded in kind.A quick interchange of passes between Deans and Grumoli brought its reward, leaving the latter free to curl a wonderful shot into the top corner of the net. The comeback was on.Liam Renton joined the act in the th minute of a strange match after a headed clearance met with a flush volley as a superbly struck shot thundered into the net for the equaliser.There was time aplenty for the Pupils to shoot themselves in the foot again, and Claremont regained the initiative when Fraser Wylie mistimed a clearance to send the ball into his own net.At the opposite end – possibly goal of the match.Astothe gesture, a deep free kick from Renton produced another equaliser, the home defence’s attempted clearance rebounding off a fellow team mate and into the net.So came the final moments of the game, with Cameron Wylie again involved.A crunching challenge on Wylie seemed to be an obvious free kick, but the referee waved play on.Gary Grumoli sent an inch perfect pass to the back post, for Ross Brown to score his first team goal and the Pupils# eventual, but by now, deserved winner.In a clf-hanging finish to a game that had everything, Alastair Ferguson produced a wonderful one-handed save to deflect a perfectly struck free kick to safety.Campbeltown Pupils are at home tomorrow with a pm kick off against second-placed Neilston.See posters and social media for further information.A previous celebration for Gary Grumoli and Liam Renton two stars of Saturday#s match. _cpupils_celebration"},{"url":null,"title":"decision-soon-on-the-quay-plans","story":"Amanda Chisholm, the independent reporter appointed to determine the appeal on behalf of Scottish Ministers, carried out an inspection of the site at Fisherrow Harbour last month.Lodged by Simply Musselburgh Care Limited, the appeal followed East Lothian Councilrsquos refusal of a plan to convert the former leisure complex, restaurant andsuites into a -bed nursing home.Ms Chisholm is now preparing her decision, a copy of which will be sent to all parties involved and published on the Planning and Environmental Appeals Divisionrsquos website.A meeting of the local authorityrsquos planning committee in June regarding The Quay, owned by Dr Charan Gill, ended with a near-unanimous decision to reject the nursing home proposal.Only Councillor Norman Hampshire, planning committee convener, backed council officialsrsquo recommendation to approve the plan.Local groups including Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, Musselburgh Area Partnership, and Musselburgh Conservation Society, among others, are calling for the appeal to be thrown out., Musselburgh Area Partnership, Fisherrow Harbour and Seafront Association, and the Musselburgh Business Partnership are calling for the appeal to be thrown out."},{"url":null,"title":"teachers-time-in-turkey-inspires-her-debut-novel","story":"Set in the Turkish capital Istanbul, Dr Margaret Halliday chose the location for her book as she worked as a teacher in the country for seven years.She decided to take up writing seriously five years ago when she was unable to live the same lestyle because of multiple sclerosis .An avid writer of diaries throughout her le, during which she saw the world, she planned to expand them into short stories when she retired.Dr Halliday, , who lives near Fisherrow, said: ldquoIrsquom excited about my first novel being published.ldquoAfter writing three memoirs, I wanted to try fiction as I had completed an Open University creative writing course.ldquoTaking the advice, lsquoyou should write about what you know,rsquo I chose Turkey for the setting as I worked there for seven years.The Belly Dancer is a tragicomic romantic thriller set mainly in Istanbul in the early s.Gemma, a young English woman, finds herself involved in more than just teaching English soon after her arrival in Turkey.

My wee daughter wanted to have an ldquoapple shower and so we stood under the trees. The mere touch of a branch resulted in a cascade of fruit. It was a wonderful ritual of autumn and I loved my kidsrsquo joy in it all, but within me there was a nagging feeling. As Irsquove got older, the oncoming of winter has had a depressive effect on me.Is it a process that affects us more as we get older, with each autumn marking the slow closing of yet another year To be sure, autumn is a beautul time of year and many people tell me it is their favourite season. I can understand that. The woods are magical, the sunsets seem more spectacular than at other times and itrsquos a time of harvest and forage. Our house is full of conkers, apples and colourful leaves collected on walks.Another part of the magic is the migrating birds. I heard the geese above me the other day, honking and flying in formation as they headed for Aberlady. They arrive at this time of year with winter on their tails. The assembly of pink-footed geese there at this time of year is a truly spectacular sight and sound. Tens of thousands of them gather at Aberlady Bay during their migration south.It almost has the atmosphere of an airport countless numbers of honking birds arriving from Iceland and Greenland, joining an already crowded bay. There are thousands of excited geese mingling together, sharing flight stories and looking forward to the next stage of their journey. Many feed in nearby fields before taking off once again to venture further south.As they fly over us their honking sounds like cackling witches. I often hear them when in the woods, as I did the other day. I looked up to see them through the branches of balding autumn trees, flying in their characteristic V flight formations. It seemed their honking was warning me of something: ldquoWinter is cominghellipwinter is coming.Some people of course follow the example of the geese and head for a kinder climate as winter approaches. But for most of us itrsquos a case of ritual and preparation. Hallowersquoen, really a later development of the Celtic Samhain festival, is one such ritual.But for me now, despite my love of autumnrsquos display, it cloaks my senses with a sense of melancholy which I find increasingly dficult to throw off.I spend as much time outdoors as possible in the other seasons but the darkness of winter forces me to retreat into my home. Hence we will soon be decorating our wee house with cosy and colourful lights to ward off winterrsquos dark blanket. But this dark blanket can cover our emotions as well, not so easily warded off.Many people I know likewise dread winter because of its depressive effect on their mental health. They wish that, like the geese, they could find a way of escaping the worst of it. I have often wished I was a bear who could hibernate away the winter months.But we are not bears or geese, and in my own battles with the oncoming of winter I have come to understand more than ever the importance of social connections and preparing for them. The truth is winter can be a time of flowering and rebirth, just like spring but in a dferent way ndash the flowering of friendship and rebirth of social connections perhaps lost or waned in the flurry of summer activities.In the past it was so self-evident. People huddled in each otherrsquos homes around the fire, keeping each other company. Like so many things these traditions have now been commercialised, yet the simple antidote of social connection in the approaching dark times remains as powerful as it ever was for us.It should be a time for visiting and getting together making time for friends and coming together in defiance of the darkness. And thinking especially of those for whom the cold and dark becomes an enforcer of confinement because of age or vulnerability.Winter should be a time of visiting and welcoming. This, I think, is an antidote to that depressive winter effect. Maybe thatrsquos why the geese honk so much. They are actually meeting up and having their version of a ceilidh!"},{"url":null,"title":"pass-the-parcel-over-new-railway-station-for-east-linton","story":"A campaign has been ongoing for nearly two decades, with the earliest opening of the station thought to be .However, fears have repeatedly been raised that the timeline could change, with the opening of the station, along with one at Reston in the Scottish Borders, slipping further down the line.Transport Scotland has stressed the plans remain ldquoon schedule and the commitment to the scheme is ldquounwavering.Tom Thorburn, chairman of Rail Action Group East of Scotland , aired his frustrations at RAGESrsquo AGM last month.He said: ldquoWe have been campaigning for these stations to open for nearly  years.ldquoWe have been shunted from one Transport Minister to another with delaying tactics from each so that no firm decision is taken when our new stations will happen.Various discussions have taken place with a succession of Transport Ministers since , when Stewart Stevenson MSP, according to Mr Thorburn, confirmed that a second Scottish Transport Appraisal Guidancewould not be required as the case for the Edinburgh to Berwick local service with a re-opened station at East Linton was so strong.However, since then, progress has been slow, with still no date confirmed for when work could begin on the station.Already, East Lothian Council has agreed to put forward more than pound million for the station, with Scottish Borders Council doing similar for the station at Reston.The new East Linton station would not be on the site of the former station there, which closed in , and instead would be to the west.Mr Thorburn said: ldquoThere is now a sixth Transport Minister, Michael Matheson, and when I tried to make an appointment to see him, his staff said his diary was full.ldquoWe have no way of knowing when our stations will happen ndash will it be by  or will they drop off Network Railrsquos agenda altogether ldquoIt seems that it is a lsquopass the parcelrsquo exercise from one minister to the next and East Linton and Reston stations are not seen as a high priority project by the Scottish Government.A spokesman for Transport Scotland said: ldquoIt was agreed by the Scottish Government and East Lothian Council that East Linton station will be delivered during the next railway investment periodas part of a larger programme of works to enhance the East Coast Main Line.

The remains of the castle are ancient and the oldest part is called Goblin Ha. It is partly underground, and its name means Goblin Hall.According to legend, a wizard named Hugh de Gford made a deal with the Devil nearly  years ago, and inan army of goblins swarmed up from hell and built Yester Castle for him. Goblin Ha is the part of the castle dating from that time and thatrsquos how it got its name.It is said goblins lurk in the shadows of the ruins, and especially in Goblin Ha itself. At sunset, when night falls, they come out of their hiding places and crawl about in the darkness.One autumn day quite recently a dad decided to take his two children on a trip to find Yester Castle. He worked long hours during the week so he kept weekends for his children.His daughter Suzie had just turned  and his son Jake was eight. Jake was mad about Harry Potter and wizards, and when he discovered there was a castle nearby made by goblins for a wizard he begged his dad to take him. Suzie was given the choice to stay at home with her mum, but at the last minute she decided to come.It was sunny when they set off. ldquoA perfect day to explore a castle made by goblins, said the dad jokingly. They parked at the golf course and walked towards the woods.ldquoMaybe the goblins play golf, Suzie joked to her wee brother.ldquoYou shouldnrsquot make fun, they might hear you, he said.They finally reached the edge of the wood and peered into it. Suzie found the bridge over the ravine that led to the ruins but then Jake ran ahead very excited, looking for goblins.It was dficult to imagine what the castle had originally looked like because it was so ruined. Jake said it reminded him of the ancient ruined temple in The Jungle Book movie. But one thing was for sure: it had an eerie atmosphere. As they explored, the dad walked under an archway and suddenly felt a shiver down his spine. He turned round and saw something move in the shadows.For a moment they stood absolutely still. Then a bird flew out, giving them a fright. The dad and Suzie burst into laughter.ldquoJust a stupid bird! said Jake, disappointed.After a careful search they found the entrance to Goblin Ha. It was a small entrance leading to a low, dark passageway. Jake bravely led the way, with his sister and dad close behind.A cold and damp atmosphere hit them as soon as they entered the chamber. Although it was dark, two windows above gave just enough light to see.ldquoSo all this was supposed to have been made by goblins  asked Suzie.ldquoYeah, said Jake, who was still getting over the excitement that he was actually in Goblin Ha, ldquoand they came from hell up that stairway. He pointed to the dark steps in the corner.All three stood peering into the dark stairway which plunged deep into the ground.ldquoAccording to the legend, this stairway was made by the Devil after he had done a deal with the wizard and it leads to hell. But itrsquos blocked up now, explained Jake. He looked at his father: ldquoCan we go down dad, please!ldquoSeems a bit dangerous to me son.ldquoAw, come on dad, said Suzie, ldquowe canrsquot come all this way and then not go down the stairway to hell.ldquoVery well, but Irsquoll go first and wersquoll use the torches on our phones, said the dad.Slowly they began to climb down the stairs. The light from their mobiles lit up the old walls and ancient worn steps as they descended. Suzie took photos in the darkness, although the flash wasnrsquot powerful enough to light up everything.Eventually they reached a point where great stones blocked the way so they couldnrsquot go any further. ldquoThey were put there to keep out the goblins, said Jake. His sister was now feeling a bit uneasy: ldquoCan we go now, dad  Itrsquos too spooky down here.ldquoScared of the goblins are we  her wee brother mocked.ldquoYes, letrsquos go back up, said the dad. Jake led the way up to Goblin Ha. ldquoItrsquos time we should be going, wersquove found the place so mission accomplished. Itrsquoll be dark soon, letrsquos go now while therersquos still good day light.So they left the ruins and walked back across the golf course, laughing and talking and admiring the beginnings of a sunset and a full moon in the darkening sky. They were at the car when Suzie realised she didnrsquot have her mobile phone.ldquoIt was in my back pocket, it mustrsquove fallen out, she insisted.ldquoAw no Suzie, it could be anywhere, her dad said, annoyed.ldquoDad, we have to go back to get it, please. I know I had it in Goblin Ha, it might have even fallen out there. The dad wasnrsquot happy but the mobile was expensive and so reluctantly he agreed.They retraced their steps all the way back to the castle. It had only been  minutes since they had left the ruins but the atmosphere in the dim twilight was very dferent.Finally they reached the entrance to Goblin Ha.ldquoYou go first, dad, said both children at the same time.And so the dad put on his torch and entered. His children followed close behind.When they emerged into Goblin Ha it was dark so the dad shone his torch on the ground, searching. ldquoWhere could you have left it  he asked Suzie.ldquoAnywhere, she replied, shrugging her shoulders.They couldnrsquot phone it as there was no reception, so they kept searching.It was Jake who heard it first: a faint sound coming from the dark stairway. He lted his head and looked in its direction but it was too dark to see anything. There it was again, it sounded like breathing.Jake froze in real terror. ldquoDadhellip he whispered, ldquodad, therersquos something there.ldquoStop it you wee bam, said his sister, ldquoyoursquore just trying to spook us. But then she heard it too. It was louder this time, a strange breathing sound. It was definitely coming from the stairway.Intrigued, the dad shone his light down the steps, although the mobilersquos torch wasnrsquot strong enough to completely light up the dark.Then suddenly a pair of red eyes appeared, staring back at him.The dad screamed, making his two children scream as well, and they instinctively ran for the exit. But it was dark and they couldnrsquot see the way.ldquoDad, for Godrsquos sake shine it over here, cried Suzie, now completely terried.The dad shone the torch and they ran through the passageway in a total panic. Once outside there was more light, from the full moon.ldquoWhy did you scream, you scared the hell out of me! Suzie shouted angrily at her dad.ldquoIrsquom sorry Suzie, it just gave me a fright, I didnrsquot mean to scare you, he said.ldquoWhat gave you a fright, what did you see dad  asked Jake, who was now scared himself despite his earlier bravado.ldquoNot sure really, I thought I saw, erhellipldquoYes, yes what  asked Suzie stretching out her arms impatiently.The dad hesitated, then said: ldquoWell it looked like eyes.ldquoI am now officially freaked out, said Suzie, ldquoplease letrsquos just get out of here, never mind the sodding phone.ldquoIrsquom sure it was some kind of animal, maybe a fox or even an owl, said her dad, trying to reassure her, ldquobut yes itrsquos too dark now, we should go back to the car and maybe we can come back tomorrow in the light to look for your mobile.Jake was suddenly distracted. He saw something in the passageway.ldquoDadhellip dad, whatever it is, itrsquos coming after us, look!The shadow of some creature was in the passageway, moving towards them.Both Suzie and Jake were now in a state of complete terror and they ran.ldquoNo, no, itrsquos dangerous, therersquos a steep fall there, donrsquot run! called out the dad.The kids stopped just in time. In the moonlight they could see they were standing on the edge of a steep fall. Their dad caught up with them and took their hands. They walked together carefully with hearts racing through the trees towards the bridge that led to the golf course.Behind them, a dark shadow came out of the entrance and crawled into the wood.They were just past the arched wall when they saw the dark shadow move in front of them, blocking the way. The dad shone his torch directly at it, and for a split second he saw it before it vanished into the darkness. He looked shocked.ldquoWhat the hell was that, dad  shrieked Suzie.ldquoI honestly donrsquot know, he saidWhatever it was, it was still in the woods, moving in the darkness. Then it came towards them once again, this time making strange noises.Jake suddenly yelled out: ldquoOur father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come thy will be done, in heaven as it is on earthhellip Whatever it was made a sound like a scream and retreated back into the dark wood towards Goblin Ha. Jake continued the prayer and finished with a loud ldquoamen.ldquoLetrsquos get out of here, said the dad. All three ran in the moonlight out of the shadows of the wood onto the golf course. They kept running until they reached the car park, legs aching and completely breathless.The dad fumbled for his keys while the children stared at the golf course, looking for a moving shadow.Finally the dad found his keys and they were in the car and away as fast as possible.Suzie was the first to speak: ldquoI ask again, what was it ldquoI think the dark was playing tricks on us, said her dad, ldquoit was an animal of some sort.ldquoBut what about that horrible scream  she asked.ldquoFoxes can make a strange screeching noise at night, Suzie, thatrsquos what I think it was, said her dad, trying to reassure her.ldquoIt was a goblin, wasnrsquot it dad  asked Jake.ldquoAye right, replied his sister sarcastically, ldquoyou read too much Harry Potter. And what was all that praying about  That was just weird.ldquoIt was a redcap goblin, said Jake, ldquoyou canrsquot outrun them and the Lordrsquos Prayer is the only thing that will stop them. I had memorised it before our visit, just in case.ldquoHowrsquod you know that  asked SuzieldquoI read about it, said Jake.Suzie was just about to say something when her dad winked at her and interrupted: ldquoWellit was a redcap then the prayer seemed to work. He hoped this would stop them arguing. And it did. Jake smiled and put on his earphones.ldquoIrsquom sure it was a fox, whispered the dad to his daughter, ldquoor maybe a big rat, but just let Jake think it was a goblin.They got home with a story to tell their mum!In a quiet moment, when the children were busy, she asked the dad: ldquoSo what was it you saw He hesitated to answer the question, ashe wouldnrsquot be believed.ldquoTo be honest, I donrsquot know, he said. ldquoI told the kids it was a fox because I didnrsquot want to spook them, but I really canrsquot say.Who knows the truth of it all  If Suziersquos phone is ever found, the photos she took in the dark stairway might reveal what was really hiding in the darkness on that day."},{"url":null,"title":"be-prepared-for-next-beast-from-the-east-says-council-emergency-planner","story":"Severe weather is the biggest risk to people living in East Lothian, according to Sandy Baptie.And he has issued advice ahead of a one-day workshop to help communities prepare for any future emergencies.It includes going back to old-fashioned handsets in a time when more people rely on mobile phones.Mr Baptie, East Lothian Councilrsquos emergency planning, risk and resilience manager, has been visiting community councils and groups in the wake of the lsquoBeast from the Eastrsquo snowstorm, which brought much of the country to a standstill in February and March this year.Heavy snowfalls and strong winds caused chaos on the roads and left many people stranded in their homes.It also saw a surge in community spirit, with tales of people helping neighbours and looking after the more vulnerable people.Now Mr Baptie is hoping that spirit will help all communities prepare a Community Resilience Plan which they can use in case another severe weather front hits the county.And he has issued some advice for people to prepare in their own home for what could happen.He said: ldquoSevere weather is the biggest risk to East Lothian.ldquoBeing prepared for it is important and people can do things themselves, such as keeping an old-fashioned phone in their house in case mobile signal is lost, having a torch to hand in case power goes.ldquoIt is also important to stock up on food when warnings that severe weather is on its way are issued.More than  people are expected to attend the community resilience workshop at The Brunton, Musselburgh, on Saturday.The one-day event, which is being funded by EDF Energy and the Scottish Government, will bring together representatives from community councils, groups and schools.Advice on a range of aspects of drawing up community resilience plans will be available, including ensuring groups who take on responsibility are covered by insurance.It will also inform people of services they can sign up to with energy companies to ensure they receive a phone callpower goes out.North Berwick Community Council, which already has a plan and implemented it successfully during the Beast from the East, will be there to talk about how they did it and what worked.Mr Baptie hopes the event will result in community plans from across the county, with each one appointing a Single Person of Contact or SPOC.He said: ldquoThe idea of a SPOC is that there is one point of contact between each community and the council so we can get information to them and they can let us know what is happening, for examplepower has gone out in one area.ldquoThe plans are about drawing up lists of vulnerable people in the community, finding out who has a x and can get medicine to people or take them to hospital or the doctor.ldquoIt is about being prepared.

This is a very concerning piece of news, especially given the fact that the Tesco bus also serves the health centre.ldquoIt comes at a time when we are being told that we need to use public transport more because of dire warnings about the impact of climate change and when massive house building will lead to gridlock unless newcomers can be persuaded onto buses.Mr Turner added: ldquoEast Lothian generally, and Musselburgh in particular, is now renowned for its excellent bus services so this announcement comes as a blow and runs counter to all that has been achieved on the public transport front in the last few of years.ldquoLetrsquos hope that the council, working with the operators, can come up with a proposal to replace the extremely useful Tesco bus, and in doing so letrsquos try to serve some places that are currently remote from buses ndash Edenhall Road and the Muckletts, for example, both had buses until a few years ago and theirwould, I am sure, be welcomed by elderly residents.ldquoI think the Tesco bus should be replaced by something very similar, perhaps marketed as the Musselburgh community bus. It should not just parallel other bus routes, which is what the Tesco bus does, but should serve some of the residential areas that are cut off from buses. Goose Green is another area remote from a bus route.A Tesco spokesperson said: ldquoWe have made the dficult decision to stop the provision of the T and T bus services to and from our Musselburgh Extra store.ldquoUnfortunately the services make a loss, which means we are no longer able to provide them.ldquoWe have worked with local bus providers to ensure that all affected areas will continue to have a bus link that connects them to our store, including a newly introduced  bus from Longniddry to Fort Kinnaird.ldquoOur priority now is to ensure our customers who use the bus are aware of our decision and of all these alternative routes so that they are able to plan their journeys.ldquoWe apologise for any inconvenience this causes.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: ldquoEast Lothian Council was notied of Tescorsquos intention to withdraw the T and T services in September and we are fully aware of the impact this may have on the local community.

A couple of years ago, there were probably only a few dozen people who would have argued that an entirely detached position, with the UK having no initial arrangements of any sort with the EU, and operating on a kind of Singaporean or Hong Kong free-trade model, was desirable.Itrsquos still, whatever its apparent ideological merits to buccaneering free marketeers, very much a minority view. Whatever is claimed for the legacy of Thatcherism, the rise of globalisation and the influence of ldquoneoliberalismnone created a majority, or even a particularly signicant following, for the kinds of pure market doctrines advanced by the Mont Pelerin Society, the Institute for Economic Affairs, Adam Smith Institute, Centre for Policy Studies or Taxpayersrsquo Alliance.That, however, is no excuse for not having considered it as a possibility. Once the Prime Minister ndash for reasons that still seem inexplicable ndash triggered Article  and immediately ruled out numerous plausible options, ending up with no deal was always something which could theoretically happen.Its likelihood was greatly increasednegotiations were to be directed, for example, by the kind of person whose strategic skills were so inept that she could throw away a perfectly viable majority, convince even her own supporters that she was unfit for office, and generally give the impression that she couldnrsquot run a bath.Anyway, orders have now been given that, in the second week of November ndash ages away ndash there will be a flurry of activity to gear us up for the several hundred thousand little bits of legislation on pfling details like the legal status of EU nationals, and the technical requirements of customs brokerage, which will be necessaryno deal is agreed.The First Minister is ldquoincreasingly concerned. On Wednesday, Ms Sturgeon said that she thinks ldquoliterally with every day that passes right now, that the prospect of no deal is becoming ever greater. Yet even something that Ms Sturgeon believes could, nonetheless, turn out to be true.Others in what might be called the Henny-Penny Tendency are even more forthright in their view that ldquothe lts are faun. Or, at any rate, that the planes will fall out of the skies, chickens will be unavailable or bathed in chlorine, the lights will go out and the supply of all commodities and services, from medicines to universities, will grind to a halt.This is the moment where it has to be pointed out that these are the people who promised us that a Leave vote would immediatelyresult in unemployment going up by ,, when it in fact fell to its lowest level since . It would cause a ldquorecession with four quarters of negative growth . A huge rise in interest rates . An exodus of foreign firms, manufacturing investment, capital and overseas students .Their spectacular wrongness to date doesnrsquot, of course, guarantee that they are wrong when they assure us that a ldquono deal exit will definitely lead to a UK that looks like a series of scenes from Cormac McCarthyrsquos novel The Road. The formbook suggests otherwise, though.It does, however, seem likely that, precisely because we have been so completely enmeshed in the regulations and restrictions of the project of ldquoever-closer union, at least since the Treaties of Maastricht and Lisbon, that no deal at all will cause signicant short-term problems. Given the Governmentrsquos record, it also seems likely ndash more than likely ndash that this ldquoacceleration of preparations scheduled to start on November  wonrsquot get us ready for everything a sharp exit would entail.Eventhe disruption would be anywhere near as comprehensive and damaging as the Chicken Licken mob believe, however, that shouldnrsquot blind us to the possibility that Mrs Mayrsquos deal might be even worse. We already know, after all, than itrsquos worse than an Efta deal , worse than the Canada +++ iant trade deal offered by the EU, and worse than the proposals David Davisrsquos team advocated, which she blithely over-ruled.It might turn out that those measures ndash unilaterally agreeing not to levy any tarf or non-tarf barriers on imports, say, or scrapping domestic regulations that make UK businesses uncompetitive ndash could be just the kind of thing which would force the country to take a more trade-based, internationalist approach. Precisely the medicine, in other words, needed to gain the benefits of trade with the rest of the world beyond the EU customs union.Wersquod have a period of dficulty, but at least emerge in the end with the result that Brexit aimed for ndash the freedom to control our own economy, legislation and trade. Mrs Mayrsquos deal,she can get it, has almost all the costs and restrictions of staying in the EU, while removing its advantages it threatens the stability of the Union, stles freedom of manoeuvre and embroils us for many years to come.Itrsquos unsatisfactory that, two years after decisively making a binary choice, we should have been painted into a corner which gives us another one ndash and between two options, neither of which most people wanted.

The ghillie scoops some gore from the corpse and smears Bourdainrsquos face while the chaps all heartily laugh at this old tradition.An old tradition it is and not one that causes a great deal of outrage.So who could have guessed - against a current affairs backdrop of appalling racism on a Ryanair flight and a Tory MSP saying disgusting things about the reproductive rights of struggling families - the thing thatrsquos agitated the internet is a dead goat.Pity poor Larysa Switlyk, a self-described ldquohardcore huntress who posted a boastful account of her latest kill to social media and now is making international headlines.Yoursquoll remember the outrage at Dr Walter Palmer, an American dentist who caused consternation and fury after hunting and killing Cecil the Lion in Zimbabwe  Well, Scotland, we are having our own Cecil the Lion moment.Ms Switlyk, posed in full camouflage regalia and admiring her slaughtered preyrsquos impressive curled horns, captioned her photo with, ldquoWe hunted hard for a big one for two days and finally got on this group. Made a perfect  yard shot and dropped him.I cannot speak for the goats of Islay, where this poor beast was targeted, but I have met his cousins on Lewis and found the issue not to be stalking the goats but to be escaping those curious about my packed lunch.Although this goat has no name or backstory, Ms Switlyk misjudged the mood. The internet is not happy and calls for Something To Be Done.Of course, there is now a petition demanding the banning of trophy hunting in Scotland.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was straight in about it with a tweet reading, ldquoTotally understandable why the images from Islay of dead animals being held up as trophies is so upsetting and offensive to people. [The Scottish Government] will review the current situation and consider whether changes to the law are required.A government statement was released saying similar, adding that responsible and appropriate culling of animals is a necessary part of sustainable land management. However, ldquoThe Environmental Secretary will review the situation and consider whether any clarications or changes to the law might be required.We are still in grouse hunting season, a popular pastime of the royal family while in Scotland. In fact, the public was treated in August this year to the news that Prince George, five, was reportedly taken on his first grouse shoot by his parents on the Balmoral estate.Prince William has made animal conservation his pet - pardon the pun - cause, flying around the world to preach against hunting endangered species.And yet hersquos well aware of the thrill of the hunt himself.Letrsquos not forget Prince Harry posing with a one tonne water buffalo he felled with a rle while on a gap year in Africa.Though the Duke of Essex missed this years royal shooting day out, reportedly due to the influence of his new we, a keen animal lover.So why are goats more sympathetic than grouse  One of the complaints detailed in the online petition calling for action is that \"Ms Switlyk has used her photos to advertise hunting experience tours to an American and international audience.\"Swaggering on social media about ones kill isnt the done thing. The rich and the royals fell stags and shoot grouse but they do it discreetly.Some are shocked that tourists would travel to Scotland for bloodsports but bloodsports are part of the le of the country.The argument for hunting trips is, as the Scottish Government statement points out, that estate management involves the culling of animal species to prevent overpopulation. The goats are not native to Islay and they have no natural predators to control their numbers. Previously contraceptive darts have been used to prevent them breeding.Im sure Ms Switlyk - who has now received death threats online herself - would argue that shes doing her bit for conservation.Scottish Greens MSP Mark Ruskell, urged the Scottish government to \"make it known that bloodsport participants are unwelcome to visit Scotland for the barbaric practice\".

Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Friday  Oct  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : pmBritish Summer Time ends at am on Sunday morning, so don’t forget to put your clocks back one hour.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is a neurological disease which results in changes in animals# mental state, abnormalities of posture and movement and of sensation. The clinical disease usually lasts for several weeks and it is characteristically progressive and fatal.According to The World Organisation for Animal Health statistics very few cases of BSE — fewer than  each year since  — are reported in the UK.Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: “Following confirmation of a case of classical BSE in Aberdeenshire, I have activated the Scottish Government’s response plan to protect our valuable farming industry, including establishing a precautionary movement ban being placed on the farm.“While it is important to stress that this is standard procedure until we have a clear understanding of the disease#s origin, this is further proof that our surveillance system for detecting this type of disease is working. Be assured that the Scottish Government and its partners stand ready to respond to any further confirmed cases of the disease in Scotland.”Chief Veterinary Officer Sheila Voas said: “While it is too early to tell where the disease came from in this case, its detection is proof that our surveillance system is doing its job. We are working closely with the Animal and Plant Health Agency to answer this question, and in the meantime, I would urge any farmer who has concerns to immediately seek veterinary advice.Ian McWatt, Director of Operations in Food Standards Scotland said: “There are strict controls in place to protect consumers from the risk of BSE, including controls on animal feed, and removal of the parts of cattle most likely to carry BSE infectivity.“Consumers can be reassured that these important protection measures remain in place and that Food Standards Scotland Official Veterinarians and Meat Hygiene Inspectors working in all abattoirs in Scotland will continue to ensure that in respect of BSE controls, the safety of consumers remains a priority. We will continue to work closely with Scottish Government, other agencies and industry at this time.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This is not some dry, academic debate. The potential health consequences of ministers failing to heed the advice of their own experts are serious.“I hope the Health Secretary will use her influence, therefore, to persuade her colleague, the Housing Minister, to accept the case for using a Rural Minimum Income Standard to help define fuel poverty in rural and island areas.  This is the only way of ensuring those who need help get the support they need.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Veterans, army and sea cadets and other groups will muster at the Royal British Legion, setting off shortly afterwards to form up on Broad Street.A short service led by the Salvation Army captain will lead to a two-minute silence at am, before a special Armistice Service takes place in the cathedral.In the afternoon, volunteers will begin to create a large-scale portrait in the sand at Scapa Beach, of an Orcadian soldier killed during WWI as part of Danny Boyle’s - NOW commission, Pages of the Sea. It was previously reported in last week’s The Orcadian that the event would take place at Waulkmill Bay, but this location has since changed to Scapa Beach.The artwork — one of  across the UK and the Republic of Ireland — will signy both the departure of the soldier from the county to serve in the war and, as the tide washes their image away, the loss of their le and those of many others.At pm, Orkney’s young people join forces with Orkney Rocks! Choir and others to remember those lost, and the impact the war had on those left behind, in a special concert at the Orkney Arts Theatre.Admission will be free and there will be an opportunity to make a contribution to the charity, Help for Heroes. Tickets for the concert will be released on Monday, October , and will be available at the council’s customer services points in School Place, Kirkwall, and Warehouse Buildings, Stromness.At .pm, a lone bugler at St Magnus Cathedral will join , inidual buglers from across the UK and oversees territories in sounding the historic ‘Last Post’.This will be followed by the lighting of a beacon on the St Magnus Cathedral kirk green at pm as part of the national Beacons of Light event which will see beacons lit across the country, symbolising an end to the darkness of war andto the light of peace.St Magnus Cathedral will remain the focus as, at .pm, the bells will ring alongside , others across the nation and beyond.Between pm and pm, the short film specially commissioned by the Kirkwall Townscape Heritage Initiative for the centenary of the armistice will be projected onto the cathedral for the last time.The convener of Orkney Islands Council, Harvey Johnston, said: “We are grateful to everyone who has worked with us so far to ensure we have a fitting programme of events here in Orkney for people to mark this momentous occasion and pay their respects to forbears who suffered so much.

Inkson, have been fondly remembered down the years and credited with greatly boosting the French linguistic capabilities of those involved.As well as sowing the seeds for lasting friendships, one of the exchanges also led to the eventual marriage of Alistair Swanson of Dingwall and Belgian Marie-Anny De Landsheer. Alistair lived next door to Marie-Annyrsquos Scottish exchange partner, Sandra, daughter of the late Sandy and Lilly Macrae.With some of those attending a th anniversary meeting in Dingwall now in their s and s, there was much to catch on. One of those present, George Robertson, said the stark contrast between the new and old Dingwall Academy buildings amazed those present.\"The day began with a guided tour of Dingwall Academy, graciously hosted by rector, Mrs Karen Cormack and two equally charming assistants, Ceitidh Petrie of fth Year and head girl, Anna-Maria Stewart of sixth year. We were amazed by the change in the Academy mdash from the grim corridors with its memories of rooms with formal rows of desks, piles of jotters and frequent administrations of summary justice mdash with the lsquoLochgelly Specialrsquo mdash to the cosy, student-friendly comfort of modern classrooms, sumptuously equipped with digital projectors and interactive whiteboards.\"Gone are the dingy cloakrooms, in the corners of which, stressed-out procrastinators struggled furiously to finish their homework on time! Gone too, are the endless, uncouth nicknames we used to give our teachers, Pirrac, Froggy, Daisy-lugs, Kate Stew, Inky, Willie the War, Kramer, Horace, Scabbac, Sinkie, Snottery Tom and so on.\"He added: \"We soon realised that Dingwall Academy is a much happier, kinder place than the strictly regimented establishment, where we learned, suffered, cried, laughed and fell in, and out, of love! The old school, however, was not all bad, because we had the good fortune of being taught by many caring, brilliant teachers who inspired and challenged us, and whom we still remember with great fondness. J.K.Inkson was one of those par excellence, but kind and modest, despite his many gts.\"After welcome refreshments in the Academy cafe, the group enjoyed a tour of Dingwall Museum.Mr Robertson said: \"The culminating highlight of our day was, without doubt, the get-together and dinner in the Royal Hotel, Cromarty. We were able to catch up with more of our old friends and former schoolmates. We were formally welcomed by Sandra Collardand by Marie-Anny, who addressed us in flawless English. The dinner was a splendid affair, with a host of gastonomic delicacies, all excellently prepared.\"The old friends recalled the lasting benefits of their exchanges down the years. Mr Robertson said: \"We were particularly glad to have a representative of the Inkson family with us, in the form of J.K.rsquos daughter, Helen, and we were pleased to hear a message of greeting from his son, Kerr, who lives in Auckland, New Zealand.\"Kerr wrote of his pride in the job his father had done, developing and managing the exchanges. He also wished us all a happy evening together. We remembered with fondness, all those who were no longer with us, and especially J.K.Inkson himself, to whose memory all drank a fitting toast.\"Warm thanks were also expressed to Sandra Collard who helped maintain contacts and organise the event and Marie-Anny who \"emulated mdash and surpassed mdash her fictional compatriot, Monsieur Poirot, in locating so many of our Belgian friends\".Although Marie-Anny was the only surviving Belgian veteran who felt able to undertake the long journey to Ross-shire, Mr Robertson said: \"There has been a great exchange of email addresses, and it looks like the ether will be buzzing with electronic correspondence between old friends in Britain and Belgium.\"Well done, Marie-Anny and Sandra, for giving us one of the most memorable days of our lives, and thank you Alistair, for your magical photographic memories of this wonderful occasion!\"Friday  Oct  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The ersion could then reopen to traffic shortly after a train clears the other side.Ross, Skye and Lochaber MP, Ian Blackford has been campaigning for the revised system with support from Scottish Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson.Mr Blackford said: \"This has the potential to be great news and work now must be put in place to make these plans a reality. I would like to put on record my gratitude to Network Rail for listening to concerns of the local community and of representatives like myself.\"Despite matters relating to Network Rail being reserved to Westminster, I knew the best hope was for the Scottish Government to try and make clear that the sorry state of affairs that we have all witnessed, couldnrsquot be allowed to continue.

In addition, with two performance improvement plans in force, poor punctuality that has caused misery for commuters should have been turned round and be firmly on an upward trajectory. But none of that has happened.Only around ten of  brand new electric trains are in service, such as on the main Edinburgh-Glasgow line. The first should have been introduced more than a year ago, but they have been delayed by series of problems including to their windscreens and brakes, and setbacks to the electrication of the route.The introduction of the other fleet, of -year-old diesels for longer-distance inter-city routes, has been equally problematic. The first of the  trains did not enter service until a week ago, some eight months late, after refurbishment of the carriages was severely delayed. Problems even included the wrong type of thread being used in their new carpets.: Alastair Dalton: How to find hidden cheaper rail faresThat will mean most of the first ten trains, which are due to be operating by December, having to carry passengers in an unrefurbished state. “Classic” is the official description.A year ago, just as ScotRail was showing off the first of the trains north of the Border, one of its former stablemates still at Great Western Railway in England caught fire.Two weeks ago, another of the trains broke down on ScotRail’s inaugural preview run from Aberdeen to Edinburgh.On top of all this, the ScotRail Alliance’s train punctuality, which has struggled for two years, has further noseed.: Alastair Dalton: Roadtesting ScotRail’s new train reveals many changesWhile officials stressed the impact of last month’s Storm Ali on bringing down the latest figures, there has been a malaise for months despite improvement plans being implemented in autumn  and April this year.I’m told an increasing proportion of the delays are caused by track and signalling faults which are the responsibility of Network Rail, rather than ScotRail’s trains breaking down.However, this is causing bad blood between the two bodies, which are supposedly working closer than ever before, because Network Rail is being “named” when things go wrong.In the old days, they diplomatically referred to each other as “our industry partners”.I hear transport secretary Michael Matheson this week voiced impatience at the lack of improvement. However, the SNP mantra that fuller control of Network Rail by Scotland would solve the problem has been rubbished by many in the industry.The pressure is on, and the next big test will come in December when the alliance attempts to add a raft of extra trains, such as a new Edinburgh-Glasgow service via Cumbernauld.It will seek to avoid a repeat of the enduring chaos down south this year when several train operators launched over-ambitious bigger timetables onto a network that couldn’t cope.Building the best railway Scotland has ever had is still very much a work in progress – and on current form, it may well remain that for quite some time to come.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4820070.1540490489!/image/image.jpg","title":"jim duffy three bands that help give scotland a good name overseas","story":"People in other countries often smile when you say you#re Scottish and one reason is our music, says Jim Duffy.It’s interesting when travelling abroad to watch people’s reactions when you tell them you are Scottish.Nine times out of ten, they smile and one can tell from their reactions that they kind of like the Scots. Although we are part of the United Kingdom, we never seem to be classed alongside England, when it comes to our identity as a grouping of people.Foreigners, for want of a better descriptor, perceive us be that bit dferent from our neighbours down south and across the Irish Sea. And when there is a drink involved, the discussion will always come round to football or music. Yes, it seems we Scots have made it into global stardom because of the bands we have produced. So, who is your favourite To keep it simple here, we are talking about bands, not inidual musicians. Some of you may class this as unfair as you adore the likes of Rod Stewart. But, while Sir Rod is undoubtedly a mega star, there are smaller bands who have had great success and are just as well known internationally.Many moons ago, I was an air steward working for British Airways. I was  and operating on s out of Heathrow. It was halcyon days for BA when Lord King and Sir Colin Marshall were at the helm. I was rostered on an -day trip to Australia. On boarding and completing my pre-flight checks with the crew “doon the back” in economy, one of the Club Class crew ran down and asked, “Anyone Scottish here ”The surprise she had was that Deacon Blue were travelling in business class for gigs in Australia. Well, you can imagine just how fast I legged it to door two left, where I saw the band board and take their seats. It was surreal and fabulous. Suffice to say, the band members were great fun with the crew and I thoroughly enjoyed chinwagging with Dougie Vipond and James Prime, two guys who play a big part in the song Dignity. And I just loved singing along to this when I eventually went to see them at the Armadillo in Glasgow.: Jim Duffy: I lapped up Brexit’s fairytale, but it’s become a nightmareI guess you can tell from that little anecdote that Deacon Blue rate very highly in my top three Scottish bands. The album Raintown is a classic and I still have it in my playlist on Spoty. But, while Deacon Blue are a very strong candidate for the number one spot, there are others that stand out.How about Simple Minds  When it comes to demonstrating international presence, these guys have shown they have got what it takes. No doubt, having the theme song in the movie The Breakfast Club catapulted them into the USA in a big way. Crack the US and you’ve made it! But, Simple Minds are more than just a band who penned decent music. They were very much involved in politics, which did them no harm in selling records. The album Street Fighting Years – with its emphasis on the troubles in South Africa – was a cracker. Released in May , the album reached the top of the UK album charts. Selling out big venues across the globe, Simple Minds must feature in my top three Scottish bands. I eventually managed to see them perform live in Birmingham. They were good ...While on the subject of Scottish bands I have seen perform live, Travis are next up. I was lucky enough to catch them perform in Boston in one of their last gigs as part of their US tour. Again, they were terric and packed the venue. Great lyrics, fantastic melodies and real personality on stage. Fran Healy, the front man, was excellent in the way he handled the crowd. I have a story for another day on this one.: Jim Duffy: Why today’s kids are the worst behaved for a generationSo, there you go, my top three Scottish bands, but in no particular order. So what about the others that you may like and that have had impact here and overseas How about Texas with the lead singer Charlene Spiteri  Texas could rock a venue and had some great hits, notably for me, Halo, which is just great to pop on in my headphones. Texas were strong, but I’m not surethey were just as big as the others, despite a loyal following, who may be pretty upset that I have not grouped them in my top three. Other groups come to mind such as Del Amitri, The Fratellis, Altered Images, Capercaillie and The Skids. But, the last couple of paragraphs have to go to bands who are pretty awesome, but not in my top three.Many of you will be shouting out: what about the Bay City Rollers  And quite right too. The tartan-clad heart throbs of the Seventies are a Scottish institution, albeit, they were gone as quick as they arrived. The whirlwind that was the Bay City Rollers in the s still has some puff, despite them going though hell. So, while not having the staying power of many other great Scottish groups, they deserve a mention.Wet Wet Wet will also feature for many of you as band that produced brilliant songs and had a terric sound. There is no doubt that Marti Pellow could chant and entertain. And Wet Wet Wet had one of the best-selling singles of all time in the UK, Love is all around. I believe the group actually pulled it from the charts after  weeks at the top.But, I cannot end this piece without paying tribute to a wee band that always get talked about abroad as one song they belted out always gets everyone up singing. Yes, The Proclaimers and  miles. It never fails to cheer up a night out anywhere in the world.Time to get your headphones on and get some Scottish bands filling your ear canals.“And I would walk  ...” That will set you up for the day now!©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4820096.1540537962!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit pro eu mps tell barnier to prepare for brexit u turn","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Michel Barnier was told to get ready for the UK to change its mind on Brexit through a fresh referendum in a meeting with pro-EU opposition politicians.The group of senior SNP, Liberal Democrat, Plaid Cymru and Green figures claimed to be envoys of the “resistance” to Brexit at Westminster and told the EU chief negotiator there was no consensus on how the UK should leave the -nation bloc.SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford was joined at the meeting in the European Commission’s Berlaymont headquarters by Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville Roberts, and the Green Party MEP Molly Scott Cato.They told Mr Barnier that opposition parties were working with pro-EU MPs in the Labour Party and Conservative rebels to defeat the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal and force a so-called People’s Vote to give the public a chance to stay in the EU.In a joint statement, the group said their one-hour meeting with Mr Barnier was “constructive” and claimed the UK’s exit from the EU “must not be assumed”.“We emphasised that there is a cross-party resistance in Westminster to the destructive Brexit being pursued by the Tories,” the group said. In an attack on Jeremy Corbyn’s lukewarm support for a fresh referendum on EU membership, the group added that “this is being waved through by the Labour frontbench, but no majority exists in Parliament for the current Brexit trajectory.”The SNP’s Westminster leader has signalled a strengthening of the party’s support for another Brexit referendum in recent days, saying he is prepared to push the issue forward in the CommonsMPs reject the Prime Minister’s deal with Brussels.Following yesterday’s meeting, Mr Blackford said: “The UK government’s reckless approach to negotiations threatens livelihoods and ignores the clear wishes of the people of Scotland.“Scotland voted to remain in the EU and we continue to press the UK Government to stay in the Single Market and Customs Union so we can protect jobs and living standards”Mr Cable said he told Mr Barnier it was “time to start serious contingency planning for a People’s Vote... because MPs who back the People’s Vote are fast forming the biggest and most cohesive bloc in Westminster.”Mr Barnier was also asked to provide guarantees to UK citizens living in the EU that their rights would be status would be protected even in a no-deal Brexit. “It is simply the right thing to do,” Mr Cable said.Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said yesterday that while Labour were open to a second EU referendum, its preference was for a general election because “we are trying to bring the whole country together”. “The country is still ided right down the middle,” he added.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4820435.1540560387!/image/image.jpg","title":"report scottish twitter users clear target for bots","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...A new report has found up to  per cent of Scottish Twitter activity could be malign amid concerns of fake activity by so-called #bots# or foreign agents.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true.

The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"no shortage of goals in action packed weekend ","story":"There was loads of football action on Saturday with LK Galaxy claiming a convincing win against Tizers to win the Association Cup.Final score was an incredible -, with no fewer than five goals coming from Jordan Thomason.Meanwhile, the contest for the County Shield was won by Ness at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Friday  Oct  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27481  ","story":"• Mícheál Mac Donncha and Robert Ballagh Mícheál Mac Donnchaby Robert Ballagh published by Head of Zeus. back in the late s. For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future.

Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8680982.1540388113!/image/image.jpg","title":"london support sought for 20 000 jobs blueprint","story":"A delegation from an area rocked by the loss of more than , highly paid manufacturing jobs in recent years is currently in Westminster with a blueprint to revitalise its economy.Business leaders, politicians and council officials from Mid and East Antrim are telling the UK Government of their ambitious plans to deliver economic growth through the proposed £bn Belfast Region City Deal.The substantial economic opportunity includes plans for around £m of investment in Mid and East Antrim, which has suffered signicant job losses with the closures of Michelin and JTI Gallaher in Ballymena.This includes proposals to extend The Gobbins clf path, Islandmagee, the regeneration of Carrickfergus and the creation of an innovation and inspiration centre at the St Patrick’s site in Ballymena.Anne Donaghy, council chief executive, said: “As a council, we are fully committed to supporting business growth and development, and promoting an environment that encourages and facilitates investment in our borough.“We focus our efforts on being an enabler to the wealth creators.

The owners of The Aniseed Lounge in Ballynahinch made the announcement on the eatery’s Facebook page this morning.Husband and we team Nick and Joanne Clough opened the pub restaurant at the site of the former Cloisters bar and grill on Dromore Street in December .With support from Ulster Bank, the ambitious redevelopment project created  jobs.The statement posted on Facebook today said the decision to close had been taken with “teary eyes and heavy hearts.”“It is with great sadness that we must let you know that we have had to make the dficult decision to close the Aniseed Lounge with immediate effect. Unfortunately we were not steadily busy enough to cover the overheads and as it is just the two of us financing the business, it has become impossible to continue to finance the shortfall. Things have been further complicated due to recent family ill health. We took nothing out and put everything in - money, hours, enthusiasm - but unfortunately it wasn’t enough,” the statement, signed by “NJ” said.“We want to take this opportunity to thank each and every one of you who has come in the doors and enjoyed our food, drink and craic.

Now the proud pilot of an Easyjet airbus , Alex, , graduated from Oxford Aviation Academy earlier this year and is based in Venice.She lives with her Italian boyfriend Edgar, whom she met during her pilot training.It has been  years since Alex left her home in Waringstown at the age of  to start a new le in Canada.The move came about after her mum Alison – a flight attendant for many years – married a Canadian pilot whom she met on her travels. They married in  and the family now live in Kitchener, Ontario, roughly an hour outside Toronto. Inspired by her step-dad Doug Glussich, Alex gained her full private pilot’s licence, her first step towards her dream of becoming a commercial pilot.She said: “Mum was a flight attendant so I was kind of exposed to flying from an early age, but it was when I met my step-dad that I first thought that maybe I could be a pilot.”She admitted that having realised her dream, it was not all plain sailing given that her profession is male-dominated: “I’m based in Venice with EasyJet. I’m the only female first officer and there’s also a female captain. “There’s just the two females out of -strong flight crew.” She said: “I do think things are going in the right direction, especially with EasyJet. They have a scholarship called the Amy Johnson initiative which offers fully paid flight training to females who they pick. “They are trying to drive more females into it, but it is a slow process.” Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"She added: “It can sometimes be challenging. You feel you have to prove your worth.“A lot of the males, the captains, are very good. They take the sex out of it. If you’re a good pilot, your a good pilot – end of story.“Through training I felt that I had to be a little bit better than the boys because I’m a girl.“I have unfortunately encountered a few negative comments, not from any co-workers, but from passengers. It’s been especially from older male passengers when they see a female pilot sitting in the cockpit they things like, ‘maybe I’d be safer getting a dferent flight’. It’s said in jokey way, they’re from a dferent time, but I don’t like hearing it because to me being a pilot is not a joke.“I’ve only had two or three of those comments, it’s not a regular thing.”Talking about the longevity of a career as a pilot, Alex said: “Pilot retirement age is  simply for medical reasons. You have medicals once a year until you get to over , then your medicals come once every six months.”She said: “I’m very settled where I am for now. EasyJet is a fantactic company, they really look after their employees, the money is good, the benefits are good. “To start your career flying an Airbus  is fabulous – it’s one of the best jets around.“However I’ve always had my sights on going long haul. I’d love to try the Boeing ‘triple sevens’, or the s or even the Airbus s, because the bigger the better, right “Before my career ends I would definitely like to try a bigger jet.”She continued@ “The longest flight I’m doing now is from Venice to Edinburgh. It’s two and half hours but from October we’ll be doing Lanzarote and Tel Aviv – those will be three and half hours each.“The Airbus that I fly now simply wouldn’t have the mileage to do more than seven hours. To do that I’d have to go to a bigger airbus – a , or to the Boeing .”Going back to her first time on board an airplane, Alex said: “The first time I was on a commercial aircraft was when I was four years old. I was going to Lanzarote with my parents and brother. “I was really excited. The noise was a bit frightening, but I loved the speed of the take off. “Back in those days you were still allowed to visit the pilots in the flight deck, so my brother and I went up with a flight attendant and I remember wondering what all the buttons were for.”Alex is now pleased to offer the same opportunities to children: “After we land we’ll have young boys and girls coming in to the cockpit. They give you so much respect, and are so interested. “If I could give any advice to the girls out there thinking of becoming a pilot, I’d say go for it.”The reassuring tone of a pilot is something that goes hand-in-hand with air travel, but are the men and women in the cockpit putting on a special voice to talk to passengers or is it their actual demeanour Alex explained: “They say everybody has a PA voice, they just want to sound as professional as they can. When I speak on board, I don’t want to come on with a really thick Northern Irish accent because nobody will understand me. It’s about clarity and getting the message across.”She added: “Pilots don’t only do medical testing. We do psychoanalysis testing. Pilots are calm. It’s in our nature. If a bad situation occurs we need to be able to handle it quickly and efficiently.“They’re not faking the voice, that’s their personality and how they are. That’s why they’re pilots.”Of her own journey she said: “Training was loads of hard work. My programme with Oxford was  months. It’s non-stop.“You have to say goodbye to your social le, but what’s  months in the grand scheme of things.“As a pilot, I’m quite happy to be a passenger. We work hard so it’s nice for me to let someone  fly. I’m completely as ease because I know the training the pilots have been through.”Talking of the most challenging manoeuvres she has had to carry out, Alex said: “When we went to Oxford we had to do upset recovery training. “We went into an aerobatic aircraft which is designed to be able to do all sorts of manoeuvres. “They put us into barrel rolls, spiral es. “Because we’re flying the big jets it’s very unlikely they will be able to get into a spiral e because computer systems have protection it wouldn’t let you. “However we always have to think of worst case scenariothese protections failed.”She commented: “In high school my strong subjects were maths and physics, when it comes to the theory behind flying I didn’t find it too overwhelming.“To get to spin an aircraft is a lot of fun. I feel like I’m in the red arrows.“I’ve been in planes from a young age. “It’s second nature to me, I don’t even flinch at it.”But what of those people who more than flinch at the prospect of air travel Alex said: “EasyJet actually do have a programme from Luton once a year where they take nervous fliers up on a free flight. “They have two pilots up front and two pilots in the cabin with the passengers explaining to them step-by-step from the take off to the landing what is happening and what are the noises you hear.“I can promise you this,it was completely dangerous I wouldn’t be doing it every day. “I think it’s fear of the unknown that makes people afraid.”Askedthere was training in place to deal with terrorist attacks, Alex said: “We do hijack training. We’re trainedanything were to happen we’re able to send out a squawk code which sends a message directly to Air Traffic Control.“Even everyday stuff – before we push back for the taxi until we get to the gate – the cockpit door is closed and will only be open for examplewe need to go to the bathroom. “We need to call cabin crew and they need to come to guard the doorwe have to leave the cockpit. “We take measures to ensure the cockpit door will not be breached. It’s also bulletproof. They’ve changed everything since  .”She explained how she came to be stationed in Italy: “The reason why I’m in Venice is because I met an Italian called Edgar during the training.”Alex and Edgar, , who is from Milan, soon became an item.She said: “Towards the end of our course we were able to say where we wanted to go. Edgar and I said we don’t mind where we’re placed but we’d like to be together. They put us both in Venice.“I’m still struggling a bit with the language – Italian has a lot of grammar in it. To get by I know the basics. It’s great to have an Italian speaker with me, in Italy a lot of places are remote and they don’t speak English.”Asked how much they see of each other, Alex said: “For the first year with EasyJet you’re on a flexi-roster so you can be working for three days then have two days off. “Sometimes we’re on completely opposite shts. He could be starting at am and I can be on lates working pm to midnight. Sometimes we’ll just see each other in the crew room, say hello and that’s it. “Some weeks you pass each other but others we get time off together when we can do whatever we want. It’s part of the job.”Alex said she also tried to go back to Waringstown as much as possible to visit relatives."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8670196.1539680805!/image/image.jpg","title":"council rolls out 2018 enterprise week activities","story":"With this year#s Enterprise Week rolling out from November  to , businesses and entrepreneurs across the borough of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon are being urged to be part of this enterprising initiative.Spearheaded by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council and sponsored by Bank of Ireland, the week-long programme will see a range of inspirational and informative events take place across the borough, demonstrating council’s commitment to nurturing and developing the local economy.

We will have state of the art facilities, this will be a top rate training facility for local clubs and schools. Our kids deserve this. There will be high-tech lighting that will illuminate the pitch but won’t effect the houses near by.“It’s vital that local kids get full use of this facility, we want it filled to capacity every day with schools, we envisage coaches training kids here, Gaelic clubs, soccer clubs, after-schools activities and outdoor gym classes. I believe this will transform the community.”Work is due to begin in December andall goes according to plan it should be completed by the end of March.Cllr Baker said the investment by Belfast City Council is a big boost for the community. “This area suffered badly under Lisburn Council and we are delighted now that this huge investment has come into the area. We have a population of just under , people here and they deserve nothing but first class facilities and that’s what we are delivering.“As a father and a member of the community here I would love nothing better than on a Sunday morning having a blitz here, rather than going to other parts of Belfast. I’m very excited about the future.”Sinn Féin MLA Órlaithí Flynn added: “I welcome the investment coming into the Lagmore area and commend the great work that has been done by our local Councillor in securing improvements to the White Rise pitch. The youth in this area and the wider Lagmore community will reap the benefits of important enhancements such as this.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/stevie.png","title":"new cemetery needed for belfast","story":"AN all-party Cemeteries and Crematorium Development working group that was formed a year ago to tackle the ongoing issues around burial costs and cemetery maintenance and development, say they feel that Belfast graveyards and cemeteries need a radical overhaul to keep up with demand.The Council group, who meet on a monthly basis have been tasked with finding solutions and coming up with ideas for Belfast’s cemeteries.Councillor Stevie Corr is the Sinn Féin representative on the working group.“The idea of a new cemetery for West and North Belfast has been discussed for well over a decade now and has yet to come into fruition,” he said.“The City Cemetery for all intents and purposes is full, Milltown has limited availability as well, St Joseph’s cemetery in Hannahstown is only available to parishioners. New graves are only available in Blaris cemetery when someone dies, the days of pre-planning your funeral or purchasing multiple graves are gone, we are almost at crisis point with our cemeteries.”Last year Lisburn and Castlereagh Council was tendered for a new cemetery, however the tender was unsuccessful.Cllr Corr said: “Because of boundary changes people in the Colin area are no longer Lisburn Council meaning they will have to pay more to be buried in Blaris because that cemetery  crematorium is no longer in their jurisdiction.“This is reaching crisis point, we need to have a radical approach, review and rethink around the issue of burials, cremations and cemetery spaces. We can’t wait until the day somebody is refused burial because there is no space.”With that in mind Belfast City Council have come up with the new cemeteries working group to look at these issues and to also come up with ideas around the development of our cemeteries.Cllr Corr said: “I am the party representative on the group and we are coming up with some excellent plans. For example, a new multi-million pound upgrade will be going into Roselawn crematorium.“We still need a new cemetery for North and West Belfast, it’s a very sensitive subject.“Our cemeteries are also in a position where they can become historical and tourist attractions. Look at Tom Hartley’s cemetery tours, they tell the tale of our city, from rich tombs and headstones to poor grounds where thousands of our poor are buried.“Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin is one of the main tourist attractions on the island of Ireland, it went from being a crime hotspot to being a place of beauty and interest, because it tells the tale of the formative years around the formation of the Irish Free State – our cemeteries are no dferent.“There have been books written about the City Cemetery and Milltown Cemetery.”Cllr Corr continued: “Clton Street Graveyard contains the graves of some historically signicant families, including the Dunvilles, the Sinclairs and Henry Joy McCracken, one of the leading United Irishmen. It was closed to public access approximately  years ago due to anti-social behavior. This has now decreased and the local area of Henry Place has been re-generated and a new business hub has been formed. The graveyard remains locked due to concern regarding the safety of some of the monuments. There are currently regular requests for access from tourists and visitors with a genealogical or historical interest in the graveyard.“Our social, political, economic and religious history are in our cemeteries and we need to have them as places we can use for education.“Take for example the City Cemetery heritage project, we want to bring tourists, academics and school children in as well as the local community.Our cemeteries are at their safest when people are in them, Tom Hartley’s tours have proved that.“The purpose of this working group is to give an extra edge and focus while giving the issues of graves, cemeteries and monuments the attention they deserve.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"newington boss crossan demands swift improvement","story":"Steel and Sons Cup quarter-finalSt James’ Swts vNewington Donegal Celtic ParkNEWINGTON manager, Conor Crossan has demanded an improved showing from his side as they continue the defence of their Steel and Sons Cup title with a quarter-final away trip to St James’ Swts on Saturday. The North Belfast side suffered a - home defeat to Lurgan Celtic earlier this month as they lost ground to Championship  league leaders Annagh United. Last Saturday, they bowed out of the Intermediate Cup following a - penalty shoot-out defeat at Maiden City after the game finished - after  minutes. Crossan feels Saturday’s game is the perfect opportunity for his side to rediscover their form in a competition that is close to their hearts. “We are looking forward to Saturday, hopefully we can get back to winning ways,” said Crossan.“The boys know that the performances haven’t been good enough over the last couple of weeks. “We want to stay in as many cup competitions as we can because of the way the league is structured. “It was a poor result and a poor performance against Lurgan Celtic and we had a few players out last Saturday, but it was sore getting beat on penalties.“You always want to be going into the big games on the back of a win and our form of the last two weeks hasn’t been good. “We are going into this match against a team that has won  from  so they’ll be full of confidence. It will be up to me to get the team up for this game.” As defending champions, Newington will be the favourites to progress, especially considering they play in a higher league. Yet, the progress made by St James’ Swts hasn’t gone unnoticed in the north of the city and Crossan is refusing to underestimate the challenge posed by the Swts at Donegal Celtic Park on Saturday. “People might underestimate the Ballymena League, but you have some great teams in that league – the likes of Bangor and Coagh and teams who were in Championship  in recent years,” added the Newington boss. “They are playing at a good level and they have players who have experience of playing in the Irish League. “They’ll be full of confidence and I don’t think they lost too much sleep when they drew us.“They are the type of team who relish the challenge no matter who they face. “They’ve been making noise for a while now.“They will want to build on that start and keep going, but hopefully we can put a stop to that winning run on Saturday.” St James’ Swts assistant manager Dan Murphy, meanwhile, insists the club is “buzzing” ahead of Saturday’s eagerly-anticipated clash with the defending Steel and Sons Cup champions. The West Belfast side have made an incredible start to the   season and have won all  of their game so far. The only stain on an otherwise perfect start came when they lost the points following their - win over last year’s Ballymena and Provincial League winners Glebe after it emerged one of their players should have been serving a suspension arising from a ban with his previous club. St James’ are aiming to go a step further than they managed in last season’s competition when they bowed out after losing - to Linfield Swts in the last eight.  “The whole club is buzzing, we know how big this competition is. We got to this stage last year and we lost out to Linfield Swts,” said Murphy. “We were - down and we gave a penalty away and went - down. “We got a goal back and we threw everything at them to get an equaliser and we make a silly mistakes and they broke and made it -. “It was a bit gut-wrenching. We wanted to go on further in the competition and we are just hoping to go one step further this year and make it into the semi-finals.” Last season, the Swts challenged for promotion from the Ballymena and Provincial League Premier Division, but fell short at the end of a busy campaign. This season, they are, strictly speaking, unbeaten on the pitch and Murphy feels that is in no small part because of the summer signings made by manager Damien McStravick. “Last year, we knew we had a good team and we were playing good football,” said Murphy. “Towards the end of the season, it was just injuries and suspensions that killed us.“Our squad was a bit light and a few boys had to play with knocks. “During the summer, we made some brilliant signings thanks to Damien McStravick. He met boys who had played at a higher level and sold them on the ethos of the club. “We ended up with a smashing squad. “We kept all the players we had last year and we’ve added a bit more quality to it. “The new boys have all bought into what the club is about and they are enjoying their football.” This Saturday, St James’ bid to continue their incredible start to the season by dumping the holders out of the Steel and Sons Cup. However, Murphy is expecting a tough battle from the North Belfast side given that Newington went on to defeat Linfield Swts in last year’s Christmas Day final at Seaview. “They are a very dogged team and they work hard for each other. They are able to take their chances when they get them,” added the St James’ Swts assistant. “We also know they are the champions of this competition and they’re no going to let go of it easily. “We played them in pre-season and we won that game -, but they signed well after that game. “We know we are going to be up against it and it will be a real test. “We have to be at our best, but the way we are playing, I thinkwe show up on the day, we can win the game.” Newington will be without the suspended duo of Gavin Taggart and Kevin Bradley for Saturday’s clash while St James’ Swts are set to be at full strength for the quarter-final tie."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"sf%e2%80%88asked to take","story":"ALLIANCE South Belfast MLA Paula Bradshaw has called for the removal of the election-style anti-Brexit posters erected by Sinn Féin in parts of the constituency.

The company behind the plan, Blue Star Line, said the new ship will include all the latest safety and technical equipment to make it fit for the st Century seas. Originally the Titanic was owned by the White Star Line.Reports claim there will be nine decks and  staterooms that can accommodate , passengers and  crew members, the same as the Belfast original.First, second, and third class tickets will be available, just like the original and there will be a swimming pool, gymnasiums, and Turkish bath.However, the engines will be diesel-powered rather than coal fired but the iconic smoke stacks will remain. Clive Palmer, the Autralian business man behind the project said the maiden voyage will take travellers from Southampton to New York on the same route as the ill-fated  voyage. Then it will cruise around the world from Dubai hoping to \"enchant\" passengers with the style of the old world mixed with the new.It has been rumoured the ship will first lt anchor in , however, the company has said it is still in the early stages of planning and due diligence for the plan. “Millions have dreamt of sailing on her, seeing her in port and experiencing her unique majesty. Titanic II will be the ship where those dreams come true,” Clive Palmer said, thereported. A computer generated graphic of the new Titanic II.“The ship will follow the original journey, carrying passengers from Southampton to New York, but she will also circumnavigate the globe, inspiring and enchanting people while attracting unrivalled attention, intrigue and mystery in every port she visits.\"Speculation over the project has gathered pace over recent weeks after a series of announcements from Blue Star Line. On Tuesday it announced it would base its European office in Paris as opposed to London which will open in March .The photograph shows bodies in sacks piled three high on the deck of the CS Mackay Bennett, before being tipped overboard as the ships priest conducts a service. Photo issued by Henry Aldridge and Son.“It is of little use having a European headquarters outside Europe,’’ Mr Palmer said.Mr Palmer confirmed discussions were underway between project’s World Director and suppliers and consultants world-wide to get Titanic II underway as soon as possible.And last week the company announced the appointment of a European director - who had originally been part of the project in  - for the project who will be responsible for commercial negotiations, recruitment and training for Titanic II, the company said. At the end of September, the company released a new technical specications update in a YouTube video. Palmer was a former elected member of the Australian parliament and has announced he is standing again for election under the slogan \"Make Australia Great Again\". He has a dinosaur theme park in Australia and the Titanic project plan has been described as his \"pet project\". A second Titanic II is also being built in a theme park in China.

Last year the department announced the process to appoint a contractor had been completed.But the tender award was delayed after a legal challenge was mounted by a BAM Civil Ltd and FP McCann Ltd, a joint venture who narrowly failed to win the contract.In August the court held that the departments decision making and evaluation processes had been legally flawed.A further hearing on remedies then focused on what should happen next.Lawyers for BAM-FP McCann contended a declaration should be made that it would be lawful for the department to award the York Street Interchange contract to the joint venture plaintf. Counsel representing the department resisted such an outcome, arguing that the matter should be left for his clients reconsideration.Declining to make the declaration sought by the plaintf, Mr Justice Maguire said: \"Such an order seems to the court to be unnecessary in a context where the court is setting aside the award of the contract, as in this case.\"The contract award is theof the department, not the court, he added.Unless the main judgment is appealed, the outcome raises the possibility of the procurement being re-run.Turning to the issue of costs, the judge made an award against the Department for % of the plaintfs fees in the case."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland could face decision over clock changes same as london or dublin","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Investigators homed in on a postal facility in Opa-locka, where they believe some of the packages originated.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Hillary Clinton Homeland Security secretary Kirstjen Nin acknowledged that some of packages originated in Florida.New details about the devices came as the mail bomb scare spread nationwide, drawing investigators from dozens of federal, state and local agencies in the effort to identy one or more perpetrators.The targets have also included CNN and Democrat Maxine Waters of Calornia. A common thread is their critical words for Mr Trump and his frequent criticism in .The president claimed on Friday that he was being blamed for the mail bombs, complaining in a tweet: “Funny how lowly rated CNN, and others, can criticize me at will, even blaming me for the current spate of Bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September th and the Oklahoma City bombing, yet when I criticize them they go wild and scream, ‘it’s just not Presidential!”Funny how lowly rated CNN, and others, can criticize me at will, even blaming me for the current spate of Bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September th and the Oklahoma City bombing, yet when I criticize them they go wild and scream, “it’s just not Presidential!”— Donald J. TrumpOctober , Details suggested a pattern — that the items were packaged in manila envelopes, addressed to prominent Trump critics and carried US postage stamps. The devices are being examined by technicians at the FBI’s forensic lab in Quantico, Virginia.The packages stoked nationwide tensions as voters prepare to vote on November  to determine control of Congress — a campaign both major political parties have described in near-apocalyptic terms.Even with the sender still unknown, politicians from both parties used the threats to condemn a toxic political climate and lay blame.“A very big part of the Anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely  and inaccurate reporting of the Mainstream Media that I refer to as Fake News,” Mr Trump said on Twitter.“It has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description. Mainstream Media must clean up its act, FAST!”Mr Brennan fired back: “Stop blaming others. Look in the mirror. Your inflammatory rhetoric, insults, lies,  encouragement of physical violence are disgraceful. Clean up your act….try to act Presidential.”Stop blaming others. Look in the mirror. Your inflammatory rhetoric, insults, lies,  encouragement of physical violence are disgraceful. Clean up your act....try to act Presidential. The American people deserve much better. BTW, your critics will not be intimidated into silence. https:t.co cSqNiuUo— John O. BrennanOctober , Robert De Niro, another target of the packages, said: “There’s something more powerful than bombs, and that’s your vote. People must vote!”The Oscar-winning actor said he is thankful no one was hurt, and thanked “the brave and resourceful security and law enforcement people for protecting us”.He has been one of Mr Trump’s most vocal critics, dropping an expletive insult at this year’s Tony Awards and also apologising to Canadians for the “idiotic behaviour of my president”.The explosive devices were packed in envelopes with bubble-wrap interiors bearing six American flag stamps and theaddress of Florida representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee.The bombs seized on Wednesday were about in long and packed with powder and broken glass, according to a law enforcement official who viewed X-ray images.

But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos current focus is on firming up the boundaries of the proposed geopark with those involved in compiling the designation confident it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.Officials believe geoparks have a signicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process. But the global geopark brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.Further information on the geopark proposal is available via Facebook on Geotourism in Mourne, Gullion and Strangford or for specic queries email geopark@nmandd.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Gold for James at cyclo cross race in Belfast  ","story":"A LARGE number of Dromara riders competed in round five of the Ulster Cyclo-Cross series in Musgrave park on Sunday, the event organised by VC Glendale.It was a rainy start to the day, but it did not dampen the spirits of Dromararsquos young riders.Hugh Hetherington, Tom Cowan and Anna Armstrong were the first to take to the course in the U- race.

Delamont already has stunning picturesque walks, a childrenrsquos adventure playground, miniature railway and cafe, but more investment is needed to enhance what it has to offer.Cllr Walker said creating new attractions will increase the parkrsquos profile and attract even more visitors.He added: ldquoI have always argued Delamont offers massive tourist potential and that with some imaginative thinking and new investment, it can rival any country park in Ireland.

It is vitally important the St Dillonrsquos Avenue site is used for the benefit of the community,he continued.ldquoAny future planning applications will involve a consultation process that enables the public to have their say on the future development.The Downpatrick councillor suggested that given the current parking and traffic flow issues at Edward Street, there was a need for an ultra-modern primary school in the town to continue to provide a high standard of childrenrsquos education.He declared: ldquoI believe the St Dillonrsquos Avenue site would be ideal for a new school development and will be writing to the Education Authority to ask that they investigate the sitersquos potential for such a development.ldquoI will also be asking Newry, Mourne and Down Council to review options for this site as it could also be ideal for other community facilities.A spokesman for the diocese of Down and Connor confirmed on Monday that the former St Patrickrsquos Boys Primary School site will be placed on the market for sale.He added: ldquoThe diocesan Trustees are legally bound to act in the best interests of the charity and to consider all offers made through the public market process.ldquoIn the case of sales of former school sites, the diocesan Trustees are required toa substantial percentage of the sale price to the Department of Education in Northern Ireland.A number of people have taken to social media in the wake of news that the former school site is to be sold and expressed concern about the impact its redevelopment could have on an already heavily congested part of the town.Several have suggested a new school should be built on the site, while others believe its redevelopment could have problems securing planning permission given the topography of this part of the town and traffic congestion in nearby Edward Street.A number of people said they would not be in favour of any form of retail development at the former school site..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Staff being followed home by unruly teenagers  ","story":"BUSINESS owners in Downpatrick have revealed that some members of staff have been followed home by unruly teenagers who are terrorising the town centre with their behaviour.The worrying revelation came during a meeting held last week to discuss mounting concern about increasing anti-social behaviour in St Patrickrsquos Square, the Grove shopping centre area and other parts of the town.Within  hours of last weekrsquos meeting concluding, a firework was thrown at a customer as he left a hot food bar in St Patrickrsquos Square, narrowly missing him.Business owners fear someone is going to have to be seriously injured or worse before the ongoing trouble is addressed.They say the anti-social behaviour cannot be allowed to continue in the area, or in any other part of Downpatrick, and insist there must be immediate action to be bring the trouble to an end.Last weekrsquos meeting between local police, business owners and elected representatives was organised by Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright, who has revealed there were a number of frank exchanges, with all those in attendance describing the talks as ldquoworthwhile.He also confirmed another session involving the parties is due to be held in mid-November.A businessman said it was ldquoentirely unsatisfactory that people who were trying to do a dayrsquos work should be terrorised by  and  year-old children operating outside the control of their parents and the police.ldquoIt is now getting dficult to recruit staff in Downpatrick town centre, he revealed.ldquoWe do not have these problems in Newcastle or Ardglass. Self-employed retailers pay tax and rates in an expectation that the government and Newry, Mourne and Down Council will ensure that the environment in our town centres is suitable for business and attractive to customers. We expect this situation to be turned around rapidly and not deteriorate further.During the meeting, business owners complained about having their staff harassed and having to close early, losing trade due to anti-social behaviour.Vehicles in the car park at the rear of the Grove shopping centre have been damaged, with business owners and local residentsrsquo group representatives expressing concern that police were not doing more to help bring about prosecutions.Residentsrsquo group members complained that they could no longer let their children play near the Grove or St Patrickrsquos Square, an area which they argued should be a major attraction in the town for adults and children alike.Fears were also expressed that this part of Downpatrick was now becoming ldquoout of bounds for the decent people in the town in the evenings.Cllr Enright said local police welcomed the opportunity to listen first-hand to what businesses and residentsrsquo associations had to say and agreed to meet met with them again next month to track progress in dealing with these issues.He also thanked South Down MLA Colin McGrath for attending the meeting and fellow MLA Emma Rogan for sending her apologies and confirming she will be at the November meeting.ldquoIt was clear that senior police officers were not aware of the scale of the problems in the town over the past nine months, Cllr Enright said.ldquoStatistics of reported crime did not reflect what was going on, with business owners surprised at the low number of prosecutions.ldquoThere appears to be a systemic problem in dealing with youth offending in the Public Prosecutions Service which insists on up to five repetitions of so-called lsquoyouth engagementrsquo by the police before considering bringing forward a prosecution.Cllr Enright suggested this left some of the worst culprits with little respect for or fear of the police.He confirmed that MLAs have been asked to raise this particular issue with the PPS, alongside concerns of people waiting up to  minutes to get through on the PSNIrsquos  number to report incidents.He said concern was also expressed about how reports of assaults, vandalism and intimidation were followed though, with some business owners keen for police to search young people whom they suspect of carrying fireworks.He added: ldquoThere was also criticism of the lsquoinvisibilityrsquo of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos community safety wardens, with some suggestions that robust action against anti-social behaviour issues at the Model Farm area may have been partly responsible for transferring the trouble to the town centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Traffic ‘worse than ever’ amid calls for filter lane  ","story":"ROADS officials have been asked to address mounting concern about traffic snarl-ups at a busy junction on the outskirts of Downpatrick.Local people and politicians have been campaigning for a new filter lane at the Ballynoe Road junction with the Killough Road which is dealing with a signicant increase in traffic at peak periods.Vehicles can be queued from the junction as far back as Bishops Brae in the morning with the upsurge attributed to the number of organisations now based at the Downshire Civic Centre.The public sector campus is home to Newry, Mourne and Down Council, the PSNI, Housing Executive and Fire and Rescue Service. The Downe Hospital is also part of the sprawling estate.Mrs Olwyn McColl, who lives at Vianstown Heights, says there has been a major increase in traffic using the junction over the past year and is urging roads officials to address the problem.She says there is available land to provide a filter lane which has the potential to signicantly reduce tailbacks.ldquoThe problem is getting worse and sitting in a tailback, especially in the mornings when parents are taking children to school and people are heading to work, can be very frustrating, she said.ldquoDue to the current layout of the junction, drivers wishing to turn left at the junction have to wait until the traffic in front of them clears. A new filter lane would help reduce waiting times.Mrs McColl said it would appear that an increasing number of drivers heading from the Newcastle direction in the morning were now using the Ballynoe and Bishops Brae roads, which was contributing to the congestion.ldquoThe problem is  times worse than it ever was, there is no doubt about that, she continued. ldquoThings are bad now and they could get worse when the nearby new civic amenity site opens early next year.ldquoMany of my neighbours share my concern and it would be greatroads officials could use the land which is available to provide a new filter lane. It would make such a dference.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said he shared the frustration of those campaigning for the filter lane which has not yet been delivered.ldquoIn addition to the nearby Downshire Civic Centre, we have a large shopping centre, a nursery and primary school, leisure facility and very busy MOT centre which is all adding to the build-up of traffic at peak periods, he said.ldquoWhile I am delighted Downpatrick has a major public sector campus, we need to ensure the roads system can cope with the additional volume of traffic its provision has generated. An important step would be upgrading the Ballynoe Road junction with the Killough Road.Cllr Curran believes a filter lane would not cost a signicant amount of money to provide and would go some way towards easing the current problem.ldquoThis particular junction is extremely busy in the morning, with a long tail back of vehicles a common occurrence. The creation of a filter lane allowing drivers wishing to turn left out of the Ballynoe Road would help reduce congestion, he said. lsquoThe provision of a new filter lane is a no brainer.Cllr Curran said that while roads officials previously identied a scheme to provide a new filter lane, they subsequently decided that, due to the close proximity of the Glebetown Drive housing area, a new slip road would cause ldquoroad safety issues.He added: ldquoI firmly believe that the time has come to revisit this particular proposal.

It was a conflict in which his uncle, Charlie Dunbar had been persuaded to volunteer for ldquoto fight for his religion.But the experience of what Charlie saw left a deep scar and changed him forever.Adrian was the focus of the ldquoWho Do You Think You Are  on RTE on Sunday evening, and it was a fascinating watch.As we all get a little older, many of us seem to have an increasing interest in our own past, especially our own family history. In Ireland, family is still a powerfully symbolic and emotive part of our DNA, and the programme often reveals some interesting context for inidual celebrities.As Adrian said: ldquoAll of us are interested in our backgrounds where we come from and what yoursquore born into. Those things shape who you are.Therersquos no doubt that we will have been particularly interested in Dunbarrsquos journey into his background after all hersquos one of our own.But the interest in the programme went much deeper and much more meaningful. With several little vignettes showing the complexity of identity in Ireland.A word used frequently these days in all sorts of context is binary, meaning only two parts or ision into two groups. Itrsquos particularly apt to the world view of Northern Ireland. Protestant equals Unionist British, Catholic equals Nationalist Irish, would be the perception.It isnrsquot the case, of course, and shouldnrsquot be. But the troubled th century in Ireland, particularly the last quarter of it, saw both groups driven further into a silo mentality.Irsquove always felt that there was a certain irony in the fact that a violent Republican campaign to achieve Irish unity did, actually, create more ision.Now, the current circumstance of changing demographics in the north combined with the Brexit crisis are focusing on identity as we go forward.Adrian Dunbar is a clever inidual and, indeed, a perceptive one and the story of his family background in the programme was punctuated with comments which should evoke some thought about the past, present and future.Adrian was brought up in Enniskillen in a mainly Nationalist area, though for a few years the family moved to Portadown, Garvaghey Road in fact, where he recalls loyalist paramilitaries parading close by in a show of strength to people in Nationalist areas to know their place. The memory of two communities living apart is eloquently described by Adrian as ldquosocial engineering to suit sectarianism. While Enniskillen was much less hostile, the time, the place and the neighbourhood environment where he and his siblings grew up were far from ideal recruiting ground for the British military.And yet, on his mother Pauline Camplingrsquos side, there is an incredibly strong link and a history of service going back three generations.Adrian visited St. Michaelrsquos Church where Frankie Roofe was able to give him intriguing detail of his great-great-grandfather coming to Enniskillen as a soldier from England and converting from Church of England to Catholicism.Recounting some of the history of the Inniskilling Fusiliers, when the regiment ldquoheld the line for Wellington at Waterloo about half of the  men were killed, Adrian himself pointed out that about a third of the men spoke only in Irish. Itrsquos a quirk of how history develops that hundreds of years later the native tongue of men who died serving the British Army is somehow portrayed controversially as anti-British.Adrianrsquos grandfather, Walter Campling served in the Inniskillings, and three of his sonshad distinguished service in the British military in world war.The programme shows Adrian coming home to Enniskillen to discuss this with his brother Liam.Interestingly, though, Liam said that because they were brought up in Nationalist areas they didnrsquot go round talking about their ancestorsrsquo British military service. And Adrian himself said that the idea that he and his siblings would have followed the tradition of their three previous generations had gone.Such service to the British military by Catholic Nationalist families was common, as a look at the names of both communities on the Enniskillen War Memorial show.Yet, it was a feature not talked about in recent history and illustrates the complexities of identity that weave their way through our communities.Conversely, of course, the perception suggests that all Protestants consider themselves ldquoas British as Finchley and thatrsquos just as much an oversimplication. Surely the two identities donrsquot slot handily into their own homogeneous monolith There were a couple of telling moments, I thought, in the Dunbar programme.His uncle Charlie, whom Adrian remembers fondly dishing out sixpences, had been convinced in the late s to join the Irish brigade fighting for the fascist Franco in the Spanish Civil War under the guise of fighting to preserve the Catholic religion against the evils of Communism.On hearing some of the shocking atrocities that his uncle witnessed, Adrian reflected: ldquoPeople do a lot of things in the name of religion, donrsquot they  Sadly, as we know only too well in the north.And he added: ldquoThe combination of religion and politics is not a good one.And there was another line which struck me. Adrian was shown a photo of Queen Victoriarsquos state visit to Dublin in  when the city was still under British rule.He was shown the regimental band, including his grandfather, and considering the protest and fight for independence in Ireland which was about to change everything, Adrian referred to his grandfather and other comrades as being ldquoon the wrong side of history.A century on from that Royal visit, the country saw a war of independence, a civil war, decades of conflict in this part of the island and more recently more Royal visits by the current Queen both north and south of the Border.And now itrsquos a pertinent question to ask what side of history the ious identities are on now.The confusion and uncertainty over future membership of the European Union has thrown the subject of identity to the forefront, and there is the suggestionthat the issue of Irish unity is firmly on the agenda.To be honest, I donrsquot think evena Border poll was held that it would result in unity just now.But herersquos a thing. On Sky News last week, journalist Adam Boulton was interviewing Scottish Deputy First Minister, John Swiney and his opening question was: ldquoWhat do you think is more likely to happen first, a united Ireland or an independent Scotland The fact that he asked it seriously is telling, as is Swineyrsquos serious reply which began, ldquoItrsquos a close run thinghellip.In the current political climate, the DUP say they are engaged in a ldquobattle for the Union. Aside from the fact that all politics here seems to boil down to that, in this case the DUP may well be right.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I have been moved to tears by so many honest and heart-wrenching accounts.I canrsquot even begin to imagine the pain of losing a child at any stage of le it is inconceivable for those who have never suffered such a loss. But sadly, itrsquos more common that we imagine.It is estimated that one in four pregnancies in the UK ends in miscarriage, defined as a loss of pregnancy up to a gestation of  weeks and  days. A loss after that is considered stillbirth and in  there were , stillbirths ndash thatrsquos nine babies stillborn every day ndash and , neonatal deaths.As part of baby loss awareness week, bereaved parents, along with their families and friends have been coming together, joining with others across the world, to commemorate their babiesrsquo lives.The campaign was started  years ago and yet the fact remains that in our society, it is really only in the last couple of years that we have started to talk openly about baby loss.Indeed it remains a subject that few of us feel completely comfortable navigating. I will admit that before I became a mother three years ago, I had conversations with women who lost their baby during pregnancy and I know I didnrsquot handle those conversations very well.Maybe there isnrsquot a right thing to say, but I recognise now that that I, like so many of us do, shied away from much,any, conversation. Despite knowing that the phrase ldquoIrsquom so sorry was lacking, I refrained from empathising any further or asking questions because I felt I didnrsquot have the right words, I was afraid of saying too much, of saying the wrong thing, of being insensitive, and most of all I was afraid of upsetting that mother.But what I have learned since is that many women ndash and men ndash who have said goodbye to a child in pregnancy or during birth, want to talk about the loss. They donrsquot want you to cross the street to avoid them. Many want you to askthat baby had a name, or when his or her birthday would have been. Of course, itrsquos hard to know any of this unless we have the opportunity to have open and transparent conversations about such a sensitive and dficult issue.Talking about the subject of death is still quite taboo in our society, particularly when it is the death of a baby. But we shouldnrsquot underestimate the importance of talking about baby loss. Not only does it help those who are grieving, helping them to process what has happened, to stop blaming themselves and feel less alone in what can be an emotional and physical rollercoaster, it also gives us all the opportunity to develop the tools and language to discuss this emotive subject with greater understanding, helping to normalise something that is common - and indeed normal - but not talked about enough.Itrsquos ironic and perhaps a cruel reality of social norms that women are encouraged not to tell people about pregnancy until after the first trimester when sickness abates and the risk of miscarriage is greatly reduced. Surely the early stage is when pregnant women need compassion and understanding. The expectation to remain silent during the first  weeks of pregnancy means many couples faced with loss are left to grieve without the support that they need. After all, it doesnrsquot matter whether the loss of a baby is at eight weeks gestation or  weeks, the trauma felt by those who loved and wanted each child are the same. They had imagined their new family they had probably considered whether that baby was a boy or a girl and all sorts of other exciting plans.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This campaign is aided and supported by a number of the Prime Ministerrsquos own Conservative Party members.Sadly, what we are witnessing from many sections is an anti-British position rather than a debate based on any sound principles as to why there are not more pragmatic positions on providing a good deal for everyone involved.As someone who voted to remain within the EU I am extremely disturbed at the antagonistic stance being displayed by the European Union towards the democratic wish of the majority of the citizens of the United KingdomThis has brought me to thinking thatthis is their attitude in general to the UK, then we are better out of this vastly over regulated group. What is even more surprising is the attitude of the Irish Government. They are our near neighbours and have signicant trade with the UK, but are certainly making no attempt to have a conciliatory attitude to finding a positive deal.Given the potential economic loss to the Republic of Ireland, Irsquom curious as to why they are not attempting to use their influence, by their public utterances and in discussions with other EU members, to provide a more assuaging attitude to the situation. This I feel would be more conducive to sustaining beneficial trading relations between the two nations post Brexit.Thankfully the United Kingdom has a strong economy which has supported and assisted many smaller nations, including the Republic of Ireland in the EU for many years.It is hugely positive that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, the fth largest economy in the world. Moreover the UK is a signicant influencer throughout the world and a society that is a leader in freedom of democracy.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

David Sterling yesterday ed to the RHI Inquiry for his fourth day of evidence The inquiry’s  days of evidence have been devastating for the reputation of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, exposing failures across the organisation and a culture in which civil servants acquiesced in breaking their own rules in order to please Stormont ministers.On the inquiry’s penultimate day of evidence, Mr Sterling said: “I have to admit that multiple mistakes, multiple failings were made and that we should have done better.“As permanent secretary in the Department of Finance, when I attended the Public Accounts Committee two years ago I offered an apology on behalf of my time at the Department for Enterprise, Trade and Investment.“But I think it’s only right as head of the service I should recognise that the extent of the failings have been such that I should offer again, without hesitation, a profound and unequivocal apology for the mistakes that have been made.“And I want to take this opportunity to make a promise on behalf of the NICS board that we will do everything possible to make sure that nothing like this ever happens again.”Mr Sterling also gave a personal assurance that any action recommended by the inquiry would be implemented “quickly and fairly”.Inquiry chairman Sir Patrick Coghlin interjected to sharply remind Stormont’s top mandarin that he would have to deal with “the fact that this is not the first time” that these mistakes or omissions have happened, with a series of damning Audit Office reports having previously exposed some of the practices which led to the RHI scandal, including the failure to keep records and a refusal to believe whistle-blowers.After outlining past failures to deliver on assurances that “lessons have been learnt”, Sir Patrick told Mr Sterling: “So we do need to be convinced that third time round something’s going to be effective.”Mr Sterling said he agreed and acknowledged that there had been a repeat of behaviour from past scandals which ought to have ended, and went on to set out a series of bureaucratic steps which he said had been taken or were being worked on in an attempt to prevent a recurrence.However, he acknowledged that past reports commented not on an absence of rules but on a culture where those rules were not adhered to – something he said had to change.He endorsed the comments of the Comptroller and Auditor General that civil servants should treat public money asit was their own.Mankilled in NI road traffic collision Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"However, he insisted that the public should not view every civil servant through the prism of RHI, highlighting that thousands of civil servants work with diligence and integrity – and have done so in particularly trying circumstances for more than a year and a half in the absence of any form of ministerial direction.Mr Sterling went on to give a second apology to civil servants for the fact that he had played a role in the scandal – in that he was the most senior official in Arlene Foster’s department at the time when the scheme was set up without cost controls.Although Mr Sterling was not personally responsible for drawing up the scheme, he accepted responsibility as the most senior civil servant within the department at the time of that key failure.He said that as someone involved in the scheme he wanted to “offer an apology to the rest of the civil service who no doubt are having to deal with the fact that the credibility of the organisation as a whole has been called into question – unfairly in my view”.However, Mr Sterling accepted some people will question what they are hearing: “I can understand that people may be cynical or sceptical about what I am saying – but I would want to give you assurance that we are very serious about this.”try catch     .               ..

A petition has also been sent in to the National Assembly.Many local residents from Penarth, Barry, Cardf and further afield have shared their frustrations over the sediment being dumped off the coast.Penarth man Anthony Slaughter, who is the Cardf and the Vale Green Partyrsquos campaigns officer and also the chairman of Gwyrddio Penarth Greening, said: ldquoWe understand and share local residentsrsquo concerns over the dumping of this potentially hazardous mud in the Severn estuary.ldquoIn addition to any possible risks associated with this waste we are opposed to any action that enables the development of the Hinkley C nuclear power station.ldquoAs the only political party in Wales that is completely and unambiguously opposed to all nuclear power we do not support the plans for either Hinkley C or Wylfa B power stations.Even rock musician and anti-nuclear campaigner Cian Ciaran, who is the keyboard player for the band Super Furry Animals, has come out against the matter.The musician lodged papers at the High Court seeking an injunction to stop the dumping and said that the ldquonuclear establishment cannot be trusted.ldquoAbsence of evidence is not the evidence of absence, and therefore the precautionary principle should dictate a rethink, said Mr Ciaran. ldquoA rethink by our politicians and policy makers to do the right think by its people.ldquoThe implications and consequences of this dredging could be far reaching.South Wales Central AM Neil McEvoy has set up a CrowdFunder page to raise pound, for the protest as he believes there may be a judicial review.He said: ldquoOur initial target of pound, was so that we could carry out an interim injunction in order to temporarily halt the dumping of the Hinkley nuclear reactor mud.ldquoHowever, in order to stop the mud dump for good we will need toto court, which could lead to a judicial review. Judicial reviews are very costly and so extra funding will be required. This will be used for court fees and to put together a strong legal challenge against the mud being dumped in Wales.ldquoIrsquom concerned because I do not believe enough testing has been done. Wersquore talking about mud being dredged from outside a nuclear reactor.Energy company EDF are dredging the mud ahead of building two new nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point C in Somerset. The company said the dredging is necessary ahead of drilling that needs to be done ahead of works for the new reactors.       ,params: .pushEnvironmental watchdog Natural Resources Walesgranted the licence for the dumping and insist that it is safe.A spokesman for NRW said: ldquoEvery element of the application was considered thoroughly including testing of the sediment from the dredge sites by independent experts in accordance with international standards and guidelines, and advice from health experts. The results showed the material was suitable for disposal at sea.ldquoWersquove tried to reassure people that the proposed activity will not harm people or the environment.EDF says the dredging of mud from the seabed off the Hinkley Point C site is necessary ahead of drilling six vertical shafts for the cooling water system for the new nuclear power station.However, those against the dredging say it could pose health risks.Max Wallis of Friends of the Earth, Penarth and Barry said: ldquoThe NRW up to recently stated the EIA for dumping had been covered in the EIA for the jetty development in Somerset, covered by the Environment Agency but this was contradicted by CEFASrsquos statement of , Nevertheless the NRWissued the  license.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.

It’s through getting to know our clients and their business that we can best share our knowledge and advice around the type of financial support they need.“At First Trust Bank, having listened to what our customers wanted, we invested in six new business centres across Northern Ireland to support fast, local decision making. We also established a Small Business Centre to meet the needs of our smaller customers. Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought. The loans provided are expected to be complementary to existing sources of finance, including banks, trade finance sources and equity investors.”Some of the companies availing of the finance include Belfast-based BLK BOX Fitness, which secured £, to grow its online  and boost exports, along with Fermanagh gin-maker Boatyard Distillery.Meanwhile, the BGF was set up in  with £.bn and has since backed close to  companies. Last year, BGF was the UK’s top institutional investor and ranked the seventh most active private investor in the world by number of investments. Upstream is a Belfast-based alternative finance company specialising in SME funding, and has also now introduced a trade finance option for clients. The market-first solution unlocks the ability for businesses to finance their working capital needs end to end, from supplier to buyer.Niall Harkin is director of customer journeys at Danske Bank. He says “personal engagement is still really important” when dealing with small and medium-sized firms looking at expansion.“That’s why last year we introduced a team of  dedicated small business advisers back in to key branches across Northern Ireland, giving customers access to expertise in their local area to discuss business plans and explore funding options,” he said.“Meanwhile, teams of experienced relationship managers supported by specialists in areas such as cash management, markets and trade finance, support our larger SME customers.“At the same time, we’re investing heavily in our digital offering, and recently added the capability for SMEs to get lending decisions in a matter of minutes in ious situations. ‘future financing’ makes the whole credit process much easier for our customers. For an overdraft, we’ve seen approvals in four minutes and access to money well within  hours. “In the future, customers should be able to go online and request an overdraft increase on a smartphone at home.”But aside from the financial support, businesses here can also turn to the support from hubs. That includes Ormeau Baths’s Barclays Eagle Labs – which is located at the south Belfast listed building – and the Ignite NI Propel Pre-Accelerator. The options are out there and available for companies wishing to take that next step, whether traditional banking or alternative streams are the way to go.

The Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said a \"shudder\" was going through the industry, which comprises  hotels and , bedrooms. In Belfast, , rooms were added over the past year, thanks to new construction of six new venues, including the Hampton by Hilton and the Grand Central, and extensions to two existing hotels. The federation said the market was going through a \"stutter\" with occupancy and room rates going down. \"It is important to note that demand for hotel rooms has grown over the last year, but it hasnt kept pace with the increase in supply,\" it added. A separate report by PwC put the cost of an overnight stay in a Belfast hotel at £.

On day two of industry event Hospitality Exchange, federation chief executive Janice Gault said: \"Market snapshots indicate a stormy  with volatility in the market. Overall analysis shows a reduction in occupancy levels and a decline in rate.\" She said Northern Ireland needed a new tourism selling point - suggesting something like Failte Irelands Wild Atlantic Way promotion, but for the north west and west coast. \"Demand is growing, but this needs to be accelerated with a number of interventions, including increased promotion, a bigger marketing budget and a proposition of scale for Northern Ireland along the lines of the Wild Atlantic Way,\" she added. \"Measures like this will allow the market to adapt to and absorb new supply. There has been a seismic change and a response of equal measure is required to create new business.\" Ms Gault said challenges for the sector included skills and staff, as well as Brexit, which had led to \"considerable uncertainty\". \"Added to this are the issues around tax, in particular VAT, access constraints and capacity at key attractions,\" she said. \"You can see why the market is experiencing a shudder as we come to the end of an era of exceptional trading.\" And while  would be quiet in comparison to the flurry of openings in , it was \"far from dormant\", the federation said. There are to be new openings in Londonderry and Newry and Mourne, while ventures on the north coast are now \"dependent on what has become a protracted planning process\". But Ms Gault said that despite some problems, the hotel sector \"has strong prospects\". However, drawing in more visitors was paramount. \"We need to increase the size of the tourism cake to ensure that each hotel gets a good slice of business,\" she said. \"Having spent in the region of £m, the hotel sector is keen to see aon this investment and a realisation of the industrys potential.\" A full briefing on the forecast takes place this morning at a business breakfast at Hospitality Exchange, which is taking place at the Crowne Plaza, Belfast.

It means the conservation-led works to take down the top two floors of Bank Buildings can now begin. “Once these unstable elements are removed, works can take place to install a facade retention scheme,” the council said. “It will also make it possible to reduce the cordon and restore pedestrian access between Royal Avenue and Donegall Place, subject to health and safety considerations as work takes place.” It also means Primark will be able to open up once again, at the building’s new extension.
