The brand is a key in the two nation\u0027s trade warIt is said that Mr Ren, who founded the business at the age of 43, decided on the name after seeing a Communist slogan on the wall which can be translated into \u0027put China in your heart, do great things\u0027. Huawei is the abbreviation of the slogan. Mr Ren was born in rural Guizhou Province to teacher parents. When he first established Huawei, he had to work - and sleep - into a run-down factory in Shenzhen with a dozen other colleagues to develop their own telecommunication devices. With the huge success of the company, Mr Ren, now 74, is one of the richest men in China and estimated to be worth $1.8 billion (£1.42 billion) by Forbes.He has even splurged 10 billion yuan ($1.45 billion, £1.1 billion) building a fake European town for 30,000 of his workers near Shenzhen.Last August, Huawei beat Apple to become the world\u0027s second largest smartphone maker after South Korea\u0027s Samsung.          Huawei has sold more smartphones worldwide in the first quarter of this year than AppleIt has held on to the title of the world\u0027s second largest smartphone vendor in the first quarter of this year, beating Apple by 3.8 per cent in worldwide market share, according to a survey from research company Gartner. The feat was achieved by Huawei\u0027s strong performance in China, said the report.Huawei became the centre of the political tensions between China and the United States after the Trump government claimed that Huawei\u0027s gear could be used by China to spy on Americans - allegations Huawei has repeatedly denied. U.S. President Trump has banned Huawei from U.S. networks. Mr Ren\u0027s daughter Meng Wanzhou, the CFO of Huawei, was arrested in Canada in December and is facing criminal charges in the U.S.         Mr Ren\u0027s daughter Meng Wanzhou (pictured) is facing criminal charges in the U.S. Ms Meng was arrested in Vancouver by Canadian police in December under the request of Washington       Huawei has been under scrutiny in the West after Washington claimed that the firm\u0027s gear could be used by China to spy on Americans - allegations Huawei has repeatedly deniedMs Meng, widely considered as Ren\u0027s heiress, is accused of using a Hong Kong shell company to sell equipment to Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions. Huawei has denied the accusation.Last month after Beijing and Washington failed to reach an agreement on tariffs during the trade war talks, the U.S. issued orders to ban Huawei from buying parts and technologies from American suppliers. A 90-day reprieve was later issued. Then Google said it would stop providing Huawei with its license to use Android, the operating system that powers all smartphones made by the Chinese firm and its sub-brand Honor. Beijing branded the U.S. sanctions as \u0027economic bullying\u0027.  Huawei claimed that it would use its backup components and the U.S. trade sanctions would not affect the company\u0027s continuous service to its clients. A Huawei sub-brand unveiled its next generation phones last month despite the brand\u0027s uncertain future. A senior Huawei executive has also claimed that the company\u0027s own operating system could be launched as early as this autumn.  Huawei has filed a motion in the U.S. asking the court to rule on whether it is constitutional for the U.S. to implement a military spending provision that bars the government and its contractors from using its equipment.How to pronounce Huawei - YouTube"},{"url":null,"title":"Devon dog owner calls 999 Labrador cross Luis gets head stuck cat flap","story":"Share this article \u0027We carried on talking when he must have put his head through too far.

It has taken them 16 hours of precise, painstaking work to remove it from a 31-year-old female donor, who had died three days earlier. A few seconds after photographer Lynn Johnson captured this extraordinary moment, plastic surgeons in the Cleveland Clinic, Ohio, began the second phase of a procedure that lasted around 30 hours in total. When it was completed, 21 year-old Katie Stubblefield became the youngest person to receive a successful full face transplant.Taken in 2017 as part of a bigger series documenting Stubblefield’s groundbreaking surgical transformation, Katie’s New Face (2017) is one of several arresting images that have made the shortlist for the 2019 Wellcome Photography prize. The aim of the award is to celebrate “compelling imagery that captures stories of health, medicine and science”. Composed of four categories – Social Perspectives, Hidden Worlds, Medicine in Focus and Outbreaks – the shortlist perhaps predictably favours documentary and photojournalism. There are some surprises, though, not least the often beautiful abstractions of David Linstead’s microscopic image of the capillaries of a human fingertip that had been injected with red ink.From its inception, photography has been utilised to illuminate the mysteries of science and medicine, with Victorian pioneers such as Henry Fox Talbot and Auguste Adolphe Bertsch creating microscopic studies of insects and plants that often resembled ornate line drawings. As the category Hidden Worlds shows, that tradition of cutting-edge experimentation continues apace with an advanced image-mapping of HIV infection undertaken by a team of research scientists that allows us to see four representations of the same cluster of 100,000 cells from a rhesus monkey.In the same section, Simon Norfolk and Klaus Thymann’s man-altered landscape Shroud, Rhône Glacier, shows the range of approaches and the breadth of subject matter that the prize celebrates. It could be mistaken at first glance for a signature work by the conceptual land artist Christo, famous for his wrapping of monumental buildings and stretches of landscape in fabric. It is, in fact, an attempt by environmentalists to slow down the melting of the Swiss glacier, the heavy thermal material reflecting heat and light that would otherwise destroy the ice. It is an image of an undertaking that seems both surreal and slightly desperate, but the ecological context is calamitous: the Rhône Glacier has lost 350 metres (1,150ft) in ice thickness since 1856 and around 40 metres in the last decade alone.Sex and death inevitably feature and, again, it is in the Hidden Worlds category where the contrast is most dramatic. Simone Cerio’s wonderfully tender and intimate series, Love Givers, is represented by a single understated image of two semi-naked women lying on a bed. Shot from above, it suggests the casual intimacy of longterm lovers, but one of them, Debora, is the first officially sanctioned sexual assistant in Italy, whose role is “to support disabled people to explore intimate practices”.Cerio has described her project as “a physical and mental journey” that challenges our perception of the disabled and their most intimate needs. “Sexual assistance is a technique of psychophysical approach to disabled people, based on massages, kisses, visual contacts and erotic stimulation,” she elaborates on her Facebook page, “This project is an opportunity, perhaps the only way for disabled people to have such an experience.”Luis Henry Agudelo Cano has already won second place in the current affairs and news category of the 2018 Sony world photography awards for his black and white series Young People Who Beautify Death. The single image from it included here gives you a sense of its almost ghostly intimacy. Entitled The Morgue, and shot in Colombia in 2017, it is a multiple exposure of one of the young people who are trained to, as Cano puts it, “salvage the beauty of the deceased, that those who love them can always remember them”. Like his fellow students, this young man is being trained in postmortem techniques to erase the scars and wounds of violent death so that the victims of Colombia’s prolonged paramilitary-fuelled violence can be viewed by their relatives.Among the several captured moments of intimacy on display in the shortlist, perhaps the strangest is by Dmitry Kostyukov. His portrait of an elderly resident of a nursery facility near Paris is tenderly observed, but it challenges all our received notions of what constitutes care and, indeed, tenderness. The woman is cradling Zora, a robot remotely controlled by a nurse as an aid to “communication, comfort and entertainment” of the residents. Many of them ignore Zora, while others take her to their hearts as they would a child.Like many of the images that have made it on to the shortlist, Zora the robot care-giver is a glimpse of a future in which new technologies such as advanced robotics and artificial intelligence will inform our lives in ways that, until recently, we would have scarcely imagined outside of the realm of science fiction. It is these glimpses of a future that is already here that makes the selection so compelling. That, and the evidence of the deep humanity that still underlies so much of the work done by those at the forefront of advances in health, medicine and science.All the winning and shortlisted entries will go on show at the Lethaby Gallery, London, 4-13 July. Category prizes and the overall winner will be announced at a ceremony in London on 3 July 2019"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58d318e14c02783dfab5b2e98b614afa24070d18/0_143_2770_1662/master/2770.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=625264f2ab3fa34dcbb1b370e475752b","title":"werner bischof 1950s america in colour in pictures","story":"The acclaimed Magnum photographer Werner Bischof’s images of 1950s America are shown for the first time in an exhibition devoted to his USA series.

Now the online shopping giant Amazon is moving in on their turf, with a chain of pop-up shops selling everything from food and drink to electronics, beauty products and homewares.The first Clicks and Mortar shop will open in St Mary’s Gate in central Manchester on Monday and will also offer Amazon Lockers for customers to collect Amazon orders.Amazon plans to open 10 shops in total. It did not reveal the locations of the other stores but said there would be openings in Wales, Scotland, the Midlands, Yorkshire and the south-east.They are part of a year-long pilot, launched in conjunction with the small business support organisation Enterprise Nation, that Amazon says will give 100 small online businesses their first taste of a bricks and mortar presence.Online-only sellers that will feature in-store for the first time include the adult kick-scooter maker Swifty Scooters, the leather electronic device case seller Torro Cases, and the men’s skincare brand Altr for Men.Amazon will find plenty of space available for its new pop-up chain, as the high street has been hit by a wave of store closures in the past couple of years by retailers from Debenhams to Mothercare, Poundworld and Maplin. Philip Green’s 570-store retail empire, taking in Topshop, Miss Selfridge and Burton, is fighting to avert collapse, and the high street chemist Boots could close up to 200 branches over the next two years. The British Retail Consortium said last month that one in 10 shops in  town centres were lying empty.Amazon has been widely criticised for paying relatively little tax in the UK and for poor pay and conditions at its warehouses. Many retailers argue that the rise of the group, which started selling books, has been a key factor contributing to the plight of high street businesses.Spiralling business rates have hit the high street hard. This year Amazon confirmed that it pays UK business rates of only £63.4m – almost £40m less than Next, despite sales of more than double the £4bn reported by the UK fashion and home retailer.The move from Amazon follows its fellow online retailer eBay, which last month opened a pop-up store in Wolverhampton, in which 40 small businesses displayed and sold their products.In October, Amazon opened its first British fashion store, in the form of a pop-up in Baker Street, central London, to seek shoppers’ views on its clothing ranges, prices and store experience.In the past two years the company has opened a physical space with a range of retail partners to promote deals related to its annual 10-day Black Friday sale.There is still speculation about whether Amazon Go, a checkout-free grocery store concept, will be rolled out internationally. The first  was opened in Seattle, Washington, last January and there are now 11 Amazon Go stores in the US.In 2017, the company paid $13.7bn for the high-end supermarket chain Whole Foods Market, which has seven stores in London.Doug Gurr, Amazon UK’s country manager, said: “Amazon is committed to supporting the growth of small businesses, helping them boost the economy and create jobs across the UK. Small businesses are one of our most important customer groups.”Amazon said it was also helping to create more than 150 full-time apprenticeships at small online businesses through a new £1m apprenticeship fund “to help increase their productivity and boost online sales”.“Our intention is to help small businesses succeed by combining the best elements of online and high street retail. This new concept will provide small businesses with the space, technology and support to experience physical retail for the first time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/703880263ebbc1f33012b148d5dad8f846aa0cba/143_0_3520_2112/master/3520.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4dd2054c988978da7f6cc597abe1005","title":"love island itv contestants social media","story":"Contestants should be given more advice on dealing with social media after leaving the villa, as well as career supportAs a doctor working in a busy hospital A\u0026ampE in south-east London, I thought spending the summer of 2018 in the sun as a contestant on the ITV reality show Love Island wouldn’t be all that difficult. Sun, sea, attractive people and, best of all, no mobile phones – how hard could it be? It turns out I couldn’t have been more wrong. If the contestants in the new series are expecting a relaxed summer of sun by the pool, they are in for a shock.From the moment my phone was taken off me as part of the pre-show preparations, I realised it was not going to be a walk in the park. There would be no speaking to friends or family or knowing what was happening in the outside world. Then came the dreaded entrance to the Love Island villa, in which the men walk in, one by one, to a line of female contestants who are waiting, ready to step forward for you, or stay in line and reject you. My turn came and I stood there shaking as my worst fears were realised: no one stepped forward. I felt sick and ashamed knowing that very soon, millions of people would see my humiliation – including all my family, friends and colleagues.The days that followed were some of the hardest of my life. My Love Island journey lasted just short of eight weeks, in which time I experienced countless highs and lows. I had some of the best moments of my life: I made some great friends and there was lots of fun and laughter. But I also experienced some dark times. From learning to live with 10 or more strangers in one bedroom to the stress and anxiety of other contestants constantly trying to steal your partner, it’s far from an easy ride.One of the hardest things for me was being unable to speak to my family and friends, when all I wanted to do was to ask for their advice and support in what was an emotional rollercoaster. There was also the inevitable anxiety about how I was being perceived on the outside. My fear was that I had no control of how I was being shown to the world. I can’t emphasise enough how powerful the edit can be. In a 24-hour period even the most angelic of characters will have good moments and bad ones. Given each daily episode is about 45 minutes long, there’s always the risk that only your bad side is shown to the viewers, and that’s the side that will be judged on social media. Scary, really.Once my time on the island was over, I opened up my Instagram account to discover it had swollen from about 200 followers to more than a million. Scrolling through, I found thousands of comments, of support and hate in equal measure. It really hit me: what had I let myself in for?I’m grateful for the kindness of the majority of the public after the show, but I’ve also faced regular trolling on social media including attacks on my physical appearance, my personality and my relationship with my girlfriend. At first I found this incredibly hard, but I’m now in a space where I find it easier to ignore the trolls. I’m lucky that returning to my career as a doctor has meant I haven’t needed to rely on becoming a celebrity influencer.But the tragic deaths of two former contestants, Mike Thalassitis and Sophie Gradon, have brought to the fore justified questions about the mental health support and aftercare available for contestants on reality TV shows such as Love Island. My experience has been a good one. I was assessed by a psychologist before, during and after my time in the villa, and was told I could ask for help at any point. In the past year, I’ve realised that the rejection I experienced on the show, and the attacks I’ve had on social media since, have affected me more than I initially thought. Shortly after Christmas, I approached ITV and asked for counselling. The sessions it organised with a psychologist have helped me adapt to life after the show. But I did have to ask for counselling, and I worry not all contestants struggling with the after-effects of the show will necessarily feel comfortable doing so.So I’m really glad to see there are some changes being made this year, including post-show counselling sessions being offered to all contestants. The production team should also make participants fully aware of the risks, as well as potential positives, of taking part, so people are more likely to make informed decisions about whether to enter the villa.There also needs to be much more guidance on how to interact with social media after the show, in particular how to deal with trolling. There is not one former islander I have spoken to who has not experienced anxiety about their Instagram and other social media accounts. I also believe there should be an element of career advice and support with financial planning as part of the aftercare: the idea that islanders will walk out of the show and make millions of pounds is absurd, and the realisation that this isn’t the reality can affect contestants’ mental health and wellbeing.Making what are relatively simple alterations to the support contestants on shows such as Love Island get could make a big difference to their lives once their time on screen is over. There’s a huge audience appetite for a show such as Love Island. Let’s hope that the right lessons have been learned to prevent future tragedies.• Alex George is an NHS doctor and former Love Island contestant"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd6e381232bf98a146e93e24991bbeab224a725a/0_34_4599_2759/master/4599.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22202aa703deeed6efafb1df77e3d470","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of elegant","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘elegant’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘elegant’.Share your photos of what elegant means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 5 June at 10am.

Once the heartland of London’s rave scene, they’re now home to new boutiques and flagship stores. With a focus on craftsmanship, sustainability and conscious consumption, you’ll find design that challenges the status quo and products made to last. From fancy pants to unisex streetwear, sun-drenched LA style to seriously chic wet weather gear, here are eight stores you’ll definitely want to drop into – and dwell.Beija LondonFounded by sisters Abbie Miranda and Mazie Fisher, Beija London is on a mission to revolutionise the way we buy underwear and swimwear. Every elegant, sculptural design comes in three sizing categories, from wire-free bralettes to full support, created to fit and celebrate AA-G cup sizes without ever compromising on style. Having gathered a cult online following, the brand’s first bricks and mortar store is as coolly minimalist as its lingerie, with abundant greenery and plenty of space for fittings. In fact, Beija’s approach is such a breath of fresh air that it almost feels as good as taking your bra off at the end of a long day. Almost.18montroseWith a roll call of labels including Stone Island, Maison Margiela, Rick Owens, Yeezy and Alexander Wang, concept store 18montrose is leading the way in unisex design. Technically, Coal Drops Yard is its third UK outlet (the boutique retailer also has stores in Glasgow and Nottingham), but this is their only London presence, and with more than 450 sq m of space, this is a temple to contemporary streetwear that goes way beyond the hype. The perfect place to get your kicks, and everything else that goes with them.Form\u0026ampThreadEthical, sustainable, sewed by fairly-paid workers in Portugal and packaged in biodegradable materials, everything at Form\u0026ampThread is transparent. Except the clothes. Favouring quality fabrics and muted colours, this understated menswear label creates beautifully timeless pieces think mid-weight cotton twill shirts with off-centre buttons and oversized chest pockets, classic tapered chinos, and discreetly textured socks, all in earthy tones such as brick, pebble, olive and navy.LavenhamLavenham has come a long way. Born in the Suffolk town of the same name, this thoroughly British brand has been making quilted gilets and jackets since 1969. The swinging 60s might be long gone, but this premium outerwear has stood the test of time. Whether you’re after an ironic city twist on rural style or just something warm and stylish to walk the dog in, all emphasis here is on quality, comfort and durability. They even offer a repairs service.LPOLWife and husband team Katy Bell and John Maskell graduated from Central Saint Martins in 2006, so it’s fitting that their shop and studio is now based in Coal Drops Yard, only a stone’s throw from the world-famous art school. LPOL’s sleek totes, rucksacks and satchels are all crafted with a zero-waste philosophy every scrap of leather is reused to make prototypes, wallets or bag tags. The brand name stands for Lost Property of London – although you won’t want to lose yours.Outsiders StoreAs the name suggests, Outsiders Store wants to keep you warm and dry when you’re outside. Stocking some of the biggest and coolest names in adventure wear, from pastel Patagonia anoraks to Blundstone boots and portable coffee makers, it’s a one-stop shop for happy campers, urban hikers and all that lies between. While the first Outsiders Store opened in Liverpool, the Coal Drops Yard boutique finds the retailer a second site in the heart of the capital, and home to a beautifully curated selection that’ll have even the most fashion-devoted Londoner yearning for a style excursion beyond zone five.TwiinIf you’ve ever crushed on that photo of Farrah Fawcett on a skateboard, Twiin is a must-visit. London’s first LA-inspired concept store, influenced by similarities between the two cities’ style tribes (we’re flattered), the store stocks a mix of luxe contemporary and vintage pieces. While the furnishings are mid-century, the ethos is pure 2019: socially-conscious brands, golden lighting and Instagram opportunities all over the shop. Even a little rain can’t kill the vibe.Wolf \u0026amp BadgerSince launching in 2010, Wolf \u0026amp Badger has established itself as a leading global online marketplace for independent brands.

We spoke to three of the district’s creative duos to get some tips on pairing up and the art of compromise.Lots of siblings wouldn’t be able to work together – have you guys always collaborated well?Mazie: We have entirely different skills, which I think is critical to us getting on. Abbie heads up design and I head up the marketing. We don’t step on each other’s toes and we trust each other’s judgments. She’s a bit more daring and I’m more commercial, so we’re a good balance.Abbie: The crossover in our pregnancies, with hormones raging, was pretty much the only time we had a row. One argument in three years of collaborating together on Beija isn’t bad, I reckon. Our working relationship improves all the time, as we gain confidence and toughen up.Has your relationship changed since you began working together?Mazie: It’s definitely stronger. She was my stroppy older sister before, but now she’s my best friend. I like to think we’ve both matured a lot since launching Beija.What do you each think the other brings to the brand?Abbie: Mazie brings so much – ideas, jokes, vision and commerciality. I can get a bit avant garde. She reins us all in.Mazie: Abbie brings gorgeous bras that women want to wear – simple styling and beautiful colours. She has great taste and won’t compromise on quality for price, which is what I really respect about her. She’s got high standards.What’s a day in the life of Beija like?Mazie: No day is the same – it’s a ride of amazing highs and frustrating lows. We’re still in our infancy, so I have a lot of jobs – a mix of copywriting, contacting buyers, planning newsletters, designing digital ads, social media, looking at fabrics, plus planning the future of Beija …Abbie: I reply to emails in the morning and do lab dips – approving and rejecting fabric colour submissions. Then I smash through patterns, make sure all the fabrics are there for cutting, so that the samples can be picked up and sewn. Measuring and fitting, then more emails and catching up with the factories. I meet with fabric suppliers, and then have meetings with my team at various points in the day. When I’m designing I have to get away from the office, as there’s no brain space with so much going on.Has Coal Drops Yard influenced your work?Mazie: I visit Coal Drops Yard twice a week and I never want to leave. It’s got a style about it that I really love – it’s laid-back and effortless. I’m always blown away by how cool and well-dressed everyone is.Abbie: The customers who shop here definitely influence us. They are pretty cool, understated and modern. And architecturally, yes. It’s a super slick, strong and neat space – all characteristics I admire and consider when I’m designing.What’s your working relationship like?Missy: In any successful relationship, work or otherwise, you have to put as much energy into understanding and knowing the other person as you do into the actual work. It’s complex being involved with your work partner in a romantic way, because sometimes you’re restricted by what they know already – about you, about the business and the way you work. Collaboration is as much about space as it is about closeness.Our ideas cross over the most in the creative, fun parts of the business, which is what we both enjoy most, but that’s not all the business is. There are a lot of times we just have to get our heads down and split the crappy jobs that no one wants to do!What do you each bring that’s unique?Gabriel: Bodega Rita’s is the product of two people with very different sensibilities and very different ways of working, and we are extremely lucky that these juxtapositions balance out in a beautiful way. It allows us to split responsibilities based on our inidual strengths, enabling us to encourage and support each other while getting on with what needs to be done.Missy: Gabe’s a brilliant chef but, more than that, he understands the importance of the experience of eating, and the transportive quality of flavour. He brings his references together in a way that is honest and thorough and not at all pretentious, and translates food that belongs in a restaurant into a tiny grab-and-go sandwich shop with eight seats.Has your store been influenced by its Coal Drops Yard location?Missy: The power of food is that it’s unifying, so we are absolutely influenced not only by the history of the area but the fact that it’s a workplace for some people, a day out for others, a place of study … I’m looking forward to summer when we can keep the front doors open, have music playing and create a lovely hangout spot for people visiting the area.What advice would you give to someone embarking on a creative collaboration with someone they’re in a relationship with?Gabriel: Work out your inidual strengths and respect them. Communicate and support each other. And always make time to do stuff together that has absolutely nothing to do with work – regularly. Don’t let work get in the way.How did you become business partners?Joao: We have been mates for a long time and we both share the same love and respect for the craft of tattooing and the piercing industry. Sacred Gold was the perfect opportunity to join forces and create something special.What’s a typical day in the life of Sacred Gold?Guy: Adorning lots of people from all walks of life. From mild to wild, discreet to ostentatious, we have something for everyone.What do you think each other brings to the business?Joao: Guy has a lot of experience and insight into the management and approach of running a studio, and a business awareness that benefits us greatly.Guy: Joao has a very unique style that is instantly recognisable. His tattoos are extremely hard to duplicate, creating something special and exclusive to Sacred Gold.What advice would you give someone starting a creative collaboration with a friend?Joao: I would say a successful partnership consists of friends who have opposing qualities. Guy and I have different strengths, so we can both bring something different to the table and balance each other out.Guy: Collaboration means bouncing ideas off one another and expanding on them. Seeing things from a different set of eyes can really expand an idea. A different perspective can also be refreshing and can help when an idea feels stagnant.Has Coal Drops Yard inspired your work?Joao: It’s been an influence on the interior of the studio. We wanted to reflect the way Coal Drops Yard has held on to the historical structure while adding modern elements.Guy: I think what influenced us the most was the style and high spec of Coal Drops Yard – we knew we had to do something that would do justice to such an incredible project.Looking for a more personal shopping and dining experience, or simply want to discover somewhere new in the capital?

Garment production has doubled in the past 15 years, with £140m worth of clothes a year ending up in landfill – and it’s a situation shoppers are very mindful of.And, in these times of digital overload, we’re rediscovering the joy of a bricks-and-mortar experience. Forward-thinking new retail districts are reimagining the traditional high street, putting an emphasis on storytelling and craftsmanship with stores for customers to spend time in. Coal Drops Yard is one such destination. As the name suggests, the warren of Victorian brick viaducts was originally built to house coal. In the 1990s, the warehouses became a new home for the clubbing scene, and now the area has reinvented itself once again as London’s most progressive shopping and restaurant district, home to a new crop of fashion and lifestyle brands encouraging shoppers to practise a more mindful kind of consumption.Tracey Neuls, a cult footwear designer who has been producing handmade shoes for the past 19 years, is just one example of a craftsperson pushing for conscious consumption. Each new design is sculpted by Neuls in clay, then produced by a Portuguese atelier using Italian leather from ethical tanneries. In her Coal Drops Yard boutique, shoes hang from the ceiling on ribbons, to be admired and encircled like mini works of art.“The rise in disposable fashion is having a wonderful knock-on effect of creating a new shopper who is more interested in quality than quantity,” explains Neuls. “Excess and choice are being replaced by emotive purchases that people intend to have around for years. We have customers who have described our shoes that they bought some 10 years ago as if they were talking about their pets – with the same attachment and love.”Neuls’ philosophy is shared by her Coal Drops Yard neighbour, leather goods brand LPOL. Founded by husband and wife team Katy Bell and John Maskell, they put responsible material sourcing and zero waste at the centre of everything they do. “As designers, we’re concerned with three things: fabric, form and function,” they explain. “The sole aim is to combine them effortlessly, sustainably and desirably in the best traditions and progression of our craft.”Meanwhile, clothes that haven’t found such long-term relationships (yet) are welcomed at Boutique by Shelter, where secondhand garments get a new lease of life. Furnished with salvaged materials and stocked with a covetable pick-and-mix of designer, high street and vintage donations, all at a fraction of the original price. But the store’s appeal goes far beyond bargains – it’s a community hub, a volunteering scheme, a source of vital funds to end homelessness and a way to tackle fashion’s waste problem.The new wave of conscious consumption doesn’t only mean caring for the planet it’s about the human impact, too, supporting businesses that strive to do good on both sides of the counter, and this is reflected in Coal Drop Yard’s retailers. Form\u0026ampThread champions fair pay for its factory workers Beija London strives to make more inclusive underwear, designed for women of all sizes with comfort and empowerment at heart and design practice and community space STORE Store addresses social imbalance within art, design and architecture by hosting creative courses for the general public, with a special focus on creating new opportunities for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.Trying harder is something we could surely all be doing. But while responsible shopping is just that – a responsibility, to do our due diligence and look a little harder at our habits – it’s not to say it shouldn’t be a pleasure, too. Neuls feels that the secret to more conscious shopping is foregoing trends and following your instinct. “If you shop with the view to invest in footwear that doesn’t go out of fashion, that makes you feel confident and makes you smile, then you are on the right track,” she says. And that’s an emotional investment as much as a financial one.In fact, most sustainability champions agree that it’s positivity – not guilt, shame or scary statistics – that drives the best trade. Make people feel bad about themselves, and they seek solace in a high street binge. But make us feel good about ourselves, and we’ll make good choices. The Coal Drops Yard approach might just be the future of shopping – do it slowly, and do it in style.To find out more about Coal Drops Yard’s carefully curated offerings, head to coaldropsyardshop-eat-drink"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7954beafcdad4620ae03032f786c55fab6a1f5ec/1_0_2966_1780/master/2966.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55712a5678b81182a2a0c60bb026d5ce","title":"master chefs 10 delicious dishes you can devour at coal drops yard","story":"London’s delicious new shopping and dining destination, Coal Drops Yard, has attracted some of the capital’s most exciting culinary talent.

The comic’s new film draws from her experiences in the industryRevenge must feel sweet for Mindy Kaling. Fourteen years ago, she was the “ersity hire” – the first female writer and person of colour on the US version of The Office – and pretty much American comedy as a whole. Now Kaling brings us Late Night, written by and starring herself as Molly, the only female writer and person of colour on Emma Thompson’s ailing late-night TV show “a vibrant splash of colour on the grey canvas of our writing staff,” as Molly puts it.Of all genres, US late-night TV remains dominated by male writers and hosts. Late Night mines Kaling’s early career for laughs but it’s clearly born of painful experience she is alienated, humiliated, resented and disrespected. It was a similar for Tina Fey with her sitcom 30 Rock, feeding off her experience as the first female head writer on Saturday Night Live.In a 2010 panel discussion, Samantha Bee, currently the only woman fronting a US late-night TV show, contrasted the nurturing spirit of her all-female improv troupe in Canada with the more ruthless approach she felt in the writers’ room of The Daily Show. “It wasn’t that it was a male-dominated culture,” she said, “but it’s a daily show, and if it’s not immediately funny, it’s not going to go anywhere.” She suggested that many women also didn’t believe they could get those writing jobs, so didn’t even apply. Its head writer David Javerbaum had another explanation: “The problem is, we hire women but they get lost on the way to the studio driving.” It’s comedy, see? Although he might not make that joke today.For all the insight that Kaling puts into Late Night, it doesn’t massively depart from expectations in terms of our hero’s journey. Diversity triumphs even if it’s in the service of Thompson’s career. But Late Night is both a record of how bad things were and how much they have moved on. Hopefully no one will need to make a movie on this subject again. It would be fitting for Kaling to have the last laugh.Late Night is out in cinemas from 7 June"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad753db754b7bac3226319d4645133e840bcdb4b/0_1173_8013_4810/master/8013.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c2789506974b9789a50343248e6f30b","title":"rachel roddy recipe parmigiana di melanzane","story":"This dish is all about layers: slices of golden fried aubergine, a smear of tomato sauce, ripped basil leaves, and mozzarella and parmesanJust like temperamental weather, parmigiana di melanzane is all about layers: aubergine, tomato sauce and cheese (mozzarella, scamorza, caciocavallo and often parmesan, too). The “parm” does not, as I thought for many years, refer to the inclusion of parmesan cheese.According to Sicilian Food: Recipes from Italy’s Abundant Isle, by Mary Taylor Simeti, it refers to palmigiana, which means shutters in Sicilian. One day, as someone somewhere in Sicily arranged slices of fried aubergine, corners overlapping corners, they were reminded of wooden shutters and their overlapping slats. However, as Sicilians struggle to pronounce the letter “l”, their creation became parmigiana di melanzane instead. This could of course be one of the many gastronomic tales that are passed around like Chinese whispers, but, true or not, the idea of shutters is a useful one in terms of construction, reminding us how the fried slices should be arranged.The first question with this dish is whether to fry or not to fry. Fry, fry, fry is almost always my answer, especially when it comes to aubergine slices for parmigiana. This is primarily because I like the thick, velvet-like texture and deep flavour that is created by letting slices dance around a pan of hot olive oil until light golden in colour and ever so slightly crisp.Second, when aubergine is immersed completely in hot oil (olive or vegetable), the cooking time is reduced and with it the amount of fat absorbed. Door open wide, shower cap on, I fry in a deep frying pan, heating two inches of oil until a cube of bread dances around the pan with a coat of bubbles. I fry four large aubergines sliced into 3mm rounds in batches, and, once golden, lift them on to a tray lined with plenty of kitchen paper to drain. I have discovered that this is a task that takes exactly the same amount of time as two back-to-back episodes of Desert Island Discs.For a leaner version in both spirit and flavour, the slices can be brushed with olive oil and roasted in the oven or seared on a grill pan, until soft and branded with dark lines.Whether you choose to fry, bake or grill, while the aubergine slices rest, cut 400g mozzarella into thin, scraggy slices (or simply shred it), grate 150g parmesan and tip 300ml smooth tomato sauce into a bowl. This can be your own sauce or a good-quality passata from a jar, or a tin of peeled plum tomatoes passed through a food mill and seasoned with salt and ripped basil.Now it’s all about making layers in an oven-proof dish – a 40cm x 27cm Pyrex one is ideal. Start with a layer of aubergine, the corners overlapping slightly like shutters, followed by a smear of tomato sauce, some ripped basil leaves, mozzarella and parmesan. Repeat this sequence of layers until you have used up all the ingredients, ending with a layer of aubergine. The top will need a thick carpet of grated parmesan and some breadcrumbs, too, if you like, plus a zigzag of olive oil.The resting is as important as the cooking. Once the parmigiana has been baked at 180C (160C fan)gas 4 for 30 minutes, leave to sit for at least a couple of hours and up to 12. It is the same principle here as with lasagne when served straight from the oven, it will be a soft and sloppy affair, the considerable heat blinding the flavour. Resting will not only develop the flavour, it will also allow the melted mozzarella and parmesan to settle and firm up into a coherent whole.I often make a shutter-like parmigiana in the morning for the evening, or in the evening for the next day. When it’s time to eat, I give the parmigiana another 10 minutes in the oven and a few more under the grill, until the top bubbles madly. Green salad with red-wine vinegar is a good partner for a square of this, on the same plate if you’re English (me) or on a separate one if you’re Italian.400g mozzarella4 large aubergines (approx 1 kg)Olive or vegetable oil, for frying300ml tomato sauce or passata150g parmesan, gratedBasilThe day before, put the mozzarella in a sieve over a bowl and drain for 24 hours. The next day, cut the mozzarella into thin, shaggy slices. Slice the aubergine into 3mm-thick rounds.In a small, deep frying pan, heat two inches of oil until hot and fry the aubergine slices in batches, turning, until they are golden brown on both sides. Lift onto a baking tray lined with kitchen towel to drain. If you want to bake the aubergine, brush the slices with oil, sprinkle with a little salt and lay on a baking tray. Roast at 200C (180C fan)390Fgas 6 for 30 minutes, or until browned and tender. To griddle, brush the aubergine slices with oil, sprinkle with a little salt and cook in a hot griddle pan until soft and branded with dark lines.In a 40cm x 27cm pyrex dish, lay a base of aubergine slices, smear over some of the tomato sauce or passata, scatter over a quarter of the mozzarella, some grated parmesan and ripped basil. Repeat the layers until you have used up all of the ingredients, ending with a layer of auberinge. Sprinkle over the last of the parmesan and zigzag with olive oil.Bake at 180C (160C fan)350Fgas 4 for 30 minutes, then leave to rest for at least three and up to to 12 hours. When you are ready to eat, reheat the parmigiana in a warm oven for 10 minutes, finishing under the grill until bubbling, if you wish."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c15a1d416b6060e7b8f772f9cacd3b4fd14830e/0_672_3541_2125/master/3541.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=376702f8610129deb29173799abda7c2","title":"thomasina miers recipe courgette mint butter bean stew","story":"Light, velvety and wonderfully garlicky, this is the perfect stew for the summerGarlic is wonderful at this time of year: sweet and succulent, with none of the bitterness of its winter counterpart.

Bring to a simmer and simmer gently for 45-55 minutes, until the beans are tender but still holding their shape, skimming the surface of any froth. (If the beans boil vigorously, their skins tend to break and they lose shape.) Take off the heat and add enough salt to make the cooking liquid taste good. Leave the beans to cool in the liquid.Slice three of the remaining garlic cloves. Warm the oil in a wide, deep pan over a medium-high heat and, once hot, add the sliced garlic and courgettes. Fry for five to seven minutes, until the courgettes begin to turn golden. Turn the heat down to medium-low, season with a little salt and cook for a further 10 minutes, until tender.Drain the beans, discarding the bay and garlic, and stir into the courgettes with the wine, lemon rind, thyme and a few tablespoons of water. Cook for five minutes, to allow the flavours to bond, then taste and adjust the seasoning with salt, pepper and lemon juice. Take off the heat and stir in the mint.Rub the hot toast with the last garlic clove and drizzle with a little olive oil. Put in shallow bowls and spoon over the stew. Top with a large dessertspoon of goat’s curd and scatter generously with more mint leaves and an extra drizzle of olive oil to serve.Cook an extra 500g butter beans as above, blitz to a smooth puree with garlic and olive oil, and serve alongside grilled chicken thighs, roast chicken or lamb. Alternatively, freeze the cooked beans for a fast weeknight soup use a good stock, and flavour with rosemary and chilli oil.

There’s no hard feelings with Mourinho?What is the problem at Manchester United now?The problem begins with, of course, that Manchester United was never refreshed. I think when you are a manager you have to refresh every year to keep the team-building process going.You brought in players. You tried to refresh.Did they not take your advice?I thought always Manchester United can buy every player because they have a lot of power. Seemingly a few players were not reachable for Manchester United. I cannot understand but it was like that.Ángel Di María, was he your choice?Di María was my choice at AZ, seven years before.He didn’t sign then. Did you want him for United? Were you happy that he came?I was satisfied, because he was a creative player, but I had other players on the list. Di María had a problem with the English football culture and the climate. You cannot buy players and know, for sure, that they can deliver. You cannot know because football is a team sport.Where did he want to play?I always ask a player where he wants to play. For him it was wing, wide and mostly left. In the Argentina team he plays on the left. I started with him there. He was not performing that well, to a level you could expect from an £80m player. I believe, then, I have to see if another position is better for him. I have played him left winger, as the 10, second striker and on the right. Then the critics say he is having to play in too many positions. I gave him all the chances that there were to perform well.Do you have any regrets about your time with Manchester United?No. The way they sacked me was terrible. But I like my time in England, because of the culture, because of the people. A lot of humour and always supporting the manager. I have respect for everybody I worked with.Who was the best player you had there?You haven’t mentioned Wayne Rooney. Was he too old by then? I’m sorry but he was over the hill. But in spite of that he was one of my best players.Was it difficult to make Rooney captain? Was he really the only choice?You can say nothing about his professionalism as a player in the training sessions or on a pitch. Outside the environment of the training pitch and the stadium is different. I made him my captain because I want to control that life outside.Interesting. Give him responsibility and then he …I think we don’t succeed totally.You said you don’t understand why United have a lot of money and won’t always pay for players. Is that because the Glazers didn’t want to pay?What does it take to be a perfect technical director or director of football?First of all you need knowledge of the game, methods of training, preparation experience, youth education, scouting and you have to think in structures. So you need a lot of experience in the football world. When you are in your profession as a technical director, you have developed a name, then you have a big network and you can always make use of that network.One person United are interested in to become technical director is Rio Ferdinand. What do you think about this? He was a good player, obviously.Were you surprised that Solskjær was given the job permanently?I was very surprised he got it in spite of the winning run at the start.Because Manchester United is one of the biggest clubs in the world that needs a manager with experience and not a manager who has trained at one or two teams and on a lower level.Pep Guardiola went straight into Barcelona after managing the Barcelona B team. He was very successful.There are always exceptions and he played as a central midfielder at the highest level, a position where you need tactical orientation, and he was my captain!You’ve got a philosophy of playing football: your Ajax team, Barcelona, AZ and Bayern Munich. Do United have one, would you say? When I was accepting the job, we never spoke about the system Manchester United played with, or about a philosophy.Is that a surprise?All my teams are really teams. I think also United played like a team. When your head is already cut off and you can inspire the players still to play that football or play the style that you want to play … We always played the same system but with other accents, depending on the opponent.If you had a blank canvas, how long would it take to sort United out? The trouble is that you cannot demand so much time. And the fans do not allow that. Also with Solskjær, they shall demand in spite of him being an ex-player. In the football world you have to deliver. However as an ex-player you always have more credit.Is it almost impossible then to succeed at these big clubs, at United? I remember your first press conference, you basically said ‘it’s too much commercial, this club’.I’m happy that you remember that. I think you have to change the structure in the organisation of Manchester United because now I think the balance between the football department and commercial department is not right and even slopes over to the commercial.What do you mean by that?What I have experienced is that I must go to the USA before the season and we have to play a lot of matches in a short time. That is a good commercial preparation but not the best for me as a football manager. Everybody was happy except me, because in the USA we won everything, but the first match in the league was a loss: Swansea. That is because every player was exhausted. When you have to start like that, that’s not good.In scouting players, Manchester United don’t have the organisation to deliver the best players in my opinion. Then with the education of players, you cannot say that the education of Manchester United is very good. How many players are coming through?With Manchester United, you have a fantastic performance department and that is under the guidance of the doctor. But this performance department needs also the guidance of an experienced technical director. You have to use that department not only for the first team but also intensively for the youth education. Then young players are more educated in the philosophy of Man United and the big step to the first team is much easier. These are the important aspects that you have to develop as a technical director.How do you provoke space?Because Salah, Firmino and Mané need a bigger space than Agüero, Sané and Sterling and also the creativity in City’s midfield is higher with De Bruyne, David Silva, Fernandinho and Bernardo Silva – they can play in a small space. That’s why City are the champions.Can you tell me the favourite player you’ve managed?

Hovis said it hopes to introduce the advert to a new generation who still appreciate its “core message of hard work, family and the strength of community”.The advert has undergone a 4K digital restoration, and its score of Dvorak’s New World Symphony has been re-recorded by a new generation of the original Ashington Colliery brass band.In April, a survey of 1,200 consumers voted the advert the UK’s most “heartwarming and iconic advert”.Jeremy Gibson, marketing director at Hovis, said: “The values of our brand have never been more relevant, so we decided to remaster and relaunch our ‘boy on the bike’ advert.“Despite being over 46 years old, recent research has found that the advert is as good today as it’s always been and differs from adverts focusing on broader entertainment.“We are seeing a mass movement across the country celebrating craftsmanship, traditional products and UK produce, and this advert is one of the most iconic examples of a brand celebrating the ties that bind us as communities and as a country, drawing on tradition but informing our future.” Scott said: “I’m thrilled that the ‘boy on the bike’ is still regarded as such an iconic and heartwarming story which remains close to the heart of the nation.“I remember the filming process like it was yesterday, and its success represents the power of the advert.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b11bc428a8127acf1df533813a1f14942a5aea7/19_294_4472_2683/master/4472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14a16fe4c9c4e982ef41b3f7c34bb946","title":"pensions must do right thing on climate change says minister","story":"Call for support for schemes moving people’s money from fossil fuels into renewablesPension schemes should be supported for moving people’s money out of fossil fuels and into renewables because the financial risks from the climate crisis are “too important to ignore”, a government minister will say on Monday.The pensions minister, Guy Opperman, is due to tell a conference that pension and investment managers must “do the right thing” and take their environmental and social responsibilities seriously to help combat the climate emergency.During the last few years a number of pension schemes have taken action to protect their members from the risks associated with climate change by reducing their exposure to companies with reserves of coal, oil and gas.Some have pulled all of their funds out of these companies, while others have chosen to apply a positive “tilt” that increases support for businesses identified as vital to combating the climate crisis, such as those working on renewable energy, while at the same time reducing investment in firms that are heavy carbon emitters, have fossil fuel reserves or are not making the sorts of changes needed to meet emission reduction targets.In April, the  revealed that parliament’s pension fund trustees were to reconsider the rules of their investments to take account of the risks posed by the climate emergency.Meanwhile, rules taking effect in October will require UK pension fund trustees to set out how they take account of “financially material considerations, including … climate change”.Ministers have previously stated that it was government policy not to direct the investment decisions or strategies of pension scheme trustees.However, Opperman is due to tell an Association of British Insurers conference on long-term saving: “The financial risks from climate change are too important to ignore.”He will also say: “Many pension schemes are doing the right thing by tilting portfolios towards renewables or away from fossil fuels and by engaging much more forcefully with investment firms who fail to take environmental and social issues seriously.”The minister will welcome the “excellent work” done by many schemes in this area but will underline more can be achieved: “Pension schemes can identify investment opportunities which will make market-beating returns for members as we move to a low-carbon economy.“They ought to be thinking about the assets which help drive new investment in important sectors of the economy: smaller and medium firms, housing, green energy projects and other infrastructure which deliver the sustainable employment, communities and environments which all of us wish to enjoy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0431c85644610b3cb9736be6cdc060f5b4bc3d9/0_0_2600_1560/master/2600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ccc7e74cac38457b4a5b98cb75d8349c","title":"50 great tracks for june from jarvis cocker lady lykez employed to serve and more","story":"From Sleater-Kinney’s return to TisaKorean’s goofy rap, here are 50 new tracks to check out this monthby  Ben Beaumont-Thomas and  Laura SnapesBeing vulnerable is a prerequisite to being loved, an emotional state equivalent to a state of emergency for anyone naturally resistant to that kind of intimacy. As if delivering instructions in an undercover military operation, her tight jaw relinquishing to a rallying cry, Carrie Brownstein commands this love song for the unlovable, keen to impress upon a partner the urgency and disembodying exhilaration of becoming open to love, the domestic and existential overhaul of it. “You got me used to loving you!” she spits, half-indignant, half-enrapt at the surprise of it. It is the first song from the Pacific Northwest trio’s forthcoming ninth album, produced by St Vincent, whose fantastic way with aggression and absurdism makes itself heard in the lurching vocal cries of Corin Tucker that colour Hurry on Home’s pop-industrial churn.Houston’s hottest sets out her philosophy on the first track from debut album Fever: men are good for nothing but money and head, though cash is best made oneself, the fewer details given the better, and critics can go whistle (in so many words). Her punishing flow is proof of an impending supremacy, a thrillingly vicious counterpoint to her hometown’s screwed legacy and rap’s post-SoundCloud slurring.“Everyone deserves a past they don’t care to mention!” Bill Callahan declared on America, from his 2011 album Apocalypse. But on The Ballad of the Hulk – one of six songs released to trail new album Shepherd in a Sheepskin Vest – he is “talking about the old days”. He muses, in that beguiling, quizzical baritone, on whether permitting himself more angry outbursts in his younger years might have saved him “holding on to ancient aches” that a reiki master intuits in his body. “I try to be a good person,” he pledges, then wonders if that’s worth pursuing at all when “the risk of the road” might derail those efforts. But the peace of Callahan’s new material – the loosest acoustic guitar playing, as bright and cleansing as dawn, inflected with humour and subtle drama – makes the case for trying. It is a fool’s errand to look to musicians for guidance, but Callahan feels attuned to a sense of calm and certainty worth heeding.JXF is a North Carolina-based folklorist and guitar player who specialises in making old songs glow with new wonder. On Out of Sight, his forthcoming record on Paradise of Bachelors, he is joined by a band for the first time, dwelling on material about “the troubles and delights of love, work and wine”. Oh Captain’s narrator is dissatisfied with his workaday grind, but Fussell and co make bright, dewy work from guitar, fiddle, piano and pedal steel.Wayfaring Stranger is one of the great mythic songs of America: dating back to the early 19th century, its stirring melody is always searching for resolution, much like the itinerant figure of its title. The definitive versions are perhaps by Johnny Cash and Emmylou Harris, but everyone from Ed Sheeran to Jack White and Eva Cassidy have had a go at it (and there’s a brilliant dark UK garage version by Jamie Woon remixed by Burial). Rhiannon Giddens’ take, from her second brilliant album of the year after her collaborative Our Native Daughters project, is stirring: her soaring voice giving the old song a new clarity and certainty.The permanently dapper Blood-affiliated rapper released his new album 4REAL4REAL this month, and it’s an absolute triumph: a true West Coast classic reminiscent of Tupac’s complex, propulsive passion. There’s blistering gangsta rap (Stop Snitchin), classy R\u0026ampB (Keisha Had a Baby) and a tremendously impassioned speech paying tribute to the late Nipsey Hussle. But the high point is Do Not Disturb – over a simple piano motif, YG’s verse is quick and dextrous, and Kamaiyah’s chorus is as withering as it is catchy. G-Eazy meanwhile uses the en vogue off-beat flow coined by fellow west coaster Blueface purists might hate it but the breezy style matches his casual cattiness: “She got a 21 waist, she models VS  Her diet is sniff more, eat less.”This is the best thing that Jarvis Cocker has done since the dissolution of Pulp: a psych-pop epic packed with humour and anthemic energy. Over a peppy rhythm, organs and Morricone-style vintage production, Cocker – under his new guise of Jarv Is… – sings a song of reluctant personal development. Or rather speaks it: in the storied style of talky Cocker songs like I Spy and David’s Last Summer, this features some wonderfully droll fantasies (“I walked through a tunnel backwards through time  Dragging my knuckles, listening to Frankie Knuckles”) as it bustles towards a spectacular climax.There’s a point at which rap technique becomes so refined and skilful that it almost morphs into a kind of sport: a prowess to be cheered and marvelled at as you would a particularly neat rabona. The verses on this track, traded between two of the UK’s most exciting up-and-coming MCs will have you hooting with satisfaction at the tongue-twisting skill the production from Scratcha DVA is the perfect springboard.Eternal Forward Motion, the third album from the Woking quintet, has been met with raptures in Britain’s metal community, and for good reason. It is a supremely focused, bracingly angry record, with space for some startling innovations amid the violent downforce, like the minimalist drums’n’screaming intro to Harsh Truth. Vocalist Justine Jones pours everything into her excoriations of toxic relationships and social pressures, including on this title track that sets up a thrilling dissonance: is she finding comfort in how time marches on regardless, or is she being steamrolled by it? Either way, the cacophonously strident climax is a weirdly moving moshpit moment.Murda Beatz, the man on the boards for beautiful productions like 6ix9ine’s Fefe, Travis Scott’s Butterfly Effect and Drake’s Portland and Nice for What, crafts one of his prettiest confections for the latest and best in a string of Chance singles. Chance’s verses are great: naive playground melodies used to chart how far he’s come, from “kitchen drawers full of sporks” to a five-star hotel where “fancy carpet make her feel like Jasmine”. But he gets upstaged somewhat by goofy Texan MC TisaKorean, whose pronunciation of “crow” is life-givingly silly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76637065d293b8d7d09e2637a839ec6806347c8f/113_0_3273_1964/master/3273.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8256f5635fe507cbefe47c689fd127e","title":"inside islamic state umm sayyaf podcast","story":"Martin Chulov, the ’s Middle East correspondent, tells Anushka Asthana about meeting Umm Sayyaf, who described her role in helping the CIA hunt for the Isis leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

Concerns were also raised about alleged behaviour towards two students, as reported by the Sunday Times at the time.He has strenuously denied the allegations, no formal complaint was pursued and Prescott returned to his role in the Labour leader’s office.Leaked emails suggested Corbyn’s chief of staff, Karie Murphy, told senior Labour officials she did not believe there were grounds for suspending Prescott’s Labour membership to bar him from attending party events.On Tuesday, Labour staffers wrote an open letter to Corbyn asking him to overhaul the system.In the letter, first reported by the Times, they wrote: “Working in politics isn’t easy, and many of us choose to give up our personal lives for Labour because we believe it is the best force for good in our country. What makes the job even more challenging than it should be is having to work in an environment where sexual harassment and bullying are not taken seriously.”The letter calls the reports about Prescott “extremely concerning” and said they needed urgent clarification as to whether the account in the Sunday Times was correct.“Clarity, consistency and transparency must be put at the forefront of the complaints process so that all sides feel confident that investigations will be conducted free from political interference,” the letter went on.“The perception can no longer be that your connections within the party will determine whether complaints against you will be pursued or not. We want to see Labour in government, but we need to get our house in order first.“We should, and can, lead the way in challenging and eradicating sexual harassment and bullying in work environments. The decision to write this letter does not come easily, but believing in a political party sometimes means having to ask uncomfortable questions.”Labour has said it takes all complaints extremely seriously. “In this case, no formal complaint was received to investigate,” a party spokesman said.MPs have urged the party to make its complaints procedure entirely independent to avoid accusations of factionalism in dealing with complaints of harassment or racism and antisemitism. The MPs Jess Philips and Stella Creasy have said the party must carve off its complaints arm, rather than use the current system where the bodies making final decisions about the complaints can be elected on factional slates."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/328e8d6ac97ee929744e46e9bf30c8ea7f709e62/0_203_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ce5d3db58e720fde3f5c7416e083ea7","title":"talkradio sacks george galloway","story":"Ex-MP tweeted there would be ‘no Israel flags on the cup’ after Spurs’ Champions League defeatGeorge Galloway has been sacked from his TalkRadio show with immediate effect, after the former MP said Liverpool’s victory over Tottenham Hotspur in the Champions League final meant there would be “no Israel flags on the cup”.The north London club, which has a strong association with the Jewish community, had called for him to be sacked, saying: “It’s astounding in this day and age to read such blatant antisemitism published on a social platform by someone who is still afforded air time on a radio station on which he has previously broken broadcast impartiality rules.”The former Labour and Respect party MP had presented the Friday night programme, called The Mother of All Talk Shows, since 2016. Earlier this year, the station was censured by the media regulator Ofcom for breaching broadcasting impartiality rules when Galloway cast doubt on Russian involvement in the poisoning of Yulia and Sergei Skripal in Salisbury last year.A spokesperson for the station confirmed it had taken Galloway off air following his tweet, which was posted after the game finished on Saturday night. They said: “TalkRadio has terminated George Galloway’s weekly show with immediate effect. As a fair and balanced news provider, TalkRadio does not tolerate antisemitic views.”Since Galloway’s departure from parliament in 2015 and a disastrous campaign in the 2016 mayor of London race, he has increasingly concentrated on media work.This resulted in the unusual relationship between Galloway and TalkRadio, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News UK. The station’s studios recently moved into the main News UK office in London Bridge, sharing a building with the Sun and the Times – outlets that Galloway has often attacked for political reasons.Galloway responded to news of his departure by threatening the station with legal action: “See you in court guys … Long live Palestine.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfff8ecab27ea24d93b03968cf0b0828a895ad54/0_128_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fee4d4616f49ddc537eb993915ab7754","title":"can you solve it dogs in pursuit","story":"Today’s problem is a classic puzzle and an excuse to post this picture of Melbourne’s annual sausage dog race, the Running of the Wieners.Four dogs are in four corners of a square of side length 1. Each dog starts running towards the dog immediately anti-clockwise to it. The dogs start at the same time, they all run at the same speed, and at every moment each dog is running directly towards the neighbouring dog. During the pursuit, the dogs will run in a spiral before they all meet in the centre. How far does each dog travel before the group collision?For bonus points, can you work out how far the dogs would travel if they started at the three corners of an equilateral triangle of side length 1, or the five corners of a regular pentagon of side length 1? Would the distance be further or shorter than in the case wih the square?The dogs-in-pursuit problem was suggested to me by Steven Strogatz, author of the magnificent Infinite Powers: How Calculus Reveals the Secrets of the Universe, which is out this week. Strogatz, a professor at Cornell, is both a world class mathematician and one of the best popular mathematics authors writing today. One of the aims of Strogatz’s book is to demystify calculus, so the general reader can appreciate what it is and how it is important it is to the modern world. He calls the big idea behind calculus the Infinity Principle:To shed light on any continuous shape, object, motion, process or phenomenon – no matter how wild or complicated it may appear – reimagine it as an infinite series of simpler parts, analyse those, and then add the results back together to make sense of the original whole.So what’s this got to do with the dogs? Well, they are running in such a way that their direction is changing continuously at every point. As each dog moves, the one chasing it must change its direction. You don’t need any technical ability at calculus to solve the problem, however, only a simple insight.Pursuit problems, that is, problems about the curves you get when a point (the chaser) tracks a moving point (the chasee), usually do require calculus. Indeed, these problems were one of the things that got the teenage Strogatz excited about the power of calculus in the first place.“I loved chase problems because of how visual they were,” he says. “I could picture a dog running after a fleeing postman, or a heat-seeking missile pursuing an enemy fighter plane. And with calculus I could solve such questions - it was thrilling!”Pursuit is also of interest because it scampers into the area of mathematical art. Here’s a full look at the (logarithmic) spiral made by the four dogs. It looks like a piece of op-art, or an optical illusion.When you arrange the 4-dog spiral with a 6-dog spiral (from a hexagon) and a 3-dog spiral (the triangle), you get an image like this. It is almost impossible to see the underlying shapes. I’ll be back with the solutions at 5pm. Please NO SPOILERS.

Bairstow plays a nothing shot at a short ball outside off stump, trying to glide it to third man, and gets a thin edge straight through to Sarfaraz.8th over: England 54-1 (Bairstow 26, Root 19) That’s a lovely stroke from Root, who waits for a wider delivery from Amir and skims it square on the off side for four. Both teams are in ultra-attacking mode, which has led to eight overs of scandalously good cricket.7th over: England 46-1 (Bairstow 25, Root 12) Wahab Riaz replaces Shadab Khan, who did his job by taking the wicket of Jason Roy. His fourth ball is on the pads and shovelled wide of short fine leg for four by Bairstow. The next ball also goes to the fine-leg boundary - but this time it’s via an inside edge that misses the off stump by a whisker. Bairstow looks in rumbustious mood, even by his standards, as if affronted by Pakistan’s sudden improvement. “I wonder,” says Steve Pye, “if one day we’ll remember the moment Joe Root uttered the immortal line, ‘You’ve just dropped match six of the 2019 World Cup.’” 6th over: England 37-1 (Bairstow 17, Root 11) Amir sits Root down with a beautiful straight bouncer. Root actually played it really well, snapping his head out of the way at the last second, but he was hanging on the back foot when he inside-edged the next ball wide of the stumps for four. It feels like another wicket is in the post. And it should have come off the next ball! Root edged a leaden-footed drive to the left of first slip, where Babar Azam dropped a ing chance! It was a sharp chance, but he probably should have taken it. This has been a blistering start from Pakistan’s bowlers.“In many ways this England side are very similar to Joshua,” says Tom Van der Gucht. “They both look big and tough, they’ve spent ages being bigged up as they rough up weaker opponents, they approach every challenge with a carefully planned out strategy of attack, often achieving impressive results - but you still have an inkling that neither of them are especially good at thinking on their feet and are at risk of getting hammered in a dog fight that goes against their prepared game plan as they fail to adapt to the unexpected.”Send them home! (I think England are far better than Joshua, for what it’s worth, though I agree there are some comparisons.) 4th over: England 22-1 (Bairstow 8, Root 5) Root almost drags Amir back onto the stumps, with the ball bouncing over the top of off. The upside of this situation - and England are where Anthony Joshua was at the start of round four the other night - is that this would be a heck of a game to win. If they do pull this off, they will collect so many more morale tokens than after their usual 330+ chases.“Jason Roy looks an incredibly petulant person to me,” says Andy Bond. “I reckon this inner rage is probably the secret of his success, but in a pressure situation (which every single game in this World Cup will be) its not the most productive of temperaments. Bit worrying.”Send him home!3rd over: England 18-1 (Bairstow 5, Root 5) Roy, who has had a stinker today, had a longish chat with the umpire Marais Erasmus on the way off. I’m not sure what that’s about. It seems he was annoyed because of an overzealous send-off from one or two of the Pakistan players. They are all over England, and it’s exhilarating to watch. I’m telling you: something’s happening! Jason Roy misses a premeditated sweep at a very full delivery and is plumb LBW to Shadab Khan. To make things worse for England, he throws away their only review by deciding to query the decision. That’s an abysmal review, and I’ve no idea why Bairstow didn’t tell him to do one.2nd over: England 12-0 (Roy 8, Bairstow 4) Mohammad Amir shares the new ball. This is a much better Pakistan attack than the one England faced last month, when Amir, Shadab and Wahab were all missing. Bairstow is so close to another golden duck when a gorgeous inswinger zips between bat and pad and just misses the off stump. After a few respectful strokes, Bairstow ks the last ball of the over just wide of the flying Imam at cover and away for four. That would have been an awesome catch because Bairstow gave it all sorts of humpty. That was a cracking over from Amir. The early signs are that Pakistan’s bowlers are in a state of haal, and when that’s the case they are seriously hard to withstand. In fact, this innings might be the irresistible force versus the irresistible force.1st over: England 8-0 (Roy 8, Bairstow 0) The Shadab experiment has mixed results. Roy chips the first ball not far short of mid-on, larrups the second and third to the boundary and then survives a big LBW appeal after offering no stroke. It was missing off stump.The legspinner Shadab Khan will bowl the first over. This is pulsating stuff - and they haven’t bowled a ball yet.“That run predictor from the 39th over is absolute rubbish,” says Robert Darby. “I hope it doesn’t see the light of day again.” I’ve changed my mind. Pakistan will win this. Something brilliant is happening.Lads, it’s Pakistan. Anyone who assumed an easy England win simply hasn’t been paying attention for the last 50 years. Pakistan have always been an affront to logic, one of the few teams in world sport capable of being in ominously bad form. They have their own high-speed train that runs exclusively between the sublime and the ridiculous, and when they suddenly hit form they can scare the haal out of the opposition.England are getting quite a fright at Trent Bridge today: they need 349 to win, which would be the highest run-chase in World Cup history. They were ragged in the field, shockingly so at times, and Pakistan panelled the bowling to all parts. I’d still make England very slight favourites – they chased 341 to beat Pakistan on this ground last month – but I wouldn’t bet my dignity on it. This is Pakistan, the team who make us all ask the same question: is something brilliant happening?50th over: Pakistan 348-8 (Hassan 10, Shadab 10) A third wicket for Woakes, but Shadab Khan slashes for four over Buttler’s head, then mullers the last ball past the ing long-on for four more. Shadab’s 10 came off only four deliveries, reflecting Pakistan’s re-found confidence. They will be delighted with that total. England bowled well in patches but their fielding veered from excellent (Woakes) to uncharacteristically awful (Roy).This is going to be fascinating. On one hand, England just have to do what they kept doing against Pakistan last month. On the other, they have to complete the highest run-chase in World Cup history, pipping Ireland’s heroics against them in 2011. Hands up who wants to be Kevin O’Brien.And with that I’ll leave you in the Woakes-like hands of Rob Smyth. Thanks for all the emails, and especially the ones I didn’t get round to reading. Anything Hassan can do, Shoaib can’t do better as he goes for a slog, slices it and gives Morgan a catch as simple as the one Roy dropped.49th over: Pakistan 337-7 (Shoaib 8, Hassan 9) Scrub that – Hassan has hit Archer for six! It was a case of long hop, long handle. 48th over: Pakistan 327-7 (Shoaib 7, Hassan Ali 0) So there were two wickets in that over, and it still yielded ten runs. Pakistan are eyeing 350 but, with seven down, Shoaib may have to get them on his own.Another skyer, and this time it’s a dolly for Root, who does a Woakes rather than a Roy.That’s the one England wanted, as Sarfaraz, who had been inelegant but effective, offers yet another skyer and this time it’s within reach. Woakes takes his first wicket of the day and his fourth catch, equalling the World Cup record for an outfielder.47th over: Pakistan 317-5 (Sarfaraz 53, Shoaib 4) Out comes Shoaib Malik, who is 37, allegedly. He could get a little puffed in the next few minutes. Wood finishes his stint with 10-0-53-2, a fine return in both senses.Wood’s short ball is there for the cut and Asif hits it well, only to pick out Bairstow on the sponge at cover sweeper. That would have been six.46th over: Pakistan 311-4 (Sarfaraz 51, Asif Ali 14) That deep-set legside field comes at a price as Sarfaraz gets away with two mishit pulls off Archer, both of which hung in the air for some time. When Archer pitches it up, Sarfaraz plays a much better shot and gets four to long-off. And then a run-out chance (to Root) turns into four overthrows, or buzzers as the commentators are now contractually obliged to call them. Sarfaraz has raced to fifty off 40 balls. What kind of idiot would suggest that he was flattered by being at No.5?45th over: Pakistan 295-4 (Sarfaraz 38, Asif Ali 11) Good from Wood – only five off the over. He has 1-47 off nine.“I’ve not been following this morning,” says Neil Harris. “Bit of a shock seeing the score. Have Pakistan gone from the shambles of Friday to this???? Have we overhyped England?” Possibly, but Trent Bridge is the home of the monster total, so we’ll see.44th over: Pakistan 292-4 (Sarfaraz 38, Asif Ali 9) Asif Ali, who lost his small daughter to cancer only two weeks ago, gets a suitably dignified welcome from Mike Atherton, the most genial of commentators. Asif could be run out off his first ball, as could Sarfaraz at the other end, but by the end of the over he’s smashing Archer for six with a tennis shot over cover. 43rd over: Pakistan 279-4 (Sarfaraz 34, Asif Ali 0) Wood replaces Stokes, which is (I think) the first time Morgan has had high pace at both ends. Wood instantly produces his worst ball of the day, a half-volley outside leg, and Hafeez flicks it for a contemptuous six. But Wood bounces back, as good bowlers do, to take his first World Cup wicket, with a stylish assist from Woakes.Before that, Andy Bond sent this email. “Just re that guy who was speculating if England’s bowling attack is actually our strength?”That is the big one. Hafeez drop-kicks Wood into the middle distance and then kicks himself because he’s picked out Woakes, who collects his third catch of the day. At last, a wicket for a seamer.42nd over: Pakistan 271-3 (Hafeez 77, Sarfaraz 33) Archer returns, Morgan sets the field deep on the leg side, so Hafeez goes inside-out and chips over extra cover for four. Archer has bowled plenty of bouncers today, several of which have been wides. But only six off the over, a tiny triumph at this stage.41st over: Pakistan 265-3 (Hafeez 72, Sarfaraz 32) Stokes continues and the batsmen cash in – Sarfaraz picks a slower ball and chips it over mid-on, Hafeez pulls the bouncer past deep backward square. The misery goes on for England’s seamers. They have missed Plunkett, sorely. 40th over: Pakistan 252-3 (Hafeez 64, Sarfaraz 27) The commentators are just saying Pakistan aren’t going fast enough, when Sarfaraz whacks Woakes over mid-on to bring up the fifty partnership – 52 off 42, which seems all right to me. Here’s Peter Salmon. “Do you think this England team has now reached a point of confidence and excellence that some of them will secretly be willing Pakistan’s score upwards, to see exactly how big a total they can chase down?” It’s a great question, but I trust the answer is no."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41075e7ee1cafc148691be25ad4337d2def31982/0_116_5000_2999/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7d3ffa355aa98875c8fd55654da51d4","title":"french open 2019 djokovic halep zverev barty keys live","story":"Suddenly it’s Alexander Zverev dominating on Suzanne-Lenglen. He has two set points on Fognini’s serve. Fognini saves the first but Zverev grabs the second with a huge forehand down the line. He levels the match after taking the second set 6-2. To think that Fognini had four break points in the fifth game of the set.Gael Monfils sends a forehand long and Dominic Thiem leads 6-4, 6-4. The Austrian shouldn’t have too many problems from here, he says while completing forgetting that Thiem adores making life difficult for himself just for the fun of it.Gael Monfils knocks a backhand long to drop his serve. Thiem breaks to lead 6-4, 5-4. He’ll serve for a two-set lead.After dealing with all that pressure, now it’s Zverev’s turn to press at Fognini’s eccentricities. He earns two break break points. Fognini saves the first with a smash, but Zverev converts the second to lead 4-2 in the second set.Fognini lets Zverev of the hook on break point, king a forehand long. Bad miss. Not much is working for Zverev, though, and he gives the Italian another chance after netting a backhand. Zverev saves it with an ace. Then he double-faults. Then he forces deuce with a stunning forehand down the line. It’s deuce for a while. Zverev sums up where he is by following a double-fault with an ace to save another break point. Somehow he holds to lead 3-2 in the second set.Thiem sprays a lovely backhand down the line to hold for 3-3 in the second set. This is much more even now, though. Monfils is playing some sprightly tennis.Dominic Thiem hasn’t been on the end of any gifts from Gael Monfils in the second set on Philippe-Chatrier. Monfils is more dialled in now. He’s serving well and finding the mark with some skidding groundstrokes. Thiem leads 6-4, 1-2 and is about to serve.Alexander Zverev is not in a good place mentally at the moment. He’s bellowing in Russian after more errors at the start of the second set. He really needs to get his act together. He’s in danger of handing the match to Fognini.Alexander Zverev batters another forehand long and bellows at his box. He’s livid. But Fabio Fognini’s delighted. The 9th seed is a set to the good against the young German on Suzanne-Lenglen. That was a very impressive set from Fogini, who took it 6-3.As for events on Philippe-Chatrier, Dominic Thiem has quelled the late fightback from Gael Monfils and taken the first set 6-4. The lesson there is not to waste the first 10 minutes of a match. Start as you mean to go on.Under pressure, Zverev goes for way too much on a second serve and hands Fognini a break point at 3-4 in the first set. Then he balloons a forehand to give the Italian a break. The young German’s so furious he decides to punish himself by stuffing his gold necklace in his mouth and having a good old chew on the metal. Yum!Having held to lead 4-3 on Suzanne-Lenglen, Fabio Fognini can be seen glaring at the umpire as he walks back to his chair. He’s a fiery character. It’s not clear why he’s annoyed.Monfils has woken up! Serving for the set, Thiem finds himself down 0-30. He finds the line with a few backhands, but it’s Monfils who comes up with the decisive shot, a brilliant low backhand for three break points. He’s in this now, the Frenchman, and he quickly breaks to love to trail 3-5 on Chatrier.Gael Monfils is having a shocker. Serving to stay in the opening set, one of his forehands goes a good 10 yards past the baseline. He’s making so many errors. Dominic Thiem is barely having to do anything. But Monfils does manage to hold. Thiem will serve for the set at 5-2.Alexander Zverev waits for Fabio Fognini’s level to dip, which always seemed a likely development, and breaks to love. Zverev is back in the first set and will serve at 2-3.Alexander Zverev is on the board against Fabio Fognini. Gael Monfils is on the board against Dominic Thiem.Monfils loses his serve again. He’s 3-0 down to Thiem and playing atrociously. If only he could rewind the last 10 minutes and start again. Ah, and here’s Jacob. I’ll hand back over to him. Bye. Fognini held his serve after a testing first game against Zverev. I was warned by Jacob that this match may go five sets. The closeness of that first game suggests he may be right. One man who exuded calm earlier was Novak Djokovic. Here’s the report of his straight-sets win over Jan-Lennard Struff. Gaël Monfils gets off to a shocker, losing his serve to love immediately, with two double faults thrown in for good measure. He needs to calm down a little, he looks incredibly jumpy. Tok! Tok! Tok! The Parisian skies have brightened up considerably and the players are out on court warming up. Just a reminder, we have Thiem v Monfils on Philippe-Chatrier and Fognini v Zverev on Suzanne-Lenglen in the men’s last 16. It looks like the rain is petering out at Roland Garros and the forecast for the afternoon is good so when play does get under way it shouldn’t be interrupted. Another headline match this afternoon that has been delayed by the Parisian drizzle is fourth seed Dominic Thiem v Gaël Monfils, the 16th seed and French fans’ favourite. Should be fun on Philippe-Chatrier once the clouds clear.Hello, it’s Gregg here. I’ll be keeping you updated while Jacob is fuelling up for the potential five-setters this afternoon. One of those matches is ninth seed Fabio Fognini v fifth seed Alexander Zverev on Court Suzanne-Lenglen. There’s no sign of the players on court yet, though, because … it’s raining. Might not be much to update you on then. Hmmm. I’ll keep you posted. I’m heading for lunch. Gregg Bakowski will step in.Move along, nothing to see here. The world No1 was in exceptional form. Can anyone stop him reaching the final?Serving for the match, Nishikori begins by knocking a forehand wide for 0-15. He wins the next two points, though, a backhand lob taking him to 30-15. Soon he has his third match point. He misses a first serve. But Paire nets a forehand off a second serve and Nishikori, who must be exhausted, is through to face Rafael Nadal! Who’s just who you’d want to play after a long, gruelling five-setter.Benoit Paire saves a break point magnificently. He has a point to kill the game. Then he double-faults. So many self-inflicted blows. Then comes a dismal forehand slice that drifts past the baseline, giving Nishikori a break point. Nishikori goes on the attack and he makes life awkward for Paire with a few looping shots. Off balance, the Frenchman nets a backhand. Nishikori will serve for the match at 6-5!Benoit Paire is down in the dumps after that game. Kei Nishikori, hitting his spots now, holds to 30 for 5-5. “Rafa Nadal couldn’t have asked for a better birthday gift than this Nishikori - Paire match,” Aditi Modi says. “Regardless of the outcome of this match, its length, and the fact that it’ll get over today, can only bode well for the defending champion.” Defiant to the last, Kei Nishikori makes it 0-15 with a glorious passing shot. At 15-all Benoit Paire double-faults. Uh oh. Oh dear. Then he nets a backhand volley to give Nishikori two break points. To be fair there wasn’t much he could do with an excellent backhand from Nishikori. He saves the first with a big serve for 30-40 - but Nishikori takes the second with a stonking forehand return to break back! Paire served for the match and didn’t come close to getting over the line. What a match this is turning out to be. Serving at 3-4, Kei Nishikori finds himself down a break point. He comes up with a huge, deep, brave forehand to save it. Benoit Paire is making chances. Soon he has another - and this time he belts a backhand return down the line! He’ll serve for the match at 5-3. The French crowd love it. “Allez Benoit!” they cry.In less dramatic news, Novak Djokovic has broken already in the third set on Philippe-Chatrier. He leads 6-3, 6-2, 2-0.But Benoit Paire is so inconsistent. He’s up 40-15 on his own serve. Before long he’s looking to the heavens after being broken. Nishikori, who has plenty of weapons of his own, is back in this increasingly dramatic fifth set!Kei Nishikori comes through a tough deuce game to hold. But Benoit Paire, who’s hitting his groundstrokes so beautifully, leads 4-2.Novak Djokovic has raced into a two-set lead. It’s only taken an hour. He leads Jan-Lennard Struff 6-3, 6-2.Benoit Paire is on his way to beating Kei Nishikori. He’s a break up in the fifth set.Novak Djokovic is a set and a break to the good against Jan-Lennard Struff, who has a sort of faraway look on his face at the moment. The German’s wondering what on earth he can do to break down the Djokovic wall. Indeed he’s soon in danger of going down two breaks, at which point he nets a forehand. Djokovic leads 6-3, 3-0.Kei Nishikori only does five-setters. Benoit Paire nails a backhand down the line on set point and despite holding two match points in the tie-break - both on his own serve, for crying out loud - Nishikori is going the distance again. Clearly he doesn’t like rest. Paire, having won the tie-break 10-8, will fancy himself now.Benoit Paire wastes a set point. Kei Nishikori wastes a second match point, a backhand flashing wide. On they go. 8-8.Here’s a report on Ashleigh Barty’s win over Sofia Kenin.Benoit Paire saves a match point in magnificent style, giving a lame second serve from Kei Nishikori the treatment. It’s 6-6 in the tie-break. Elsewhere Novak Djokovic has the first set in the bag against Struff."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f09db6085f4acea1578a337d55910b5f9bd18c91/0_495_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54a0205718c3cd36ee43a6bdee81dea8","title":"san francisco ballet review shostakovich edith wharton bjork","story":"Sadler’s Wells, London A season of 10 UK premieres opens with a cold-hearted Edith Wharton tale, Soviet struggles with Shostakovich, and an X-rated artpop classStylish, forward-thinking, technically impressive, San Francisco Ballet carries all the hallmarks of its home city. The California company has an admirable commitment to new work and this season of four programmes features 10 ballets all new to the UK.The opening programme (A) is dedicated to Alexei Ratmansky’s Shostakovich Trilogy. Ratmansky is a master choreographer and his work’s immediate watchability belies some inner secrets to unlock. This triptych is steeped in Soviet Russia – the system under which Ratmansky grew up and Shostakovich struggled to conform to – from exploded iconography (hammer and stars) hanging over the stage to images of fear, unity, power, order and despair.Ratmansky clearly has an affinity with Shostakovich’s mercurial music. The first ballet, Symphony #9, sets up the connection with the score as paramount. In every switch and turn of mood the dancers are there: the breezy buoyancy, the knowing humour, the luxuriantly stretched lines. Ratmansky makes use of classical ballet’s inheritance while casting it anew. He corrals the corps de ballet into unison shapes – a single body amplified into solid geometry – while soloists pull off casual moments of audacious virtuosity. Notable among the excellent dancers is Sofiane Sylve, who brings hard-edged glamour to the Balanchine-esque Piano Concerto #1.The trilogy’s central section, the Chamber Symphony, has Ulrik Birkkjaer representing the composer himself (the symphony was said to be autobiographical). There’s a sense that what we’re seeing is the artist’s fantasy, his memories, muses, the materials of his creative world – sometimes within his grip, sometimes not, sometimes thwarted by the system around him.The company’s second programme (B) showcases three very different choreographers. There’s the elevated beauty of Edwaard Liang’s The Infinite Ocean, inspired by Olafur Eliasson’s Weather Project installation at Tate Modern (AKA The Big Sun). It’s a piece that glows and shimmers, not quite touching reality, and features the inely snaking port de bras of Yuan Yuan Tan.Then there’s the storytelling prowess of Cathy Marston in Snowblind, a cleverly condensed retelling of Edith Wharton’s novella Ethan Frome. Birkkjaer’s Ethan is straitjacketed by duty to his needy but dominant wife (Jennifer Stahl), whose presence is so cold that when she puts a hand on her maid Mattie’s shoulder it’s as if the chill has been conducted into Mattie’s bones. Marston uses a small chorus of dancers to create the storm of swirling snow in a piece that’s stripped back, yet strong on atmosphere.From sober literature to artpop, a ballet set to the songs of Björk sounds amazing but it’s the only dud note. Arthur Pita (who devised the decor as well as the choreography) has gone all out with the visuals: mini silver palm trees dropping from the sky, tinsel, masks, Marco Morante’s ornate bodystocking costumes turning the cast into odd gods and exotic creatures. Perhaps it’s all trying too hard.Maybe it’s not Pita’s intention but Björk Ballet doesn’t feel very true to the spirit of the Icelandic icon. Her music can be deeply romantic and intimate, but she’s never resorted to sexy cliche. Yet here, her song Bachelorette comes with flesh and harem pants like an X-rated Aladdin. The work is not without its highlights, but the ballet-rave climax to Hyperballad comes off more like a balletcise class at the gym. Euphoria is elusive.• Programmes C and D continue at Sadler’s Wells, London, until 8 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/696dd32f5ed9131064e9095c62d2116dfbf7c200/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2096e81d6cf66d13895927d9e69f343","title":"britain best walk the cleveland way north york moors","story":"There are hundreds of real beauties but Kevin Rushby has a soft spot for the ‘sustained glory’ of this North York Moors classic, celebrating its 50th anniversary this yearWhat is the most spectacular walk in Britain? The ridges of Helvellyn, Snowdon or the Cuillins? Perhaps parts of the South West or the Pembrokeshire Coast Paths? All are great contenders, but for sheer sustained glory you would be hard pushed to beat the Cleveland Way’s coastal section between Staithes and Filey. I’ve done it several times, in both directions, and never failed to be satisfied. And yet, approximately half of the 110-mile path is inland, starting in Helmsley and taking a huge loop north then east before reaching the coast at Saltburn-by-the-Sea, 10 miles north of Staithes. I had never walked any of that moorland section, but this year, as the Cleveland Way celebrates its 50th birthday, I decide to put that right.We start on a Friday: myself, partner Sophie and Wilf the fell terrier. Our plan was to begin near Osmotherley, 30-odd miles inland, and do the whole northern edge of the North York Moors, plus a 10-mile coastal section south from Saltburn to Staithes. But we are late and so begin at Kildale, a few miles further east, where there is a small railway station on the Middlesbrough-to-Whitby line (incidentally, a strong contender for most spectacular railway).The weather gets wilder as we approach Roseberry Topping, a sturdy outlying peak the shape of a mini volcano. On the summit it’s scarcely possible to stand, and even Wilf seems glad to descend into the trees below. He’s even gladder when we get to our first halt, the King’s Head in Newton under Roseberry, as it’s dog-friendly, with treats on the bar and a comfy bed in the corner – which he immediately occupies. The pub has been renovated with spacious rooms and a friendly atmosphere. Sophie thinks the food “a bit unimaginative” (I’d say, “decent portions”). As for Wilf, he can’t believe he’s allowed a fried egg.In the morning we are asked what do we want in our bait? There’s a pause. It turns out that “bait” is local dialect for packed lunch, an indication perhaps of how close the sea is. Back in the 18th century, when young James Cook was born a few miles from here, the coast was where everyone went to seek their fortune. Cook himself walked to Staithes and found his first job.As we leave, a greenfinch perches on a wire, an omen for a day of wild nature. The wind has gone and the sun is out. Up on the moor all the ponds are full of frogspawn and the frogs are honking with glee. Curlews come warbling over. Lapwings do crazy aerial cartwheels. The path is largely a well-made, stone-flagged trail that curls along the escarpment, dips through woods, and stutters around some housing. In places, the waymarking is poor, but a local voice always seems to pipe up: “Doing the Cleveland Way? Go down here…”Eventually we drop into a steep-sided wooded valley where a lovely river winds down under a viaduct and takes us into Saltburn. Close to the town, the valley sides have been restored to their 19th-century splendour. In fact, Saltburn is a quite splendid discovery, presiding over a huge swathe of sandy beach, a cliff railway and a pier. There’s a surf shop and great fish and chip restaurant too: it’s a kind of funky Victoriana.When I take Wilf down for a run on the sand a bit later, I am half-expecting to see the locals surfing in top hats and tailcoats, but an icy wind is slicing in from the north, so they are just standing on the pier, looking at the waves, dressed in T-shirts.We stay at the Spa Hotel, conveniently right on the Cleveland Way, and also dog-friendly. We retreat to the comfy bar and restaurant. Wilf can’t believe his luck again: more treats on the counter.Next morning we have sunshine and a few miles of coastal walking. While villages to the south have become tourist honeypots, this section of coast remains staunchly undeveloped for visitors, yet no less spectacular. In Skinningrove, we get an instant coffee at the corner shop and admire the public toilets – built in memory of the shipwrecked crew of a Norwegian barque stranded here in 1901. The sandy beach is stunning, and empty.The last section of path takes us up to 203 metres, over the highest sea cliffs on the east coast of England, before we drop down to our finish in Staithes, arguably the prettiest village, with the Cod and Lobster, the best pub. Across the cobbled lane is the place where James Cook worked, standing in the grocer’s window, staring out to sea. My affection for the remainder of the path ahead, all the way to Filey, is unwavering, but my favourite hike has just got longer.• The trip was provided by the North York Moors national park.

Already, it’s shaping up to be a phenomenal viewing yearby  Kate Abbott and  Gwilym MumfordDaisy Haggard’s downbeat gem took on a tough topic – a woman’s return to her home town after a stretch behind bars – and turned it into a meditation on grief, regret and the passing of time, though with enough gags to keep things zipping along.What we said: A few episodes into Back to Life, I felt like pushing it away in protest. “No, no!” I cried inwardly. “It’s too much! It’s too good!” Read the full reviewIn its second season, this black comedy about a hitman who catches the acting bug took its story into darker territory, with Barry’s attempts to extricate himself from his past life only dragging him further into oblivion. Things aren’t going to end well.What we said: Though it’s a comedy rather than a thriller, Barry replicates much of what made Breaking Bad irresistible. Read moreAfter five virtually flawless sitcom seasons, Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson’s millennial kweens went out in the same way they came in: with gross-out gags, madcap surrealism and one of the greatest on-screen friendships in TV history.What we said: This season has given Abbi and Ilana the best possible send-off. It has been joyful, silly and wild, and while it feels like the perfect and necessary time to wrap up their adventures, it is poignant that they’ve done so by reminding you just how good those can be. Read moreAnother comedy that went out on a high, Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney’s tale of floundering parents managed to deliver more home truths about the family unit, pay fond tribute to late guest star Carrie Fisher – and offer up one of the most shocking endings in recent TV history.What we said: From first to last, Catastrophe has been an unremitting triumph. Read the full reviewAlready sitting atop IMDb’s top 250 TV shows list before the final episode has even aired, Sky and HBO’s restaging of the Soviet nuclear disaster captures the ineptitude, corruption and horror at its core.What we said: Chernobyl is a disaster movie, a spy movie, a horror movie, a political thriller, and a human drama, and it spins each plate expertly. The terror is unflinching and explicit, and its images of burned bodies collapsing into putrid decay are impossible to forget. Yet it never feels shocking for the sake of it, only as haunting and horrible as its subject matter demands. Read moreAfter years spent hinting at the damage done to our planet by the climate crisis , David Attenborough finally laid out the threat in all its magnitude, in a documentary that may just have turned sceptics into believers.What we said: This is a rousing call to arms. It is an alarm clock set at a horrifying volume. Read the full reviewE4’s comedy accurately captured the loneliness and mundanity, but also the sense of community, that comes with picking up a controller. All that, and it was as addictive as an all-night Fifa session to boot.What we said: This wickedly entertaining new sitcom may have been inspired by the massive success of online games like World of Warcraft but, thankfully, you are not required to know your Azeroth from your elbow to enjoy it. Read moreOne of last year’s surprise hits, Lisa McGee’s Northern Irish comedy didn’t let things slip in its second season, with its quartet still finding teenage kicks in the midst of the Troubles. The scene in which teens from both sides of the sectarian ide unleashed a barrage of stereotypes about each other (“Protestants hate ABBA!”) is among the year’s funniest.What we said: Derry Girls’ magic remains intact. The evocation of the 90s is as lightly done as ever (Elizabeth Hurley is fleetingly referenced – “She’s a total ride, but she paperclips her frocks together”) and the Troubled setting never overwhelms but simply throws into relief the ordinariness of the girls’ lives in the middle of extraordinary depths of conflict. Read the full reviewPulling off a state-of-the-Brexit-nation series looked a tall order, but Toby Jones’s understated comedy-drama was taller, finding humour and pathos in its tale of a coach driver who discovers a refugee hiding in his wheel arch and a body washed up on the beach.What we said: If it is a comedy, it is one with the bleakest tragedy at its heart. But whatever label you put on it, it is a fine, fine piece of work. Read the full reviewBack for its second (and, as it turned out, final) outing, Fleabag added a hot priest into the already heady mix of biting wit and family dysfunction – and it built to a heart-rending ending with a wedding, a mad dash to the airport … and a fox. Unforgettable.What we said: Series two raised the bar. Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s risks were so impressive all one could do was shake one’s head in appreciation. Read the full reviewDid the gargantuan fantasy drama stick the landing in its final season? That’s an argument for the comments section, but both in the scale of its six episodes, and the fevered discussion they prompted, it was unquestionably the TV event of the year.What we said: The ending was true to the series’ overall subject – war, and the pity of war – and, after doing a lot of wrong to several protagonists, it did right by those left standing. When you play the Game of Thrones, you win or you die. Overall, I think, it won. Read the full reviewSally Wainwright travelled back in time for her latest piece of thrillingly human Yorkshire drama, with this real life tale of Anne Lister. Suranne Jones has received rave reviews for her portrayal of the 19th-century industrialist and diarist, who developed a code to hide her lesbianism.What we said: It’s Regency Fleabag! Because the heroine occasionally breaks the fourth wall and exteriorises her inner monologue. But it’s set in Halifax in 1832, so it could be Northern Jane Austen. Then again, it’s about Anne Lister, who has been dubbed the first modern lesbian, so maybe it’s Queer Brontë ... You can afford to have a little fun with Gentleman Jack Sally Wainwright clearly has. Read the full reviewThe Horrible Histories team offered up more unashamedly silly comedy with this spirited sitcom about a group of ghouls going to war with the new owners of a crumbling mansion.What we said: In making us giggle at the supernatural, Ghosts is very British. But it is American in the sense of having a gag-to-airtime ratio much higher than British sitcoms normally manage these days. Read the full reviewThis deliriously absurd sketch show from a former Saturday Night Live player was hailed immediately as one of the greatest Netflix shows to date.What we said: I wolfed down the entire series in one sitting, genuinely incapacitated with laughter. And then I watched it all again. I’m at the stage where I’m cherrypicking sketches now, but I’ve seen my favourites six or seven times. I’m fully obsessed at this point. At its peak, I think I Think You Should Leave might be one of the funniest things I have ever seen. Read moreA devastating four-hour exposé of alleged child sexual abuse by Michael Jackson. Wade Robson and James Safechuck chillingly and plausibly outlined their accounts of childhood grooming by the man that they, and the whole world, worshipped.What we said: An astonishing piece of work. Relentlessly spare and unsensationalist, it manages better than any other in its genre not to let its attention wander from the survivors’ testimony. Footage of Jackson is confined almost wholly to that of him with the boys themselves on stage, private calls between them and family snaps. He is never allowed to overwhelm the story. Read the full reviewJed Mercurio’s police corruption masterpiece returned for a fifth outing after a two-year wait, bringing with it a stunningly complex performance from Stephen Graham, more urgent exits required … and heartstopping, jaw-dropping action to the last.What we said: As ever, nothing is wasted not a scene, not a line, not a beat. It fits together flawlessly – you can imagine Mercurio sitting like a watchmaker at his table with the parts spread before him and fitting the loupe to his eye before assembling the whole thing and listening for its perfectly regulated tick. Read the full reviewStefan Golaszewski’s sitcom tour de force ended on a heartwarming high. Over three lovely series, Lesley Manville and Peter Mullan as Cathy and Michael gave us the gift of a quietly epic romance that will echo down the ages – and kept the tears in our eyes.What we said: Mum might have looked like it was just a sitcom, but it had something beautiful to say about love and loss. It’s said it. Read the full reviewAssembling the largest collection of trans actors in televisual history, Ryan Murphy’s big-hearted drama about the voguing scene in 1980s New York had style, grace, swagger and sass for days. What’s not to love?What we said: Razzle-dazzle showmanship isn’t Pose’s only source of infectious joy. Watching the slow, still-unfolding process of these characters becoming more and more their true selves is as exhilarating as the opening bars of Cheryl Lynn’s Got to be Real. Self-actualisation isn’t easy, but it sure is beautiful. Read the full reviewFollowing a young woman with a form of OCD called Pure O, which manifests as constant invasive thoughts about sex, this comedy-drama was among the year’s frankest and most fearless TV.What we said: The drama and the gags are never sacrificed to worthy exposition, virtue-signalling or finger-wagging, but, at the same time, the series has so evidently been made in good faith that you can surrender to it entirely, never fearing that it will put a foot wrong. Read the full reviewA hipster Groundhog Day, but also so much more, Natasha Lyonne’s comedy about a thirtysomething trapped in a time loop of death and rebirth proved a truly mind-bending proposition.What we said: Russian Doll is an acquired taste. But do persist: there is such a fine, idiosyncratic, impressive show nested within. Read the full reviewGillian Anderson starred as Jean, a sex therapist whose son Otis (Asa Butterfield) – though too anxious to masturbate himself – sets up a sex advice service at school. A punchy, horny comedy, with the added bonus of the fantastic Ncuti Gatwa as Otis’s best friend Eric. Worth watching for his heroic prom outfit alone.What we said: Endlessly and seemingly effortlessly funny, in a naturalistic way that doesn’t have you listening for the hooves of the next gag thundering down a well-worn track but, like Catastrophe, catches you almost unawares and makes you bark with laughter. Read the full reviewArthur Cary’s thoughtful, wonderful and always dignified 90-minute documentary heard the stories of some of the last living people who survived concentration camps as children. A very important work indeed.What we said: For an hour and a half, I was crying, especially when Cary followed three generations of Holocaust survivors to Auschwitz, knowing all the time that tears are not enough. Nor guilt. Read the full reviewHow would you react if you could barely get cast as Man Who Smells Fart in an advert while your kid brother became a Bieber-esque teen hearthrob overnight? That’s the premise of this brilliant satire, which skewers our pop-culture-obsessed society spectacularly.What we said: It has heart, charm, steel, belly laughs and a gimlet eye. Get on it. Read the full reviewJohn Hannah and Kelly Macdonald starred in an intelligent drama about a vigilante attack on a potential child killer that managed to ask ever more challenging questions as its episodes rolled on.What we said: It is a drama that resonates with its time by asking what constitutes a victim and how much leeway we allow in bestowing that status. Do they have to be perfect? How sure do we have to be? And what happens when the perpetrator becomes a victim too, of a different kind? Read the full reviewShane Meadows reunited with This is England star Stephen Graham for an unflinching drama about a troubled dad attempting to reunite with his long-lost sister and process childhood sexual abuse.What we said: Unspoken pain infuses every scene, every gesture and expression from Stephen Graham and in doing so lays the foundations to do justice to the suffering of victims everywhere. Read the full reviewLiza Williams’s three-part documentary revisited one of the biggest – and longest – murder manhunts in British history, taking us back to a time so different it seemed almost foreign.What we said: At its best, Williams’ series – with its mixture of archive footage and new interviews – is a social document. The hindsight it offers is not primarily about the mishandling of the investigation, but of the grim tone of the times. Read the full reviewThe excruciating monkey tennis-pitcher went back to the BBC for a One Show-style magazine programme. Inevitably – and hilariously for viewers – it wasn’t the smoothest of returns.What we said: We get the heroes we deserve, and as you finish writhing in agony and lie limp from laughter, hatred, panic, despair or in awe at the end of another half-hour in his appalling company, you can only reflect that if Brexit means Alan then the whole business just got more complicated still. Read the full reviewA last hurrah for Julia Louis-Dreyfus’s mendacious yet incompetent vice-president, in a political satire that was perfectly attuned for these most buffoonish of times.What we said: Louis-Dreyfus has won a record six Emmy awards for her role as Selina Meyer, and, frankly, it’s no wonder. She is magnificent, brittle and furiously amoral. In this seventh and final season of Veep, it appears to be getting out while it still has a hope in hell of making its fictional world look more comedic than the real one. Read the full reviewAva DuVernay’s staggering miniseries about the Central Park Five showed how a group of young boys came to be falsely convicted for raping a young white woman in 1989. It is unbearably harrowing to watch the boys, as young as 13, get violently coerced by police into giving confessions.What we said: The performances are uniformly astonishing – especially from the central five, Asante Blackk, Caleel Harris, Ethan Herisse, Marquis Rodriguez and Jharrel Jerome, most of whom are just a few years older than the teens they are playing. They capture the innocence, in all senses, of children, and the permanence of its loss. It feels like a great privilege to see them. Read the full reviewRussell T Davies’s hugely ambitious drama followed a family through the next 15 years of British life, taking in the migrant crisis, terrifying technological innovations and Trump’s increasingly fraught face-off with China.What we said: For a series that compresses 15 years into six hours, it seems to pass in the blink of an eye thanks to Russell T Davies’s trademark humour, compassion and the kinetic energy with which he infuses every project. We do not deserve Davies, but thank God he’s here. Read the full reviewFollowing her projects about breasts and penises, artist Laura Dodsworth photographed a range of women’s vulvas, then showed the sitters their vaginal portraits and interviewed them for their responses. The result? Intimate, empowering television, unlike anything that has ever aired before.What we said: A gently but relentlessly radical documentary. It’s not until you see a full set of female genitals filling your screen that you realise how little you see anything of or about them in wider culture.

As the Up series hits 63, the man whose story gripped a nation explains why he won’t be watchingWhen Seven Up first aired in May 1964, it featured 14 very different seven-year-olds, all revealing their thoughts and aspirations to the camera. The prep school boys were already eyeing Charterhouse and Cambridge. East Ender Lynn Johnson wanted to work in Woolworths. The curveball was Neil Hughes, a moptopped little Liverpudlian who announced: “I want to be an astronaut.”The title of that first series came from an old Jesuit saying: “Give me the child until he is seven and I will give you the man.” The seven-yearly series returns this week with 63 Up. Did Hughes make it into space? “You know what kids are like,” he laughs as we meet for coffee at a hotel in Penrith, Cumbria. “If they’d filmed me a week later, I might have said something completely different.” The moptop is gone, too.While the posh boys became barristers and Johnson a librarian, the Up cameras tracked Hughes’s dramatic experiences with depression, squats, homelessness and destitution. And then 42 Up revealed his remarkable transformation into a Liberal Democrat councillor and a lay preacher. (He also stood, unsuccessfully, at the 2010 general election.)Although his ups and downs have gripped viewers for decades, Hughes is keen to point out – genially – that Up is very much director Michael Apted’s “interpretation” of his life. “For most people,” he says, “what’s on TV is more real than the truth. But people must remember that there’s someone behind the camera.” Hughes stopped watching the series after 21 Up. In fact, he virtually stopped watching TV altogether. “People tell me I’m portrayed as triumphing over the odds,” he says. “But that’s not how I see my life at all. I’m grateful for the successes, but I see my life ultimately as a failure. I’ve failed in almost everything I’ve tried to do.”He describes himself as “reclusive” and “a bit eccentric”. He doesn’t own a mobile phone and finds modern society baffling: “How can anyone want to spend their time tapping away on a device?” But he was so keen for the world to hear his side of his story that he penned an autobiography: it exists in a single, unpublished hard copy. “It’s my truth, in case anyone is interested.”So what did happen to that gentle, hopeful little boy who charmed a nation by skipping happily to school? Picked for Seven Up for his enthusiasm and opinions, Hughes, the son of two teachers, says he had a happy childhood, though not quite as idyllic as depicted. “We had family arguments. You’d go on holiday all cheerful and come back in a silent car.” In 14 Up, however, he was agitated and complained of being unable to relax. “I went to a rough school and got bullied a lot,” he says. “I got beaten up several times and, to be fair, I beat people up as well.” At the age of 16, he was diagnosed with a “nervous complaint”. He adored literature and, after reading Brideshead Revisited, dreamed of going to Oxford. He got the required grades but flunked the admission exam. “I think I misquoted someone,” he sighs. It haunted him for years. He spent six months hitchhiking to toughen himself up. “When I think of the risks I took, the places I stayed, the people I associated with, I swallow hard.” He ended up at Aberdeen university, studying languages and law when Scottish nationalist students mounted what he calls a “soviet-style takeover” of student halls. “If you were not Scots, then woe betide you. Nobody threatened me, but it was a horrible atmosphere.”Dropping out after the first term, he slid into years of menial jobs and life on benefits, to the chagrin of his father. He worked in hotels and as a grouse-beater. “You don’t actually beat the grouse,” he laughs, and I realise that the Up cameras have not done a great job of capturing his warm, dry sense of humour. “But if they were half-killed, then you had to wring their necks. As a teenager you don’t care, but later you think, ‘What am I doing to serve the planet?’”In 28 Up, he was homeless in the Highlands, sleeping in sheds, while 35 Up found him on a council estate on Shetland, visibly struggling with his mental health, but he says it wasn’t quite the torrid time the show presented. “When I got there, a quarter of the community had no television,” he says. “But being completely isolated, you learn to depend on the few people who are there, and also to be more robust.” He read avidly, overcame his rejection of religion and realised the power of community. “I knew I had to go into politics. Shetland changed me as a person. And the northern lights – spectacular!”By 42 Up, everything had transformed again, thanks to another Seven Up participant. In that very first series, boarding school boy Bruce Balden said he wanted to help poorer people. After seeing Hughes’s struggles, his adult version – who had taught in Bangladesh and London’s East End – reached out, putting Hughes up at his home in London, then finding him a basement flat in Hackney, where he finally obtained a degree via the Open University. “Bruce was a great help,” Hughes smiles. “I couldn’t hold down a job, but I wanted to contribute to society.”When he first went along to Hackney Lib Dems, the “ruthlessness” shocked him. “One guy would stop at nothing to get what he wanted,” he says. “I didn’t think I was tough enough for that world, but when we knocked on doors my experiences meant I could chat to anybody, whatever their situation. I didn’t have to make anything up.” Finally, tiring of London politics, he visited friends in Cumbria – a childhood holiday haunt – and stayed, eventually swapping his caravan for a housing association cottage. “Politics is very different here,” he says. “I enjoy helping people, empowering communities.”These days, he ides his time between his councillor duties, the church and voluntary work in an Oxfam shop. This week’s 63 Up reveals that he got married – to a woman he met in panto – but after four years the relationship ended, owing to his recurring low moods. “I’ve still not got over that.”His parents have died, too, but there had been a reconciliation. “I got on better with my mum when she had dementia,” he says with a sigh. “All my life, she’d been trying to mould me into something I wasn’t. But by the end she seemed to accept the way I was.” Hughes seems to view his own life as one of shattered dreams. “If I’d been successful, I’d have been in Westminster, stopping this hideous government or I’d be in theatre, directing what I wanted.”That said, he recently helped to get rid of a “rubbish council”, is campaigning passionately to restore the Keswick-Penrith railway line – and he still dares to dream. “If you can change the neighbourhood you live in,” he says, “you can change the world.” His eyes are sparkling, just like the eyes of that would-be astronaut back in 1964.• 63 Up is on ITV at 9pm on 4, 5 and 6 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ce68da0bb0ec899388102f1a5a899952885232a/35_15_1154_692/master/1154.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89bbe1f3045d6737e85656e4be04c0ee","title":"new york city whale sightings increase","story":"A total of 272 whales were spotted last year, compared with five in 2011, thanks to legislation mopping up pollution, experts sayFor most New Yorkers, wildlife spotting is confined to squirrels, the odd raccoon and anguished encounters with rats. But in the waters surrounding the city a very different animal experience is quietly booming: sightings of whales.A total of 272 whales were spotted in New York City waters last year, according to the citizen science group Gotham Whale. That is an extraordinary leap from 2011, when just five of the huge cetaceans were witnessed frolicking near the most populated urban area in the US.The sightings, almost all of humpbacks, have been logged by Gotham Whale members who are building a catalogue of known iniduals, of which there are currently 112. The organization is partnered with American Princess Cruises, which has restarted annual summer voyages from Queens to take spotters and tourists out to spy the vast aquatic mammals.“The numbers keep increasing and increasing very dramatically,” said Paul Sieswerda, who was a curator at the New York Aquarium for two decades before starting Gotham Whale.“Humpbacks were nearly hunted to extinction but the populations are coming back. The whales aren’t common knowledge in New York but word is getting out. People go crazy when they see them. They are amazed.”Sieswerda said the increase in sightings was down to a confluence of happy events, including legislation such as the Clean Water Act and Endangered Species Act that have mopped up pollution flowing from the Hudson River and helped safeguard humpbacks from direct harm.Cleaner water from the Hudson is bringing nutrients that feed a fish called menhaden, also known as bunker. Menhaden are a key prey species for humpback whales, with juveniles congregating to gulp down the fish.“The whales are coming to eat the world famous cuisine in New York,” Sieswerda said.The surge in sightings has spawned a number of cetacean celebrities, including Gotham, a whale that entered New York harbour in 2016 and carried on up the Hudson, startling people looking down from apartments on the Upper West Side.A separate whale was pictured breaking through the water to scoop up a tight formation of fish, the Empire State Building in the background. This whale, regularly seen and identified by a distinctive scar from a boat propeller, was named Jerry by the Grateful Dead fan who took the image. Most of the whales are spotted near the Rockaways, along Long Island and close to the New Jersey shore.The apparent rebound of humpbacks near one of the busiest ports in the world tallies with an overall recovery of the species in the western Atlantic, even as species such as the North Atlantic right whale are threatened by extinction due to fishing net entanglements and environmental disruption.Scientists are yet to see a full picture of the state of New York’s whale population, however. In April, the Wildlife Conservation Society’s New York Aquarium and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution deployed two new acoustic buoys, to monitor whales even when boats are not nearby. It is hoped the project will help detect minke and fin whales, as well as more regularly sighted humpbacks.“It’s a really exciting time, I think it’s a great opportunity for people to get out there and see whales in New York waters,” said Howard Rosenbaum, senior scientist at the New York Aquarium. “It’s fantastic that you can go out from the Rockaways less distance than most New Yorkers commute on the subway each day and get to see some of the largest animals on the planet.”Rosenbaum pointed out that it can be hard to ascertain if the increased sightings are down to a growing population or simply a growing number of people taking the time to look. Longer-term and more complete research will be needed.“We have to be careful when we are talking about New York whale populations, but it is safe to say whales are being seen with increasing regularity and that there is an overall recovery happening among humpbacks,” he said. “Last year was amazing for whale sightings and I hope it’s the same this year.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2a312b7b9a80651399561df7a2f229a87c86f02/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c800d583a881a53c6b74faf4437bfee7","title":"science institute that advised eu and un actually industry lobby group","story":"International Life Sciences Institute used by corporate backers to counter public health policies, says studyAn institute whose experts have occupied key positions on EU and UN regulatory panels is, in reality, an industry lobby group that masquerades as a scientific health charity, according to a peer-reviewed study.The Washington-based International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) describes its mission as “pursuing objectivity, clarity and reproducibility” to “benefit the public good”.But researchers from the University of Cambridge, Bocconi University in Milan, and the US Right to Know campaign assessed over 17,000 pages of documents under US freedom of information laws to present evidence of influence-peddling.The paper’s lead author, Dr Sarah Steele, a Cambridge university senior research associate, said: “Our findings add to the evidence that this nonprofit organisation has been used by its corporate backers for years to counter public health policies. ILSI should be regarded as an industry group – a private body – and regulated as such, not as a body acting for the greater good.”In a 2015 email copied to ILSI’s then director, Suzanne Harris, and executives from firms such as Coca-Cola and Monsanto, ILSI’s founder Alex Malaspina, a former Coca-Cola vice-president, complained bitterly about new US dietary guidelines for reducing sugar intake.Malaspina – whom Coca-Cola describes as a “longtime scientific and regulatory affairs leader” – said he expected many nations to follow the new guidelines, adding: “We have to consider how to become ready to mount a strong defence.”According to ILSI’s declared mandatory principles, it “may not directly or indirectly propose public policy solutions or advocate the commercial interests of their member companies or other parties”.Kristin DiNicolantonio, ILSI Global’s communication director, told the  that “under no circumstance does ILSI protect industry from being affected by disadvantageous policy and laws”.The study, published on Monday in the journal Globalization and Health, found that when ILSI’s regional offices failed to promote industry-friendly messaging, they were subjected to sanctions.In another email from 2015, Malaspina wrote: “About the mess ILSI Mexico is in because they sponsored in September a sweeteners conference when the subject of soft drinks taxation was discussed. ILSI is now suspending ILSI Mexico, until they correct their ways. A real mess.”ILSI says its Mexican affiliate was suspended for “engaging in activities that can be construed to be policy advocacy”.Around this time, ILSI was caught up in a separate controversy, when the  revealed that ILSI Europe’s vice-president Prof Alan Boobis chaired a UN panel that found glyphosate was probably not carcinogenic to humans.The final panel report included no conflict of interest statements, even though ILSI Europe had received donations of $500,000 (£344,234) fromMonsanto, which uses glyphosate in its RoundUp weedkiller, and $528,500 from its industry representative, Croplife International.Corporate figures from companies including Monsanto, Kraft and Nestlé have sat on ILSI’s board, although DiNicolantonio said they did so “in an inidual capacity”.In 2012, the European parliament suspended funding to the European Food Safety Authority (Efsa) for six months over a string of conflicts of interest allegations involving ILSI members on its own board. A separate parliamentary inquiry into the group in 2017 contributed to new EU transparency rules.The food group Mars last year announced that it would break its ties with ILSI, whose work it described as “advocacy-led”.But former and current ILSI officials continue to play key roles in the EU’s science advisory mechanism, which recently produced a report that recommends a slew of industry positions on pesticides. These would, for example, replace current rules outlawing any products that could harm human health with a US-style concept of “acceptable risk”.PAN-E alleges that eight of the 12 EU pesticides risk assessments that it studied had their regulatory use “designed andor promoted” by the industry.Over the course of 2015, a World Health Organization (WHO) move to distance itself from ILSI due to links between one of its members and the tobacco industryprovoked a degree of internal anxiety in ILSI, according to the new study.One email exchange between the University of Washington’s Prof Adam Drewnowski and Malaspina led to suggestions of a direct approach to the WHO director, Margaret Chan.Drewnowski wrote that Chan had “said that she was ready to be ‘at the table – but not in bed – with industry’ (her own phrase). Since then, her position has hardened considerably. We should remind her of her own phrase and get her to the table.”If a dialogue could not be started, Chan “will continue to blast us with significant negative consequences on a global basis”, he continued. “This threat to our business is serious.”In emailed comments, DiNicolantonio said that any suggestion that ILSI had attempted to influence Chan over sugar-sweetened products was “unfounded and inaccurate”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c26d713125ece83663439de890f58a0b86a06aa2/0_0_1520_912/master/1520.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b137929fa58b3327085b8a17f33dbea3","title":"the president of the united states cant talk like this to the very queen of england","story":"Donald Trump is having tea with Queen Elizabeth II but you can’t get upset"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0edb6eadce1862ef8f884cf5d1bc32b40f012a15/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=275f357b88da4cbcc6c5b6c93c6cf68e","title":"d day 75th anniversary interviews","story":"The stories of those who were there on 6 June 1944 and others involved in this week’s commemorationsThousands of people are preparing to mark the 75th anniversary of the D-day landings at commemoration events in the UK and France this week. Senior politicians and members of the royal family as well as hundreds of veterans will attend ceremonies to mark one of the main turning points of the second world war and the biggest amphibious invasion in military history.More than 200 veterans have boarded a cruise ship, MV Boudicca, charted by the Royal British Legion, to attend the events, while others are descending en masse on Portsmouth and Normandy. Here we hear the stories of those who were there on 6 June 1944 and others involved in this week’s commemorations.Percy Lewis, 96, a wireless operator with No 6 Beach Group, spent most of D-day sheltering in the sand dunes off Sword beach. After landing at 11am on a small landing craft, he had to wait for the rest of his battalion to come. “Now and again there were a few shells coming over, but all the infantry and tanks had gone,” he said. The remainder of the second world war, however, would not prove so straightforward for him.Lewis, from Guildford, was evacuated and treated in Staffordshire before returning, this time to the Netherlands. In October 1944, while advancing through the country, his platoon found themselves at night in a small village “somewhere in the Venray area” and occupied the crossroads.But he had to retrace his steps to retrieve some wireless equipment. “I started walking back alone, rifle over my shoulder, and the moon had just come up behind my back. I got a fair way back. Someone shouted: ‘Halt.’ I said: ‘Friend.’ Nothing. I walked a bit further. ‘Halt.’ I said: ‘Friend.’ Nothing. I took the rifle off my shoulder.“There was a row of cottages. A door was open. I thought: ‘I’ll make for that door.’ And just as I got to the door, Jerry stepped out with his rifle on me. I looked at him. He looked at me. I put my hands up. Two German paratroopers about two doors away pushed me into the middle of the road.“I thought: ‘They’ll start shooting in a minute.’ Nothing happened. They took me round the corner, and down into the cellar. And it was full of German paratroopers cleaning all their kit.”With a rifle pushed into his back, he was handed over to a Panzer ision. He was now a prisoner of war, and would be interned in the Stalag XI-B Fallingbostel PoW camp in Germany. It was liberated in April 1945.“Eleven of us go to Normandy, to Arromanches, every year,” said Lewis, who has regularly given the exultation on the seafront during the annual commemorations.Ron Smith, 94, an electrician (then known as a wireman) from Rustington, West Sussex, was on landing craft tank (LCT) 947, which approached Sword beach at 7.35am on D-day. As troops disembarked, a shell hit one of the tanks on the landing craft, immobilising it and blocking the craft’s exit ramp. Torpedoes on the landing craft exploded, killing the colonel on board and three others. Smith helped wrap up the bodies, as the LCT was forced to retreat and make its way back to Portsmouth.“I helped to lay three of them out,” he said. One was Lt Col Arthur Cocks, the first British officer killed in the landings. “He’s now celebrated in Portsmouth Cathedral with a window,” said Smith.On their final briefings, he said: “We were told we were going to France, ‘and you won’t need a passport’.”But nothing could really prepare for the beach landings. “I don’t reckon a winkle survived on that beach. It was just one heap of explosives – it was amazing the way the tanks went off.“As soon as we landed, our role was to clear off quickly so the next could come in.” But after the LCT was hit, “we couldn’t land anything else”.He spent a week in Portsmouth as the LCT was repaired, then headed back to Normandy. But the LCT hit a mine off the coast of Arromanches, near the Mulberry harbour. The crew managed to swim to a nearby merchant ship, which had been deliberately half-sunk to provide defence for the artificial harbour.“We went up a rope, up three steps, and were over the gunnel on to the deck. Then we went to the wheelhouse. And the only thing we rescued was a huge jar of rum. And we drunk the lot,” said Smith. “There were 12 of us, and we were on there for 14 hours.“Everyone was too busy to rescue us. We had to just stop on there. Eventually a landing craft came alongside and we were off. We were taken to an army camp, and they served us with half a loaf of bread and soup you could stand a spoon up in, and it was the best meal I’ve ever tasted. Amazing.”Smith was then dispatched to the UK, where he recovered from his injuries in a hospital in Scotland. He was later sent to Burma.“It’s a long time ago. This is the most I ever talk about it. I was only 19, that’s all I was,” he said.Marie Scott, 92, a switchboard operator, volunteered for the Women’s Royal Naval Service (WRNS) at 17. She was posted to the labyrinthine Fort Southwick, the underground Combined Operations Underground HQ, and the nerve centre on D-day, which was run from tunnels deep in the cliffs overlooking Portsmouth. On D-day, her job was as a very high frequency (VHF) radio operator, relaying messages to and from the invasion fleet and landing troops.“It was a series of tunnels. Quite spartan,” she said of Fort Southwick. “The tunnels were very deep. We had to go down about 350 steps to get into the tunnels and, indeed, come up 350 steps. But at 17 you could do it.“We had long shifts, so we had to sleep down there as well. There was no natural light. There was no fresh air. So we had air conditioning and electric lights. On and off I was down there certainly for six to nine months, over D-day and after D-day,” she said.“We knew something big was afoot because there was an armada of boats in Portsmouth harbour. That was a giveaway.“The VHF radio was a one-way system. When you raised your lever to transmit, the recipient couldn’t make any interjections until you had finished, and said: ‘Roger and out.’ or whatever. Then they would raise their lever, and transmit their message”.On D-day she was in direct contact with the wireless operators on the allied invasion fleet as they stormed the beaches.“When they raised their lever, I could hear very loud, sustained gunfire. It was really so bad that you thought: ‘Oh my God. There’s a battle going on.’ You knew. You thought: ‘God, men are dying.’ The reality suddenly hit you. For a rather naive 17-year-old, I think it was terrifying. But it was a job. You got on with it.“The messages were all in code, so you didn’t know what was being said. But you could hear the gunfire, every time the lever was lifted. I’ve never forgotten what I heard. Never.”On the 75th anniversary, Scott, from New Malden, Surrey, will be in Normandy, travelling as a guest of the Taxi Charity, that annually takes veterans to Normandy. This year more than 30 taxis will be involved.It will be a special moment for Scott, who after the war became a secretary, married, raised a family and then worked for Surrey county council. She has been awarded the Legion D’Honneur by the French, which will be presented by a French general at a ceremony at the Pegasus museum in Ranville.“I’m deeply honoured, and very humbled. You feel that you can’t be deserving because men laid down their lives. We were the backroom people,” she said. “It’s overwhelming, really. And it’s going to be fantastic.“All that really concerns me is that somebody will be available – hopefully a strapping young soldier or sailor or airman – to help me up the steps!”He saw one LCT break up. “They weren’t really meant for that sort of sea,” said Jennings, from Emsworth, near Chichester.“Apparently, we landed on the wrong side of the beach. It should have been further left, I think, but we didn’t know it at the time. I can still see it. It’s like a ciné film. I can see us coming in and thinking: ‘Well, there were mines on the beach.’ There were all sorts there. Luckily, the tide took us and we landed on a reasonably safe beach.”His abiding memory was wishing “just to get back, to be honest”.Jennings said: “I’m just one of thousands who was doing the job you were trained for. I’m nothing special.” He continued to ferry troops back and forth across the Channel during the liberation.Bill Gladden, 95, who was in the 6th Airborne Armoured Recce Regiment, was 20 years old when he took off from a Dorset airfield on D-day in a Hamilcar glider, which dwarfed the Halifax towing it. It was the first time tanks had been flown into a battlefield, and he was squashed alongside one tank and six motorbikes, weighing a total of 16 tonnes.As they crossed the Channel he climbed on top of the tank to look out of a porthole. But then, suddenly, the towrope dropped. “I felt the towrope go, because once it drops it’s like you hit a brick wall. I couldn’t move, I just hung on, and that’s how I landed in Normandy, spread-eagled on top of a Tetrarch tank.”Their job was to quickly make their way to Ranville Bridge over the Orne, taken earlier in the day, and hold it. He spent his first night in Normandy dug in there, then he moved to an orchard at Ranville. His stay would be brief.“Each day we went out, pretty deep into the countryside, to find out where the Germans were and report back,” said Gladden. “We got chased back a few times.“I’d been there about 12 days. We could hear the Germans start up their tanks of a morning. And, although we used to go out quite a bit, the fighting went on in the Ranville area for a long time.”On 18 June he came back from patrol as usual. “And I was just about to pour the water out and have a brew up when suddenly there was a bang, and I was on my back.” A German Tiger tank had fired on the group. The whole of the front of his ankle was blown off. “I had just my Achilles holding my foot on,” he said.Colleagues carried him to an old barn used to treat casualties. Two days earlier, Gladden had helped carry the bodies of two friends to the same barn. “Little did I know that within the next two days they would be carrying me over.“I didn’t feel any pain at first. When the pain comes on, they start pushing the old morphine into you. And then you sail away.”He remembers coming to a field hospital. Doctors were struggling to save his foot. “‘Amputation considered’: that was on the ticket I read around my neck when I came to, lying on a stretcher on the grass being sick as a dog.”Gladden was evacuated to the UK. He spent the following three years in hospital, with his foot only finally being saved by a sophisticated bone graft involving both his legs being temporarily sewn and plastered together. His foot has troubled him ever since. The injury meant he was discharged from the army on medical grounds.“I count myself very lucky,” said Gladden, from Welling, Kent, who went on to work in the accounts department at Siemens. “I survived, thousands didn’t.”He has returned to Ranville 10 times during recent years, since becoming a widower, and was heading there again for the 75th anniversary of D-day as a guest of the Taxi Charity. “It’s a nostalgic visit. And it is nice to get thanks from the people out there. But I think the main thing is to keep alive the fact that victory didn’t come cheap.“There were thousands of young men who were killed and maimed in those first few days, and we just don’t want any more wars. That’s the way I look at it.”Before the 75th commemorations, seven surviving veterans from the Battle of Normandy and D-day were honoured at an event at the Royal Hospital Chelsea.Chelsea pensioner Bill Fitzgerald, 94, who served with the Sussex regiment and was only 18 at the time, said: “We were the third in on the day. We got so far in and then we hit something underneath, so we knew we were going to get wet.“The beach master was there shouting out: ‘Get off this bloody beach and don’t get killed.’“The water was full of bodies and they were mostly all Marine Commandos – but you couldn’t take too much notice, all you were thinking of was helping each other,” he said. “Looking at the bodies, you felt sorry about it, but you had a job to get on that beach and wait for your friends.”He was injured nine days after D-day in a shelling on 15 June. “We had a horrible day fighting and the tanks decided to stop in the woods,” he said. “Believe me, they shelled the hell out of us.“All I can remember is getting a shell very near me, going up in the air and coming down and one of my friends putting a helmet over my face,” he said, speaking at the Royal Hospital Chelsea last month. His femur was broken in half and he was flown back to the UK on 17 June.“After I was discharged, I got my suit, I got my hat, and you’re outside the door saying: ‘What’s next?’”Chelsea pensioner Frank Mouqué, 94, was a corporal in the Royal Engineers who landed on Sword beach and whose job was to dispose of bombs on a stretch of land beyond the parapet next to the beach.“We approached Sword beach in a landing craft. We had all of our gear on our backs and a rubber ring around our stomach to help keep us afloat. Let’s face it, the landing was very gory. You didn’t have time to think, survival instinct kicked in,” he said in his account published on the Royal Hospital Chelsea’s website.“After reaching the beach, I ran up towards a parapet, and searched for mines. After 12 hours of being on the go we were exhausted and then had to dig a foxhole to sleep in. We had to dig six foot down and two foot wide.“I slept outside for the next year or so, we had no protection from the elements. We had an oversized gas cape to go over our clothes and all our gear. We rarely slept lying down. Each time we slept in a barn we were ravaged by fleas – so even that was no good.“It was a different time: I wasn’t a hero, I was a little cog in a big wheel. When you add all those little cogs together – then we became important. We all worked together towards peace.”Alan Gaudern was born on D-day in Harrogate, North Yorkshire. His father, William, a teacher, would never see him. Serving in Normandy with the Somerset Light Infantry, William was killed on 10 July 1944 at the age of 37. Alan – who has visited Normandy, in particular Hill 112 west of Caen, which his father fought to recapture, and Bayeux war cemetery, where he is buried – has retained his last letters written from the front.The letters, read by Alan, form part of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission’s Voices of Liberation audio archive. During the 75th anniversary commemorations at Portsmouth and Bayeux, there will be installations where the public can listen to many of those voices.William and his wife, Ethel, already had a daughter, Joyce, aged four, when Alan was born. “Alan William was born on 6 June at Harrogate hospital. Ethel and he are both doing well, from what I hear,” William wrote to family friends. “I haven’t see my son and heir yet, so you can guess how much I am looking forward to my next leave. When that will be, I don’t know.”But it was not to be. William’s last letter to Ethel was dated 18 June 1944. He was on the move, he said. “It is a lovely summer morning, so we should have as comfortable a trip as is possible. The countryside was perfect as we came along, so fresh and full of beauty,” he wrote.He enclosed a £5 cheque, sent to him at the front by his father. “Please cash it and spend it on yourself, on something you would really like. I shall look forward to hearing what it is, and later to seeing you wearing it,” he wrote.The letter continues: “You know we’ve faced up to the likelihood that I may not come back. But you know I feel I shall come back because I want to so much. We’ve had a perfect married life together, haven’t we?”He adds: “But if I don’t come back, I want you to know how much I owe to you and to thank you for our lovely life together. And to let you know that it isn’t my wish that you remain a widow if you really fall in love again. I am happy in the knowledge that you’ll bring up Joyce and Alan to be useful and good God-fearing citizens. If I don’t come back, teach them as much nature study as you know, which is a great deal.“I hope we can sit down one day and laugh at what I’ve written. Wish me a happy landings and be a brave lass like you always are. You’re not to worry or else the milk will go sour.”Alan, a retired bank manager, and himself a father, said: “My mother was both mother and father to me and I think she did a good job with that. Yes, I felt as I look back that I would have wished to have a father as a male role model, which is so important. But my mother was an amazing woman.“She was left with a four-year-old and a six-week-old baby to fend for herself. People now don’t realise how difficult it was for war widows. Yes, my mother got a war widow’s pension, but that was taxable. Taxable! For a war widow.”Three generations of William Moody’s family have worked for the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) in France. As supervisor of the sector that takes in Normandy, Moody, 67, has a responsibility for ensuring the Bayeux military cemetery, the largest British second world war cemetery in France, looks perfect for the 75th anniversary.There are 4,144 Commonwealth burials there, each one marked with a white headstone. Maintenance is ongoing throughout the year. Each headstone is cleaned. The turf is fertilised and cropped short to maintain its vivid green. Seasonal plantings include roses, designed to bloom in June on the anniversary.“The headstone is the identity of the soldier, with his badge, and his name and his regiment. So it’s so important. You see old veterans, standing by the graves of perhaps a friend they lost. Sometimes they rest their hand on the headstone. This is their comrade, whom they lost in the landings. As I walk past, I keep very quiet, because they are honouring their comrades. They are here to see their friends. It’s very emotional,” said Moody.“And the plantings, to me, it is as if each one has their own little garden, like they might have done back home, if they had lived. I am proud to be able to honour those that fell and to give them a place that seems like home, although they are sometimes so far from home.“I feel as though I am passing the legacy of remembrance on to future generations, ensuring that we can always come to these remarkable places to reflect on the courage, sacrifice and the real cost in human terms that these men and women made to preserve our freedom.”Moody has worked for 52 years with the CWGC, starting as a pupil gardener. His father, who is from Aberystwyth in Wales, served with the Royal Signals, serving in India before coming to France after the Normandy landings and staying there to work for the CWGC in northern France.He has witnessed many anniversaries at Bayeux, and other CWGC cemeteries throughout Europe and north Africa. But it is the scale of the Bayeux commemorations he always finds so moving. “I am always amazed when I see the veterans go past marching. They try to keep straight, they are soldiers still, and the pride is there. They walk straight, and some of them have difficulties walking, but they still do it, they try to march, and its a huge effort for them, but they want to show the public they are still there,” he said.Col Jeremy Green (retired), is a historian and expert on Southwick House, the Allied HQ near Portsmouth, from where Gen “Ike” Eisenhower made the decision to delay by one day. Green said initially there were huge differences between American and British and Norwegian meteorologists. And had Ike, the supreme allied commander, listened to his fellow Americans, D-day could have been a disaster.“The Americans came here with great enthusiasm based upon an analogue system of taking the weather by a guy called Irving Krick. He basically said if you look at historical weather patterns, and if those conditions are replicated again, the same weather would occur,” said Green. “And the problem for us, the Brits, was he was briefing Eisenhower direct.”The American military initially refused to talk to the British chief meteorologist, James Stagg, “because he was a civilian”, until Stagg was temporarily made a group captain in the Royal Air Force.Stagg was receiving information from weather stations including, crucially, Blacksod Lighthouse in County Mayo, on Ireland’s west coast. A huge depression rapidly moving into the Channel did not augur well for 5 June, the original planned day of the Normandy invasion, thought Stagg. Krick thought 5 June was “good to go”.Ike was living on his nerves, “smoking five packs of cigarettes a day, drinking too much coffee, eating little and sleeping less,” said Green.With disagreements among the meteorologists, Stagg decided it fell to him to give an “unequivocal and firm opinion on the deterioration of the weather”. He told him 5 June would be overcast, stormy, with winds too strong to land troops, and cloud offering just 500ft-to-zero visibility.His words were greeted with silence, said Green.In the end, Eisenhower’s decision rested on Stagg’s opinion that there would be a brief “interlude” on 6 June. Eisenhower made his fateful decision. His diary records that on what should have been invasion day he awoke in the early hours to find “our little camp was shaking and shuddering under a wind of almost hurricane proportions and the accompanying rain seems to be travelling in horizontal streaks”.Stagg had been right. If the invasion had started that morning, it would have failed.Hours later, at the morning meeting, he announced his decision. Trusting Stagg, once more, the invasion was on for 6 June.Commander Craig Wood, of the Portsmouth flotilla, has responsibility for the naval homage to commemorate D-day in the UK.“This is an opportunity to commemorate our comrades who have gone before us, and to salute those who are still with us. And to recognise the phenomenal feat they embarked upon, which, I think, even after 30 years of service, is very difficult to even begin to imagine what that must have been like,” he said.Part of the Portsmouth flotilla’s role during the D-day event is to perform a salute to the 300 veterans aboard the Royal British Legion’s specially chartered MV Boudicca. “As the Boudicca sails with veterans to arrive in Normandy on 6 June, as they did 75 years ago, we are escorting her out, and further RN ships at sea will salute them as they go past,” he said.The frigate andsubmarine hunter HMS St Albans will escort the Boudicca and fire a salute to the veterans on board. The flotilla includes frigates and minehunters taking part in a sailpast in the Solent.“It’s been really heartening to see the young men and women of the armed forces coming together for this. Those same values and standards, the ethos of the armed forces 75 years ago and before, still resonate today,” he said.With the dwindling number of second world war veterans, many have predicted this will be the last such occasion to commemorate D-day.“Never say never,” said Wood. “The 70th anniversary was going to be the last event, and here we are five years later, And we still have a number of veterans. A naval historian once told me that history may not repeat itself, but it sure does rhyme. And it is wonderful we can still engage with the veterans to remind ourselves about what they went through.“It’s humbling to see that spark in their eye as they recall what they did. Their humility is the thing that resonates with me. The ‘I was just doing my job, I played a very small part’. Not one of them would ever claim to be a hero of the day.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/156efb4660dc0f0b1006f90111644226ed034466/0_410_8508_5105/master/8508.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49228dc7628bf857d2cb5cfc144b6d31","title":"three venezuelan families a photo essay","story":"Silvana Trevale left Venezuela in 2011 but has returned to document the ever worsening crisis that has deeply affected families of every economic status. She was selected as the 2018 recipient of the Joan Wakelin Bursary, administrated in partnership with the Royal Photographic SocietyVenezuela, a country that once hoped for wealth and a bright future with its oil reserves and natural resources, is falling to pieces. It faces a humanitarian crisis where families struggle daily to find food, medicine and clean water as they live with collapsing public services. Many attend the ongoing protests, which are frequently violently repressed. Though I left my home in 2011 I have returned to Venezuela to document the ever-worsening crisis that has deeply affected families of every economic status.As a young Venezuelan woman, my focus was to the youth of the country in relation to how the current crisis has harmedtheir past and present, and jeopardised their future. Three families with contrasting realities took part in the photo essay, allowing me into their homes so that I could gain an insight into their lives.Firstly, I met an upper-class family, who asked to keep their identity anonymous for their own security. The youngest girl, who is a past contestant in the Miss Venezuela beauty pageant, has left the country to pursue her career as a model. Her brother and sister have been out of Venezuela for more than two years, working in their fields. The father said: “If they had told me, that at my age my children were going to leave because there were no opportunities, we would have left.”He works as a hotel manager while he witnesses the economy fall apart, constantly trying to maintain a balance in his job alongside spiralling inflation. He said in January: “The difficulty in obtaining foreign currency is what has affected us the most. In October, the black market dollar equalled 90 bolivars and is now at 2,500 bolivars.”The Melean family are working hard to achieve their dreams. Estefferson, the oldest brother, is now living in Chicago and studying nursing. He is covering all of his expenses with a baseball scholarship. He returned for the holidays to visit his family and his hopes for the future are high. Estefferson said: “I can open the doors for my family, to move forward and get out of where we live, as I would like them to live in a better place in the future.” They live in El Valle in Caracas, at the bottom of a favela area that is not safe.The youngest brother, Gerson, is following the same dream. He is training to be signed by the Major League Baseball (MLB) organisation, while he continues his high school studies at the weekends. Sarai, the youngest sister, was completing her studies at the Andrés Bello Catholic University. However, she had to stop as the cost became too high for the family to cover.She said: “It’s tough to live with fear, knowing that for a pair of earrings, some shoes or a telephone they can kill you. The people are so desperate, they are so hungry.”Yesenia, their mother, works full time as a secretary, although she sometimes does not make it to her job across the city. With the current electricity blackouts, transportation is not working most days Public transport is not available because of the lack of spare parts and their high prices.Lastly, the Fermin family lives in a small town called Mamporal, a 90-minute drive from Caracas. The mother has 11 children however many of them have left the country or are residing in other states of Venezuela. Five of her children live at home with her and her husband, Felix. The oldest son living at home is Abraham, who is away during the week while he trains to join the military.The 15-year-old son, also called Felix, said: “I want to be an artist to help my mom.”. He spends his time drawing Catholic figures with the hope of becoming an artist one day. Carmen, the youngest girl, said: “My desire is to leave Venezuela, become a doctor and help my family.”Wanda, 17, was seven months pregnant with twins when I photographed her. She had been raped by a neighbour. Wanda has since given birth to two girls. The Fermin family struggle to feed themselves and the children are showing signs of malnutrition, as they often miss out on breakfast and dinner.Imelda, the mother, has cancer and no treatment is available in the country. They have travelled several times to Caracas in search of medical attention, often without success. When Wanda was about to give birth, they were taken to Caracas in search of a hospital that could help them, after visiting four hospitals and being rejected because of a lack of space and facilities. Finally, as a relative knew a doctor in one of the hospitals, they managed to take Wanda in and look after her during her birth.Venezuela’s current crisis seems to have no end in sight. The country’s citizens are doing what they can to continue, but it is becoming harder day by day. The younger generation, still proclaim some hope at least. I am reminded of the moment when Carlos, Wanda and Carmen were playing in the water. They danced as if they had a break from reality, as if the water washed away their troubles for a moment."},{"url":null,"title":"16 ways to have family fun around ireland on a budget","story":"Given the pretty miserable weather we have been having of late you could be forgiven for thinking that summer is still a long way off.

The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Bioersity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) ranked the main factors causing species loss: changes in land and sea use exploitation of organisms climate change pollution and invasive alien species.These are “eroding the foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide”, and climate breakdown could soon become the main driver.Nature is being destroyed at such a rate that a million species are at risk. On the day the IPBES report made headlines, Dr Allan Mee of the Golden Eagle Trust checked for sightings of the Ring Ouzel in the MacGillycuddy’s Reeks in Co Kerry, one of just two of its remaining habitats in Ireland. “No birds located. Sad but likely witnessing local extinction of the species, once found in 28 Irish counties,” he tweeted. Pádraic Fogarty of the Irish Wildlife Trust replied: “This is mass extinction unfolding before our eyes.”How is the potentially lethal cocktail of bioersity loss and climate disruption going to impact on coming generations in contrasting parts of the globe? Equally, what does it mean for an animal that dominates the Irish landscape (the cow), and the majestic lion, not critically endangered yet rapidly disappearing?The baby born in IrelandConscious of what the next generation is facing, Australian Jim Scheer helped set up the FridaysForFuture climate action movement in Ireland, which is driven by young people. As for the babies of today, “their freedom is limited”, he believes. As a child, “the most I had to worry about was, ‘is there air in the tyres of my bike?’” he says.They are facing a whole different world of realities, a place where the First World problem of “where will I go on my holidays?” may be replaced by “where is my next meal coming from?”The issues weigh heavily on the current generation of young people, he believes, which is why “coming together to grieve” – a feature of recent protests – matters, and is part of telling the truth. There is much frustration too at the inaction of elders.“Uncertain” is the future of that child, says climate activist Dr Lorna Gold. Hope is emerging through the climate movement but, looking at the timelines required for transformational shift, there is “more and more uncertainty”.Children growing up in Ireland will be relatively protected, by location, wealth and assets they will have access to, “but even in the best-case scenario, it will be a diminished world.”This will be due to loss of species and a more complicated world, disrupted by climate and associated conflict, where Dr Gold fears the freedom to explore and travel in relative peace is undermined. It’s a place of learning from the internet rather than real life. The pluses will be better local connectedness with “their own earth” and nearby food production.That Irish child will never hear the corncrake or the curlew, says climatologist Prof John Sweeney, and, as they grow, they will be confronted with hard choices on lifestyle and mobility. The fossil fuel-driven car will be forced out by regulation, he says, but different ways of getting off the island, for example, will be needed if aviation does not overcome its emissions issues.By mid-century, most will live in green cities with an almost total absence of the private car. The transport revolution will be in urban areas but slower to come to the countryside until battery technology improves, Sweeney notes.A near zero-carbon world will mean less air pollution. Clean energy in their home and workplace will mainly come from offshore wind.A downside will be more extreme weather events attributable to climate change more intense storms and rainfall, increased flooding with sea level rises – and yet water shortages in summer.The child born today in Ireland – and the adult they become – will cope far better than their counterpart elsewhere.The developing world babyA baby born today in a developing country, on the other hand, will be at the frontline of climate disruption, says Christian Aid Ireland policy and advocacy adviser Jennifer Higgins. They will have to contend with stronger cyclones, warmer days and nights, more unpredictable rains and longer heatwaves.“Here in Ireland we will have the resources and ability to adapt and deal with these unprecedented weather events, but in many parts of the world, going to Tesco to stock up on sliced pan won’t be a possibility.”They will be the ones who will suffer the worst consequences of our inaction on climate change. “Sustained periods of unseasonably heavy rain can have a damaging impact on agriculture, causing the loss of topsoil and serious nutrient leaching,” says Higgins.In Ireland, save for the odd hosepipe ban, water is always on tap for domestic, industrial and agricultural use. “But in the developing world, where most people depend on agriculture to earn a living or just stay alive, it’s a scarce and precious resource.”Those living in coastal regions will suffer a loss of coral reefs, which half a billion people rely on for fish. For those born among indigenous communities in tropical rainforests, not only will they lose their homeland – already being eroded by increasing industrialisation – but there will be loss of habitat that acts as the lungs of the earth and regulates rainfall.Children will be most susceptible to the increasing diseases that a changing climate will leave in its wake, she adds. Their education may be disrupted when schools are used as shelters when disaster hits their communities.If temperatures increase in already hot areas, it will diminish scarce resources to sustain life and will force many to become refugees.But this may “dwarf numbers caused by conflict or political and economic necessity. When their land becomes uninhabitable because of drought, flood or sea-level rise, they will have to seek a safer place to live,” Higgins predicts.It may be a world where techniques such as conservation agriculture transform crop production and smartphone technology helps drive rural economies backed by deployment of cheap solar PV. But extreme weather events will continue to threaten food production, as seen with recent cyclones in southern Africa.Gold fears a business-as-usual approach means such circumstances can become an intractable problem very quickly, and says solutions are beyond most communities on cost grounds. Therefore the child is facing increased malnutrition, chronic hunger, dependency on external aid, and political instability – an existence marked by inequality and injustice.The IPBES report starkly outlines how indigenous peoples and the poorest are most reliant on land and sea for survival. The combination of land grabs by multinationals facilitated by corrupt governments, extreme climate events and bioersity loss add up to a very bleak future for their offspring, Gold concludes.The future of the cow Humans are not the only beings whose lives will change. The IPBES report emphasises that the effects will be felt first among animals and other living things.In Ireland, there are currently more cattle than people, and they are the most common large animal. For many, the cow (for beef and milk) is the bellwether of Irish agriculture and rural life. For others, it’s the problem because of associated carbon emissions.Teagasc’s head of communications, Eric Donald, says cattle numbers are currently a matter for inidual farmers. With no quotas, no policy instruments are in place. In future we are likely to have fewer beef and more dairy cattle.On emissions, Donald says there is wide acceptance of the need to implement mitigation measures – a process is already in train.Having a grass-based system to feed those cattle will be critical to sustainable farms from an environmental, economic and social perspective, Donald adds. Ireland will need to find export markets for 80 to 90 per cent of its product. Meat consumption may decrease on an inidual basis and there may be a shift to plant-based diets, but increased population growth will mean “demand won’t drop significantly”.But cattle will have to compete for space due to a more erse range of crops, land being used for bioenergy and afforestation (increasingly native woodlands and not just on marginal land) that will act as important carbon sinks, and hedgerows ensuring better bioersity and pollinator capacity.To question beef consumption may currently be an Irish “no-no”, but the reality is the consumers of tomorrow will be confronted by a wide range of new plant and synthetic proteins that will taste surprisingly good and be cheaper, which is likely to mean less red meat is consumed – in line with health guidelines.Eric Donald defends the pursuit of higher genetic quality as a means of increasing efficiency and lowering emissions, especially “because lifetime productivity is better”. With extending grazing seasons, it’s the key measure in improving farm sustainability guidelines. It also complements changes in fertiliser use and slurry management.But John Sweeney says the Irish cow is “reaching limits in terms of genetics”. Like pedigree dogs, they are less able to cope with change and stress compared with native species.Unquestionably, there will be fewer of them, he believes, “if we want to maintain bioersity for future generations”.Expansion in the cattle population has coincided with deterioration in water quality, with widespread glyphosate contamination (one study has found 20 per cent of Irish adults have traces of the herbicide in their urine), nitrates pollution and an emerging ammonia problem.“Continued expansion of the national herd is not compatible with this report. That’s where the crux comes.”The future of the lionJennifer Higgins joins in a lament for so many endangered mammals.Of all species threatened, IWT campaign officer Pádraic Fogarty is shocked by the latest indicators for hippos, giraffes and lions. In particular, “it would be an absolutely travesty if lions were to go extinct . . . The magnificent animal has permeated our culture and imagination, from children’s stories to the pillars on Trafalgar Square.”But maps don’t lie. In 1950 there were 400,000 lions in the wild. Today there are 23,000-39,000 lions in all of Africa, which is “extremely low” in global terms, when once they lived in Ancient Greece and North Africa, and became extinct in Greece only around 100BC.Outside of southern Africa, numbers of lions in 23 unfenced reserves in 11 countries are estimated to have dropped by 62 per cent between 1993 and 2014. Asia is home to a small subpopulation in the Indian state of Gujarat, where numbers are growing, but it’s just a pin on the globe.“There is no data to say that lions are about to disappear, but their populations are shrinking fast,” he explains. The species is classified as vulnerable but the slide into the “endangered” and then “critically endangered” categories looms, while “threatened with extinction” is applied to its current status.For Fogarty, the same pressures apply to other mammals, but the lion’s wellbeing is further undermined by gametrophy hunting and false western-world notions that it is somehow good for population numbers. All told, we are facing a scenario where lions will “shrink to a few corners of the planet”.What to doThis is not going to be sorted by putting bird tables in back gardens. The Ipbes report shows nature-based solutions can help bring “transformative change”, but there is a greater systemic problem.In the past 50 years, the human population has doubled, the global economy has grown nearly four-fold, and global trade has grown tenfold, together driving up the demands for energy, food and materials.Thinking that endless economic growth is possible and not valuing the essential services provided by nature is a delusion leading to catastrophe, Sweeney believes.“Until we get away from euros and cents and GDP, we will be in a cul-de-sac . . . Unless we rethink how we value the services provided by the natural world and include them explicitly in a wellbeing measure, we delude ourselves that a sustainable future is possible.”That was the core message in a submission this week to EU leaders meeting on the future of Europe by the European Environmental Bureau (EEB) and more than 200 academics, including John Sweeney, policy experts and civil society groups.There is an onus too on iniduals to act, according to EEB vice president Attracta Uí Bhroin. “It’s not enough for us to sit on the sofa and watch David Attenborough’s latest breathtaking and terrifying documentary and shake our heads. Every politician coming near your front door needs to know environmental sustainability is your priority, and must be Europe’s priority.”Fogarty hopes people now see the connections between climate breakdown and mass extinction, that they are two sides of the same coin. “We have all of the solutions to hand, but what we’ve been lacking is any sense of urgency to get on with it.”He senses momentum moving in the right direction, though the lack of a response from the Taoiseach or any Government minister “makes me feel that they are still hoping it’s an issue that will go away. We can’t really afford this level of disengagement when we need to be getting on with things.”Scheer is brutally frank about future voters born today. “I don’t think people get a choice of what games they play.”They will have to be focused on survival. “It feels as we have handed them a shitstorm.”As for the current generation, too many are stuck in business-as-usual mode. There is a need to raise consciousness quickly. “Ignorance is not a choice” given the IPBES report. “It’s not an opinion, it’s scientific. It’s happening.”Kevin O\u0027Sullivan is Environment and Science Editor and former Editor of The "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/17/TELEMMGLPICT000147339863_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"judges given new expenses policy telegraph discovers judiciary","story":"The Ministry of Justice approved expenses including shampoo and crockery.  Lord Chief Justice, Lord Ian Burnett, pictured, claimed for multiple journeys to and from his homeMinistry of JusticeThe judiciary are to be given a new expenses policy after The Daily  found that Britain\u0027s most senior judges have claimed for crockery, shampoo and a taxi to transport ceremonial robes on taxpayer-funded expenses.Expenses data released under the Freedom of Information Act shows how some of the most high-profile members of the judiciary in England and Wales have had claims for everyday items as well first-class trains approved, even though they receive a salary of at least £180,000.At present, judges are encouraged to follow the expenses policy for Ministry of Justice (MOJ) civil servants, and the judiciary has also set out specific guidance relating to travel, accommodation and relocation....To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletMinistry of JusticeBrexit latest news: Boris Johnson launches leadership campaign as rival Jeremy Hunt says he would allow no dealRussia orders Tinder to hand over users\u0026#39 private messages on requestSwedish court rejects detention request for Julian Assange Donald Trump visit: Queen welcomes US President to Britain - latest newsDonald Trump\u0026#39s day in tweets - from insulting the Mayor to meeting the QueenComment: Stop trying to meddle in our affairs, Mr Johnson – the NHS is not for sale Everything we know about Donald Trump\u0026#39s state visit to BritainRussian arms manufacturers pull out of Venezuela over late paymentsHow Donald Trump relies on a 1,000-strong entourage, \u0026#39The Beast\u0026#39 limousine and a £25m security operation to keep him safe Do ex-soldiers need more help returning to \u0026#39civvy street\u0026#39?Japanese women submit petition over de-facto requirement to wear high heels at workNeymar faces police probe after allegedly publishing intimate photos of his \u0026#39rape\u0026#39 accuser on social mediaThe Tory leadership candidates have set out their Brexit plans - here\u0026#39s what Brussels will think of them Sephora\u0026#39s 700 shops to close for ersity training after SZA says she was racially profiled\u0026#39Purged\u0026#39 aide to Kim Jong-un reappears alongside dictatorBodies spotted in search for missing Himalaya climbersComment: Why you should think twice before tweeting about Love Island contestantsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"expenses podcast lone campaigner took whole parliament","story":"Journalist and freedom of information campaigner, Heather BrookeTucked away in the back of New Labour’s 1997 manifesto is a promise.

What they do now know, however, is it is not due to schooling or upbringing.Studies have shown that adopted twins with the same genetics do just as well academically even if they have had vastly different education or parents. Although selective schools like Eton achieve higher grades, it is the selection process itself which accounts for the difference, and that same cohort would achieve the same marks if sent to a state school, Prof Plomin argues.Speaking at The Hay Festival, he said: “Do differences in the quality of school make a difference in outcomes like GCSE scores or getting into universities? “There’s a correlation there – kids who go to selective schools have a GCSE score that is one full grade higher than kids who go to comprehensive schools.“But if you correct for what the schools selected on, there’s no difference in GCSE scores. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you select the very best kids academically, yes they go on and do well. But have you added value? The answer is no. ‘So why send your kids to Eton? Don’t. If all you’re doing it for is educational achievement. Schools matter, kids have got to learn all this stuff. But do they make a difference? The answer is no.”Eton currently costs more than £40,000-a-year and 19 of Britain’s Prime Ministers were educated at the school. Prof Plomin accepted that parents may want to send there children to fee-paying schools to mix with the ‘right sort of people’ but said they shouldn’t expect the institutions to improve their grades.Private schools may also instil confidence, leadership skills or connections which improve job prospects in later life, he conceded. Although just seven per cent of children in Britain attended public school, over a third of MPs, half of medical consultants and two thirds of high court judges had a private education. But he added: “Differences in GCSE results for selective and non selective schools are not an index for the quality of education the schools provide. “Even though schools have little effect on inidual differences in school achievement, some parents will still decide to pay huge amounts of money to send their children to private schools in order to give their children whatever alight advantage such schools provide.“I hope it will help parents who cannot afford to pay for private schooling or move house to know that it doesn’t make much of a difference in children’s school achievement.”Want the best of The  direct to your email and WhatsApp?

meaning shoes - and kutsuu - meaning pain - was launched by actress and freelance writer Yumi Ishikawa and quickly won support from nearly 19,000 people online.Campaigners say wearing high heels is seen as near-obligatory when job hunting or working at many Japanese companies.Today we submitted a petition calling for the introduction of laws banning employers from forcing women to wear heels as sexual discrimination or harassment, Ms Ishikawa told reporters after meeting labour ministry officials.A ministry official who met her was a woman and sympathetic to our petition... and told us that this is the first time voices of this kind reached the ministry, Ms Ishikawa said.It\u0027s the first step forward towards achieving their goals, added Ms Ishikawa.Japan\u0026#39s corporate culture has come in for much criticismMinistry officials were not immediately available for comment on the petition.A tweet by Ms Ishikawa earlier this year that complained about the requirement to wear heels for a hotel job went viral, prompting her to launch the campaign.As I realised that so many people face the same problem, I decided to launch the campaign, hot on the heels of the global anti-sexual harassment #MeToo campaign, she said.Some campaigners online have said high heels are akin to modern foot-binding while others urged other dress codes, such as the near-total donning of business suits for men, to be loosened in the Japanese workplace.In 2015, the director of the prestigious Cannes Film Festival apologised after a controversy blew up over women being denied access to the red carpet for not wearing high heels.Swedish court rejects detention request for Julian Assange Donald Trump visit: Queen welcomes US President to Britain -

including Kim Jong-un - smile and clap.The KCNA coverage made no mention of the reports in foreign media that Pyongyang’s chief negotiator with Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, had been purged.Quoting unnamed sources in the North, the South Korean Chosun Ilbo newspaper reported on Friday that Kim Yong-chol had been sent to a forced labour camp in a remote part of the country and was undergoing ideological re-education to take responsibility for the failure of Mr Kim’s summit with US President Donald Trump in Hanoi in February.The paper also claimed that five foreign ministry officials were executed in March for the collapse of the summit, which Mr Kim had reportedly hoped would lead to Washington lifting economic sanctions on his regime.The report added that a number of other officials were sent to political prison camps as Mr Kim attempted to shift the blame for the failure of the summit onto his underlings.Citing the original story, media around the world followed up on the reports, although few foreign media outlets have a presence in Pyongyang and the North Korean government is not known for responding to requests for information.The KCNA report only identified Kim Yong-chol as “comrade”, so it is not clear if he has been demoted.A spokesman for the South Korean government was unable to confirm or refute the media reports on Friday.In April, the South Korean intelligence agency reported that Kim Yong-chol had been replaced as the director of the United Front Department, although he had managed to retain his position as vice-chairman of the central committee of the Workers’ Party.Swedish court rejects detention request for Julian Assange Donald Trump visit: Queen welcomes US President to Britain -

in the past four years, however, Venezuela has struggled to meet its payment obligations.Moscow rakes in around $15bn annually from military exports to foreign nations and that money flows through Rostec, a massive state-owned holding company that has grown to control almost two-thirds of Russia’s defense industry.Russia’s arms industry deploys significant personnel abroad to manage its global empire.Some of these representatives work out of the Russian embassy on diplomatic passports. The vast majority of them are instructors or technicians who fly in to teach customers to operate and take care of their purchases. Then they leave if no further contracts are signed. Rostec has been moving its people out of Venezuela in the past four months after realising that the funds have dried up, the source said.According to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported Rostec’s withdrawal from Venezuela, the number peaked at 1000 but now stands at a few dozen. The ’s source could not specify exact numbers, but estimated Rostec’s peak presence could have reached 2000.Rostec’s pull-out does not represent Moscow’s turning-away from Caracas. In March, a contingent of 100 uniformed Russian troops flew to Venezuela. The source says these were military engineers sent to perform free maintenance that Rostec would otherwise charge for.Neither the Kremlin nor Rostec have made any official statements about the withdrawal.A request for comment from Rostec was unanswered at the time of publication.Donald Trump visit: Queen welcomes US President to Britain - latest newsDonald Trump\u0026#39s day in tweets - from insulting the Mayor to meeting the QueenBrexit latest news: Boris Johnson launches leadership campaign as rival Jeremy Hunt says he would allow no dealComment: Stop trying to meddle in our affairs, Mr Johnson – the NHS is not for sale Everything we know about Donald Trump\u0026#39s state visit to BritainHow Donald Trump relies on a 1,000-strong entourage, \u0026#39The Beast\u0026#39 limousine and a £25m security operation to keep him safe Do ex-soldiers need more help returning to \u0026#39civvy street\u0026#39?Japanese women submit petition over de-facto requirement to wear high heels at workNeymar faces police probe after allegedly publishing intimate photos of his \u0026#39rape\u0026#39 accuser on social mediaThe Tory leadership candidates have set out their Brexit plans - here\u0026#39s what Brussels will think of them Sephora\u0026#39s 700 shops to close for ersity training after SZA says she was racially profiled\u0026#39Purged\u0026#39 aide to Kim Jong-un reappears alongside dictatorBodies spotted in search for missing Himalaya climbersComment: Why you should think twice before tweeting about Love Island contestantsComment: Brexit will reshape the UK economy for the good and usher in a new social contract  Comment: We must stop pointing fingers and work together to tackle the environment\u0026#39s biggest threatsBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent 2019 final, as it happened: singing war veteran Colin Thackeray wins variety contestWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/05/28/13/ipodtouch.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-3906706  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt=   srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/05/28/13/ipodtouch.jpg","title":"apple itunes internet wwdc 2019 music streaming app","story":"IM Subscribe  registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

But Apple has long been rumoured to be planning to do away with it and swap it for new, standalone apps.The latest signal of that rumoured change is the scrubbing of iTunes from the internet. It comes just hours before Apple takes to the stage at its Worldwide Developers Conference, where the announcement is set to happen.The most obvious change is that Apple has cleared out the Instagram and Facebook pages that it runs for iTunes.\u0026nbspOn Instagram, the company has removed all of the posts from the account so that it is completely empty.

The convention centre has been decked out in Apple banners for days, there have been full-scale rehearsals going on (and the final rehearsal was a stormer, I’m quietly told) and 350 recipients of Apple WWDC scholarships have arrived in town.These scholarship winners are developers, most of them young, who have been given a ticket to the week of events.Yesterday, 14 of them experienced what some would\u0026nbsplater describe to me as a once-in-a-lifetime event. Adjacent to the main hall in the conference centre\u0026nbspis a vast room with a quintessentially Apple vibe. The area is ided by long wooden tables with white wooden stools that are so meticulously placed underneath you imagine someone used a ruler. There are huge, shiny, as-yet-virgin whiteboards with neatly stacked multicoloured pens and discreet grey sofas in the corners.The 14 scholarship winners shown into the space are preposterously young, teenagers and upwards, all with a MacBook or iPad or iPhone holding their valuable, home-grown IP. These are the apps that have won them scholarships.

As the developers talk, a little nervously at first, but quickly put at ease by Joz’s relaxed, avuncular charm, there’s an atmosphere of collegial excitement, with each developer willing their friends to succeed.I talk to Spruce Campbell, 14, born in Lewisham, whose previous prototype game won a BAFTA in 2017 (when he was 12!). He has a game, Cyber Jump, on the App Store, and his scholarship application was inspired by seeing migrations of starlings. “I saw them flying around and I thought that would be a good approach – it’s not easily translatable into code, there are so many inidual things, there’s no over-arching structure, there’s no chief starling telling them all what to do.” He created a simulation where each bird is inidually created and knows where every other bird is. By touching the display, the birds react, flying in different directions. It is deftly done, and gently hypnotic to watch.Joz moves on to the next developer. And then, suddenly, everything changes.“We’ve got one more exec who wants to see your work,” we’re told, and the developers turn to see Tim Cook has slipped unobtrusively into the room. The effect is electric, with jaws dropping, impromptu bursts of applause and wide grins appearing on face after face. Cook shakes hands and gets involved. But where many CEOs would plant themselves on a throne and accept audiences from grateful supplicants, Cook is moving around the room to each developer, grabbing a stool if there is one, or kneeling on the floor next to them, the better to get a look at their apps.If the kids are tongue-tied in his presence, they quickly get past it because of his evident interest, asking the precisely appropriate question, giving subtle hints of how Apple is involved in the same topics, and even what to look out for in the upcoming keynote. He’s interested in an app that uses augmented reality. It’s something he has talked about in the past, saying, “It’s a big idea.”Cook is a man\u0026nbspwith a busy schedule, of course, but you’d never guess it from his insistence on spending as much time as he can with each developer, including with Matt Moss. Moss has created several eye-tracking apps, Hawkeye and Hawkeye Access, which help marketers and user experience experts learn about how you’re looking at something onscreen. Today, he’s demonstrating an app where you can paint using your eyes. If they had been feeling awestruck, the developers have recovered themselves: Moss boldly asks Cook to have a go, and Cook obliges.Moss explains that to make the app start or stop painting a line, you must pucker your lips. Cook gamely pouts as needed. I’ve seen the result of Cook’s endeavours and, while it may not win any prizes, it’s a neat abstract with several Apple attributes: an understated simplicity and a discriminating sense of colour.Finally, Cook is told he really does have to go now, and after a quick group photo, he makes to leave. But then one of the developers asks for a selfie. “Oh, of course,” Cook beams.

Among millennials, the figure rose to 79 per cent.The Labour party revealed on Monday that it had commissioned a study on the impact of a four-day working week for millions of public sector workers.Working hours fell steadily from the start of the industrial revolution until the 1980s but have since levelled off.If the historical trend had continued, workers would be putting in about 33 to 34 hours per week but in reality three quarters of people work close to 40 hours.The results come as politicians, trade union leaders and employers increasingly examine the feasibility of a four-day working week, a debate sparked by fears that accelerating automation will push many people out of employment.Britons work the longest hours but a four-day week is not the answerBritons work some of the longest hours of all developed nations but productivity growth has been among the slowest. Proponents of a shorter working week say that workers who do fewer hours are often more productive.Pawel Adrjan, UK economist at Indeed, said: “Time will tell if workers’ enthusiasm for the four-day week ever makes it the norm in the UK, but the idea has shot up the agenda of politicians, academics and even some employers over the last twelve months.“Demands for flexibility and worklife balance are also increasing, so employers who want to attract and retain the best staff will need to take an imaginative and flexible approach to how they organise their people.”On pay transparency, Nordic countries have long taken the lead. In Sweden for example, citizens can request the tax returns of any inidual, allowing them to ascertain that person’s income.Openness has been credited with reining in excessive pay at the top of the income distribution. Sweden’s tax agency is also one of the most trusted in the world.Income inequality has grown steadily in the UK for several decades with the top 1 per cent of households now collecting around 8 per cent of pay, compared to 3 per cent in the 1970s.Average chief executive pay at FTSE 100 firms is now 147 times that of the average worker’s.four day week\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

House of FraserHomebase has recently dropped the Bunnings association from its storesThe deal also requires an agreement to be reached with the Pensions Regulator over a £750m deficit in Arcadia’s pension funds.MP Frank Field called on Sir Philip to use his own money to fund the scheme, as he did with the BHS pension scheme after Parliament\u0027s Work and Pensions Committee began applying pressure.Sir Philip\u0027s wife, Lady Tina Green, who is Arcadia\u0027s main shareholder, has offered to pay £100m into the schemes over the next three years.However, the Pensions Regulator said it has doubts the plans will “adequately protect” the pensions of employees.The crunch vote comes as Sir Philip faces his own legal battles. He has been charged with four counts of misdemeanour assault in the US after a Pilates instructor alleged he repeatedly touched her inappropriately.Katie Surridge told police in Arizona that Sir Philip ked and grabbed her backside during classes in the Canyon Ranch luxury resort in Tucson in 2016 and 2018.Pima County Attorney\u0027s Office said on Friday that he has been charged with four counts of knowingly touching another person with the intent to injure, insult, or provoke.Deputy county attorney Lauren Deakin said: “Philip Green has been formally charged with four misdemeanour assault counts.“Each count has a potential sentence of up to 30 days in the Pima County jail, a fine of not more than 500 US dollars, and up to one year of probation.”Sir Philip, 67, “strenuously” refuted the allegations, with a spokesperson\u0026nbspsaying he is “disappointed” the charges have been lodged.“Sir Philip strenuously denies these allegations and is disappointed that the charges have been filed in his absence and they are minor categories of misdemeanour in the United States,” a statement issued by Arcadia said.“Sir Philip is not personally required to attend before the court at the forthcoming hearing and will be represented by his lawyer.“Contrary to previous suggestions in the media there is no allegation of any sexual assault or misconduct made by the prosecution.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sales were boosted by Uber’s heavy investment in its food delivery and freight businesses.Concerns about the company’s losses were eased by news that Uber has become less reliant on discounts and promotions.“Our story is simple. We’re the global player,” Dara Khosrowshahi, the chief executive of Uber, told analysts on his first earnings call after the company’s IPO earlier this month. “Our job is to grow fast at scale and more efficiently for a long, long time.”Uber has faced strong competition from rivals such as Lyft in its core ride-hailing business and incurred extra costs for signing up new drivers. Incentives paid to drivers more than doubled last year.Costs rose 35 per cent in the quarter, as the company spent heavily in the run-up to its IPO.\u0026nbspGross bookings, a measure of the total value of rides before driver costs and other expenses, rose 34 per cent from a year ago to $14.6bn.Alyssa Altman of digital consultancy Publicis Sapient said Uber’s future was still in doubt.“Uber has an easy to use app, a fleet of drivers and vast quantities of data, but its rise has been fuelled by its investors’\u0026nbspwillingness to subsidise the taxi rides that make up the bulk of the business,” she said.“Last year 5.2 billion people rode an Uber. In each of those trips, the company lost an average of 58 cents.\u0026nbsp“Uber continues to grow, and it’s fair to say it dominates the taxi-hailing market, but the company’s success is built on sand. The reality is that it still hasn’t made a profit. They need to have a reason for being and one that people value.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Among millennials, the figure rose to 79 per cent.The Labour party revealed on Monday that it had commissioned a study on the impact of a four-day working week for millions of public sector workers.Working hours fell steadily from the start of the industrial revolution until the 1980s but have since levelled off.If the historical trend had continued, workers would be putting in about 33 to 34 hours per week but in reality three quarters of people work close to 40 hours.The results come as politicians, trade union leaders and employers increasingly examine the feasibility of a four-day working week, a debate sparked by fears that accelerating automation will push many people out of employment.Britons work the longest hours but a four-day week is not the answerBritons work some of the longest hours of all developed nations but productivity growth has been among the slowest. Proponents of a shorter working week say that workers who do fewer hours are often more productive.Pawel Adrjan, UK economist at Indeed, said: “Time will tell if workers’ enthusiasm for the four-day week ever makes it the norm in the UK, but the idea has shot up the agenda of politicians, academics and even some employers over the last twelve months.“Demands for flexibility and worklife balance are also increasing, so employers who want to attract and retain the best staff will need to take an imaginative and flexible approach to how they organise their people.”On pay transparency, Nordic countries have long taken the lead. In Sweden for example, citizens can request the tax returns of any inidual, allowing them to ascertain that person’s income.Openness has been credited with reining in excessive pay at the top of the income distribution. Sweden’s tax agency is also one of the most trusted in the world.Income inequality has grown steadily in the UK for several decades with the top 1 per cent of households now collecting around 8 per cent of pay, compared to 3 per cent in the 1970s.Average chief executive pay at FTSE 100 firms is now 147 times that of the average worker’s.four day week\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Hang tight!Though it might not be obvious to users of the apps or services themselves, much\u0026nbspof the underlying infrastructure of the web is provided by just a few companies. That means that issues at one of those firms – such as Google or Amazon – can very quickly cause problems across the internet, taking down websites that might appear entirely separate from those suffering the problems.In 2017, for instance, large parts of the internet stopped working because of an issue at Amazon Web Services, which caused problems at\u0026nbspQuora, Trello and some of the world\u0027s biggest news sites. That was later traced back to one small typo in the company\u0027s code, which caused underlying infrastructure to break and websites to stop working.Similarly, in 2016, a vast cyber attack focused on Dyn, which also provides some of the infrastructure that keeps the web breaking. That meant websites like Spotify, Reddit and Twitter all went down.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.21. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.20. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.422 Avengers: Age of Ultron19. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.18. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.17. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 722 s of the Galaxy Vol 216. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.15. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.14. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1022 Ant-Man and the Wasp13. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2122 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.22. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.21. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.20. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.422 Avengers: Age of Ultron19. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.18. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.17. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 722 s of the Galaxy Vol 216. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.15. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.14. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1022 Ant-Man and the Wasp13. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU.

Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 432 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.532 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1332 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1432 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1732 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2132 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2732 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2932 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3132 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail.

It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1332 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1432 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1732 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2132 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2732 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2932 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3132 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.“If there’s interest, then that’s always a factor. If people are really psyched about it, I’d be psyched about it too. So we’ll see.”The band’s initial split in 1999 was mired in acrimony. During their final concert, at London’s Brixton Academy, Malkmus attached a pair of handcuffs to his microphone stand and told the audience: “These symbolise what it’s like being in a band all these years.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

When the surviving members of the Doors assembled to hear a recording of Kilmer, none could tell which was the impersonation and which the real Morrison. The Doors was not loved by all but the great Kyle MacLachlan and Meg Ryan were memorable in supporting roles as keyboardist Ray Manzarek and Morrison\u0027s girlfriend Pamela Courson respectively.

Sales were boosted by Uber’s heavy investment in its food delivery and freight businesses.Concerns about the company’s losses were eased by news that Uber has become less reliant on discounts and promotions.“Our story is simple. We’re the global player,” Dara Khosrowshahi, the chief executive of Uber, told analysts on his first earnings call after the company’s IPO earlier this month. “Our job is to grow fast at scale and more efficiently for a long, long time.”Uber has faced strong competition from rivals such as Lyft in its core ride-hailing business and incurred extra costs for signing up new drivers. Incentives paid to drivers more than doubled last year.Costs rose 35 per cent in the quarter, as the company spent heavily in the run-up to its IPO.\u0026nbspGross bookings, a measure of the total value of rides before driver costs and other expenses, rose 34 per cent from a year ago to $14.6bn.Alyssa Altman of digital consultancy Publicis Sapient said Uber’s future was still in doubt.“Uber has an easy to use app, a fleet of drivers and vast quantities of data, but its rise has been fuelled by its investors’\u0026nbspwillingness to subsidise the taxi rides that make up the bulk of the business,” she said.“Last year 5.2 billion people rode an Uber. In each of those trips, the company lost an average of 58 cents.\u0026nbsp“Uber continues to grow, and it’s fair to say it dominates the taxi-hailing market, but the company’s success is built on sand.

There is nothing I can do about that the 1922 Committee perhaps should have tightened up the rules before we started.Please allow a moment for the live blog to loadSenior Tory lashes out at \u0027shambles\u0027 of Tory leadership raceJeremy Hunt suggests UK could copy Trump\u0027s tax cutsMinisters urges candidates with minimal support to \u0027think twice\u0027... as Donald Trump arrives in UK for official state visit... and insults London Mayor even before his plane touches downNigel Evans - a senior member of the Tories\u0027 1922 committee of backbench MPs - says we don\u0027t want what happened last time - a cosy chat.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe says the contest must not be a repeat of Theresa May versus Andrea Leadsom, and this time must go to the party membership for a vote in the final round.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspEvans adds that there should be hustings around the UK with the final candidates, and televised debates.According to the Press Association, the transport secretary Chris Grayling has confirmed this morning that he has no interesting in the leadership contest.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhen asked what he thought of the contest as he opened a railway station in north London on Monday, he said: I think we\u0027ve got an excellent range of candidates.I would say that I rather agree with James Brokenshire today, and I hope those who are not really, numbers-wise, in the running, will think twice about whether they really want to go ahead with their candidacies.If you look at people who\u0027ve got established campaigns, I think we\u0027ve got some good candidates, and whoever takes over will do a good job for the country.On the Conservative leadership race, Mr Brokenshire also appealed to the 13 contenders for some of them to consider pulling out of the race in order to speed things up.\u0026nbspThere is a real sense of urgency when we look at the time period we have on the current extension over the Article 50 process, he said.We need to find a way to get on with this, to get a new leader in place quickly.That period of reflection is what some colleagues I hope will do, looking at their levels of support and just thinking, \u0027Is this the right thing to do at this time\u0027.Cabinet minister and Theresa May ally James Brokenshire has insisted those politicians\u0026nbspboycotting the US president\u0027s state visit are fundamentally mistaken.\u0026nbspLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford and Speaker John Bercow have all snubbed the Queen\u0027s invitation to a state banquet on Monday night.\u0026nbspMr Brokenshire criticised those refusing to engage with Mr Trump, saying it was not in the best interests of our country.It\u0027s important that we engage seriously and sensibly with one of our closest allies, he said.People will have different views, and indeed that relationship allows us to have conversations on a range of different issues - I think the responsible thing to do is to actually engage with that process, to actually have that conversation.Those that are saying they don\u0027t want to see the president, I think that is fundamentally mistaken and is not in the best interests of our country or indeed, here in London, the best interests of our capital city.On Brexit, she says we have to out on 31 October deal, or no deal.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAsked whether she could actually do this - given the opposition of parliament - Esther McVey says while people might try and frustrate the process, the she wouldn\u0027t be bringing back something to the House for people to amend.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspPressed on whether there would be any role for Nigel Farage in Brexit in her government, says she does not foresee a role for him.\u0026nbspDonald Trump\u0027s British\u0026nbspenvoy\u0026nbsphas sparked fury with claims that\u0026nbspaccess to the NHS would be on the table in post-Brexit\u0026nbsptrade deal with the US.Woody Johnson, the US ambassador\u0026nbspto the UK, said the entire economy would be included in transatlantic\u0026nbspnegotiations, which could include allowing American private firms to bid for NHS contracts.In an interview ahead of Mr Trump\u0027s state visit, Mr Johnson said the US was already looking at all the components of the deal and trying to get everything lined up so when the time comes we’re ready to go.\u0026nbsphttps:www.newsukpoliticsdonald-trump-nhs-trade-deal-woody-johnson-matt-hancock-a8940861.htmlThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

All labour has dignity and the way that we give labour dignity is by paying people the respect and the value that they are worth... We have to raise the national minimum wage to $15 an hour.”Taking to\u0026nbspTwitter\u0026nbspafter her stint behind the bar, she wrote:\u0026nbsp“I was nervous that I may have lost my touch - still got it! That muscle memory doesn’t quit.\u0026nbspMs Ocasio-Cortez\u0026nbspwas campaigning for the Raise the Wage Act 2019, a bill introduced by members of her\u0026nbspDemocratic Party in January which would prevent tipped workers from being paid less than the federal minimum wage.\u0026nbspUS law exempts restaurants, nail salons and car washes from paying their tipped staff the minimum wage of $7.25 (£5.93) per hour. It has not risen from that rate\u0026nbspsince 2009.Instead they are allowed to pay just\u0026nbsp$2.13 per hour.

If we’re not willing to draw a bright line and say we’re not socialists, we could quite possibly re-elect this president.”Some in the audience disagreed with Mr Hickenlooper’s thinking.Republicans aim to demonise Democrats as ‘baby killers’ and socialistsJonathan Tasini, a labour activist who endorsed Mr Sanders in 2016 and published a book about the senator’s ideas, said that Mr Hickenlooper had effectively talked his way out of the 2020 race.“Every single presidential candidate came into this hall was treated with respect,” Mr Tasini said. “He red-baited us and got down in the mud, and I think it finished him.”Mr Hickenlooper’s allies saw it differently, speculating that the cold reception at a convention dominated by liberal activists would help distinguish the governor to moderate Democratic voters.Asked how the booing might play on Fox News, which has devoted hours of coverage to the rise of socialists inside the party, Mr Hickenlooper said it would help.“I think what it says is that we are having that discussion as Democrats, and my hope is that we will clearly say, a result of those broadcasts, that Democrats are not socialists,” he said.13th moviesOther Democrats have taken opportunities to distinguish themselves from the party’s left flank.Michael Bennet of Colorado, who joined the race last month, told one of his New Hampshire audiences that he had stood and applauded during the State of the Union, when President Trump said that America would “never be a socialist country”.“In my part of the country, when you call somebody a socialist, or when they call themselves socialists, it makes it harder for them to get elected.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ms Merkel has said she would not stand at the next German federal elections, and that she would instead hand over the reins to a new chancellor. She has also quit her party leadership, which is now occupied by her protege, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer – widely referred to as AKK.“I assume the SPD will undergo a succession in short order without hindrance to the functioning of the grand coalition,” Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer.“In the CDU we believe that this is not the time to play politics.

The way they are paid back means youngsters who are bright enough can afford it in the long-run, without ever truly crippling them with debt.But nobody should be arguing that those who don’t go to university should be subsidising those who do, any more than they already do.There are some universities charging full-whack for sub-par courses, and because almost everybody is charging the maximum students don’t have much choice. The “market” the Government hoped for has never truly developed.But the real answer to our skills crisis Supercharging vocational education, and giving kids the skills for the st century’s technological revolution.THE Government is right to demand service station operators are transparent about pricing.They’ve been ripping off motorists for years.

Always apply sun cream when you’ll be in the sun. Don’t forget to wait  mins before venturing out. You can burn on a cloudy day too so wear sunscreen evenits not sunny. Reapply, reapply, reapply. You can burn in the UK too. Make sure youre using the correct SPFOver half Brits admitted they regularly miss areas of the body when applying sun protection.These are the areas that people are most likely to miss when applying sun cream, and how many of us dont apply sun cream to this area while outdoors.. Soles of the feet -  per cent. Bottom -  per cent. Hairline parting -  per cent. Lips -  per cent. Eyelids -  per centLauren Mackenzie, head of medical aesthetics at The Hospital Group, said: “Skin cancer is one of the biggest killers in the UK, so it’s quite shocking to see the risks Brits are taking when it comes to failing to protect their skin from sun damage.It seems from our research that most people are seriously underestimating the protection needed and aren’t giving sun cream application the appropriate time and attention.“Spending an extra five minutes applying sun cream and waiting for it to start working before jumping in the water on holiday are really simple changes to make, but will certainly save your skin in the long term.Practices like this can protect you from premature ageing and more serious damage that the sun can have on your body.”"},{"url":null,"title":"boris rev up leadership campaign","story":"Having kept a low profile for the past few days, he will unveil his most senior supporter yet, with Liz Truss, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, set to endorse him.The Boris campaign will also unveil a slew of MPs backing him, which will put him ahead in the endorsement stakes.But just as signicant as the number supporting him is the fact that Boris’s old enemies are beginning to make peace with him. I understand that ious MPs have been to see him to say that while they won’t vote for him, they would accept his leadership.One MP who won’t be endorsing him, though, is Amber Rudd. She and Boris sat down on Thursday. But ultimately the dferences between them over Brexit policy are too great to make any kind of dream ticket work.I understand that Rudd pushed the former Foreign Secretary to budge on his commitment that the UK would leave the EU on October  with or without a deal. Johnson would not. Rudd felt that she could not support someone holding this position.Another complication was that Johnson and Rudd’s dferences on Brexit made it very hard for them to agree on a joint governing agenda. Johnson, though, should still have more votes in the first round than any other Brexiteer candidate.He needs to finish  votes clear of Dominic Raabhe is to establish himself as the clear Leave choice — Raab is more likely than him to pick up support as the second tier Brexiteer candidates drop out.As one of those backing Boris puts it: “He’s got to get as close as possible to a third on the first round.” The support of a third of MPs guarantees you a place in the members’ run-off.The problem for the former London Mayor, as this supporter acknowledges, is that “ there’s ever a perception that Boris was falling back then that would be compounded”.On the Cabinet side of the contest, Sajid Javid is attempting to reboot his campaign by today setting out his plan for how to deal with the Irish border issue.One of those backing him tells me it is “not just how you voted in the referendum, but your ability to implement no deal or negotiate with the EU” that matters. This supporter argues that Johnson and Raab aren’t going to get anything out of Brussels, while Javid might.The Cabinet side of the contest is becoming increasingly fractured. I understand that the Cabinet Ministers most opposed to No Deal have privately agreed to back either Matt Hancock or Rory Stewart in the first round. Both are running interesting campaigns.Stewart is out doing social media walkabouts, while Hancock is making arguments that the other candidates are being forced to follow. I’m told that next week he will propose a levy on betting companies to fund treatment for gambling addiction.The energy of these campaigns is causing trouble for the more established Cabinet contenders. I understand that backers of one of them are now warning MPs: “Go to bed with Hancock, wake up with Boris.”But Jeremy Hunt’s biggest problem is the sense that, in the words of one senior Tory, he is a “completely wasted place” in the final two as it is hard to see how he could beat a Brexiteer candidate.This is why a growing number of Tories think the party is “heading to the destined psycho-drama” of a Boris Gove run-off.BATTEN down the hatches, hurricane Donald is blowing into town. As his interview in this newspaper demonstrates, Donald Trump won’t be governed by the normal diplomatic conventions on his State visit.He is more than happy to make known his admiration for Boris Johnson, despite the Tory leadership contest. Though some of the rival camps think Trump’s blessing will be a double-edged sword.It is the Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, who will greet Trump on his arrival, which will give Hunt the chance to burnish his statesman credentials. Hunt will also be involved in Tuesday’s Downing Street talks between Trump and Mrs May.Penny Mordaunt, the Defence Secretary, who is expected to throw her hat into the leadership ring, will meet with the President’s daughter, Ivanka, to discuss female economic empowerment.Trump is not an easy President to deal with. But he is the leader of our closest and most important security ally. UK politicians must also realise that on ious issues, including China and the role of Huawei in G networks, the Trump position represents the new political consensus in the US.The UK would be mad to endanger its most import- ant intelligence relationship over this issue.THE next test for Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party comes on Thursday, with the Peterborough by-election.If Farage’s party can win, it will show how Brexit has redrawn the political landscape. It will give the Brexit Party a toe-hold in Parliament and a chance to become a formidable political force.Butthe Brexit Party can’t take a seat which voted heavily for Leave in the aftermath of its Labour MP being sent to prison, then its current momentum will be checked.CABINET on Tuesday has been cancelled. This is surprising given that it didn’t meet this week as Parliament was in recess. The official reason for it not taking place is that there is too much on with the Trump visit and D-Day commemorations.But as one minister points out to me, it is hard to believe that Cabinet would have been cancelledit hadn’t been for the fact that Theresa May is resigning as Tory party leader at the end of the week.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That is the Cabinet.It is not only Theresa May who let down Conservative Party voters, members and supporters.She was abetted and supported by her Cabinet. In this country we operate a system of collective responsibility and it is not good enough for Cabinet members now to claim they held a dferent view or would have done things dferently.How can it be right that Cabinet Ministers, who were complicit with the failed Brexit polices of Chequers, the Withdrawal Agreement and the subsequent betrayal of Brexit, credibly seek to claim they are an acceptable choice for this role They were sat around the top table when decisions were made and must take responsibility for them.I would sup with a very long spoon indeed with those who are complicit but now claiming they can offer the Party new leadership and direction.The British public are not stupid and our Party members know what they are voting for.They wont be fooled by those born-again ‘Leavers’, who trumpet their devotion to Brexit even though they have done nothing for the last three years to advance theof British sovereignty.The British public and our long suffering Party members know where the responsibility for the greatest breach of trust in our democratic institutions lies.After three years of being repeatedly told that ‘nothing has changed’, the time has come for ‘everything to change’.The British people are desperate for our country to leave the EU on st October. They are crying out for leadership which will put the country and our people first.The European Elections clearly reflect that and anybody who has knocked on doors or engaged the public in recent times knows that.We simply must move on and move out of the EU and fast.And in doing so we must move into a trade negotiation as has been outlined through numerous proposals over the last  months.Unfortunately Theresa May’s Cabinet showed themselves unwilling to listen to detailed proposals which would have a delivered the genuine Brexit the public voted for.So now the priority is to exit the European Union and move forward to negotiating a future relationship with protects British interests and keeps open the global prizes and benefits of Brexit which the British people voted for.Ministers who claim they are pro-brexit have failed to stand up for the . million who voted to leave and make that robust case to deliver the referendum mandate.The people were promised we would have left the EU months ago and that ‘no deal was better than a bad deal’.Having danced to the tune of the tune of the EU, spent billions of pounds on ‘no deal’ preparations, our country must just get on and leave the EU.Too many people in our political class lack confidence in our country and trust in the public. They have sought the comfort of the EU making our laws rather than making the decisions themselves. No wonder the British people feel betrayed.They expected the UK to leave the EU on th March as they were promised. Every day longer we remain in the EU adds salt to that wound.The governing class has broken trust in our politics.The British people voted to take back control and for Britain to be free, independent and self-governing again. Our destiny is as a global beacon of free trade, not a satellite of the EU.The Conservative Party must quit the navel-gazing and stop the rot of this Brexit betrayal.Those of us who believe in our Country and people, who respect our democratic and political freedoms, will continue to stand up for our liberty to make sure the days of betrayal are over.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I take them at their word - so on that basis the Withdrawal Agreement Bill is dead.Instead, I have a pragmatic three-step plan - a plan to deliver Brexit in a way that protects citizens of the UK and the EU, delivers certainty to businesses, and maintains the integrity of our United Kingdom.No more preicating. No more fearmongering. And no more limbo. Just compassionate and decisive action that demonstrates leadership.My first step will be to take sensible measures to enshrine certain agreements into law, and to protect our people.I will immediately introduce key legislation to address this.First, I will introduce a citizens’ rights bill. EU citizens who have built lives here, and UK citizens who have made their homes in the EU must have the weight of uncertainty lted from their shoulders.Second, I will introduce a bill that locks in the mutually beneficial measures that have already been agreed between the UK and EU.This will cover areas like citizens’ rights in Gibraltar, our sovereign bases overseas, security and intelligence-sharing relationships, transport, data, and medicines.It is in everyone’s interest to put these agreed arrangements in place, and I believe many MPs would support this, regardless of how they voted in the referendum.The second step is to give businesses and industry the confidence and certainty they need to plan for a managed exit. I want them to be able to invest, hire, and innovate with renewed optimism.So we will ramp up preparations for our managed exit, focusing efforts on delivering alternative arrangements for the Northern Ireland border with the EU.Our continued strong bond with Northern Ireland will be protected.There are some sensitive sectors that rely upon ‘just-in-time’ supply chains, like automotive and aerospace. I know how important these are, and we will propose specic regulatory agreements with the EU for these.For other industries, like medicines and agri-foods, we will seek specic customs agreements on tarfs and non-tarf barriers. This will protect trade in the most vital goods and services but allow us to embrace new free trade deals around the world.At the core of this work will be open communication to Parliament, the public, and EU colleagues about progress, to build an environment of confidence and certainty. Parliament will receive regular updates, and households and businesses will receive communication from government that provides clear information about our managed exit.Transparency will be at the heart of everything I do - it’s what parliament expects, and it’s what the public deserves.The third step will be to lead a delegation of UK Ministers to meet with the EU Council and the proposed new EU Commissioners, to talk directly about the wide-ranging preparations we are making for a managed exit on October .Discussions will culminate in a UK EU summit, in September, in Belfast and Dublin, where the EU Council and proposed Commission will be invited to agree which measures we will all accept, to ensure a properly managed exit.As Prime Minister, I will not advocate an extension of any kind, and it will be clear that in all circumstances the UK will leave the EU at the end of October. With comprehensive arrangements in place, we will be prepared for any eventuality.We owe it to the country, and to our strong democratic tradition, to fulfil the instruction that our voters gave us.I am a passionate, pragmatic and positive believer in Brexit, and with my three-step plan, we can decisively leave the EU. We can demonstrate to the world that the UK remains a beacon for opportunity, fairness and democratic leadership. We can restore that vital trust between politics and the people.It’s not too late to take advantage of the opportunities we hoped for in voting Leave.

This one-inch square of bright embroidery was given only to those who were first to storm ashore on D-Day.Their chances of being killed or maimed in that first wave on to the Normandy beaches on the morning of June , , were even higher than at World War One’s Battle of the Somme.Alan, now , will never forget the pep talk given by Brigadier George Prior-Palmer to tank crews of the th Armoured Brigade as they prepared to free Europe from Hitler’s tyranny.He says: “The Brigadier told us, ‘You’re the assault wave – you won’t be coming back’. A few like me survived but many didn’t.”Radio operator Alan, from Eye, Suffolk, and his crew had caught the last ship heading out to France from Gosport, Hants, after their Sherman tank was among several that broke down on the way to the harbour.He remembers watching General Bernard Montgomery drive past the convoy of stranded tanks waiting to be repaired and recalls: “Monty was in a vile temper as he went by in his car.”Then, after a night spent bucking and rolling in the choppy English Channel with no rations or sleep, a Naval officer stuck his head around the corner of the ship’s metal corridor and said: “Oh you poor buggers, you’re going now.”Just after am, as the tiny Landing Ship Tank  approached the Normandy coast, it looked asJuno Beach was on fire.At .am the battleship HMS Warspite launched a broadside – the starting signal for the assault.Alan recalls: “There was a small infantry ship alongside us which was hit by a German shell. It sank and the soldiers were thrown overboard.“The men were all in the water, thrashing about. Some were dead, some were injured. Others were trying to save themselves.“The ship went over the top of them and they were all chopped up into bits by the propellers.“As we went in, legs, arms, bodies and heads floated along in with us on a rising tide. It was a terrible sight.”The landing ship was carrying a lorry which was also hit by a shell and burst into flames. Alan says: “The lorry was blazing like mad and the tank behind it rammed it off the ship. Four tanks blundered off on to the shore.“The beach masters were shouting at us to fire this way and that but because the tank had been so heavily waterproofed, we couldn’t turn the turret or fire the gun.“Then they were shouting, ‘Get off the beach, get off the beach!’“So we went hell for leather across two roads, out into the countryside where we found a big depression where the Germans had been digging soil to make defences. We got into the hole to try to scrape off some of the waterproofing.“Shells were going one way, bullets the other way. I was terried.“The radios were no use. The British dialects were so strong you couldn’t understand what was being said, especially when they started swearing. It was a shambles.“Our officer, Goodwin his name was, said, ‘I think I’d better go and see what is happening’. But Jerry spotted him, dropped a mortar and he got hit in the back with shrapnel. He went back on the same ship he came in on.”Separated from their regiment and with no orders to follow, the crew of Alan’s Sherman made their own way until they found other tanks.He says: “There was a scream overhead and word went round that there was a German Tiger tank in the woods ahead. An officer came up with what they called a tank destroyer.“It had a bigger gun than what the German tank carried but it had no armour at all. It took a direct hit and bits flew everywhere.”Later, they found themselves leading a convoy, and Alan’s tank was hit as it climbed a railway embankment.Infantrymen managed to drag the crew out. As they waited for the Sherman to be repaired, they caught their first sleep in days.Alan says: “The only thing we did have in the way of food was cans of cocoa or soup.”After smashing through “Rommel’s asparagus” – wooden poles strung with wire to entangle British paratroopers and gliders – they fought German Panzers near Pegasus Bridge.Later, they were ordered to attack a chateau near Sannerville being used as SS headquarters. Alan, who worked as an engineer in Suffolk after his military career ended, says: “I looked through my periscope and I saw a German stand up as calm as can be with his bazooka.“Bang, off went our left-hand track. Shells were coming in all ways. Our tanks were being blown up right, left and centre. In his memoirs Monty said, ‘We lost a few’. We lost nearly  tanks in one day.”On July , Alan’s crew was still in the thick of the action north of Caen when the tank commander, Cpl Louis Wilkes, dropped down from the turret, blood pouring from his head.Alan says: “I ed under the gun and held him in my arms while we got him to a field dressing station, where the medics laid him out. I had lost my best friend. He was  years old and married with two children.“We rolled him up in his blankets and buried him in a grave we dug ourselves in an orchard, placing his tin hat to mark where we laid him.”Forty years later Alan found his friend’s grave had been moved to the military cemetery at Cambes-en-Plaine.Alan’s story features in a new book A Time To Fight, by Robert Anderson, published by Unorm.Read the remarkable stories of the ing veterans from our superb souvenir pulloutLes Reeves, Corporal, Royal Armoured CorpsIT was pm on D-Day before tank driver Cpl Les Reeves, who was attached to  Royal Armoured Corps, landed on Juno Beach.A veteran of El Alamein, he had already been in combat many times but was still extremely nervous.Les, who will be  on June , says: “Those who said they weren’t nervous were either fools or liars.“We hit the sea and we were submerged before the beach appeared in front of you. Our first hit was a German pillbox, which we blew up from  yards.“We were firing two- pounders, which were like pea-shooters against the Panzers which were equipped with mm guns.“The Germans had superior arms. The best pistol in the world was the Luger. They had the best machine-gun of the war, the Spandau, and, of course, they had the Tiger tank.“How did we win the war  We steamrolled them but would never have wonthe Yanks hadn’t come in.”Les drove his Churchill tank through Normandy, survived the carnage at Arnhem in the failed Operation Market Garden and the Battle of the Bulge before pressing on into Germany. Near Osna-bruck, the first tank in a convoy of three was hit.The next thing Les remembers is waking up in hospital in Oxford nine days later. The rest of his tank’s crew had all been killed. Les only survived because a metal plate attached to the tank’s turret protected him from the blast.But a piece of metal lodged in his head, leaving him blind for six months and paralysed down one side.Les ed home, to Walsall, West Mids, was married for  years to Della and ran his own business selling frozen food and commercial fridges.After the attack, it was another year before movement ed to his right hand, arm and leg.Les added: “It seems to me that sadly anyone under  doesn’t even know what D-Day was. They don’t know about Operation Market Garden.”Les has a severely autistic relative and was recently informed by a council official that a meeting about their welfare had been arranged for November .He says: “I told the woman, who was in her late thirties, ‘We can’t do that – it’s Armistice Day’.“She replied, ‘It may be important to you but not to me’. I was disgusted.Leonard Emmings, Coxswain, Royal NavyLEONARD “TED” EMMINGS was the ­coxswain of a Royal Navy landing craft bringing soldiers on to Juno Beach on the morning of D-Day.Carrying a platoon of  from the Queen’s Own Rles of Canada, Tedsteered his landing craft toward the shore.He says: “Our mission was, ‘Whatever you do, you’ve got to get your troops off’.“We were told, ‘It doesn’t matter what is going on around you – it’s your job to put the soldiers on the beach’.”Arriving under a hail of gunfire, Ted’s craft hit an obstacle and his crew had to kick its ramp down.Despite the damage, Ted’s crew were able to get all  troops out and on to the beach.He recalls: “We were one of the first lot to hit Juno Beach – the first wave.” But what Ted, from Guildford, Surrey, saw that day will never leave him.He says: “You got in as far as you could. You dropped your ramp and that was the signal to come out. That is when they were picked off.”The landing-craft coxswains spent days at the Normandy beaches in the initial assault, bringing more and more troops to further the Allied advance.Les says: “We were one of the first waves in but when we came back later on during the day, you could see all the blown-up landing craft and the bodies of the guys in the water – both dead and the ones slowly moving.” At one point, Ted’s craft hit an obstacle which detonated a mine.He says matter-of-factly: “We sank and got picked up out of the water. We didn’t have time to be scared.”Having survived that day, Ted saw many Canadian friends, who he had spent months training with, perish on the Normandy beaches. He says: “They came over here, trained over here, died over here. They never made it across the beach.“People should be told about it. I feel so sorry for the Canadians. I wonder how many of those got back to Canada one way or another.”Having lost so many of his mates, Ted has not missed a memorial since.The -year-old says: “I always go to Bayeux cemetery because two of my crew are there.”After the war, Ted worked for the Forestry Commission until he retired – but losing all those friends will always haunt him. He says: “We won the war in the end but whether it was worth it I don’t know.“I feel so sorry for the Canadians, as a lot didn’t get to go back home.”Ted Cordery, Torpedo Operator, HMS BelfastA VETERAN’S tears of grief for his fallen friends,  years after they died at ­Normandy, showed the nation just how raw the wounds of D-Day remain.In February Ted Cordery, , moved viewers when he wept on Good Morning Britain and said: “I lost shipmates I served with. I’ve seen their ashes go over the side.”He added: “I’m not the hero – they are the heroes.”As an able seaman on HMS Belfast on D-Day, Ted helped as dozens of wounded soldiers were brought off the beaches.He told viewers: “These soldiers could have been wounded a mile or two inland.Most of them never made it. They were taken to sick bays where most of them died.”He added: “It’s such a waste of a young le. I try to imagine how they ­suffered from a mile inland until they were lted on to the ship.”Ted was  when he ­volunteered in , choosing to join the Navy because his four brothers were in the Army. He already knew the harsh realities of war. At , he had seen his home in West Ham in East London bombed.He joined HMS Belfast and became a torpedo operator. When the ship was brought in to support the D-Day landings, Ted opened fire on the enemy. He said: “We were firing from the Belfast with the help of a spotter plane to provide support for the initial landings and provide cover fire for the troops.“The sight of all those troops being lowered into the water from the ships, some you knew would never make it to land, was just astounding.“It’s a memory that sticks with me – all those small boats full of men trying to get up on to the beaches . . . and the sight of those that didn’t make it.”Ted added: “When I landed on the beaches I saw the devastation. A few days later, out of nowhere, a local Frenchman passed on a bike, spat at my feet then carried on.“I was so angry and started to go after him. Luckily, my commanding officer told me to calm down and I stopped.“I thought, ‘He doesn’t know who I am and what I’m doing there. He could have lost his home, same as me’.”After the war, Ted worked as a Fleet Street printer. He married and lived in Oxford.Percy Lewis, Signalman, st Battalion Black WatchSIGNALMAN Percy Lewis was  on D-Day. His ­regiment suffered huge losses on Sword Beach and in the days that followed he ended up serving with the st Battalion Black Watch in a unit made up of men from other regiments.He said: “We were advancing through Holland. There was a bit of expected scrapping but after a week or so we advanced on this small village near a forest at night.“The way you advance, one platoon goes forward, then two platoons come up and you stop. And then they go through you. You are leapfrogging all the time.“We didn’t know where we were and I was told to send a signal back that we were all right because it was quiet. I couldn’t get through so was sent back on foot.”On his way back, Percy was captured by German paratroopers. He was taken into a building where he found a fellow soldier on the floor, covered in a blanket, begging for help for his hand.Percy said: “There was hardly anything of his right hand. It was all bleeding and two German medics were doing nothing.“I took out his field dressing and started bandaging it up. I put the tourniquet on and askedhe was all right. I’d just got him some water when someone dragged me up from behind.”A German officer with a rle pushed Percy up a flight of stairs where he was greeted by gunfire and the sight of a Panzer tank. He had been captured by the German th Parachute regiment and was handed over to the nd Panzer Grenadiers, shackled and placed in a makesht cell in the cellar of a nearby castle.Percy, from Windsor, Berks, said: “There were three beds with two blokes lying on the other two, but the beds were just the raw springs. The other two men were asleep but covered head to toe in mud, and they stank.”For the next ten days a German commander interrogated him daily about his mission, ision and unit as the number of men in the cell grew from three to .Eventually he was released, and after the war Percy ed to carpentry, the trade he learned before war broke out.He has ed to Arromanches in Normandy to remember his fallen friends almost every year since .He said: “When I first joined the Normandy veterans, Surrey branch, there were  of us.There was so much noise with bombs dropping everywhere – you couldn’t hear yourself talkCommando, Royal MarinesBOY soldier Joe Corless lied about his age to sign up at  – and marked his th birthday battling enemy fire at D-Day.Joe, , says: “A lot went in as boys but you came out a man – a lot wiser.”The son of a Boer War veteran, Joe adds: “On my th birthday I cycled  miles to Plymouth with two friends and we volunteered for the ­Marines. We told them we were  and we got away with it. They needed young men.”Recalling D-Day itself, Joe, from Bridgend, says: “On landing, all we saw was water and about , ships.“We were driving the boat in and out all the time.“On the initial landing, the blokes had to go over the side and swim. After that, you’d drop your ramp on the beach and the blokes would run ashore.“We would go to and fro bringing people in off the dferent ships.“We had sailors, commandos and shallow-water ers – or frogmen – whose jobs were to cut the barbed wire and disarm explosives.“The naval ships were shelling and there were bombs dropping all over the place. You couldn’t hear ­yourself talk.“Instead, we communicated by ­semaphore.”Joe landed at Lion-sur- Mer on Sword Beach – under heavy enemy fire. He says: “We didn’t know where they were, but they had guns up there ­damaging us.“There were six-inch anti-personnel shells. They would scatter their shrapnel and make holes in your boat. I was just standing there and lucky nobody shot me.”Instead, Joe – armed with two Lewis guns on his craft – managed to take out an enemy plane. He says: “These two ­German e bombers came in and we all had to open fire and we hit one and destroyed it. A report came over the tannoy, ‘Well done, Marines!’.To align his craft, Joe was given a map reference of a house up on the hill.Years later, he ed to Normandy with fellow former Marine George Davis, who recalls: “We found the house, and when we saw the front, Joe ­recognised it. He was absolutely thrilled to bits this house was still there.”Joe became an engineer after the war, working in power stations and chemical plants. But he never forgot the friends he lost in battle.He says: “You had mates going in but you didn’t have them when you come back. But it was what we trained for – and I have never gloried in it.“The survivors are all getting older now but D-Day should never be forgotten – like those close friends we lost.”Albert Price, Tank Operator, Royal DragoonsHAVING watched his friends die during a training exercise six weeks earlier, Albert Price was one of the first men on to Gold Beach.At  years of age, he had been part of Operation Smash, the largest live-ammunition practice of World War Two.It was supposed to herald the success of the new DD Valentine tanks which could “sail” on the sea then drive on land. But instead of a ­successful preparation for D-Day, five tanks sank and six men perished.Albert, , who now lives in Solihull, West Mids, says: “I managed to get out when my tank started to go down but other men weren’t so lucky. We knew we had to do it again in Normandy so we put it behind us and focused on the task in hand.”Albert had joined the th th Royal ­Dragoon Guards in  and he says of June , : “When we set off I think all of us felt very proud, but none of us knew we’d be taking part in something that would go down in history.”After landing, Albert’s unit happened upon an enemy building in the distance and groups of retreating soldiers.“There were lots of German infantry marching away,” he recalls. “I remember how archaic their columns looked – there were no tanks or armoured vehicles.“There were horses pulling things and what looked like ­furniture vans. We fired upon them and while I didn’t care about the German loss of le, the horses being killed really stuck with me.” But Albert’s D-Day ended after a skirmish with the th Panzer ision on day two.He says: “I had my head on the tank telescope. I heard a loud blast and someone shouting, ‘We’ve been hit’. It was like a sheet of red came across my entire face.”With blood pouring from a head wound sustained from the telescope, Albert fled out of the tank.He says: “There was machine gun fire all around us. I was shot in my left foot and a ricochet hit my right shoulder.“A fire was raging so I backed away as best I could. I was still trying to move when a black figure walked past me.“I barely recognised him as our driver because he was burned so badly.”Albert was eventually rescued and taken back to an aid station.He says: “My tags said I was ­Catholic even though I wasn’t and the padre came and gave me my last rites as I waited evacuation.”After the war, Albert lived in Canada for  years. He ed to Britain and worked in insurance.Recalling ato Normandy, he said: “I found the graves of the men I served with but I ­prefer to remember them as the men they were, not the men buried there.”Marion Loveland, Wren Third Officer, Royal NavyMARION LOVELAND was working in the Navy pay office on D-Day.But she remembers June  for all the wrong reasons because her fiancé, marine commando Alec Aldis, died serving his country on Sword Beach.Marion, , from Southampton, recalls: “Alec and I hadn’t told anyone about us. I read in the lists he’d been killed and from then on I lost my love of ­service and left the Navy.”Marion was familiar with Forces le, as her father was a colonel in the Royal Marines and her mother was a Wren during World War One.Marion says: “I grew up on a barracks so it was a le I already knew. I’d got a job at BP in London but then war broke out so I signed up to serve.”The -year-old was posted to ­Eastney Barracks, Hants, where her father served, and it is there she met Alec, a signal officer in  Commando Royal Marines. She says: “He was very reticent to pursue ­anything because of who my father was.”With the war ratcheting up, Marion was posted to The Old Naval College in Greenwich, far from her fiancé. She recalls: “The last time I saw Alec, a few days before D-Day, he asked me to marry him at Christmas when he got back.”But Alec landed on Sword Beach, which had very little cover, and was killed. Marion recalls: “I was at work and saw a report saying he’d been KIA. It affected me badly and after that I wanted to leave the Navy.”While her engagement had been a secret, Marion’s parents knew she had suffered a loss. She says: “Dad didn’t know the details but they knew I’d been hugely affected.”Marion ed to her job at BP and met her husband Stuart, who she married in .While she will pay her respects today to those who lost their lives, she will also be celebrating her th birthday. She says: “It is D-Day memorials first then maybe lunch in a restaurant.”On her birthday in , she recalls: “I went to ­dinner with friends and saw planes flying over.“It didn’t even cross my mind that Alec wouldn’t come back.”Christian Lamb, Plottings Officer, Royal NavyWHEN teenager Christian Lamb joined the Wrens, one of her main concerns was what type of hat she would wear.But her skills landed her in Churchill’s office in Whitehall making top-secret maps for the D-Day invasion.Now, , Christian, from Battersea, South West London, recalls: “I joined the Wrens in  at . I discovered I was going to be a rating, so I wouldn’t have an officer’s hat. Disaster!“I had to have the worst hat instead.”Christian was offered a job at head office but says: “I had joined to be surrounded by naval ships full of luscious- looking sailors. So I said, ‘No thanks!’ ”Transferred to Plymouth as a plottings officer working on the radar covering the Atlantic, she would enjoy nights out with submariners ing from the Med.She says: “We all had great fun and parties on board the ­submarines.” Later transferred to Belfast, Christian met John Lamb, a First Lieutenant. She recalls: “We got engaged in ten days. We were ­married for about  years with three children and seven grandchildren.”Christian was transferred to Churchill’s Whitehall office in  where she helped prepare maps for the Normandy landings under total secrecy.She says: “There were many of us working on inidual pieces of the ­jigsaw but none of us knew what the ­others were doing. My brief was to ­pinpoint everything identiable that could be seen from the bridge of an approaching landing craft.“The large-scale Ordnance Survey maps showed all those roads, churches, castles and every possible feature that would be visible.“Anything notable, I put on my maps. It had to be accurate.“Churchill had an office upstairs and we used to see secret people doing all sorts of exciting things.”Christian was then posted to Falmouth to join her husband, who had ed with a convoy.She says: “When D-Day came, I remember hearing reports on the radio.“It was absolutely ­thrilling. They probably used my maps to make a base for their plans.”Tom Hill, Coxswain, Royal MarinesAFTER spending  days on Sword Beach, Tom Hill believes he was ­fortunate to survive.Tom, , from Purley, Berks, was  when he signed up to the Royal Marines in .“To join other regiments you had to be ,” he recalls with a smile.Working as a tool setter – a protected profession – Tom gave up his job to serve his country.“We had no idea D-Day was happening,” he says. “We were on a ship in ­Portsmouth and we would often pick up Army soldiers and take them to Scotland, so we presumed it was a ­normal day, a normal job.”But when -year-old Tom, a landing craft coxswain, saw the soldiers handling French money, he suspected something dferent was about to happen.On the SS Empire Battleaxe, Tom was part of a flotilla that landed at Sword Beach. He and his crew of four had to ferry soldiers in Landing Craft Assaults, or LCAs, from the main ships into the shallows at Sword to fight.Tom says: “I could see other LCAs with their doors blown off.“There was one beside me. The sergeant had one engine and couldn’t fire the other. The body of one of our troops was wrapped on the propeller.”Tom and his crew ferried in hundreds of troops and supplies to advance the attack.“One day we were eating when I had an urge to gun the LCA’s engines. As it lurched forward, a shell landed where we’d been a few seconds earlier. I can’t explain it to this day.”Just days after their narrow escape, Tom’s craft was delivering letters when a captain told them to stay over on one side of the boat. Intrigued, Tom’s team rounded on the ship only to realise a shell had gone down its hatch, ­killing every soldier inside.Tom and his crew continued their work, but on their th day they were hit and their LCA sank.“We swam to an American tugboat,” Tom recalls. “The captain told us they were ing to America and did the four of us want to come.“But we rejoined a British ship and were given five days’ survivors leave.“My sister came to Portsmouth to visit me for the day.”When he rejoined his unit after leave, they started an -month commission all over the Pacic.Tom, a school caretaker for  years before he retired, says: “While I’ve been fortunate to marry, have children and live a long le, it is never easy being one of the lucky ones. So many good men I served with didn’t get to see the world in peace.Ian Forsyth, Trooper, th Armoured DivisionFOR Ian Forsyth, D-Day was only the start of an -month odyssey.He went on to survive being blown up in his tank and ­liberate the Bergen- Bn ­concentration camp.Ian, from Rosehearty, Aberdeenshire, was a -year-old trainee teacher when he took part in the ­Normandy Landings as a radio operator.He said: “As well as operating the wireless it was also my job to load the gun.”The trooper’s th Armoured Division broke out of the Normandy beachhead and harried Hitler’s Nazis all the way back to Germany.They headed to Northern France and then Belgium where they captured Antwerp. By March , they had also captured the German city of Lubeck.Ian, , recalls: “It was a constant ­battle. You got brief periods of respite before you were on the go again.“We lived and slept inside those tanks and they were not built for comfort. They were claustrophobic and very warm.”Three times Ian was in a tank that was hit by shells – but he says: “The worst that happened to me was losing my front teeth and suffering an injury to my hand.“It all depended which side you were on when the shell hit.“Sadly others weren’t so lucky. There were only three of us left at the end of the war from a troop of .”In April , Ian and his troop arrived at Bergen-Bn.The Brits were un- prepared for the sight of , emaciated sick prisoners – and more than , corpses. Tears fill Ian’s eyes as he recalls: “I couldn’t believe what I saw. The smell from the decomposing bodies was unbelievable.“Prisoners were looking at us through the barbed wire. We disobeyed orders and threw food over the fence.“But the folk at the back crushed ­forward and trampled to death the folk at the front. We made a bad, bad ­mistake but we didn’t know any better.”Ian’s war didn’t finish until the surrender of Hitler’s successor Admiral Donitz on May , .Returning home, he finished his ­training and went on to teach ­engineering. He now lives in Hamilton, Lanarks.The grandfather of five had two daughters with his we Margaret, who passed away in  – and he also has three great-grandchildren. Memories of the war stay with him.He said: “I thought I was going to help to change the world – it wasn’t long after D-Day before I lost that dream and I was fighting to ­survive.”John Bell, Bomb Aimer, Bomber CommandWHEN the war started in , John Bell was  and took his father’s advice to leave school and get a job “because the war won’t last long”.He started work as an office boy at an accountancy firm in the City of London but, inspired by hearing the Battle of Britain overhead in , he joined the RAF as soon as he was .John, now  and living in Worthing, West Sussex, said: “I was ft in and was told I was too tall to be a pilot, so I signed up as an observer-navigator and had gun training in South Africa. In  I was assigned to Lancasters as a bomb aimer.”A member of  Squadron, John and his crew flew all over France and Germany in the months before D-Day as part of the RAF’s Bomber Command.With crews expected to perform  ops before going on brief leave, John and his six fellow airmen spent the first few months of  flying over Northern France.He said: “There were targets and we didn’t know at the time but they were all ­connected to the invasion – ammunition dumps, factories and the like, all targets that could have had an implication on the success of the invasion.”On June , John’s crew were told the invasion would happen the next day and they would have a pivotal role.The squadron of  Lancasters was split into groups.Taking it in turns, each group would fly two miles apart, at mph, for a minute and  seconds before flying back on themselves for one minute. Every three seconds, each plane dropped aluminium strips known as chaff to jam German radar signals.John, who is originally from Storrington, said: “Every hour we’d be replaced by another formation who would do the same thing. It was to make the Germans consider whether they had enough reinforcements on the beaches orthey needed more in the skies.“We were excited, andany of us felt nerves then no one said anything.“It was a great feeling and we were proud to take part.”As the end of the crew’s  operations approached, John recalled: “We believed we’d survive. Our rear gunner had a we and child and was a few years older than the rest of us.“He’d tell us we’d have to get home, and we believed him.“If you’re flying through bullets, someone will always survive.”After the war John saw service in Cyprus, Singapore and Washington DC before finally leaving the RAF as a Wing ­Commander in .Patricia Davies, Special Duties Linguist, Women’s Royal Naval ServiceAS a schoolgirl recovering at home from tuberculosis, Patricia Davies passed the time by chatting to the ­Austrian cook and housemaid who had been hired to help her mother.By the outbreak of war, she was  and fluent in German – making her the perfect recruit as a Wren translator.Now , Patricia, from Chiswick, West London, said: “I joined in the spring of , aged , and I was a special duties linguist, trained to intercept German naval radio signals.“We were based on an isolated little radio receiving station on top of the clf in Dover.Churchill visited five times in order to be seen in the area as part of ­Operation Fortitude – to make the Germans think we were going to land at Calais.“I’d been on night duty and came out of this building at eight o’clock in the morning and there was Churchill coming up the clf path and I think Monty was with him and a lot of staff officers.“I thought, ‘What on earth was the Prime Minister doing on top of our isolated clf at eight o’clock on a spring morning ’ Of course, he went to look at the coast opposite and no doubt intended to be seen in the area.”She continued: “We were all intensely aware D-Day was going to happen.“Our Wren officer went on June  to Dover Castle to get sealed orders, but the invasion was postponed because of the weather, so we were all on edge.“Then at about four the next morning, one of the Wrens who had been on duty came rushing round all of our ­bedrooms, saying, ‘It’s started, it’s started!’“We got dressed and went out on top of the clf, but there was nothing you could see from where we were.“There was always a lot of shelling of Dover – which was known as Hellfire Corner.They shelled the town and also tried to hit these convoys that passed by right underneath the clf.“We saw one little ship hit directly by a shell and it exploded and caught fire. That was very sad.”Patricia added: “My st birthday was a week after D-Day and I was very unsure whether we would be able to celebrate but we did.“Our friends came to our Wrens’ ­station and we had a proper party.”After the war, Patricia became a BBC producer, working on The Sky At Night.She said: “I still keep in touch with two of my ­colleagues, both well into their nineties, and we did go back to Dover last spring for our firstto our station on top of the clf.“The house is now a luxury hotel – slightly dferent inside from when it was full of radio sets and bunks.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We will mostly likely have to delay flight until morningthis happens.”The messages were sent in an internal server for employees.The flight attendants are understood to have decided to stay on the flight – despite working longer hours than they should have.But they complained to Delta bosses and said they would be “tired and hungry”.An attendant listed as “flight leader” voiced her complaints in correspondence seen by Huffpost.“Since we are deciding to stay although y’all are trying to trap us on the plane, and now our layover has been shortened and we will be past our duty day, hungry and tired. It would be nice to have a deadhead at some point tomorrow.”A ‘deadhead’ is a crew member flying in a passenger seat. They are not a part of the working crew and are often being repositioned by the airline.A later message said: “We are ready to walk literally, Doing the operation a huge favour.”Delta is following up with the team involved to address the situation.“Operating an airline is a team effort and the guidance shared in this exchange does not reflect the respect and collaboration we expect of our employees when making operational decisions,” a spokesperson told SunOnline.“Delta’s unique culture is built on supporting one another and that didn’t happen in this case.

In a ruling published in March , the regulator said his programmes were in breach on two counts on separate days in July and August . He said the notion Jeremy Corbyn was tolerating and enabling anti-Semitism was a “gigantic lie” and described allegations against him as a “coup”, Ofcom said. TalkRADIO argued Mr Galloway was the “maverick lone voice of the left compared to the majority of his fellow presenters.” But Ofcom said they were “serious breaches” and said the regulator was considering a statutory sanction.

And a friend landing from across the Atlantic wouldn’t try to get his dirty, money-grabbing tiny mitts on our National Health Service.

Trump mini-me Johnson is happy to cuddle for a pat on the head from an orange man-baby he once labelled “out of his mind”, whose “stupefing ignorance” meant he was “unfit” to be President.

Veteran Tory Ken Clarke said the Conservative Party is tearing itself apart and joined mounting calls for the field to narrow itself. He told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: It is all a shambles and is in danger of becoming a rather tragic farce unless some order is brought into it. There is nothing I can do about that the  Committee perhaps should have tightened up the rules before we started.

But first MPs must hold one round of voting for each candidate until the field is reduced to two. There are concerns that could take several weeks before , Tory members get the chance to choose the winner from the final two in a postal ballot. Cabinet minister James Brokenshire called for outsiders to stand aside. He warned: We simply do not have the luxury of weeks of navel-gazing or days and days of whittling candidates down to the final two and talking to ourselves.    So I say gently to some of my colleagues who have put themselves forward for what has been described as the Grand National of Political Contests – please, think carefully. If you already know itaposs going to be a bit of a struggle to get over the first fence, let alone Becheraposs Brook ahead, then maybe you should pull up. There is no embarrassment in that. And Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said those with little support should think twice about staying in the race. He said: I would say that I rather agree with James Brokenshire today. And I hope those who are not really, numbers-wise, in the running, will think twice about whether they really want to go ahead with their candidacies.

Ian Jeffrey was found in the water at Holden Wood Reservoir by a man on a fishing trip on the morning of Sunday, December , . A hearing at Burnley Magistrates’ Court heard that the -year-old had sent messages and letters expressing his worries about a tax credit issue and his own depression to his loved ones prior to going missing. A post-mortem examination gave the cause of his death as drowning. The inquest heard from detective inspector Tim Brown who said belongings were left at the waterside including a note wrapped in plastic.    He said: “There were no apparent injuries or suspicion of violence or third party involvement. “We had information from family members that notes had been left by him.” Mr Jeffrey’s son, Alex, told the court he had seen his father the night before and there was ‘nothing unusual about the evening’, but that after taking a phone call his father was ‘quiet and distracted’. He added that his father could sometimes be ‘an over-thinker and a worrier’. He said: “I woke the following morning to a phone call from my mother. She had received a text from him and the police had already been called.” The court heard that Mr Jeffrey had been prescribed anti-depressants in  but on his final visit to his GP in March  he said he was no longer taking them and declined a further prescription.    Lancashire Coroner Richard Taylor said: “One thing I cannot do at this hearing is answer why he did it but I think the answer would seem to have been answered in the messages that he sent to you. “You have my sincere condolences and my sympathy that you have had to relive this at this hearing.” Mr Taylor recorded a conclusion of suicide.   ***Most people who are thinking of taking their own le have shown warning signs beforehand.

The Duchess of York shared some snaps from the Trooping the Colour rehearsal causing fans to beg for her to reunite with the Queenaposs son. Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie were also at the event which saw the Prince join the parade in his formal unorm. One snap shows the family posing together with Fergie laughing as she looks up at her former husband. Another sweet image shows the three ladies looking at Andrew from a balcony.   Fergie captioned the snaps: So proud of  @hrhthedukeofyork  on parade today for The Colonel’s Review with  @grenadier.guards  at Horseguards and also my girls.Numerous fans have since commented on the post begging the pair to get back together. One wrote: Just re-marry and make us all happy x. Another said: Thanks so much for sharing these photos !!! You all look so great and so happy!!! Such a wonderful family. I’d just love to see you and the Duke remarry or at least officially get back together. You two are soul mates and in my eyes The Greatest Royal Love Story. You two are meant to be. A third added: I think they will marry again, love in the air.    Rumours of a potential reunion between Fergie and Andrew have been swirling since Princess Eugenieaposs wedding last October.Last month,  ITV Royal Editor  Chris Ship  reported Andrew and Fergie, who live together in Windsor, were back together more than  years after they orced. A report by the Sun claimed Andrew and Fergie are back in a romantic relationship that friends say makes them friends with benefits.Neither is dating or pursuing anyone  romantically, the report claims. It is said Prince Philip has removed his objection to the relationship, with friends saying he doesnapost care any more, the report added. But Charles is adamantly opposed to the idea of Fergie becoming a royal again and believes she will look for ways to make money off her royal position, it is claimed.  A royal source claimed: Charles is not OK with Fergie. He can’t stand her in reality. “He thinks she’s brought embarrassment to the Royal Family in the past and his relationship with his brother has been strained as a result. There’s so much baggage because he feels she sided with Diana over Camilla all those years ago. However, another royal source denied the claims, telling : It is not correct to say thatare back together. Fergie recently joined Andrew on a trip to Bahrain with daughter Beatrice and her boyfriend, property developer Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, fuelling rumours that their romance was back on. However, the Duchess of York has denied claims that sheaposs back with her ex-husband.  Her spokesman said: “The Duke and Duchess remain good friends as they have been for many years, and nothing has changed.” A spokesperson for Andrew declined to comment at the time. The Queen, meanwhile, has a personal relationship with Fergie, inviting her to Balmoral for summer visits. Fergie has also told recently how she joins Her Majesty for tea at Ascot and Windsor Castle.She also attended  Prince Harry  and Meghan Markleaposs wedding in May last year. However, she doesnapost get an invite to the Queenaposs estate in Sandringham, Norfolk, when Beatrice and Eugenie join their father and the rest of the royals for Christmas.The Duchess of York landed in the  Royal Familyaposs  bad books as the couple went through a dramatic and public separation in  before orcing in .The scandal led to her being shunned for years before relations began to thaw as their children grew older. Behind it all, Sarah and Andrew have remained close and they reside together at Royal Lodge in Windsor. Rumours of a reconciliation have continued to follow the couple and Fergie revealed in November last year that people keep asking herthey will remarry. She said at the time that she and Andrew were happy with the way we are right now and the happiest orced couple in the world.

She had been seeking £, in damages plus her legal fees. Experts believe that her success could tempt others who are unhappy with the quality of teaching they received at university to take legal action. Ms Wong, who now lives in Hong Kong, told The Sunday : The payout means this is a victory for me, despite the university strenuously fighting my case and denying any responsibility.apos She added: In light of this settlement I think universities should be careful about what they say in prospectuses. I think they often make promises which they know will never materialise or are simply not true.    Speaking ahead of the settlement last year, she said: Although I graduated with a First Class degree in , it is a Mickey Mouse degree. I hope that bringing this case will set a precedent so that students can get value for money, andthey donapost they get compensated.

Anglia Ruskin, which holds a mid-ranking in UK university league tables, said that because the settlement was out of court, nothing had been proved in law. A spokesman said: Ms Wongaposs longstanding litigation... has been settled at the instruction of our insurers to draw a line under these matters and to prevent a further escalation of their legal costs. The claims were wholly without merit and resulted in cost orders made against Ms Wong by the Central London County Court on two occasions. In , the Advertising Standards Authority upheld complaints against six universities – Leicester, East Anglia, Strathclyde, Falmouth, Teesside and the University of West London.  It said that universities had to be able to prove claims that they made about their status.

Lucy Regler, who works as a make-up artist, had layered on the self tan mousse but forgot to exfoliate and moisturise. The -year-old was horried when she woke up with bright orange hands and what looked like a beard on her face. She had hoped the fake tan would help her to look smart for a aposposhapos brand event but ended up feeling embarrassed by the patchy coverage. Photos show the self-tanner with her normal pale complexion contrasted by her dark orange tanned hand and a fake-tan shadow under her chin.    Lucy claims she used the aposwrong side of the tanning mittapos and the resulting patchy coverage also left white streaks on her chest, armpits, legs and left her feet two dferent colours. After sharing the photos online, pals were convinced that the orange hand on Lucyaposs mouth belonged to someone  - and were in hysterics when they realised the error. Lucy claims that the result was so aposdiabolicalapos sheaposll never self-tan again. Lucy, from Aberdare in Wales, said: It looks absolutely vile. When my mother saw me she just went aposwhat the f*** have you done apos. My legs turned out really well but my hands made people make comments like, aposI thought someone  was grabbing youapos. They were like aposI thought you were being kidnapped, you couldaposve got away with thatapos.    My neck made it look like I had a beard because I had only done the tan up to a certain point on my face.

I donapost think Iaposll tan again. I think Iaposll have a spray tan from now on. I donapost want to risk it. Iaposm just going to let an expert do it next time. Iaposve scrubbed, Iaposve itched and everything, Iaposve used a skin peeler and it didnapost work. She claims it was the first time she had used fake tan in seven years and had previously always used tan wipes to achieve her golden glow. Lucy, who also works at McDonaldaposs, said: I wanted a fake tan because I was going to a really posh event. Iaposm really not posh, so I was like Iaposll have a tan, Iaposll look really skinny with my tan. So I was chucking the layers on, it wasnapost making much dference so I thought Iaposd keep going.    My hands just werenapost taking it so I pumped about six pumps [of the mousse] and literally lathered my hands with it. I just cried the next morning. I wanted to cry. Compared to the rest of my body it was diabolical. The event was really posh. They were drinking their champagne while I was drinking my WKD. I wanted to look all smart. But I didnapost look smart, not with the bad hands and bad ankles. I had to use a darker foundation, but it didnapost look too bad.

James Davenport is a man who threw himself into his passions. The former boxer, better known as Shinny, calculated that he slept with , women from the age of  to . Whether it was girlfriends, one night stands or prostitutes, the -year-oldaposs appetite for sex was near intiatbale. But it wasnapost enough.    Alcohol, drugs, sex - anything. The quick, instant gratication was what I wanted, the Salford man said. “From the age of about  or  when I went fully into sex, up until I was about , I calculated that I probably slept with about , women. “I picked up prostitutes, women from clubs, anywhere. I could have between five and  women over the course of a weekend. But it wasn’t enough. “I even started questioning my own sexuality at one point.” Shinnyaposs appetite for sex and alcohol started when he was just ten-years-old. “I would manipulate older girls to perform sex acts on me,” he said. “I was very mature at an early age, my thinking was like a teenager. I knew it was wrong, but it excited me. I couldn’t help myself. “Addicts become experts at manipulating and we will do anything to get what we want. For me it was simple to manipulate a girl older than me and convince her it was OK to do what we were doing.    “The alcoholism started around the same age. I remember drinking alcohol at my grandparents. It was some form of lager in a tap barrel in their spare room. I loved the way it made me feel.” Shinny can pinpoint his compulsive behaviour back to when he was seven and experienced addiction for the first time. “I used to steal it and drink it out of the bottle,” remembered Shinny, who now hosts a recovery talk show in Youtube. “With vinegar, I think I got a kick from it, a bit like with a chilli. “I also remember drinking out of a dirty puddle, and have only recently found out, during my recovery, that it was also part of the addiction. As I drank it I remember thinking - I have made my own decision to do that and no one knows what I’ve done. “Along with that my behaviour was up the wall. I used to wet the bed and was scared of the dark when I was younger. I always felt like an outsider looking in. Through my addictions and behaviour I was trying to escape my own thinking.” By high school Shinny - who also struggled with bulimia for  years - was snfing aerosols, smoking weed and doing harder drugs.    He would go on to sell drugs and become involved with Salford gangs. Sex, drugs, rock and roll, violence and criminal activity was my le,” he said. “Alcoholism has nothing to do with alcohol as such, it’s the feeling that it gives you. Anything that excites me - Iaposm in. “Later on I became involved in criminal activity. I wanted to be the most successful, hardest drug dealer. And the most handsome. I can go to bed thinking about myself, dream about myself and wake up thinking about myself. Addicts are very self-obsessed people.”    Shinny believes some of his issues stemmed from his relationship with his alcoholic father, who wasnapost present during large parts of his upbringing. He had the chance to forgive him for his absence for he died seven years ago. The father of two hit rock bottom when he began planning out his suicide, only to pull himself back from the edge by thinking of his eight and -year-old children. “I planned how I was going to do it, and how. It’s so sad to think that it can get that dark. When my partner left and I could not be with my children anymore, that was what I needed to sort myself out. “I went into detox in . Since then I have had one relapse, but as of June , I will be two years clean.” Despite a relapse in , Shinny has turned his le around with the help of Alcoholics Anonymous’ -step programme, and the support of his partner Nicole Evans. Now two years clean he has used his experience to help educate people about addiction through a documentary called aposThe Making of an Addictapos.   A -minute teaser of the biopic, directed by Chris Green, was screened Saturday morning at HOME and is available to view on Shinnyaposs official Facebook page.He now aims to make the full movie, which he then hopes to take round schools as an education tool for young people. “I want this film to be the new Kes, I want it to be an education to children in schools,” he explained, talking of the  film by Ken Loach. “I have channeled my addictions into getting well and helping others, and want to show others that it can be done. If it wasn’t for my girlfriend Nicole I wouldn’t be where I am today. She’s a massive part of my le. “This disease is always going to be there. You can either wallow in it or fight. My first thought in the morning is always negative, but I quickly change that into a positive and pray to a higher power greater than me to keep me clean and sober for one more day. “It’s a  hour reprieve. I don’t think about tomorrow. If I have to do this for the rest of my le to be a decent father and member of the community, I will.”The trailer of the documentary can be viewed here.If you need someone to talk to Samaritans can be confidentially reached on  .

I ask-year-olds should have the vote but Yasmeen doesn’t think the voting age should be dropped. She says: “I don’t know very much about politics. There are so many stupid people of my age.” And much older, young lady! But is my generation running the country well  Karina thinks not as young people are not represented properly. She argues Swedish school strike leader Greta Thunberg “represents us” and climate change is “more important than Brexit.” As an oldie who thinks the pits should never have been closed and backs fracking under the right conditions, there’s not a lot I can say to that.    These bright sixth-form lasses from Longley Park College in ­Sheffield are also concerned about their generation’s lack of representation on television.

I’m Labour, old Labour in fact, but not a Corbynista. Karina asks what I think about today’s society. That’s harder to answer, but I believe the Thatcherite ­revolution atomised society, exalting ­iniduality over collective identity.

She writes: Was there any extra tension behind the scenes at Buckingham Palace during Donald Trump’s visit Prince Charlesaposs body language signals suggested there was.  The Prince of Walesapos signature self-comfort anxiety rituals appeared to have increased as he emerged from the palace to greet Trump on the lawn outside. He patted his pockets stuffed one hand inside his left pocket several times fiddled with his cuffs and ended employing a hand-wring as he stood waiting, suggesting high levels of agitation. He received Trump with a warm smile though, finding himself on the receiving end of a very prolonged, bent-arm handshake ritual that included eight or nine hand-judders and even a pat on the arm add-on gesture from Trump, who was clearly trying to show bloke-ish friendship and good humour.    There was some rather awkward rituals of herding and ushering after that, with Trump using one hand to usher Charles to walk in front, which led to Charles throwing both arms out to his sides to counter-herd Trump in front of him like a shepherd with his flock. Trump adopted an air of happy dignity, using a mouth-clamp and raised chin plus a very upright walk, although he broke into a smile of pleasure as he walked up to greet the Queen. Trump claimed he could have bedded DianaBy Chris KitchingBusiness mogul-turned-politician Donald Trump, now , is known for making dubious claims and inappropriate comments about women in his decades in the spotlight.  He made some tasteless remarks about Princess Diana, , shortly before her death in a car crash in Paris . Then a real estate magnate, Trump, speaking to radio shock jock Howard Stern, bragged that he could have bedded the Princess of Wales. Trump - who recently called Prince Harryaposs we, Meghan Markle, nasty - agreed he could have nailed the mother-of-two in a shocking interview. Stern asked: You could’ve gotten her, right  You could’ve nailed her.  Trump agreed, saying: I think I could have. He added: “She was actually really beautul. I thought she was supermodel beautul. She had times when she didn’t look great and she had times when she looked better than anyone in the world. It is said that both Charles and Prince William deliberately snubbed Trump when he visited the UK in July last year. In , Trump told the New York Times that Charles and Diana - then still married - would be joining his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida.  It was an effort to boost his business, but it was fake news. Buckingham Palace responded to the report and called the claims rubbish. The palace was also forced to rubbish claims that Diana wanted an apartment in Trump Tower in New York. More recently, the Prince of Wales, , and Trump are at odds over climate change. Charles, the heir to the throne, is a champion of the environment who has launched a number of conservation initiatives over the years. Trump has called climate change a Chinese hoax, bulls**t and a con job in the past, he wants to pull the US out of the Paris Accord, and many of his policies have been condemned by environmentalists. In January , two years before he was sworn in, Trump tweeted: This very expensive GLOBAL WARMING bulls**t has got to stop. Our planet is freezing, record low temps,and our GW scientists are stuck in ice.

The President and his we Melania will be guests of honour at the swanky celebration, which will be filled with tradition, protocol and some very, very fancy food. But thereaposs a lot more to a State Banquet than just sitting down for dinner. Months of preparation go into the lavish affairs and everything from the food to the guestlist is thoroughly planned. The whole thing only lasts an hour and  minutes, but there are lot of things President President Trump and his we will have lots of rules to remember.    The table A team of three people spend EIGHT weeks unpacking all George IVaposs Grand Service, dismantling, washing, polishing and putting it back together again. Setting up the room itself starts about five days before the event and a dedicated team spends hours making sure everything is just perfect. All the napkins are embroidered with the Queenaposs monogram, and are folded by one person so they are all exactly the same.    Each guests has six glasses for champagne, white and red wine, dessert wine, port and water. There are , bits of cutlery on the table for  guests. A member of the team measures each of the place settings to make sure every piece of cutlery, glass and decoration is in exactly the right place - to the millimetre. Once all the decorations have been added, the Queen does a final inspection to check everything is perfect. The food Chefs in the Palace kitchen start preparing the food as late as possible to ensure it is all fresh. Everything is handmade from scratch.    There are four course - fish, meat, pudding and then dessert . The menu changes for every occasion, but the dishes served up as just as fancy as you would expect. For King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maximaaposs visit last year, the kitchen served up meat pies and chocolate orange torte. The guests When guests arrive they will be shown into one of the state rooms before being personally presented to the Queen. They must remember not to touch the Queen at any point. Michelle Obama raised eyebrows when she put her arm around the Queen during a visit to the Palace.    They are then led into the banquet room where they have to check the seating plan and find their seats. Guests must then stand at their place until the Queen comes into the room. Once she takes her seat, everyone  can sit down. During the first course, the Queen will chat to the guest on her right. On the second course, she will switch to the guest on her left. This means President Trump will have to make sure he doesnapost chat to her when itaposs not his turn.

She screamed: She is my mother, she is -years old, you are supposed to be looking after her. Please make her loose.  The disturbing footage also shows Mrs Maraisapos daughter trying to comfort her by stroking her hair while telling her Iaposm sorry mother.

They just left her there.She was so hungry and dehydrated. They couldnapost even apologise for what they did to my mother.  A family spokesperson Viginia Keppler told press outside the Mamelodi East Police Station that the family still have not been told why Mrs Marais was restrained. Gauteng Health, which is responsible for the hospital , has launched an investigation into the incident.A nurse, security guard and two doctors accused of being involved in restraining Mrs Marais have been put on special leave by the organisation.   Gauteng health executive council member Bandile Masuku told The Times : We have done our preliminary investigation and we have received reports.The reports have revealed four iniduals who were involved and who are on special leave pending their suspension. The report, according to Mr Masuku, identied a number of challenges regarding how Marais was treated as well as capacity issues relating to management and infrastructure. The family of Mrs Marais was visited by Mr Masuku on Sunday after the footage went viral. According to Gauteng health the hospital staff involved were served with letters asking for representations on why they should not be suspended. Mr Masuku said: After that we will be entering into a full-blown investigation, which will be independent. We welcome the involvement of the Human Rights Commission to do their own investigation which will hopefully correlate what we find. We have done a preliminary redress with the family… we are going to continue to give psychological and social support to the family because it is traumatic and something that should not be done to a human being, especially people who come to our facilities for help. He said that the hospital is committed to making sure it changes things around for its people in Gauteng, and helping staff members with the dficulties they face. He added that staff work very hard and he thinks they feel that the department doesnapost appreciate those who are putting in extra effort.  "},{"url":null,"title":"woman who ran another man","story":"NewsWoman who ran off with another man days after £k Mexican wedding gives birthMeaghan Mitchell cheated on husband Andy just days into their wedding but the couple have since reconciledShareCommentsByLiam Ross:,  JUN NewsMeaghan and Andy Mitchell tied the knot in a lavish ceremony in Cancun a year ago today - but soon hit rocky waters \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman dubbed the fajita cheater after she ran off with another man following her £, Mexican wedding has given birth to her husbandaposs baby.

Racheal Acuff went into septic shock from pneumonia that she didnapost even know she had. The -year-old drove herself to hospital after noticing blood in her urine which indicated a kidney infection. But when she arrived her health quickly deteriorated within the space of  hours.    Doctors tried to take the mum-of-twoaposs blood pressure , but it was almost too low to register at   and Racheal was quickly moved into a room on her own where they started to run tests before being moved to another unit. This is the last thing Racheal remembers as she was then sedated for three weeks. During this time, Rachealaposs family were called into the hospital to say their final goodbyes, which she could hear but not respond to due to the sedation. Doctors expected the worst, but to their surprise Racheal, from Missouri in the USA, came round weeks later. She was shocked when her mum told her that she had suffered septic shock from pneumonia which she had no symptoms of before other than tiredness and a kidney infection.  Racheal also had disseminated intravascular coagulation , a blood clotting disorder common in sepsis patients, toxic shock syndromefrom an unknown source and her kidneys were not working so she was put on dialysis. She was put on a ventilator to aid her breathing, had a feeding tube and IVs for her antibiotics to fight the infection and for a blood transfusion. After hearing her family say their last goodbyes to her, Racheal decided that she was not ready to die and made it her mission to get better for herself and her boyfriend,Taylor, , and daughters, Eden, , and Reagan, nine.    Racheal was in an intensive care unit for  days before being moved to a step down unit for a further eight days and spending two-weeks at an inpatient rehabilitation facility where she learnt to walk again and she went home in August. Since ing home, Racheal has had surgeries to amputate her fingers, toes and hand which were left damaged from her illness. She said: I went into septic shock on June , , from pneumonia and a kidney infection. I had no symptoms of pneumonia and I only knew of the kidney infection when I peed blood. I drove myself to the hospital as my boyfriend was currently in the same hospital with gallbladder issues.  Once I got to the hospital everything started happening really fast after they took my blood pressure which was so low it almost didnapost register. They moved me to a room right away and began running a list of tests. The last thing I remember was being told they were moving me upstairs and then I was sedated for three weeks. When I woke up my mum explained to me that I had septic shock, DIC and toxic shock syndrome from an unknown source. I was on a ventilator which was helping me breath, a feeding tube for all my nutrients, a port-a-cath for my dialysis because my kidneys were no longer working and two IVs for access for blood and to give me all my meds. I remember hearing my family cry when the doctors told them to bring in family to say their last goodbyes, but I was sedated and had no way to respond to them.  I felt totally helpless but I knew I had to fight to prove them wrong. I didnapost feel like I was dying, and I wasnapost going to. When I first woke up, I was totally surprised, and then I went into fight mode. I began to fight harder every day to get better. The doctors knew right away based on my blood work that I was septic and knew exactly what was wrong and treated me instantly with four antibiotics in the intensive care unit for  days. I was then moved to step down for an additional eight days for a total of  days in the hospital. I was then moved to an inpatient rehab facility for additional two weeks to learn to walk again and after almost nine weeks of medical attention I went home. Once home Rachealaposs sepsis ordeal still wasnapost over as her extremities were damaged due to the lack of blood flow whilst she was ill. On August  , she had the dead parts of four of her fingers on her left hand removed followed by the removal of the dead tissue on all five fingers on her right hand on September   and the amputation of all  of her toes on September  . Racheal had revision surgery to remove the little finger on her right hand on March ,  and on May   had a trans-radial amputation of her right hand two inches above the wrist. Recovering from her toe surgeries was the most harrowing for Racheal as it took her three weeks to walk again due to pain and she is learning to adapt to le without her right hand and is looking forward to getting a prosthetic in a few weeksapos time. Since I came home in August of last year I have had three surgeries on my hands, two to amputate my fingers that had lost blood flow during my illness and died, and my most recent, the amputation of my right hand due to its lack of mobility and , said Racheal.  The recovery process of sepsis was long and discouraging but in the end it gave me strength I didnapost know I had. The recovery of each surgery was dferent with my foot surgery being the worst, I couldnapost walk on them for three weeks and it was very painful. My most recent hand amputation has been dficult in that I lost a whole hand, lucky for me Iaposm left-handed and they took my right but itaposs still dferent. Iaposm starting to adapt until I get my new hand in a few weeks. I have grown so much through this process in myself and in my faith in God. There is no medical reason I should be alive. So, something more powerful is in my corner for sure. I soak up every moment good and bad and never take le for granted. Itaposs such a special gt youaposve been given so live it well, because youaposll never know when it could be taken away from you, and when itaposs real bad remember, itaposs just a bad day not a bad le.

The teenager discovered in the Bogomolnye Peski burial ground is believed to be between , and , years old. Remarkable video and pictures show the ancient adolescent lying next to the game. Astrakhan History museum’s scientic researcher Georgy Stukalov said the skeleton lay in a “crooked position”.  The game “was probably the most popular among the kids in the Bronze age”. “And this game - Shagai - came to us through the centuries. “Even  to  years ago our granddads and grannies used to play this game.” It remains in Mongolia and some Central Asian states. Depending on the angle the bone lands in more modern versions, players may ine their luck.    The two convex sides represent a horse or sheep - seen as lucky - while the concave faces signy a goat or camel and are held to be unlucky. The grave is from the ancient Srubnaya culture, according to archeologists. In the same necropolis near the village of Nikolskoye, finds were recently announced of a “laughing” prehistoric man with an articially deformed egg-shaped skull, and a , year old nomadic ‘royal’ in a tomb with stunning gold and silver treasures. Unlike the teenager - whose burial was older - these relics came from the Sarmatian nomadic tribe which held sway in the region until the th century AD.

I have access – and I’m not the only one – to a number of friends in the US who love football, or soccer as they call it.“We have work to do to get the £m – but it is doable – but we can’t do it without help from the fans.”When asked further about when the Dons board would have a clear financial plan in place for funding the stadium, Cormack added: “It may be sooner than thatfor us to know and it may take a little bit longer.“What we have to do is come up with what we want the stadium to look like, and what do we want it to have and that will include consultation with fans.“We’ll have input from football architects on top of the architects we’re using here.“When we’ve got that we’ll then be able to have a look at the financing side.“Where we are as a club the cup is half full or half empty.“To me it’s a half full – we got rid of £m worth of debt in , there’s no bank debt.“We funded separately the training campus and we have doubled the football budget since Derek McInnes has been here.”Initially when the Kingsford plans were unveiled in  the stadium was estimated at a cost of £m.But by spending more on the ground Cormack, who has visited a number of recently-built stadiums with commercial director Rob Wicks for research, believes it can be more beneficial to the Dons in the long term.He said: “When you research other stadium builds you end up asking ‘ you spend £m how much extra revenue can you generate ’“The answer might be a £m, but whatyou spend £m  We thinkwe do spend that we can generate an extra £m-£m in turnover per year.“That is more palatable to investors and people like myself.“These are the things we are going through just now to make sure we get it right.“We’re starting our consultation with all our stakeholders in the autumn.“The good news is that in the States I have access to some of the top people who fund stadiums, like Spurs’ new stadium.“We get access to best practices and what is really doable.“We need to explore all the avenues, we’ve visited other clubs like Atlanta, Arsenal and Newcastle and Belgium.“When you go and visit these places,you are curious and ask the right questions about what worked and what didn’t work, you learn something.“Right now we’re in this evaluation mode looking at the pluses and challenges about how clubs delivered their stadiums.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/05/TS-A96-East-of-Huntly-to-Aberdeen-Route-Options-Plan-May-2019-2-e1559043071129-940x457.jpg ","title":"a96

transform the area in front of Aberdeen#s art gallery has got under way.The Schoolhill improvements will see a new entrance plaza created for the gallery, which is due to reopen in autumn after its £. million renovation.The project will use local granite to complement the area, with the road outside Robert Gordon#s College retained.Aberdeen City Council expect the works to take around  weeks, with a one-way system on Schoolhill occasionally required for safety.The council has allocated £, to the project with additional funding coming from Nestrans, Transport Scotland and Sustrans Scotland.Councillor Marie Boulton said: “This isn#t just about improving the setting for the art gallery and Cowdray Hall but putting people first through modern place-making.“We are delivering a safer, cleaner and more inclusive city centre in line with residents’ wishes while complementing our unique architectural heritage by using local granite for the Schoolhill public realm.”Plans for the second stage of the development are being drawn up, which would see the new plaza extended along the northern edge of Schoolhill."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week

A bruised and battered face caused alarm on first viewing which gave way to quite a lot of laughter and bold comment.But what a delightful party, laid on by our warden Sheena Stewart and ladies and saw we all had tea, coffee, and home baking, including shortbread and sconesand presents of wine and malt whiskey. What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

That was the purpose of a meeting of farmers, teachers and others interested in the countryside on May .Organised for the Edinburgh-based charity by the local branch of NFU Scotland, -plus people came along to the Inveraray Inn on a bright, chilly May evening.Making the journey west to spread the word were RHET chairman George Lawrie and executive officer Katrina Barclay, who outlined the structure and potential benefits of RHET.With its headquarters at Ingliston, RHET acts as an umbrella body, co-ordinating the existing dozen Countryside Initiatives around Scotland . Each CI is set up as a charity in its own right, with help and support from Ingliston.The point of each regional CI is to bring children closer to farming, forestry, aquaculture and other rural industries.Working with partners, the charity would deliver learning opportunities for young people aged three to  around the Scottish agricultural environment and the countryside.Examples of the activities undertaken by RHET include farm visits for schools classroom speaker talks by volunteer farmers providing free educational resource materials for schools outdoor education events across Scotland competitions and projects for schools and training farmers and teachers in the delivery of information relating to food and farming.Regional CIs are supported by co-ordinators, who will liaise with schools and nurseries, organise visits, carry out health and safety checks and make sure everything is in place for events like farm visits.Present at the meeting was Argyll and Bute Council#s Head of Education Anne Paterson.#I am really encouraged to hear about the work of RHET,# said Mrs Paterson.Emphasising the the importance placed on outdoor education by the local authority, she added: #We have a good history of farm visits in Argyll and Bute, but on a more informal basis. As an education service we encourage schools to be outdoors.Mrs Paterson concluded: #We are really keen to make it happen and to work in partnership with RHET.#George Lawrie, who has been involved with RHET for around  years, said: #What I find most rewarding in working with the young people is just seeing the smiles on their faces.#If you want to find out more, whether as a farmer crofter, education provider or are involved in any other land use or rural industry, contact Lucy Sumsion by email at lucy.sumsion@nfus.org.uk to express an interest.PIC:From left: NFUS Argyll and the Islands region chairnman John Dickson with George Lawrie and Katrina Barclay of Royal Highland Education Trust. _aRHETmeetingKatrina Barclay addresses the sizeable audience in the Inveraray Inn as George Lawrie looks on. _aRHETmeeting"},{"url":null,"title":"fynefest celebrates turning 10 with a beer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFyneFest s for , celebrating hitting double figures with as much flair as ever.Beer, food and music: what more could anyone ask for  And there#s going to be plenty of each at this unique event, held over four days from Friday May .As usual, the field will be filled with trucks serving everything from pizza to curry and cupcakes.

council expressing concern regarding contractor Memsafersquos ldquooverzealous approach.Former Chairman of Peebles Community Council Lawrie Hayworth, branded the damage to headstones as ldquovandalism during a discussion about the cemetery following the remedial work in March.But Scottish Borders Council denies damage was caused to the headstones by contractors.Addressing members of the townrsquos community council, Councillor Shona Haslam said: ldquoWe all had a meeting with officers at the cemetery and they explained the process by which they test.\"There were a couple of headstones that we asked questions about and they were going to get in touch with Memsafe to come back and give us an update on them.ldquoAnybody with any concerns, and have before and after pictures of the headstones that were tested and made safe, should let us know.\"What we felt as councillors is that given that we had to do the test, given that we had to do the test in a certain way, it had been done in the best possible way that was available to the council given the legislation that was governing us.Community Councillor Peter Maudsley askedthe contractor was paid per headstone taken down.He said: ldquoOne of the things that interested me is how the contract with the contractor arranged.\"Are they paid by the number of stones that they have to take action with  Becausethat is the case, then there will be a tendency to hit more headstones than they might otherwise have done.Councillor Haslam said this was one of the questions asked by elected members to council officers.She explained: ldquoIt is based on the number that they test, so there is no bonus for them with the number they take down.Members of the community council still feel there is unhappiness within the town over the current state of the cemetery and are considering putting in an application to the Common Good Fund for memorial restorations.Chairman Les Turnbull said: ldquoIrsquom wonderingthere is anything as a community council we can do to try and help improve the look of the cemetery, and perhaps affect some sort of repair on some of the stones that have been taken down.Councillor Haslam replied: ldquoWe were informed by officers thatthe community council provide funds to enable the headstones to be fixed then the community council would therefore accept liability in the future should those headstones fall onto somebody.Peebles Community Trust is now seeking the views of locals regarding remedial work in the cemetery.Community councillor and Chairman of the PCT, Lawrie Hayworth added: ldquoAs part of that clearly we would need to look at the legislative and insurance implications in discussion with our councillors.Councillor Stuart Bell said: ldquoI think itrsquos important that we take proper procedures in regard to rectying the dficulties and particularly the anxieties in relationship to the headstone testing programme thatrsquos been on-going.ldquoOne of the things that was brought to

development projects in the area.At the end of July, the group set off to host a development camp for young Malawian males to build confidence and leadership skills.Activities will include construction work to restore an elderly womanrsquos home damaged by recent floods.And the group will also take time to hike up Mount Mulanje to reach the highest peak in Malawi.After planning the expedition last summer, the group has need to raise over pound each for the project.Denis Robson, Graham Little, Thea Panter, John Little and Sophie Wilson will team up with five Malawian leaders to host the pilot programme.Through the Rotary Young Leadersprogramme, the Scottish Borders group was able to link up with the Rotary Club of Limbe, to plan the project.Travelling to Zomba, in Malawi, the objective is to develop leadership skills for both the --year olds taking part and the young Borderers involved.Innerleithens Denis Robson, the group leader, has been involved in making connections with the Zomba district for many years.Denis told us: ldquoOur focus is on creating a sustainable model for educating people to become young leaders.ldquoRYLA is a worldwide programme offered by the Rotary to improve the leadership skills of young men and women.ldquoWe are delighted to be taking part in the pilot RYLA Malawi programme and hope to encourage the local rotary clubs to adopt the model in future years and make it sustainable.ldquoWe have an amazing set of Border Exploration Group leaders and graduates who will be able to help share their skills and confidence to the Malawian youths.ldquoAnd I hope they develop a great international understanding that they can have throughout their lives.As part of the development project, the group will work with local skilled people to rebuild a storm damaged home in Liwonde.Malawi often is hit by extreme weather conditions and the recent Cyclone Idai was no exception.Additionally, the programme will include a Climate Mitigation project on the Zomba plateau.Working alongside the Forestry Department the team will prepare a site to plant  trees in October.And educate the community living in the forest to preserve the highly valued resource.It is hoped that these daily activities, together with evening workshops, will develop skills in teamwork, collaboration, problem solving, critical thinking, communication and leadership.A self- assessment questionnaire will be completed before and after the event covering self-confidence, communication skills, practical and leadership ability and general happiness.A presentation to parents s will be given by the young Malawians on the final day explaining what benefit the camp has had for them and how they can apply the experience for the benefit of the community.President-Elect Bernard at the Rotary Club of Limbe:ldquoThe RYLA-Malawi Program will offer an opportunity for Malawian youth to nurture and grow their leadership skills and potential, through boot camp interaction with their Scottish counterparts.Although the team from Scotland will pay their own travel costs, they are still fundraising to meet the expenses of running the RYLA development camp.Sponsorship is needed to cover the cost of all food, accommodation, transport and building materials for the construction projects.For one Malawian youth to attend the camp it costs pound, and the volunteering group hopes to seek sponsors for all .Denis added: ldquoWe are seeking sponsors for the  Malawian youths at pound each.ldquoAnd I would like to thank the Rotary clubs of

the dferent elements from Beethovenrsquos other works ndash piano solo, orchestra and choir in a sequence of iations on the theme of an earlier song.Beethoven himself played the piano part at the first performance.There followed two songs, one to words by Robert Burns in an arrangement for orchestra, soprano and baritone by Tony Kime, and one by Leonard Bernstein from West Side Story.After the interval the choir embarked on a monumental performance of A German Requiem Op.  by Johannes Brahms, joined by the two South African pianists, Ben Schoeman and Tessa Uys, who played the alternative version prepared by Brahms as a piano duet for four hands on one keyboard, on this occasion the Melrose Music Societyrsquos Petrov piano.They gave a performance of scintillating musicality and power,

We also have the folk that are working hard to make our town nicer place to live like the In Bloom group, the volunteers who attend the bi-weekly beach cleans and the group that is working to protecting our library by volunteering to make it a more attractive and interesting place to go.ldquoThese people are the reasons why Cockenzie and Port Seton in my books is one of the best places in Scotland.The iLiveHere website contains hundreds of cutting reviews of villages, towns and cities across the UK."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-groups-celebrate-share-of-10000-funding","story":"Now in its third year, CALArsquos Community Bursary, supported by the Courier, aims to provide support for a wide range of organisations and projects within the communities in which CALA builds.From community kitchens to sports teams, a total of  local projects and initiatives were selected to receive a share of this yearrsquos fund from  applications ndash East Lothianrsquos highest number of submissions to date.Philip Hogg, sales and marketing director with CALA Homes , said: ldquoCALA has always been committed to making a positive and lasting contribution to local communities through an active programme of charity donations, community support and sponsorship, and the Community Bursary scheme gives us the chance to find out exactly what support is needed locally.ldquoThe response to the scheme has been overwhelming, and wersquove been delighted to hear from so many local charities, schools, community projects and good causes in East Lothian about the fantastic work that is being done.ldquoThis is the third year we have launched the CALA Community Bursary in East Lothian and wersquore looking forward to working with each of our selected charities over the coming months and seeing how each of them use the funds to make a real dference.ldquoWe would like to thank everyone who took the time to apply to the CALA Community Bursary, and congratulate each of them on the valuable work they are doing within the local community.Receiving a share of the pound,-plus CALA Community Bursary are: Sustaining Dunbar ndash Belhaven Community GardenLongniddry Tennis ClubLaw Primary School Parent Teacher AssociationBass Rocketeers Netball ClubBridge Centre Youth Nights @ The Bridge CentreGullane Christmas LightsPrestonpans After School ClubDunbar Highland DancersBlack Diamond Thai Boxing ClubCampie Primary SchoolMusselburgh Rugby Football ClubOur Community Kitchen East Lothianand Cycling Without Age Musselburgh ."},{"url":null,"title":"ice-cream-shop-opening-in-former-dunbar-rbs","story":"Plans to transform the former Royal Bank of Scotlandon Dunbar High Street have been given the thumbs up by East Lothian Council planners.The bank moved out of the premises at  High Street in May last year, with Gavin and Susan Love, of Love Sweets and Ices, now getting ready to move in.Love Sweets and Ices is currently based on the opposite side of the street at  High Street.Mr Love, who has run the business with his we for about eight years, told the Courier they planned to use both premises, with The Sweetie Bank aiming to open later this month.He said the plan was to offer ldquoa wider range of traditional sweets and treats and ice creams.He added: ldquoWe are particularly looking forward to being able to give our customers the option to enjoy sit-in ice cream and sundaes.ldquoThe feedback from customers and visitors to Dunbar has been great and we anticipate being up and running later this month so that we can be prepared for the busy summer months.The bank branch closure was one of  RBS and  NatWest branches to shut following a decision at the end of .Mr Love, who previously worked in the banking sector, revealed what it was about the former bank that attracted him to it.He said: ldquoI think it was its location on the High Street.ldquoIt is on the sunny side of the street, which is quite nice for an ice cream and sweetie business.The plans received no objections and were backed by the townrsquos community council.Previously, Pippa Swan, chairwoman, said: ldquoIrsquom looking forward to it and I am sure it will be a good addition to the street.Ward councillor Paul McLennan added: ldquoI think it will be a great success and good luck to Gavin and Susan, who are investing in the town and are really nice people."},{"url":null,"title":"dance-music-pioneers-inner-city-set-for-fringe-by-the-sea","story":"Inner Cityjointhe line-up at the harbourside in North Berwick on Friday, August as part of their -year commemorative tour.Founded in  by Detroittechno pioneer Kevin Saunderson, Inner City were one of the first bands to take dance music to the mainstreamcharts.Classics such as Good Le and Big Fun would go on to influence British bands like Soul II Soul, Massive Attack and many more.

He goes to bed with his T rex, plays with dinosaurs constantly and knows even the complicated names of lesser-known dinosaurs.However, we have tried very consciously to allow our kids to be who they are and resist the gender stereotyping that defines what a girl should be and what a boy should be.But here was my youngest daughter, at the age of five, clearly articulating the ision between girlsrsquo and boysrsquo toys.Her list was in line with the way toys are still marketed. Often there are two versions of the same thing, one for girls and one for boys.Even some story books are defined in this way, with images and colours which are used to reinforce the gender identity of the object evengender is not specically mentioned.Donrsquot get me wrong, I have no problem that my son loves dinosaurs.But I do have a problem with marketing directed at my children to force them into a narrow definition of what toys they should like based on a patriarchal version of gender.In truth, itrsquos not so much the toys themselves but the emotions and ways of being that are deliberately connected to them.Itrsquos the idea that boysrsquo stuff promotes bravery, toughness, being fierce and adventurous, while girlsrsquo stuff promotes cuteness, romance, beauty and love.It is changing and itrsquos much better than it used to be because there is so much more awareness and debate about this issue. Gender neutral marketing is more common now, mainly as a result of public pressure.But as the conversation with my daughter shows, we still have a way to go.But does it really matter  Is it just a politically correct obsession that is making a mountain from a molehill ldquoBoys will be boys, after all, and ldquogirls are all sugar and spice, and all things nice.It really matters, of course, and I think it matters just as much for my son as my daughters, perhaps even more so.That may be controversial, but I believe that as gender stereotyping is being challenged, it is often more dficult for boys to free themselves from the traditional definition of male identity than it is for a girl.I say this as a father of four girlsand one boy.Perhaps part of the reason for this is the fact that being male is still in many ways the privileged gender, and so there is an understandable focus on removing the restrictive definition of female roles which limit opportunities for women.But the struggle for gender equality has to be a two-way processit is to be ultimately successful.We must also unshackle our boys from the narrow definition of what it is to be male, a definition which still remains powerfully entrenched in our mindsets and the way society works.I personally suffered from this when at school. I was ldquosoft, sensitive, a daydreamer. I was often made to feel I was not a proper boy. There was no space for me to realise that the lsquoladdishrsquo way of being male was not the only way.Irsquom not advocating taking the dinosaurs away from my son and forcing him to play with a unicorn or Barbie doll. Even I loved dinosaurs when I was young. But it does mean allowing him, and yes encouraging him, to explore sides to his nature that society would still label as feminine: nurture, co-operation, make-up, dresses, dancing, looking after dolls and toys, and feeling vulnerable and being allowed to express it.The best way to encourage boys to express this part of who they are is through role modelling by other men, especially in the early years of childhood when a childrsquos brain is forming, and the childrsquos view of how the world works is being created.This includes how to treat others on a personal level.So nurture and care by male family members can be a crucial part of this. But one gender inequality we rarely hear about is the fact that men make up only two per cent of early years childcare workers. And this is an inequality not just for adults, but for our children.It conveys the message to young children that caring and nurture is not a manrsquos job or a male quality. So we grow up believing this is lsquonaturalrsquo.And this idea is so entrenched that there have even been examples of parents complaining that a man is working in a nursery!Looking after children is as much a manrsquos job as it is a womanrsquos. Or it should be, and seen to be. But itrsquos not just about work, or even childcare or parenthood. Itrsquos about ways of being and understanding that there are hundreds of ways to be a man or woman and we all have the right to make our own path.Thatrsquos why itrsquos important from the beginning to show that therersquos no such thing as boysrsquo toys or girlsrsquo toys: there are childrenrsquos toys.Or perhaps more accurately, to show the emotions and qualities traditionally associated with them are not gender specic.As always, children teach us. When we got home, Lewis put his T rex to bed. ldquoHersquos tired, he said, ldquoand hersquos a nice T rex.This was my lesson from my son: a T rex can be nice.He summed up the issue as only a child can."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-25-years-since-east-lothians-independence","story":"Twenty-five years ago this week, the Courier proclaimed the news with the headline: ldquoItrsquos independence for East Lothian.This week, East Lothian Council chief executive Angela Leitch said: ldquoThe Local GovernmentAct of  saw the abolishment of the two-tier Region and District Councils to be replaced with  unitary authorities across Scotland.\"I believe this has greatly benefited East Lothian communities, as responsibility for major services including education and social work were decentralised from Edinburgh and instead became the focus of political decisions at a more localised level.\"Over the years, our politicians have ensured ongoing investment in all of our towns and villages, providing facilities for local people, developing our infrastructure and continually working to improve the services we deliver. This has been recognised in a iety of inspection reports that have confirmed that East Lothian Council is a high performing council and has an ethos which recognises the importance of working closely with its residents and communities.\"Our elected members all live within the county, understand local issues and can ably represent the views of communities.\"Previously, some political decisions about our county were approved by people who had no real knowledge of East Lothian.\"Local government reorganisation has improved both local democracy and the ability of local people to hold the council accountable for the decisions it takes.Here, we take a look back at how we reported the news that the county had secured its place as a stand-alone local authority in the upcoming local government reorganisation:East Lothian has won the battle for independence.In a dramatic about face, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang has given in to the majority wishes of the population and decided it can stand on its own two feet.From , the district will once again become master of its own house as an all-purpose local authority.It means East Lothian councillors will be responsible for running a full range of services ndash from education and social work to rubbish collection and recreation.The Local Government Bill which will end the -year lespan of Scotlandrsquos network of region, district and island authorities is currently going through its final stages in Parliament.And earlier this week, Mr Lang ndash supported by local Labour MP John Home Robertson ndash tabled an amendment to give East Lothian the go-it-alone status it wanted.It was the high point in a hard-fought campaign by angry locals which began last year when the Government announced its original intention to lump East Lothian in with Berwickshire.But their success in fighting off that idea was not the end of the battle ndash they still had to persuade Mr Lang and his local government minister Allan Stewart that East Lothian was NOT too small to become an authority in its own right.They had also to force them to give up alternative plans to create an East Lothian-Midlothian-West Lothian authority ndash and more recently a proposal to merge East and Midlothian.As councillors and senior staff celebrated the announcement with champagne, [district] council chairman George Wanless smiled and said: ldquoWe are absolutely delighted with the outcome.He said it was dficult to say what eventually changed the minds of ministers.ldquoBut I have no doubt that the campaign the district council fought had a lot to do with it.He added: ldquoIf I was being charitable, I would say it was a case where the Scottish Office actually listened to the people for a change...It was, however, a ldquogreat decision for the people of East Lothian, who had supported the campaign from the start.ldquoI would like to thank all those who came out on the streets and took part in demonstrations in the early days of the campaign ndash and all those who wrote to Ian Lang in support of the idea that East Lothian should be an all purpose authority.Councillor Wanless totally rejected the previously-held Government view that East Lothian was too small to stand on its own.ldquoWe currently have a population of something like , and growing.ldquoBy the year  we could have at least , and my colleagues and I along with our officials are confident we can handle all the services that the new council will be responsible for.And he insisted: ldquoWe will do so in the same economic and efficient way the electorate have been accustomed to over the years.MP John Home Robertson said the White Paper to reform local government could have been the ldquodeath knell for East Lothian.ldquoBut people all over East Lothian fought back in a massive local campaign and we have won a magnicent victory.He paid tribute to Councillor Wanless and others who took part in the campaign, saying: ldquoWe have shown that public pressure can move even this Government.ldquoHowever, we are not out of the woods yet.ldquoLocal government is all about providing important services to local communities and we must continue to fight to ensure that East Lothian is properly provided with the funds it requires through revenue support grants.The councilrsquos Conservative group leader, the Rev Dr David Whiteford, said: ldquoI am very pleased that the Scottish Office ministers have listened to the electorate.ldquoThe view of the electors all along has been consistent ndash that East Lothian could and should be an all-purpose authority.ldquoI believe East Lothian has the capacity and potential to become an authority on its own and its staff are well capable of serving very well the needs of all the people.He added: ldquoI am very pleased that that message has now been accepted by the Scottish Ministers and that they have departed almost entirely from their original plan.ldquoLarge is not always beautul and I think we can do better on our own.He believed the transition to a stand-alone East Lothian council would be fairly simple.ldquoThe staff structures are already on the ground and all you really need to do is build on that.ldquoI do not anticipate a great deal of dficulty.ldquoIt is a challenge.ldquoIt is something that we should think through.ldquoWe have a new council coming into being and we should try to run it in a new style way.ldquoI hope councillors will concentrate on the needs of East Lothian people and will try and make that their main concern.Said SNP councillor George Thomson: ldquoEast Lothian has a growing population.ldquoWe have a good district council which is well capable of becoming a single tier all-purpose

brother as part of a Preston Athletic Youth FC group that had travelled to the park in Yorkshire for a weekend football tournament.However, as reported in last weekrsquos Courier, the entire group of  people were asked to leave a day early after several incidents involving adults and young players.Flamingo Land took the decision to evict the group after a couplersquos domestic altercation at the bar resulted in security being called and, in a separate incident, police were called to the park to arrest a young woman on suspicion of assault.Sophiersquos dad Michael Carruthers, a coach for the club who splits his time as a part-time support worker and caring for seven-year-old Sophie, from Blawearie Road, Tranent, has now hit out at the ldquodisgusting behaviour of security staff at the park.The family had made the trip south as Sophiersquos brother Kaden, , was playing in the May - football tournament.Mr Carruthers said that he, along with most of the group, woke up on the Sunday morning totally unaware of the events of the previous evening which resulted in the group not allowed to remain at the park, where they were due to stay another night, after their football tournament at nearby sports pitches ended.ldquoIt was all very upsetting, he said.ldquoWe didnrsquot really know what was going on. To kick everyone out after a few incidents seems to me really unfair.ldquoThere were young kids there who were very upset and humiliated.ldquoAs I understand it, the people responsible for what happened had offered to leave so that the rest of us could stay. It seemed cruel to kick every single one of us out.ldquoWe were on the bus when members of the security team came on and cut the childrenrsquos wristbands off [for entry to the park] which was really unnecessary.ldquoMy daughter was crying, it was disgusting behaviour.ldquoWhen it came time for us to leave after packing up our stuff, we had to walk to the place of pick-up and wait for the buses, watched by security guards the whole way.ldquoWhen we got to the place we were getting picked up from, we then found out that they werenrsquot going to allow the buses into the park. My daughter had her walker with her instead of her chair and was already struggling at how far she had had to travel there was no way they could ask her to walk another fair distance to the buses.ldquoIt was after what felt like ages, and I had kicked up a bit of a fuss, they finally let the buses come down to us to collect us. It was a humiliating experience.And he claimed: ldquoThe security guards were very intimidating, especially to the children. We were all treated like criminals, even though the majority of us hadnrsquot done anything wrong.ldquoMy daughter even turned to me at one point in tears, asking: lsquoWersquove done nothing wrong, why are we getting thrown out rsquoldquoI understand some of the behaviour was unacceptable, but there were young children on the trip and they should have been taken into account before the decision was made. To punish everyone for the actions of a small few seems very unfair.Flamingo Land did not respond for requests for a comment this week,Last week, spokesperson Andy Miller said: ldquoThe anti-social behaviour which was displayed by members of the football team in question couldnrsquot be tolerated as it was interfering with other guestsrsquo enjoyment.

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship. The human race isnrsquot over yet."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9918363.jpg?type=article-full","title":"a-guide-to-some-of-scotlands-best-beer-gardens","story":"Relaxing with a cold drink and enjoying the sunrsquos rays is a rare but welcome treat for us Scots.

After gorse was taken away and sand imported from other parts of the site, the new th, known as lsquoHillhouse,rsquo replaces the former par- th hole.To create a better link between the th green and the former th fairway, Kimber has also built new teeing grounds near the th green to enable play towards the new th fairway from a completely dferent angle and achieve a right-to-left dogleg hugging the railway line.With the alterations ready for the start of the  season, the new th ndash which at  yards features an undulating green, pot bunkers around the green and a view to Arran looking back down the hole ndash has already proved popular with members and visitors.Bob Anderson, Greens Convenor at Kilmarnock , said: ldquoWe are absolutely delighted with the new th hole, it couldnrsquot have looked better. It is a well-designed signature par-, with a nice yardage and improves the enjoyment of playing Barassie without the walks.ldquoVisitors or potential members were previously coming to Barassie and it was too long, overall. Over the years we have tried to get the playability up but retain the enjoyment and the new hole has already proved tremendously popular with all the members.The total yardage for the par- course has reduced by eight yards to ,, while the standard scratch for all levels remains the same.Coupled with other initiatives such as rough reduction, the course changes have also helped Barassie to grow membership in these challenging times.The club, which was founded in  and the course finally laid as  holes in , now has a total membership of over ,.Claire Middleton, General Manager at Kilmarnock , added: ldquoWe are thrilled with the new par- th hole. Paul Kimber and his team managed not only to meet our budget and a tight schedule but, even more importantly, meet membersrsquo expectations.ldquoWe look forward to another great golfing season and our members and visitors enjoying the course changes.Barassie, which also boasts a -hole layout, counts former Amateur champion Gordon Sherry and fellow ex-Walker Cup winning players Jim Milligan and Jack McDonald among its current members.The club also offers improved facilities in the clubhouse and professionals shop, run by Gregor Howie.Visit the website to find out more.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lochranza CentreWelcome to Arranrsquos oldest and youngest tourist attraction.The Vikings called Arran the mysterious Island, sometimes there, sometimes not depending on the weather.

Previously, pupils completing some National s would repeat pretty similar assessments in S for Higher. The time is better spent developing skills and understanding.\"The early signs are promising. Although results at Higher have fluctuated from year to year there has been a signicant overall increase in the proportion of pupils achieving Highers since , when the model was introduced.Nearly  per cent of school-leavers secured at least one Higher this year compared to  per cent six years ago and over the same period pupils achieving five or more Highers has risen from  per cent to  per cent.The schools approach puts an interesting spin on the current debate over whether CfE has led to a restriction in subject choice rather than the greater breadth that was promised.There has been much wringing of hands over a reduction in the number of National  qualications on offer in many schools, but the example of Hillhead demonstrates an approach which does just that, but makes sense for those pupils who will be judged primarily on their Highers.The current debate centres on the fact that under previous curriculum models pupils would routinely sit eight or nine Standard Grades in S before identying the five Highers they would take in S.As CfE was being designed, one of the questions posed was whether cramming for a repetitive cycle of examinations was a worthwhile pursuit. Did it prepare pupils with the skills required for a rapidly changing world and was it something pupils found meaningful, relevant or even enjoyable As a result, the so-called Broad General Educationwas designed for the first three years of secondary school, essentially delaying the start of study for formal qualications from S to S, but allowing pupils to develop a range of additional skills in a less pressured environment.What that has meant in practice for many schools is that pupils only have one year to study the National  and National  qualications that replaced Standard Grade, leading to a reduction in the overall number of subjects.The Scottish Parliaments education committee is currently holding an inquiry into the issue and has received evidence that appears to show a signicantly reduced choice, at least of traditional subjects.Figures from the Reform Scotland think tank show a majority of schools now only offer six subjects in the fourth year of secondary school. Others schools, with a dferent interpretation of the curriculum, are still offering eight or nine, although this usually means choosing subjects earlier than CfE envisaged.Chris Deerin, director of Reform Scotland, said: \"We are in real danger of opening up a new type of attainment gap in Scotland - one where children who are allowed to sit eight or nine National s or s will have a distinct advantage over those restricted to five or six.\"The Royal Society of Edinburgh is also concerned, arguing the impact of reduced subject choice is felt most keenly by learners who leave school at S with fewer qualications than previously might have been the case, typically those from more disadvantaged backgrounds.An RSE paper on subject choice added: \"Reduced course choice at S can also constrain learners options in S and S since it will be more dficult to progress to Higher level without the pre-requisite learning at National  level.\"With English and mathematics seen as essential, the narrowing means particular subjects are now in decline in S. Research by Professor Jim Scott, from Dundee University, identied these as German, French, art, drama, music, computing studies and some sciences.The Scottish Association of Geography Teachers is deeply troubled by the trend saying widespread narrowing of the curriculum has reduced choice for inidual pupils \"thus limiting their career opportunities too soon and restricting the opportunity to change career pathways further into the senior school\".However, John Swinney, the Education Secretary, argues in an interview in the Herald tomorrow that looking at one particular moment in the senior school experience is a mistake because CfE allows pupils to secure qualications and other skills and achievements in a more flexible way.\"Young people are remaining engaged with education and participating in education for longer than was the case when I was at school which is a very signicant change. Wherever I go I dont see a narrowing of choice in Scottish education. I see a blossoming of choice,\" he said.Mr Swinney also said he was relaxed about the dferent curriculum models adopted by schools, with the study of six subjects just as valid as nine, as long as the school had the support of pupils and parents.Nonetheless, curriculum and inspection body Education Scotland has concerns about schools which still have a focus on a traditional qualications structure. And they have gone further than most in suggesting that some subjects may not be relevant to some pupils.Gayle Gorman, Scotlands Chief Inspector of Education, said: \"The aim ... was to change the focus of study in the senior phase from the model that many teachers, parents and others will be familiar with.\"That may well mean young people taking fewer qualications, particularly at some levels ... and that the curriculum design may look dferent from school to school.\"We are still seeing some schools where the focus is on a one year qualications ladder, with a drive to the next batch of National , National , Higher or Advanced Highers, and too often in the traditional subjects that were studied by those of previous generations, but may not always be the best fit now within a st century skillset.\"Young people, preparing for a very dferent world of work than their parents or teachers, are telling us that there is still too much focus being placed on traditional qualications at the expense of more innovative pathways.\"The Educational Institute of Scotlandteaching union believes the structures in secondary are mostly unchanged, despite the introduction of CfE.An EIS statement said: \"While the qualications themselves have changed, the ways in which young people undertake them much too closely resemble the experiences of senior students a decade and a half ago.\"Indeed, it could be argued the current arrangement is poorer as the compression of qualications into one year rather than two has required a reduction in the number of subjects chosen and also a signicant time pressure in delivering these courses in a single year.\"Parents are also concerned. Eileen Prior, executive director of parent body Connect, said they were aware of schools where pupils still chose subjects at the end of second year and began work on their National qualications in third year.She said: \"We are still pushing many youngsters through National  when they could be going straight to Higher. The flexibility of CfE in relation to dferent pathways rather than going through the assessments associated with National  and National  has not been embraced across the board.\"And Joanna Murphy, chairwoman of the National Parent Forum of Scotland, urged schools to embrace the idea of flexibility.She said: \"More and more of our young people are staying on for the full three years so the focus should be on the qualications that they leave with, not the order in which they sit them.\"There is no point in creating a mental health crisis in our young people, which we hear is happening, by making them just sit and learn things.\"Resolving the tension between specialists who see the quality and longevity of their subjects underpinned by formal qualications in S and beyond and those who argue for less pressure and more alternative choices is not easy.Mark Priestley, professor of education at Stirling University, believes a review of CfE is important to try and establish some fundamental principles about what schools should deliver.He said: \"Fundamentally, we need to consider the worth of qualications. The system as it currently stands tends to encourage an approach which is about passing exams rather than the state of being educated. Both are important, butwe over-focus on qualications then we are selling young people short.\"The controversy about the narrowing of subjects has been largely determined by what people think education should be, based on the way it used to be. At some stage we are going to have to review CfE to determine what schools are actually for.\"*See tomorrows Herald for the full interview with John Swinney."},{"url":null,"title":"swinney-to-announce-crackdown-on-nitrite-meat-after-herald-on-sunday-campaign","story":"Swinney is expected to back maximum legal limits for meats such as ham and bacon at lunch times, and support a restriction on the use of products which contain nitrites.Meanwhile, Glasgow city council - the largest local authority in Scotland - has confirmed its schools are planning to go nitrite free by the end of the year.A World Health Organisationreport from  placed processed meat in the same carcinogenic category as asbestos and tobacco.Experts found that a g portion eaten daily - the equivalent of two rashers of bacon, or a single sausage or hot dog - would increase the risk of bowel cancer by %.Herald on Sunday campaign: time to dump nitro meat from schools and hospitalsThe health risk occurs when nitrites - a preservative which helps turn meat pink - is heated and produces cancer-causing nitrosamines.

Even though Scotland voted Remain in the Brexit referendum, Leonard had echoed Jeremy Corbynrsquos lsquosoft Brexitrsquo message that was designed to appeal to both sides in the EU debate. He succeeded only in haemorrhaging votes to the SNP and the Lib Dems.Post-drubbing, he has changed his mind and positioned his party as being unequivocally pro-Remain. He also says he will campaign around Scotland for the UK to stay in the EU.However, it is important to understand some of the root causes of why his European campaign bombed. The SNPrsquos election communication included a picture of Nicola Sturgeon. The Scottish Tories put Ruth Davidson front and centre of their literature. Scottish Labourrsquos main leaflet, by contrast, had a picture of Corbyn. Leonard was nowhere to be seen.ldquoIrsquove had conversations with Mark Drakeford, the First Minister of Wales, and we both agree that that was a mistake, because his picture wasnrsquot on the leaflet in Wales either, he says.Given that one of Leonardrsquos main problems is a low profile, such a decision by the UK party seems unforgivable. But it could have been even worse.ldquoThe leaflet that you describe originally had a text which didnrsquot recognise that wersquove got dferent challenges facing public services in Scotland. And so we had to re-write the text, Leonard says.Revealed: SNP ministers former staff received thousands in secret exit paymentsI put it to him that the picture decision was made by Corbynrsquos office, with the finger of suspicion being pointed at communications director Seamus Milne.ldquoI wasnrsquot involved in the negotiations about that, he says, weakly.This reply sums up the last twenty years of Scottish Labour. If Leonard is the leader of an autonomous party, he should not have to ldquonegotiate to have his face on his own partyrsquos leaflet. Little wonder critics hurl the branch office jibe at him.ldquoI accept that, as much as possible, the election should have been used as a  to promote me, he says.Leonard and Corbyn are political allies, but the Scottish Labour leaderrsquos colleagues believe the pair are too close. Colin Smyth, a member of Leonardrsquos shadow cabinet, said last week that he had to become his ldquoown man. Is Smyth correct ldquoI donrsquot accept this narrative that I am simply there as Jeremy Corbynrsquos man in Scotland, he says. ldquoI accept that I need to present myself, and make it absolutely clear, that there is a distinctive Scottish Labour party position on things.He also believes that Scottish Labour may need more autonomy: ldquoThere is still work that needs to be done, some battles that need to be re-fought, to establish the importance of having a distinctive Scottish Labour presentation to the people of Scotland.An area of potential reform is party discipline. One racism case relating to a Scottish member has dragged on for over eighteen months, but the investigation is handled at a UK level. Leonard is sympathetic to this changing:ldquoThere has been a debate about whether the current disciplinary process inside the Labour party...is fit for purpose. And I think that there is a case to be examined around that.:SNP councillor raises questions about partys poundk indyref fundraiserHowever, Leonardrsquos dficulties as leader did not start with the European election campaign. After he defeated moderate MSP Anas Sarwar to succeed Kezia Dugdale in , his allies believe he has been undermined by a relentless series of briefings, leaks and sniping.ldquoOf course I get frustrated when things are leaked, but in the end wersquove got to try and focus as a party, not on ourselves, but on all those people, in all those communities, that need a Labour Government, he says.ldquoThe Scottish Labour party will only succeed when we are outward looking and when we talk about the things that are important to the people we need to appeal to.Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray, a leading Corbyn critic, recently wrote on WhatsApp that Scottish Labour is full of ldquothugs and incompetents. It was then leaked. What did Leonard think of these comments ldquoFirst of all, I dismiss the allegation.

Itrsquos not clear that these practices happen, and who is doing this.:Lib Dems call for freedom of information legislation to be expandedIn , the Scottish Parliament removed the non-disclosure clause from its standard settlement agreement. It does not rule out the use of such agreements, with gagging clauses still able to be usedboth parties agree to it.The settlement agreements used by Denham for two of the cases contained non-disclosure clauses within them.According to official figures, MSPs offered their staff settlement agreements  times between February  and February .The total amount paid out was pound,. with parliament officials stating none of the cases related to bullying or harassment.A spokesman said such payments would typically come from MSP staff cost allowances, currently capped at pound,.An SNP spokesman said: \"We do not comment on employment matters. MSPs, in common with all employers, are able to let staff go in line with HR advice, guidance and legal requirements where their employment is no longer required.\"A Scottish Parliament spokesman said: ldquoSettlement agreements are a legitimate means of facilitating the ending of an employment relationship on mutually agreed terms and do not affect former employeesrsquo right to make a protected disclosure such as whistleblowing.Some politicians have raised concerns about the use of non-disclosure agreements by elected officials.Labour peer Lord Foulkes said: ldquoThis is certainly not transparent. I have a number of concerns about NDAs and the way they are used to gag people.ldquoI am surprised they would be used by any elected member.:Richard Leonard in row over plan which could cull Labour MSPsA Scottish Conservative spokesman said: ldquoWith the allegations against Joanna Cherry still unresolved, this is a really bad look for the SNP.ldquoI wonder how quickly Nicola Sturgeon will describe Ash Denham as an lsquoassetrsquo to the SNP government Traditionally NDAs have been used by corporations to prevent those employees leaving the business from disclosing confidential information or trade secrets, which could hinder their former companiesthey move to new job.The controversial element comes from when they are used to settle employment disputes. If a member of staff claims they have been wrongfully dismissed or discriminated against, employers have been found to settle the disputes to avoid any negative publicity, by paying staff and asking them to sign a non-disclosure or confidentiality agreement.By signing the agreement, employees are effectively legally bound not to repeat or discuss any of the allegations again in public, leading to the agreements being commonly described as gagging clauses.The use of non-disclosure agreements and clauses specically in discrimination cases, is currently under review in Westminster, with hundreds of submissions received in the past six months.It comes following revelations that employees of businessman Sir Phillip Greene signed NDAs when they accused him of sexual and racial discrimination.The Topshop tycoon was accused of making racist comments to black employees, groping female staff, and of being aggressive towards both male and female workers - all of which he denies.Westminsters Women and Equalities committee have heard evidence from business leaders, human rights campaigners and lawyers about their views on the use of NDAs in discrimination cases.Scottish employment law firm Thompsons solicitors were among those which submitted evidence.In its submission in November, the firm states thatthe clauses were banned altogether \"this would ensure that the true extent of sexual harassment and discrimination claims within the workplace was much more widely known.\"\"In addition, it would prevent serial offenders within a workplace having their conduct so easily ldquohushed up by their employer.\"Surely,there were several employees who all had their sexual harassment claims settled, in circumstances where the employees could discuss what happened to them, questions would need to be answered by senior managers in regards to what action,any, they were taking to address the perpetratorrsquos conduct.In addition, we believe thatwomen were able to speak about what happened to them in the workplace it is more likely that other women who have suffered similar acts of harassment or discrimination may come forward due to having a collective voice and therefore there being more likelihood that they would be believed.\"The flip side of banning NDAs is that it may prevent employers from settling employment claims. A confidentiality clause can have huge value for an employer whose reputation means a lot to them, their customers and their business. Therefore,NDAs were not permitted, an employer may be more likely to run sexual harassment cases to Tribunal in order to seek to prove that the harassment didnrsquot take place.\"The firm suggested that one way of controlling their use would be to force companies to publish how many they use in any given year, similar to the practice of publishing annual figures on the gender pay.SNP MP Hannah Bardell has also spoken previously about having to sign an NDA before becoming an elected politician, and welcomed the suggestion by the solicitors firm.She added: \"I think thats a very good idea. I dont knowit would work in the public sector or in politics, but certainly for the private sector I think it is a good idea.\"In my own experience having been through it myself in the private sector, I signed one because I felt pressured and I havent had another option.\"The reality is there are legitimate uses and illegitimate uses, and getting into the complexity of that is very dficult. Good employment practised for members and for staff, and support for staff and members is absolutely vital.\"They are all things that, whatever parliament we are in need to be constantly reviewed and addressed to make sure that everybody gets adequate support of there are any employment issues.\" Having looked into technical points of NDAs it is clear there are helpful uses but they are massively open to abuse as well, and I can only speak from a business perspective on that, from my own experience.\"Finding a way to stop the misuse is very challenging and I dont think anyone has been able to answer that question yet.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9933256.jpg?type=article-full","title":"outdoor-play-gets-funding-boost","story":"But for many it has been seen as an option only for the middle-classes and those able to afford the expensive costs of private daycare.Now children from disadvantaged backgrounds are to be given the same opportunity to spend their nursery years learning outside thanks to a Scottish familyrsquos donation of half a million pounds to create new outdoor nurseries in some of the most deprived communities.The pound, gt has been made anonymously to the charity Inspiring Scotland with a view to establishing a new social investment fund and social enterprises to run the nurseries.:Never mind the weather, let children go out and playThere are currently only  fully outdoor nurseries in Scotland, but the fund will support up to , children over a five-year period to access outdoor play and learning, concentrating on disadvantaged areas where there is limited or no outdoor nursery provision.The fundrsquos use of a social enterprise model to set up outdoor nurseries in deprived communities is designed to have a major impact on the le chances of children from some of Scotlandrsquos poorest communities.Research from around the world demonstrates the enormous benefits to childrenrsquos health, wellbeing and development of getting outside to play and learn.The right to play is enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, while the Scottish Government has issued guidance titled Out to Play designed to offer advice on building new outdoor nurseries, as well as encouraging indoor nurseries to get children outside more often, whatever the weather.:Playground politics as Presiding Officer fights for school greenspace#Celia Tennant, Inspiring Scotland Chief Executive, said: ldquoWe are delighted by the generosity of this donation to support the health, wellbeing and development Scotlandrsquos children.ldquoWe believe that playing and learning outdoors, being active and having fun is a crucial part of a childrsquos development, and we want all children in Scotland to be able to do that.\"This funding will allow us to create daily le-enhancing outdoor experiences for children from some of Scotlandrsquos most deprived neighbourhoods.\"She added: \"This new private funding is testament to a growing movement in Scotland to embrace outdoor learning and of a deepening understanding of the huge physical, mental, social and emotional benefits of playing outside from an early age.Initially, the fund will select and invest in five organisations to set up as social enterprises to run outdoor nurseries in dferent deprived communities.

The Charter – which was launched late last year – lays out the purpose and aims of Fair Trade as agreed by the two largest global Fair Trade organisations: the World Fair Trade Organisation and Fairtrade International.The new document refreshes the vision of Fair Trade and more closely aligns with the UN Sustainable Development Goalsby highlighting Fair Trade’s longstanding role in addressing challenges covered by the SDGs, including inequality, gender rights, and climate change. The Charter lays out the unique approach, achievements and impacts of Fair Trade and illustrates how inclusive economic growth, fair wages and better working conditions can be achieved while empowering women and ensuring opportunities for the next generation.Aberdeenshire became the seventeenth Fairtrade Zone in , contributing to Scotland becoming a Fairtrade Nation.The area’s current Fairtrade Zone status continues until May , and one of the points in the Council’s Environment and Climate Change Policy states a commitment to develop an approach to ensure that local environmental, social and economic issues relating to the health and fair treatment of people are considered while also strengthening Aberdeenshire as a Fairtrade Zone.Following its decision last week, chair of Aberdeenshire Council’s Sustainability Committee, Colin Pike, said: “Pledging support for the new International Fair Trade Charter further demonstrates Aberdeenshire Council’s commitment to the global Fair Trade movement.“We as a Sustainability Committee and as a Council fully endorse the aims and refreshed vision for Fair Trade in the ever-changing world we live in, and in line with our Environment and Climate Change Policy.” Vice chair, Isobel Davidson, added: “Aberdeenshire Council has been committed to the Fair Trade movement for a number of years now in ious capacities, and pledging our support for this new International Charter is a further demonstration of our continued advocacy going forward.”Aberdeenshire Council is also a member of the Scottish Fair Trade Forum . The Forum was established in January  to promote the cause of Fair Trade in Scotland and secure Fair Trade Nation status for Scotland.The SFTF is encouraging other local authorities and public bodies to recognise the International Fair Trade Charter as a common reference document for the global Fair Trade movement.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The Junior Doric Verse competitors\"  Society hosts Strichen Festival viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"oor wullie big bucket trail to visit inverurie","story":"Cartoon favourite Oor Wullie will make his way to Inverurie this summer as part of his charity Big Bucket Trail.The town and local area will house seven sculptures as part of the first ever nationwide trail raising money for The ARCHIE Foundation, the official charity of Royal Aberdeen Children’s Hospital.Across Scotland,  Oor Wullies will be found on the streets of Aberdeen, Inverness, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow.A portion of those have been allocated to Inverurie thanks to the help of local businesses.GPH Builders Merchants, Inverurie Precast, ANM Group, Tarmac, Barra Berries, the Inverurie panto and the town’s Business Improvement District have each sponsored a sculpture, with funds going to benefit sick children in Grampian.Six Oor Wullies will be found in the town, while one will be ready to discover in Oldmeldrum.Derek Ritchie, manager of Inverurie BID, said: “We are absolutely delighted that the town will be hosting a number of sculptures this summer.

When Samaritans first started, for example, homosexuality was illegal.“But people still face the same challenges they did when that first call came in.“When there is no-one  to talk to, we’re there. That’s what is at the heart of the Samaritans – the power of human connection.”Founded on the principle that trained volunteers should answer calls, that has not changed either.And it’s something that strikes very many callers who use the service.In Scotland, volunteers were contacted more than , times last year and spent more than , hours providing emotional support to people in distress.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Members of Aberdeenshire Councils Sustainability Committee: Cllr Martin Ford, Cllr Iain Taylor, Cllr Victoria Harper, Cllr Isobel Davidson , Cllr Sarah Dickinson, Cllr Colin Pike , Cllr Sandy Wallace, Cllr Anouk Kloppert, Cllr Neil Baillie\"  , Cllr Sarah Dickinson, Cllr Colin Pike , Cllr Sandy Wallace, Cllr Anouk Kloppert, Cllr Neil Baillie\"  Council pledges supportto International Fair Trade Charter viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"That’s the equivalent of  days of listening in one year alone. James said: “I’ve spoken to numerous people who have used the service. “Many of them have said that knowing a volunteer is giving up their time to help them at their lowest ebb is incredibly powerful.“When people are struggling, eventhey have family and friends close by, it can be hard for them to open up and talk about what is troubling them.“That’s particularly true of Scottish men who have a reputation for being stoic and unlikely to talk about their emotions.“However, that is also now changing and the ratio of men to women calling the Samaritans is almost  .“Men are more inclined to pick up the phone nowthey are worried or sad about something as they know that they can talk to someone at the Samaritans in the strictest confidence.“When callers phone in, it’s completely anonymous. “We can’t see your phone number or where you are calling from and you don’t even have to give your nameyou don’t want to.“All of that means people can have conversations in a way they wouldn’t normally.”Men and women contact Samaritans for a wide range of reasons including isolation and loneliness, problems with mental or physical health and worries about family and relationships. Just under a third of callers also express thoughts of suicide.Volunteers also run hundreds of community events and awareness sessions, working with a wide range of organisations including schools, colleges, foodbanks, community centres, support groups, youth groups and health and emergency services.These events help spread the message that Samaritans is there for everyone.The charity also works with a range of national and local partners to ensure suicide prevention is a priority. Samaritans runs a Prison Listening Scheme, training inmates to become listening volunteers and provide peer-support.And through its work with National Rail, it has trained thousands of rail staff in suicide prevention.Of course, operating  hours a day,  days a year means the charity needs ever more volunteers to help provide its services, which now include email and text messages too.So in this diamond anniversary year, James is hopeful of recruiting an additional  volunteers.“We have up to  volunteers, more than  of whom answer calls, emails text messages and letters,” said James. “What our volunteers do is pretty demanding – when you pick up a phone, you’ve no idea what someone is going to say to you next.“Being non-judgemental is the most important quality we look for in volunteers.“Many of our callers thank us for our advice but our volunteers don’t actually give advice – they are trained in active listening, encouraging people to share their story and work through their own problems.“We are often referred to as the fourth emergency service and demand across the UK is substantial.“That demand is not going to go away and we want to make sure we’re here for people now and in  years.“But there’s a natural turn-over of volunteers so we always need to recruit more.“We could be there for even more peoplewe had more volunteers.“So we’re looking for people of all ages and from all backgrounds to get on board.“We’d love to hear from younger volunteers as we’re looking at new technology, such as webchat, to respond to people too.“In the s and s, most people came to our branches for face to face chats now almost  per cent of our contacts are via the phone and you don’t need credit on your mobile to call us.“We can’t do online chats now but we want to make sure we’re accessible to future generations so we hope to set them up soon.”John Lawrie has been a volunteer at the Edinburgh branch for  years and has witnessed many changes.As long as his hearing remains intact, the -year-old plans to continue.Initially, though, the retired investment manager had his doubts.He said: “I never thought I’d be able to do it. But in the early s, a mini series was on TV about the Samaritans and I started wonderingit was something I could do.“So, almost on the spur of the moment, I applied. “After an initial chat, I was invited to do the training.“The intervening  years have been immensely rewarding. That might sound strange but speaking to someone in a terrible state and them ringing off  minutes later, feeling better, can be really rewarding.“I’ve not changed their le they are still in the same boat as when they first called. But talking to someone  can often help them see a way forward.“It’s a privilege to be the person that they’ve opened up to.”Some calls are, of course, harrowing but volunteers are there for each other and also debrief their manager at the end of each sht.John said: “I have spoken to people who are suicidal – we’re not there to talk them out of it. “However, we do ask them to talk about why they’re feeling so bad. “The fact they’ve called the Samaritans might mean they’re not quite as certain as they say they are.”John also enjoys visiting schools. “I often worry they’ll think I’m terribly old, which I am!” he said. “But I like to think they get on better with their grandparents.“I always end my talk by saying: “I hope you never need our service but,you do, I hope you never hesitate to use it.”Someone contacts the Samaritans every six secondsToday Samaritans has grown to become the leading charity for suicide prevention with  branches across the UK and Ireland. Someone contacts the charity every six seconds.In Scotland, volunteers were contacted more than , times last year and spent more than , hours providing emotional support to people in distress and crisis.People can contact Samaritans by phone, email, text, letter or by visiting their local branch. And in the coming years, the charity will be introducing new methods to provide emotional support including webchat.Today – just as  years ago – every call for help is answered by a volunteer. And to meet demand, the charity needs to recruit at least  volunteers in Scotland in . Anyone can contact Samaritans for free,  hours a day,  days a year. The service is anonymous, confidential and non-judgemental. You can get in touch by calling   or emailing Jo@samaritans.org or write to Chris, Freepost RSRB-KKBY-CYJK, PO Box , Stirling, FK SA. Alternatively, you can find your local branch at samaritans.org branches.There are  across Scotland including Stornoway, which had  contacts last year answered by  volunteers Aberdeen , Dundee ,

We now have policies like minimum unit pricing and a new alcohol strategy that acknowledges the scale of the challenge we face in Scotland.Yet despite some positive advancements in Scottish Government policy over the last decade, alcohol harm is costing Scotland £. billion annually and is still contributing to the death of people we know or love, every single day. People like -year-old Gerry from Lanarkshire – my dad – who died fouryears ago.Growing up around alcohol has a big influence over us, especially for the ,+ children in Scotland living with a problem drinker.The statistics bring home the scale of the challenge. I know, because my family has been one of them and I’ve seen first-hand how “social drinking” can spiral into full-blown dependency and destroy relationships, careers, health and happiness. During my time in Parliament, speaking up about Scotland’s relationship with alcohol has been a personal priority.I’ve raised the issue of tackling stigma directly with the First Minister and as Co-Convenor of the Cross-Party Group on Drugs and Alcohol Misuse. Addiction is an illness and problem drinking in Scotland is a public health emergency. Social stigma and corporate influences are strong, so our decision-makers need to have courage.That’s why the collaboration between the Children’s Parliament and Alcohol Focus Scotland is exciting. Young people talking openly about alcohol and how it affects them in their everyday lives is a powerful message to politicians.So, with young people pushing for change, like those in the Children’s Parliament that I’m looking forward to welcoming to the Scottish Parliament soon, I am optimistic about our future and the progress that is possible. Communities need more services and investment and that’s why Scottish Labour is committed to a social responsibility levy. The legal provision already exists for this additional tax on alcohol sales. We simply want the Scottish Government to enact this and reinvest the funds in communities and recovery programmes.A public health approach that protects young people and changes our attitudes to alcohol can make Scotland a healthier and happier nation.Monica Lennon is Scottish Labour Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"life re injected into edinburgh international film festival alistair harkness","story":"The programme launch of the Edinburgh International Film Festival has been a dispiriting affair in recent years, with too few films of note to get excited about and far too many unknown quantities proving they were unknown quantities for a reason.Opening with Edinburgh director Ninian Doff’s properly funny coming-of-age comedy Boyz in the Wood, however, the rd edition of the festival proves there’s le in the old dog yet.There is the UK premieres of Jim Jarmusch’s recent Cannes-opener The Dead Don’t Die, Joanna Hogg’s Sundance-winning The Souvenir and — headlining a commemorative retrospect — Varga by Agnès, the final film by the late, great Agnès Varda.

Even though that lead evaporated in the latest Opinium poll , they’re still celebrating a first UK top spot in nine years.: Dani Garavelli: ‘I disagree with Jo’ moment a bad start for SwinsonThe good news for the Lib Dems is that English Remain voters have either forgotten their part in imposing university tuition fees and austerity or decided there are bigger Brexit fish to fry. Whatever the reason, the party most used to losing deposits is riding high. But will they be able to capitalise on this opportunity without the weel kent face of Sir Vince Cable at the helm  : Jo Swinson: I will take on ‘independence obsessed’ SNPThe battle to replace him as leader at the end of July is a modest affair compared with the Tories’ -strong line-up. It features just two candidates: Sir Ed Davey and Jo Swinson. Nominations close on  June, the day Theresa May bids a tearful farewell. But at that point the Lib Dems must decide what kind of party they really are – nasty or nice Tory-lite or genuinely radical a one-trick, anti-Brexit pony or a vigorous and serious potential government. It won’t be as easy as it looks. The party’s moment in the sun may finally have arrived but beyond “Bollocks to Brexit” it’s not clear the party has a winning slogan, distinctive policies or a new leader capable of commanding the UK stage.Take Sir Ed Davey, whose radical credentials are surely damaged by taking a gong from the Tories in consolation for losing his seat after the coalition debacle. Sir Ed’s record as energy minister is underwhelming from a Scottish perspective. Subsidies for community hydro and solar  were cut and vital subsea connectors to the Northern and Western Isles vetoed because islanders wouldn’t knuckle down and build vast wind farms tode-risk the project and simply the budgeting process. Even though Alistair Carmichael was Scottish Secretary at the time, the long-awaited Northern Isles cables weren’t built on the Lib Dems’ watch. Mind you, Sir Ed did approve connectors to Norway and Ireland instead. Nice. He also introduced contracts for dferencein place of subsidies for onshore and offshore wind plus marine renewables. Somehow Scots firms have won only a handful of these contracts and a new island-shaped CfD was only introduced last week. Soon after losing his seat in , Ed was knighted and joined the PR firm that represents EDF Energy. EDF had just been awarded the contract to build Hinkley Point C nuclear power station by… Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Ed Davey. Oh, yes, and Sir Ed supports fracking too. This is what passes for a radical record on tackling climate change in England.Anyway, back to Brexit – doubtless the Lib Dems’ strongest card. Sir Ed wants to use “the Cooper-Letwin process” so the Brexit default is Revoke rather than No Deal on \u2028 October. Whoop, whoop. When the crowd-funded Revoke Article  legal action failed its first hurdle in February , Lib Dem MP Christine Jardine promptly quit. Happily for MPs, all are now legally entitled to press the Revoke button, thanks to the tenacity, vision and co-operative capacity of the original petitioners in the Green, SNP and Labour parties. Without their constancy when the going got rough, Ms Jardine’s colleague Lib Dem MP Tom Brake would not have been able to join the posse in the latter stages and give the Lib Dems a democratic name-check. Poor.Meanwhile Sir Ed’s sole opponent, Jo Swinson, announced her candidacy on last week’s Question Time, taking a pop at the SNP’s failure to close the educational attainment gap. The MP for East Dunbartonshire cited figures from the Scottish Index on Multiple Deprivationwhich suggests only  per cent of children in Govan go on to higher education. This immediately provoked a social media storm, not least from Govan High’s headteacher who cited more recent figures which show the school’s actually doing pretty well. Was this an own goal or just plain baffling  Well, it would be usefula Holyrood statistician could explain how such wildly dfering stats can attach to roughly the same educational cohort. It would also be pointless to maintain that income doesn’t play a shamefully large part in determining access to opportunity in Scotland. But that’s why roughly half the population supports Scottish independence so all policy decisions, tax levers, benefit levels and income streams are under Scottish control, all ability to offload responsibility are at an end and a truly concerted sht of resources can tackle Dickensian levels of poverty, generated by David Cameron’s Con-Dem coalition government. Just for the record, both Sir Ed and Ms Swinson were members – she voted  times for the bedroom tax, five times against raising benefits in line with inflation, seven times for disability cuts and  times for general welfare cuts. But bygones…Even though the SIMD figures do exist, the statistical basis of her Question Time rebuke was dodgy, the “Milngavie air of superiority”was snfy, the “forced breeziness” a little wearing and the choice of First Minister Nicola Sturgeon’s seat as a target was negative and predictable. If Ms Swinson aims to outdo Ruth Davidson with high octane attacks on the SNP’s record in office, good luck. The SNP isn’t perfect. But politicians in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones. And thanks to the Lib Dems’ disastrous involvement with the Tories, shatterproof glass only covers them south of the Border for the single issue of Brexit. Even there, they must share the honours as second vote champions with the UK Greens. In Scotland, the latest poll puts them in fourth on just  per cent. And this despite winning a seat in recent European elections.If it’s too late to bring on a fresh face, the Lib Dems must find a fresh approach. Otherwise, it’s not just the big two parties that face political oblivion – ultimately, the big two-dependent Lib Dems will become political casualties as well. ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"new benefit for low income families for cost of sending children to school","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Low-income families are now able to apply for a new benefit to help cover the costs of sending a child to school.Applications for the School Age Payment can be made from today for eligible families who have a child old enough to be starting school this August.The payment will provide £ per child, paid in the year the child starts school.The application process will be open until  February next year, while parents who have deferred school entry so that their child starts school in August  are also encouraged to apply in the current window.Following the introduction of the payment, the Scottish Government is now delivering four new benefits - the Best Start Grant Pregnancy and Baby Payment, the Early Learning Payment, the School Age Payment and the Carer’s Allowance Supplement.The payment is part of the Best Start Grant, a package of three payments for families in receipt of eligible benefits - including Universal Credit, income support, housing benefit and tax credits - to help at key stages in a child’s le.The Best Start Grant package also includes the Pregnancy and Baby Payment, which has been open for applications since December , and the Early Learning Payment, which launched in April.Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said: “Covering the costs of a child starting school puts pressure on family finances, and we have created this new payment to help ease that burden, putting more money into the pockets of families at a time when they need it most.“We are committed to doing all we can to make sure Scotland is the best place for a child to grow up.

Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us, saying that joy in this reunites us. He knew it was chance that saw us on one side or another of any nationalist driven war, and wanted to emphasise the need for healing and togetherness.It’s a concept of course that also is captured by Robert Burns ten years after Schiller in: For a’ that and a’ that, or Trotz alledem und alledem, as it also became in .

Napoleonic Wars were certainly consequential in the rationale behind the companies formation. Particularly the Peninsular war.It wasn’t of course ever a one way street. Garve, a contemporary of Schiller and Goethe, did a great to broadcast the gains of the Scottish Enlightenment by translating and accrediting the works of Smith, Hume, Ferguson, Hutcheson, Reid and others, to the extent that Goethe himself, though perhaps before his heyday, said there was nowhere in Europe that could hold a candle to what was happening in Scotland. It would be unreasonable to suggest Burns did not become familiar with the thoughts of Kant, Rousseau, Locke, and other European philosophers, directly or indirectly, in the salons of Edinburgh. It would similarly be a nonsense to suggest that Haldane had no exposure to all this. His inspiration cannot be orced from the earlier flourishing of inspirational ideas of brotherhood and equal worth that happily live on yet. Shetland, after the Napoleonic era, seems to have been quite a radical place to a degree, as the later broken-promise legal challenges possibly demonstrate. There was also a legal challenge related to a whale grounding in Sandwick which seemed fairly radical in intent. The underpinning ideas don’t appear to respect the random lines drawn on maps that seem to dominate some people’s thinking.Some lines are more equal than others eh Peter The modern Labour movement of course grew out of the earlier Liberals, with many older ideas and values broadly held in common. Opening the debate, crossbencher, Lord Lisvane saw a problem where Scotland and Northern Ireland, as two of four parts of the United Kingdom, backed Remain, yet could be dragged out of Europe against their will. He identied #a sort of imperial condescension from the centre—from Westminster and Whitehall# and sought #a devolution settlement properly owned by its participants# that would #include something perhaps missing from the present arrangements: the R word—respect.#Most Scots voted to continue their solidarity with Europe, whilst a signicantminority of English and Welsh voters would apparently risk sacricing their older union with Scotland in order to Leave. Schilleradvocated seeking broadminded and warmhearted company. Should the UK falter, will it be those who sought to continue to enjoy the benefits of the wider degree of solidarity who are really to blame I am so sorry, Peter Hamilton, Schiller died two hundred years ago.

Students have learnt about the aquacultures along the tidal zones of Skye and food practices that can support them.During the summer, three graduates of the course have been awarded a Climavore apprenticeship in restaurants across Skye and Raasay # Edinbane Lodge, Raasay House, and Scorrybreac Restaurant.

They were among the first pioneers in planting English and Scots settlers in Ireland. But by , Smiths settlement failed and the lands reverted to the crown.On  May , King James I granted the Ballymena Estate to another native Irish nobleman, Ruairiacute Oacuteg MacQuillan. The estate passed through several owners, eventually passing into the possession of William Adair, a Scottish laird from Kinhilt in southwestern Scotland.The estate was temporarily renamed Kinhiltstown after Adairs lands in Scotland. The original castle of Ballymena was built in the early th century, situated to take advantage of an ancient ford at the River Braid.In  Charles I confirmed the grant of the Ballymena Estate to William Adair, giving him the right to hold a market at Ballymena on every Saturday. He hired local Irish as workers on the estate they served as tenant farmers for much of the next two centuries and more.And from those early days, Ballymena became a commercial hub for central Co. Antrim, steadily growing in prosperity through the years of the linen boom in the th century.Until recent years, the traditional market had been held at the area known as the Fair Hill on lands bordered by upper Broughshane Street, William Street and Thomas Street.When the area was sold for the development of what is now the Fair Hill Shopping Centre, the Saturday market was moved to its current venue near the Seven Towers Leisure Centre.And that is pretty much where the whole tradition kicked off nearly  years ago as the site is pretty much right in the front garden of what used to be the Adair familys residence in Ballymena!Mid and East Antrim Borough Council is urging you to come enjoy, explore and love your local market this May as part of UK wide campaign to support our local traders. ‘Love Your Local Market’ runs from - May.

He started his football career with Dromore Amateurs before playing for Glenavon in the Irish league and later ing to his much-loved Dromara Village FC, as both player and assistant coach. Walter was held in high esteem at DVFC, where his name features on the roll of honour.Triplets Blake, Ryan and Megan were aged just four when their dad passed away, leaving his we Margaret and family heartbroken at the loss of a much loved husband and father. Since then the McVeigh family has raised funds for Leukaemia and Lymphoma NI and the Anthony Nolan trust,with a range of events. Walter McVeigh during his playing days. “My hope, on behalf of my family, “ said Margaret, “is for everyone to have a great day and to raise money for the two charities that are very close to our hearts, who save many lives.“Our family and friends have been working tirelessly during the fundraisers on the lead-up to the main event. “The communities of Dromara, Gilford, Limavady, Belfast and beyond have really got behind us during our big breakfast, ballots, craft mornings, sponsored walks and discos we can’t thank them enough.”Son, Ryan, added: “Just like our dad, Blake and I have been involved with Dromara Football Club most of our lives. It’s great the club are helping us to create a special day that will be remembered forever, with funds going to two worthy charities.”Walter visited Old Trafford many times and dreamt of taking his children to see United play, but it wasn’t to be.When the family began thinking about what they could do to honour him, on his th anniversary year, it felt right, they said, to invite Manchester United Legends to play at Dromara a select team of Walter’s old frends, teammates and his children. Walter’s son Blake added: “I know how much my dad would have loved to have been involved in a game like this, playing alongside his idols, as well as Ryan and I.”The family’s thanks go to DVFC for the use of its ground on match day and for continued support over the years also to local councils for help on launch day and for support provided. In the run-up to the big day, many United Legend Players have been released, including Brian McClair, Keith Gillespie and Bryan Robson.

They get to meet the young ones and they’ve prepared lunch for the kids so they’ll get to sit down and have a meal together where the young ones can learn about the service provided here.”She added: “The garden is looking impressive with all the dferent colours. The young ones are putting their mark on the garden, which is great.”Michael McAllister from Leonard Cheshire Disability commented: “It’s good to get the guys involved in this project.“This is the third day we’ve been here and we’re getting ready for the barbecue next week. It’s been good fun, but it’s a good opportunity for the young people to get involved with Rosemount House.“It’s a good education for them. It’s also about creating more awareness in Belfast about homelessness. This is a real positive project for the young people to be involved in.”Michael Bradley, who lectures at Belfast Met, said: “Partnering up with Leonard Cheshire gives young people the chance to give back to the community. They’re also developing teamwork skills and communication skills. They’re able to help the community, but it’s also part of their qualication too.”He added: “One of the residents came in one day and spoke to the young ones about the choices that he made that led him here. It had quite a big impact on the students, because they could relate to it in some ways. It’s really striking a note with them.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"largest tv in ireland on sale in west belfast electronic store","story":"CUSTOMERS in Noel Grimley Electrics did a double take on Wednesday afternoon as the latest in TV technology was unveiled.The ” Samsung QLED, the first in the north, was unveiled – just in time for Saturday’s Champions League final between Liverpool and Spurs.“It’s great to see the TV displayed in the store,” said owner Eamon Grimley, “we are a big Samsung dealer and were the first in the north to sell the K TV. That’s what we are here for, to showcase the latest in technology. People in West Belfast want the latest, most up-to-date technology available,” he said. “The QLED is the screen quality, it’s giving you the best in picture quality. With us being in the area we want to showcase the latest in technology for our customers and make it as accessible to everybody.”With a £. price tag, Gerard Bonner explained how the TV has a wealth of top of the range additions.“The TV is a quantum dot display, so it’s QLED, it has a layer of quantum dots, like wee fine crystals on it so it enhances the colour and the brightness. It’s basically two and a half times brighter than a standard LED TV and there are over a billion colours that come through on the screen.“The two main things with the TV is that it has Apple TV.

PIPS came to the house for the wake and I got talking to them,” she said.“They offered me the chance to come for some therapy sessions and to get involved in the family group. I went and thought at the time it was all too much. It just wasn’t for me.“A few years later I thought about it and went back. I met the other members and we have been best friends ever since.“The thing is we know exactly how each other feels. You can’t explain it to anyone  how it feels to lose a child.“There is one woman in the group who lost three sons and another who has lost two.”Anne joined the group six years ago when her son Brogue died.“For me, the group provides great friendship for me and I enjoy coming every week,” she explained.“When it is my son’s birthday or the anniversary of his death, sometimes I don’t feel like leaving the house but I would never miss a group meeting on a Wednesday night.“Really, without this group I don’t think I would be doing as well as I am today.“Every week, I look forward to a Wednesday night to come along and meet with people I now class as my friends.”As well as exchanging their own personal stories of heartbreak and loss, PIPS Family Group is much more than sharing their loss.Every year, members save up to fund a four-day holiday abroad with previous destinations including Amsterdam, Malta and Portugal. They also have regular days out, shopping trips and an annual Christmas dinner.“I think the social aspect of the group is very important,” added Patricia. It is not all miserable and we all enjoy our holidays and day trips to just get away from it all. We have all become really good friends.“We work closely with New Lodge Arts doing things like arts and crafts and doing social things with them really gives us all a bit of a lt.“Losing a loved one is dferent for each person. I understand the group might not be for everyone.“We all just sit and chat. We can talk openly about our loved ones we have lost and it helps us remember the good and happy times.”Due to renovation work at PIPS Antrim Road offices, the family group recently got good news of a room available in Tesco in Cityside, Yorkgate, where their weekly meetings will be held for the foreseeable future.Despite the success of the group, Patricia would like to see a similar group set up for men so that men can talk to each other about the subject.“The suicide rate in North Belfast is terrible. It is an epidemic,” she said.“We badly need a similar group like ourselves, but for men so that they can too talk to each other.“We have welcomed men before but some felt it just was not the setting for them.“I wish a man out there would do something. Men need to be talking.“As for our group, it is great to have this new room in Tesco. It is a good size and a lovely room.”PIPS Family Group are open to welcome new members.

In April, he took up the head chef post at the Malone Lodge Hotel, where he had previously worked as a Senior Sous Chef before a seven-year spell working abroad. Although his new role may be viewed as a veritable homecoming, it could well be his most exciting challenge yet.Liam first started his career in the industry working as a waiter in the Europa Hotel – a summer job that would soon see him step behind the line in the kitchen. Reflecting on those early days, the Clonard man said: “The passion of the chefs had for food, the flavours and the way they were plating stuff up really inspired me. It was good to see that buzz in the kitchen.“Yes, it is a stressful environment, but the guys all have fun. They all work towards one goal and they’re all one big family. It doesn’t matter what kitchen you go into, they’re all family –one person goes down they all go down, which just shows the teamwork. When I first watched the guys in the Europa it just bit me and I wanted to be a chef after that.”Liam’s flair for cooking and his desire to learn inspired him to gain chef’s qualications, and garnered further opportunities including the chance to work at the inimitable James Street South.He later went to work at the Malone Lodge Hotel, where his skills brought critical acclaim in  he became one of six finalists in prestigious European Chef of the Year Awards. Liam was the only chef in the finals from a non-Michelin starred restaurant and eventually picked up a bronze award for his five-course menu that showcased the best local and seasonal produce. His passion for seasonality and high-quality produce is something that has stuck with him to this day.“I like to stick to the classics,” he explained.“Classics are classics for a reason. Sometimes I’ll twist it as best as I can, but I always try to keep the flavours clean and seasonal. It’s basically just good food that everybody can enjoy. It doesn’t matter what your dietary requirement, we can cater for it.“We’ll always try to make a dish that is gluten free or dairy free so that we don’t have to tell people they can’t have it. We’ll twist a classic dish to more clean or refined flavours so that everybody can enjoy it.”When Liam left Belfast for Guernsey seven years ago he felt it may well have been for good. His move brought success, of course – he headed the team at Guernsey’s most popular restaurant, the Slaughterhouse – however, when the Malone Lodge offered him a new opportunity it was a challenge he could not pass up, and one he is meeting with his typical enthusiasm for food.“I’ve been bringing seasonality back into the restaurant. I’ve been making Macklin’s Bar back into a bar where people can come for a few pints and have chicken, ribs – bringing back real pub grub,” he said.“We’re making sure the lobby is buzzing again with people enjoying scones, teas, coffees and paninis – just having a bit to eat and drink and relaxing.“We’re bringing the restaurant back to what it was a nice hotel restaurant that is there for families, kids, and everybody so that they can have a nice sit down meal. It’s not just for customers who are staying in the hotel – it’s for the people of the area, people from all over Belfast, or people just visiting.”He continued: “The response has been very very good. I’ve come in at a crazy time with tour groups coming in, we’ve had holy communions coming in, but the feedback has all been positive. People like what they see happening and what they’re getting, and they like that they are getting good value for money.”Although Liam felt he might live in his home city again, he insists hiswas the right move. With Belfast’s ever growing food culture and tourism industry, it could not have come at a better time.“Belfast has always been a booming city – it’s basically like a mini London,” he said.“It is always evolving and the food is always evolving. We have some amazing chefs. You have people like Stevie Tolman, who is a Michelin starred chef at OX – I worked with him in James Street South – I think it’s amazing what he does. Every chef bouncing off each other is the whole point of it.“I think it’s brilliant for Belfast’s tourism and the city as a whole. We’re able to show how we’re moving forward to a better place. You can actually go out now and enjoy a nice meal. When I was younger you maybe went out for your communion and you were luckyyou got a steak. People are now trying dferent things, they’re experimenting with food, and they are opening their minds to the dferent things you can eat. There are a lot of Asian restaurants and a lot of other multicultural restaurants in Belfast, which brings a lot of passion and a lot of enjoyment for everybody.”He continued: “I’m happy that I’ve been asked to come back and take over the kitchen. It brings a lot of pride because I was here when it was the old restaurant and then I was here when it got done up.“It’s good to be able to show these guys in the kitchen where hard work gets you and what we can do together. I want to give a bit of guidance and teach them things that I’ve learned and the stuff that I’m still learning. I’ve been away for seven years, but I’m proud to be back. I would have come back maybe once a year, but I’ve always missed Belfast and I’ve always been a West Belfast boy, so I’m glad I got the opportunity.”"},{"url":null,"title":"sajid javid would make grand gesture to irish government by covering costs of new digitised border in ireland","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mr Javid continued: \"In my departmentat the moment Ive got border force and weve done work for months on what an alternative to that arrangement could look like and whats missing is that good will. \"What I would do is make a grand gesture to Ireland that we would cover all their costs - the upfront costs, the running costs - of a new digitised border. \"I think it could be done in a couple of years but I think we could cover their costs.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38163421.ece/9197d/AUTOCROP/w620h342/plaza.jpg","title":"belfast benefit centre staff spat out of windows and hurled objects onto the street below","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Powersharing at the executive at Stormont collapsed in January  amid acrimony between Sinn Fein and the DUP, leaving a political vacuum in Northern Ireland for more than two years. Theresa May and Leo Varadkar released a statement on Sunday evening after being updated on the progress of the talks by Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Karen Bradley and the Tánaiste Simon Coveney.It read: \"We welcome the constructive engagement shown by all parties to date. It is clear to us that the Northern Ireland political parties wish to see the institutions of the Belfast   Good Friday Agreement restored, but operating on a more credible and sustainable basis. \"While broad consensus has been reached on some issues, other areas remain to be resolved.\"The Secretary of State and Tánaiste believe that there is a genuine but narrow window of opportunity to reach agreement in the immediate period ahead and that it is essential to continue and intensy talks to this end.\"As Prime Minister and Taoiseach, we will continue to monitor this progress closely.  \"We believe it is imperative that the parties now move without delay to engaging substantively on the shape of a final agreement.\"The DUP and Sinn Fein have so far been unable to come to agreement on a series of issues, including same-sex marriage, language rights and legacy issues.Sinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonald said: “We are now at the end of this phase of the talks.

It is definitely an iconic part of the lough.In the late s, maritime archaeologist Thomas McErlean and a team from Ulster University stumbled upon the worldrsquos earliest known tide mill during an excavation at Strangford Lough.Discovered close to the remains of Nendrum Monastery on Mahee Island, Thomas recalls the signicance of unearthing this medieval tide mill.Thomas says: ldquoThis was a site we got so excited about, we knew we were changing the course of Irish archaeology and indeedhellip industrial archaeology. We were breaking new ground and it was absolutely wonderful.In recent times, Strangford Lough has become an important site for tidal energy research and in  the worldrsquos first commercial tidal turbine was built near Portaferry.The turbine is now being decommissioned and local marine expert Simon Rogers, who is working on the removal, reveals the impact the tide has on operations.

Based on a five acre site at Kennedyrsquos Lake, the retreat has been visited by disabled groups who abide by the ethos of lsquofishing for funrsquo.No lead weights or barbs are allowed. Once a fish is caught and photographed it is released back into the lake.Robert explains that with the help of his close aide and fellow veteran, Nigel Cree, who is a director of Letrsquos Do Veterans Support, the net has been widened and that an invitation is being extended to anyone within the local community who wants to try out fishing.While battling to overcome his disability, Robert discovered there was little or no help for disabled veterans available in his community.Facing an interminable series of bad news on his journey to recovery he viewed the opportunity to be given a role in the British Limbless Ex-Servicemenrsquos Association as his saving grace.Robert said: ldquoWhen I got involved I saw people much worse off than myself. Some veterans had catastrophic injuries. I began to gain qualications in helping other people in the same situation as me. This helped me with my own recovery and give me a focus.ldquoMy house is down by the lake. One evening I was sitting observing how peaceful it was and it got me thinking about how I could put the lake to good use. In hindsight, the idea saved me from myself.ldquoI got a small team involved and before we knew it we had been successful in attracting funding to construct a car park, create fishing stands and a foot bridge, stock the lake with indigenous course fish and install an eco-toilet with disabled access.ldquoThere was no stopping half way through and the gamble has paid off with a successful opening and an encouraging demand for bookings growing each day.Robert describes himself as ldquonot being a lsquotea and biscuits man and doesnrsquot like to stand on ceremony.He continued: ldquoI have been helped by a devoted team of helpers and I would like to pay tribute to each of them and I dedicate this achievement to them and the three other veterans I started with who gave me great encouragement.ldquoIrsquod also like to thank Alpha Concrete, Hamilton Brothers and Cunningham Stone who were exceptional in their work with memorial plaques which have been erected.Robert said he hopes to provide fishing workshops in the near future and to get more people using the retreat.He added: ldquoA lot of time and money has been invested and when strangers visit we would ask them to adhere to the rules. They can contact me to book a session and pay a minimum day fee.For more information on Clough fishing retreat and for other initiatives which Letrsquos Do Veterans Support carry out, visit www.letsdoevents.info or contact Robert on  ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Event marking Men’s Health Week  ","story":"THE St Patrick Centre in Downpatrick is hosting a special event next month to mark Menrsquos Health Week.Between June  and June , the centre dedicated to Irelandrsquos patron saint will feature an exhibition of art, craft and woodwork by members of the townrsquos Menrsquos Shed.The shedders are busily preparing for the exhibition with visitors welcome to view the work on display and learn about the work of the organisation in the community.The Menrsquos Shed aims to promote positive mental health and wellbeing to men over the age of  with the organisation offering a sizeable, well-equipped workshop at its Ballydugan Road industrial estate.There, shedders make wooden items to order such as garden seats and planters and they also produce items for community and conservation projects, like bird, bat and owl boxes for the National Trust.The Menrsquos Shed also offers opportunities for people to learn new practical skills including art, wood carving, clay, copper and leather work. The shedders also sing, cook and enjoy copious amounts of tea, biscuits and craic.And when not busy making things, the men love to get out and about visiting other Menrsquos Sheds which is a great way to network and exchange ideas.They also take part in day trips and have been involved in a new community engagement programme at Hillsborough Castle. The local shedders have also been given a fantastic tour of the grounds at Castle Ward to see their very own bird boxes being installed.The Downpatrick Menrsquos Shed is open on Tuesdays and Thursdays between .am and pm and on Friday between .am and .pm.For more information about the work of the organisation and how to get involved, telephone   or visit the Facebook Page, @MensShedDownpatrick..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Former chairman reflects on year in office  ","story":"FORMER Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin has described his term at the helm of the organisation as ldquoabsolutely fantastic.Mr Murnin mdash who lost his Slieve Croob seat to SDLP colleague Hugh Gallagher at the recent council election mdash served the area for four years, with his term as chairman a particular highlight.Reflecting on his year in office, which took him across Europe, the United States and the Far East, Mr Murnin said he spent almost  nights abroad and that there were many high points over the past  months.Addressing the local authorityrsquos annual meeting last week, the outgoing chairman thanked his party colleagues, fellow councillors and staff for their support.But Mr Murnin said the joy of his year in office was tinged with sadness as a number of people across the district tragically lost their lives, including a council staff member.ldquoThere were many highlights along the way, continued the chairman whose time at the helm concluded with a major charity walk which raised over pound, for Air Ambulance Northern Ireland, Harmony Community Trust and Newry Gateway Club.ldquoIt was great to start off my year with the districtrsquos special olympians and to be with them again near the end of my term in office. They represented the district so well at Irish level and again at world level in Abu Dhabi, bringing home medals.Mr Murnin also referred to the success of the inaugural Be Active Cup involving soccer teams from opposite sides of the council area. He instigated the tournament and hopes his successors will continue with it.He continued: ldquoDuring my year we had the opportunity to salute Dermot Curran, one of our long standing councillors mdash in fact the longest serving in Northern Ireland mdash with whom we enjoyed a fantastic night.ldquoIt was also a pleasure to lead our St Patrickrsquos Day parade in my home area which was really special for me. We then had the Innovation Nation event, bringing many young people from our schools together to see the exciting advances in the business opportunities that are presented to them going forward.Mr Murnin said he was also involved in helping fundraise for brave Bessbrook girl Ellen Treanor and six-year Alfie Pentony from Newry who will both travel to the US for pioneering health treatment.Sadly for the former chairman, rain intervened last August and the annual Festival of Flight international air show in Newcastle was cancelled.On a serious note, he told those in the chamber that a great responsibility comes with being a councillor.ldquoAs you strive to make this district the number one place to do business and set up a home, itrsquos worth remembering that those across the council chamber are not necessarily the enemy mdash you all must work together for the betterment of our district, he said.ldquoDuring my recent visit to New York, I was able to see how investors view the world and it was interesting to see where they see opportunities and risks, in particular.ldquoOne of those was climate risk and the importance of it, with businesses looking at it from an investors point of view. As a district, this is something that we need to take seriously, and not necessarily just rising sea levels.Mr Murnin believes that increased rainfall is going to make a dramatic dference to the way buildings and roads are designed, also highlighting the need to look at alternative energy forms.He added: ldquoBuilding for the future and how a modern city should look like will also be important. One thing that struck me looking out from the observation tower at the One World Center in New York was that the city is surprisingly green as so many of the buildings have roof top gardens and trees. This is something we should look to replicate where we can..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Foster sisters and Alex shine at schools’ event  ","story":"THE Newry Mourne and Down Primary Schoolsrsquo Cross Country Championships were held in Kilbroney Forest Park last Tuesday.Jodi Foster was first in the P girls and her sister Kari was second in the P girls.

His young  year-old jockey, Sean Armitage, was giving the horse a work-out gallop in preparation for the Sligo race meeting when he suddenly felt the horse jerk.Moments later they saw blood trickling down the neck of the horse and after finding a small hole they realised that a bullet had done the damage. The incident happened near the army camp.Mr Treacey, who lives at Ardglass Castle, reported the incident to police and investigations began immediately. However, they have not discovered who fired the bullet.ldquoThe future of the horse is very much in the balance, said an unhappy Mr Treacey. ldquoThe bullet is lodged close to the horsersquos spine and my vet has suggested a very tricky operation is needed to remove it.ldquoWorse still, it could easily have been my jockey who was hit. He was in the racing position on the horse and had the bullet been six inches higher it would have hit him in the head.A police spokesman confirmed the incident and said that it had been established that the horse had gunshot wounds, possibly from a . bullet.ldquoOur investigations are continuing and we hope to be in a position to establish whether it could have been a ricochet or a stray bullet from the firing range, or a deliberate shooting incident, he said.LEITRIM mdash Road racer Tom Herron, tragically killed at the North West meeting on Saturday, was buried beside Leitrim Presbyterian Church on Monday. The mourners included many of his racing colleagues, who had flown from the Isle of Man to be at the graveside.The funeral service was conducted by the Rev James Johnston, who referred to Herronrsquos many qualities and the determination which had taken him to the top.Herron was the third motorcycle ace from mid Down to die in race accidents.

Fortunately, the action only lasted for a limited period.PORTAFERRY mdash Declan Mackell sailed single-handed out of Portaferry on Sunday afternoon to go round the world. A handful of boats accompanied him out of Strangford Lough after he had enjoyed lunch at the Portaferry Hotel.ldquoYes, Irsquom probably mad, he admitted before he left. ldquoBut I see this outing as something that should satisfy my curiosity in the same way as my transatlantic trip last year.His -foot yacht dipped gently into the Irish Sea as the former carpenter tacked his way out of sight and got his self-steering gear into action for his first night at sea.Declan, who has prepared his boat over the last six months, will take in France, the Mediterranean, the Canaries, Atlantic and Pacic Oceans, Australia, New Zealand, Indian Ocean and Cape Hope before coming back to Portaferry.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Castlewellan Library, formerly the Market House, was officially opened by Mr Peter OrsquoHagen, chairman of the South Eastern Education and Library Board, this week.Almost pound, was pumped into covering the building into a library and the Board agree that the expense was worth it.

Those that are successful are provided with financial support for one year only.It is a system that the chairwoman of the Bishopscourtrsquos playgroup is keen to see changed.Mrs Patricia Curran, who revealed that Tiny Toons recently missed out on Pathway funding by a narrow margin, said playgroups did a ldquomagnicent job, particularly in rural area where working parents rely heavily upon them.She said playgroups look after children at the most critical time in their development and need to be provided with financial certainty.A number of playgroups across the district revealed recently that they were organising additional fundraising activities to generate income and were appealing for donations of everyday essentials including toilet paper, wipes, photocopying paper and even bin bags.Mrs Curran revealed that Tiny Toons only found out about the strategic support fund by chance and while pleased the cash will pay staff wages over the summer, fresh funding applications will have to be made at the start of next year to cover costs.ldquoWhile we narrowly missed out on Pathway funding, we have secured other support from a fund which we knew nothing about, she continued.ldquoThe money we have secured will keep us ticking over. We are not saying everything is hunky dory as a result of this particular finance. We have money to pay for  childrenrsquos places from next September which is good. The money secured under the strategic support fund will pay our staff over July and August.Mrs Curran said that had the playgroup not been made aware of the strategic fund it would have been a ldquovery dferent story.ldquoWhile securing funding comes as a relief, it does not provide us with any degree of certainty. We will have to make a fresh application for Pathway funding at the start of next year and go through this process all over again, as we and others do every year, she continued.Mrs Curran said Tiny Toons and other playgroups across the district were operating in a ldquochallenging financial climate.ldquoThe provision of ring-fenced funding is vital for us, she declared. ldquoWhile things are fine for now, we know that come the New Year we will have to start filling in funding application forms again.ldquoRing-fenced funding for a two or three-year period would provide certainty and help playgroups operate in a climate where there would not be a cloud hanging over them.ldquoThe funding issue affects all those in the education sector and I read recently that one headmaster warned that his school could be forced to only open four days a week as it did not have enough money.Mrs Curran said that while strategic support funding has provided Tiny Toons with short term relief, guaranteed ring-fenced financial support would provide certainly and allow future planning.She added: ldquoGiven the current funding model, there is always uncertainty hanging over us. We are voluntary workers and we should not have this pressure on our heads. That said,we did not do this work, who  is going to do it ldquoNot many people want to do voluntary work any more because of the pressure involved. We in Bishopscourt were worried about paying our staff and have been provided with some relief.

The race exited the campsite with the organisers issuing strict instructions for runners not to cross walls or fences, except through an open gate where a marshal would be there to direct them.Wet tops were the order of the day, for while it was mild and dry, but there were a few ominous grey clouds around and once up near to , feet the climate conditions can be much more challenging.By the way, one of the race directorsdecided it would be wise to recce the course earlier in the week.So on Monday evening meeting at the above-mentioned stunning Meelmore Lodge, he gathered with a few so-called running mates.

Ahead of the first episode, Ruth told the News Letter: “I was nervous at the start about it coming on TV. Then whenever I saw the adverts it’s put me at ease a wee bit. Businesswoman and fashionista Shirley“We’ve seen a few clips but we don’t get to see the whole episodes until the public sees them.”While it’s been billed as Northern Ireland’s equivalent as TOWIE and Made In Cha the characters come across as being a lot more down to earth.Ruth, , said: “It’s just the way we are everyday. People in Co Tyrone are very genuine.“It might come across as we all know each other but a lot of the people in the show I hadn’t met until we came together for the programme.Country singer Neil“I’d never met Bobby or Lynda or Audrey or Melvin. We’re all friendly now.“Even when I met them and the cameras weren’t on we got on really well. Bobby constantly had me in stitches. He could have his own show.“We’re from Dungannon. Lynda is Omagh direction, Audrey I think she’s up by Clogher.NI athlete Erin McConnell happy to rise before am to achieve Olympic dream\"  \"  Reported On This Day  Years Ago : Entry rules for the Downpatrick races are listed Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“The way it’s filmed it might seem that we live closer together.”Ruth said she had some dficulties with the cameras to begin with but soon found her feet: “When it was being filmed they said, ‘pretend we’re not here’. At the start I was accidentally looking into the lens. After a while, after the second or third time, you do forget the cameras are there.” Ruth explained how she got involved with the programme which was filmed at the start of last summer: “They went to my friend’s salon and they were giving out flyers trying to find someone who comes from a farming background and is also into the beauty and all. Helen said about me and passed on my details. They contacted me and I said I’d be interested, it sounds like great craic.”Ruth revealed that it wasn’t technically her TV debut: “When I was in primary school I was in school choir of the year, but that was in a choir and I’m a blur.”In one scene, Ruth who is a member of a gun club takes two of her friends shooting: “Hollie had shot once before, Helen had never shot in her le. We just sort of thought we’d go for the craic. That’s the sort of thing that we did for the show. It’s not like reality shows were they make drama for the sake of it.”Ruth described herself as “a part time farmer, part time beautician and a full time mum”. She said: “Maisie is two this week. She’s not in the show but I do talk about her.“I have a boyfriend, we’re not married or engaged. We’ve been going out for three and half years and we’ve been friends since we were .”During her early days as beautician she needed someone to practice on. Cue her dad John: “When I was training as a beautician I had to practice eyebrow waxing. I got my kit and asked dad would he let me practice. I think I got one strip pulled off and he stopped me. He said he’d been in enough accidents on the farm but that was by the far the worst. He ended up with one bushy eyebrow and one normal one.”She added: “My oldest brother John is a full time farmer. He’s won’t be on the show, he’s a bit shy. He works on the farm with my dad and my dad’s friend Billy.“My mumhelps out on the farm before her own job as a classroom assistant in a special needs school.”Ruth appears in the show alongside her brother Neil. As a duo they’re used to being in the limelight together.She said: “Neil’s a country singer. We used to sing together. We were a two-piece band then I went to Australia for a year and he went out on his own.“He started to make it really well on his own so I left him to it.

They havenrsquot had any unpleasant encounters.ldquoBut itrsquos inevitable as a person of colour, whether they see something on the news or it happens in a social environment.ldquoBefore it gets to that point they should consciously or subconsciously have enough references to their own self worth in media, be it movies, books, or cartoons to handle it.Mr Banda was spurred into writing by a comment made by Tancho after school. ldquoI donrsquot knowit was a book or a lesson, but Tancho made a very generalised comment ndash he said they have no water in African homes so they have to walk really far.ldquoI told him: lsquoYou know Africa is not a country right  They all have their own experiences the same way Europe is made up of a lot of dferent countries.ldquoIt worried me. Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them.

The only way forward out of this mess is to let the people have the final say on any deal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

She said: “It has been another great show, and we’ve been very lucky with the weather. “A big thank you to everyone who contributed to the success of our th annual show, especially ABC Council, Translink and principal sponsor ABP. We are also indebted to the many iniduals who give so freely of their time to organise the show.”The cattle and sheep sections attracted a iety of continental, native and traditional breeds.Leading the cattle parade and securing the award for the supreme champion of champions was the Holstein cow Glasson Goldfish Form Erle VG from Philip and Simon Haffey’s -cow herd at Portadown. A second prize winner at Balmoral Show, she calved her third in March and is producing  litres of milk every day. Originating from the noted Erle family at Smiddiehill, her granddam was the ,gns Field of Dreams Formation Erle. The Haffey family have won seven successive Holstein championships at Lurgan Show. Interbreed cattle judge Cyril Millar, from Coleraine, described the overall show champion as a spectacular specimen of the breed. “It’s never an easy task judging beef cattle against dairy cattle, and the exhibitors deserve credit for putting on a tremendous show of quality animals. “Today’s overall winner is a flashy dairy cow with great power and scope. She has a big open frame, a well attached udder, and walks well on sound legs and feet.”Taking the reserve supreme award was the interbreed beef winner, an Aberdeen Angus heer from Richard and Fiona McKeown’s Herd at Templepatrick. This home-bred heer was born in April , and secured the reserve breed titles at Balmoral and Lurgan.  Cyril Millar added: “This heer is a peach of a beast, and a very close second. She oozes breed character from head to toe, and has great conformation and muscle.”Runner-up in the interbreed beef line-up was the two-year-old Charolais heer Summervilla Nikki exhibited by Nigel and Gail Matchett from Portadown.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/5g1.jpg","title":"belfast to get superfast g mobile broadband this month","story":"Posted on Wednesday  May  by John Mulgrew Suzanne Wylie, Belfast City Council with Karen Dundas, EE Victoria Square store manager Belfast is to become one of six UK cities to get superfast G mobile broadband later this month, it has emerged. EE is bringing the connectivity to the city from May , alongside London, Edinburgh, Cardf, Birmingham and Manchester. While still at an early phase, with further roll-out a longer term project, EE says it expects customers in Belfast to “experience an increase in speeds of around -Mbps even in the busiest areas”. “Some customers will break the one gigabit-per-second milestone on their G smartphones. The fastest speed possible when EE launched G in  was just Mbps.” Marc Allera, chief executive, of BT’s consumer ision, says: “This is the start of the UK’s G journey and great news for our customers that want and need the best connections. We’ve started with G in some of the busiest parts of the UK, the widest range of G devices in the UK, and plans that give customers the best mobile connection and great benefits. “We’re adding G to the UK’s number one G network to increase reliability, increase speeds, and keep our customers connected where they need it most.  “G will create new experiences with augmented reality, make our customers’ lives easier, and help launch entirely new businesses that we haven’t even imagined. We’re upgrading more than  sites to G every month from today to connect more places to what G can enable.” Suzanne Wylie, chief executive of Belfast Council, said: “Digital connectivity is at the heart of our strategy for the growth of Belfast. G is key to making our ambitions a reality. It will drive our economy forward and enable Belfast to thrive in the fourth industrial revolution. Being one of the first G enabled cities in the UK is an exciting prospect for us, and will bring our businesses and citizens the best mobile connectivity in Europe. “G connectivity will ensure our city remains competitive, indigenous businesses grow and big global brands continue to build their businesses in Belfast and support our ongoing digital advancement.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sign_1.jpg","title":"across the borderline export focus","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business The export market is booming in cross-border areas in and around Newry, but how will things change post-Brexit  Pavel Barter checks out the pulse of businesses in the region As the morning sun illuminates the shores of Carlingford Lough in Co Down, a team of workers carry bags of oysters from the water to the beach. They toss, turn, and grade the shellfish according to size, before ing them to the seabed. Across the Lough we can see the Cooley Peninsula and Co Louth. In the Brexit border debate, this is ground zero.Growing oysters takes three years, says Darren Cunningham, owner of Killowen Shellfish, and he exports stock every week. “It leaves on a Friday evening at around pm, and % is exported to France. It goes through Dublin and Rosslare to the top oyster buyer in Europe. The oysters are in purication tanks in France by Sunday evening. That’s how quick it is.” Carlingford Oysters then travel to restaurants in Paris and other European capitals. How is business  “Very good,” Darren says. “We sold nearly  tonnes of oyster last year. Two tonnes went to China and the rest to France.” Is there much competition  “Not for us. We’re the talk at the minute. We have the best stuff.”Darren and his team work next to Ballyedmond Estate, the family home of the late Edward Haughey, founder of Norbrook, one of the world’s leading veterinary pharmaceutical companies. If you travel further up the lough – past Warrenpoint, home to Northern Ireland’s second largest port – you will reach Newry, where Norbrook is based.Killowen Shellfish and Norbrook, which generated an operating profit of £.m in the year to August , are very dferent businesses, yet both speak the common language of exports. There are around , VAT registered businesses in the greater Newry area and many of them are accustomed to criss-crossing the border.“We have a number of major global players based here in Newry who supply goods across the world,” Colm Shannon, chief executive of Newry Chamber of Commerce and Trade says.He name-checks MJM Marine, a leader in the global marine industry, which employs  people in three offices across Europe. “Equally, we have a number of smaller companies who are involved in north-south trade. That’s usually the first step into the export market.”Exports are the essence of business for Re-Gen Waste, a Newry firm established in  by five siblings. Re-Gen began by recycling paper, cardboard, tin and plastics, before graduating to municipal waste and black bin waste. The family developed their own purpose-built facility in Newry, creating a business that generates millions. Its work is spread across Northern Ireland, the Republic and rest of the UK.According to John Doherty, a director at the business, Re-Gen “exports hundreds of tonnes across the border every day. We’re the fourth largest recycler in the Republic.” Its recycled products are exported to almost  countries around the globe. Re-Gen is not alone. Other successful Newry exporters include FM Environmental Group, which has offices in Malta and the Middle East. In , Newry’s BM Steel landed new business, in a deal worth £m, in the Netherlands and Great Britain. Around Noon, a producer of high-quality sandwiches, employs  people and has made acquisitions in Dublin and London. Newry-based construction firm mac-group is another all-island operation. In , it completed a £m refurbishment of River House, a -storey building in Belfast. Simultaneously, it was working the new Barclays headquarters in Dublin. “We employ over  people, across four dferent offices,” Brendan Moley, group interiors managing director at mac-group says. “The Newry office has  full time people. A lot of those staff members support projects in Dublin, London and Birmingham. There’s a lot of commuting back and forth across the border. We are trading in cross border services on a daily basis, but we’re also heavily involved in products and goods.”Although GB is Northern Ireland’s biggest external market, businesses in the Newry region are accustomed to cross border trade due to their geographical location. “We’ve always looked at Newry as being half way between Belfast and Dublin,” Brendan says. “You can get to Dublin Airport in  minutes from here. The talent available within the Newry market, in terms of some of staff, skill-set and knowledge, is extremely beneficial as well.”Some businesses fear that a hard border, in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, will cause delays. According to Darren Cunningham, only a few hundred lorries crossed the border every day in . That number is around , today. “A minute delay can knock everyone back hours,” he says. “My oysters can’t hold their breath forever. They’re a living creature. They only have a certain amount of time. The quicker they get to France, the better condition they’re in.”Re-Gen operates its own transport department. “Currently we send a lorry to Dublin twice in a day to collect materials,” John Doherty says. “If there is a delay at the border, you are likely require a second lorry. The cost of taking everything from the Republic to the north doubles.”Technology, such as unmanned border posts equipped with cameras, would be unlikely to solve the problem, suggests Brendan. “Any type of border control will impact business. Being from the border area myself, knowing how many crossings there are, I think it would be absolutely impossible to police it in any sensible way.”Newry businesses fear they will face mountains of costly paperwork post-Brexit. There may also be compliance issues, such as food traceability dficulties for food producers like Killowen Shellfish, construction product regulations for mac-group, or paper work for Re-Gen’s haulage drivers, whose Certicates of Professional Competencemay not be to be recognised in a post-Brexit EU. The Government has suggested imposing zero tarfs on goods from the EU in the event of no deal. Newry businesses believe this would put them at a competitive disadvantage. “The business community has expressed concerns that Northern Ireland will become a back door into the UK market for goods coming from the EU,” Colm Shannon says. “History tells you when you have iation of tarfs on the border, that’s an opportunity for smuggling.”Staff recruitment is another concern at Re-Gen, which has a -strong workforce. “We’re already finding it dficult to recruit staff,” John says. “Often, the people we’re hiring are seasonal and foreign workers. It’s the same for the agricultural industry, hotels...”But what about the arguments that a managed no-deal could be good for business  Firms would still have access to EU markets under WTO rules. Furthermore, the UK might strike lucrative trade deals in the years to come. Businesses around Newry are not buying this. Certainly not Norbrook, which has “an integrated supply chain, with a global supply base, which relies on frictionless trade,” according to Liam Nagle, the company boss.Uncertainty reigns for export businesses in the Newry area. “The chaotic nature in which this has been managed has restricted companies like ourselves from planning for the future,” Brendan Moley says. “It’s one  dawn after another.”Darren Cunningham, looking across the water to where Co Louth is starting to feel very far away, says: “A lot of people are in complete disbelief and don’t think it’s going to happen. I can’t get my head around it at all. That’s the truth.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jannine_1.jpg","title":"my day jannine waddell","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business Name: Jannine Waddell MBE Position: Managing director at Waddell Media .amMy alarm goes off and I instantly check the weatherand have a quick look at emails that have come in overnight.

Oh, and a deal on Brexit could be getting another outing, while outgoing Prime Minister Theresa May will soon leave the front of the political stage and a would-be successor taking up the reins of a stagecoachwhich has been out of control for months, and could still be heading for a ravine in the coming weeks. A potential deal of sorts should be going before the Commons again soon, in an attempt to get some form of plan in place to ensure the stability of the UK economy as a whole, and that trade can continue unabatedbetween Northern Ireland and the Republic. So, who’s in the running to take up the mantle from Theresa  As I write this, the bookies’ favourite is Boris. Yes, that Boris. The man who was one of the forerunners to the convoluted chaos we’ve now found ourselves in. I think the word chaos applies regardless of whether you voted Remain or Leave – what we’ve had to endure from the powers that be since the referendum in has been nothing short of an horrendous inability and incapability of showing leadership.

Aaron Taylor and former telecoms boss Scott Ritchie have joined forces to set up Northern Ireland’s first bespoke mail-order pet food business, Snack at Frank’s. The pampered pooch market is one which is booming – with around nine million dogs in the UK alone, and owners spending more than £ on food, snacks and clothing. Mr Taylor, one of the co-founders of the Ormeau Baths, has teamed up with Scott Ritchie, formerly of Connect Telecom to set up Snack at Frank’s – an e-commerce subscription service delivering “healthy and nutritious dog treats straight through your letterbox”. The pair have already raised £, in funding from angel investors and grown to a team of seven, but Mr Taylor says they are already planning to increase the workforce. “There’s a real community of dog owners and pet lovers online but it’s very fragmented,” he told Ulster Business. “Part of what we’re doing with Franks is to provide a space for pet parents to come together and interact with each other to get tips and advice on how to keep a healthy happy dog and how to make it a key part of the family.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
