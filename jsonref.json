Yet The Fate of Fausto (Harper Collins), “a painted fable”, as Jeffers describes it, feels like a fantastically fresh departure.Fausto is a pompous, pinstripe-suited man with a twirly moustache and a desire to own the natural world. “Tree, you are mine,” he shouts before moving on to the lake as the tree bows obediently. More spare in text and imagery than its predecessors, it’s a tale full of suggestion with expanses of white page wittily used as pregnant pauses and punctuation.In an age of exquisite picture books, this is possibly the most beautiful of the year. Made with traditional lithographic printmaking techniques, neon pink and yellow shades zing against an earthier palette of green, teal and brown. The aggressive, bullying Fausto is both timeless and utterly of our age (straight out of Westminster, you could say). As he fizzes with rage and makes demands even a toddler would find ridiculous, he’s also very funny. He’s last seen stepping out of his boat to stamp on the obstinate sea.Another fun ode to nature comes in the form of Joanna Rzezak’s 1001 Ants (Thames \u0026amp Hudson), a nonfiction book that feels more like a walk in the woods. Rather than pages heaving with text, we gather short facts about the countryside as ants march through it. So when the ants brush past a fern we learn that these plants are older than the dinosaurs and when they run into a snail, that its average speed is three inches a minute. Children will love trying to spot the ant in red socks featured on every spread.A thin skyscraper of a book, Small in the City by Sydney Smith (Walker) explores the sights, sounds and dangers of the modern metropolis as seen through a little protagonist’s eyes on a wintry day. Smith won the prestigious Kate Greenaway Medal last year for illustrating Town Is by the Sea, about a young boy in a seaside mining community, and he can conjure up a North American cityscape just as impressively – all gridded streets and buildings, traffic lights and crowds (Smith lives in Toronto). The narrator begins: “I know what it’s like to be small in the city... Construction sites pound and drill and yell and dig”, before offering advice about where to find comfort and make friends. Towards the end of the book, we learn who the advice is for, adding even more depth to this warm, sweet tale (it’s hard to resist immediately rereading).City living is also the subject of Felicita Sala’s debut picture book, Lunch at 10 Pomegranate Street (Scribe). Part biography of an apartment block’s inhabitants, part children’s recipe book, each highly evocative illustration depicts a different resident or family in their kitchen preparing a dish, with the instructions alongside. There’s Mister Ibrahim making baba ganoush who “remembers his childhood home and smiles” or young Maria who mashes avocados for guacamole. I was left longing for more meat on the story, but the book is a wonderful celebration of multiculturalism and food bringing people together. It’s also a unique way to encourage independent readers who are would-be cooks (it’s recommended for five-10-year-olds).• To order any of these books for a special price click on the titles, go to bookshop or call 0330 333 6846.

But nobody is listeningWe’ll easily cope,” breezes the no-deal prime minister. “This is a great, great country.” Indeed it is. Most inhabitants would certainly agree. But to love your country is not to think it greater than others, nor incapable of making grievous mistakes. Britain has not, as yet, made the fateful error of actually electing Boris Johnson and his cabinet of undesirables. Nor did it vote for a no-deal Brexit. But on he drives, accelerating towards the abyss.It’s that insouciant ignorance that drives businesses mad the devil-may-care fecklessness, ignoring the boring details. Andrea Leadsom, our improbable business secretary, writes in the Sunday  that she has met firms of all kinds and guess what? “They were overwhelmingly positive about our future.” She ends: “Britain’s best years for business and for all our people lie ahead.”Andrew Varga was driving along when he heard David Davis laughing on the Today programme as he expounded similar airy nonsense about the “trusted trader scheme” – goods checked in warehouses away from the border, all easy-peasy.“I was climbing the wall! Drives me to despair!” says Varga, managing director of Seetru, a Bristol manufacturer of industrial safety valves. Perhaps Leadsom has only met happy businesses by refusing to hear from those like Varga, a Cambridge engineering PhD, who has failed to find a hearing with any branch of government for the inconvenient facts from companies like his.“My local Tory MP, Michelle Donelan, wouldn’t come to the factory: when I saw her in her surgery she couldn’t get rid of me fast enough.” Labour MPs have listened and visited but no Tory to date. At a large meeting with Suella Braverman, then Brexit minister, she parroted the usual empty phrases: “trusted trader” and “WTO rules”. Since 2016 he has been trying to raise the alarm, but “no one wants to know”. He wrote to the prime minister, who passed it on to Steve Baker, then at the Department for Exiting the European Union, but got a useless stock reply.At 11pm UK time on 31 October the UK would, by default, become a “third country” in terms of relations with the EU, with no post-Brexit plan in place, and no transition period. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the £39bn orce payment.The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports – making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO ‘most favoured nation’ rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.WTO rules only cover goods – they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK’s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to ten years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement (FTA) is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally – the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK’s trading relationship.The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azevêdo, has told Prospect magazine that in simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none.Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses – eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a ‘managed’ no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.This is not just about the bottom line. There are emotional shocks too. “Our EU customers were our friends, but there was a sudden chill after 2016. I hear antagonism, nationalism rising, as if we are ‘other’ and not one of them any more. My people are upset by conversations with old customers who say: ‘You bloody Brits! You’re ruining everything, and we’re not going to pay the extra duty.’” His office staff are remainers, but the factory floor is split in half. “Everyone tiptoes around each other or it gets too heated. The Brexiters are aggressive, the remainers creep into their shell.”His father praised 1972’s entry into the common market. “Fantastic. Overnight just one gold standard for every product exported to every European country instead of a plethora of kite marks.” When Brexiters castigate EU regulations, “they have no idea how good they are for us”. Varga is a “congenitally liberal Tory, but I can no longer support that party”.Talk to others in quite different trades and the crescendo of despair rises as “do or die” day nears. Chris Slowey, head of Manfreight, a hauliers in Northern Ireland with 300 employees and 120 indirect jobs, lists just some of the crises ahead: they take Kerry Foods from the Republic to places like Leeds, but with a no deal “taking just one quiche across the border needs three vet certificates, for the milk, the ham and the eggs. That’ll take five times more vets and they’re short already.”All three of these very different businesses make the same complaint. No one listens. They can’t get the ear of any ministers. No one wants to know what Brexit is doing already, or the devastation no deal will cause to companies like theirs. They warn that bogus reassurances about the UK’s preparedness will come unstuck. Lorry delays at ports may be sorted within weeks, but Varga says his problems are mostly “frog-boilers” – the steady loss of customers that has started already. Why hasn’t business shouted louder from day one? He tried, but others took fright in the face of hostile press coverage. He says businesses were warned that pro-leave customers would turn their back on products from companies that spoke out against Brexit.What these businesspeople share is sheer incredulity at what is happening, at politicians charging ahead deliberately remaining ignorant of the damage done. Expect the mighty £138m public information campaign to be empty propaganda. HMRC promises to contact “every known trader”, but why bother when they refuse to hear what they’d rather not know? Gordon Brown rightly calls for parliament to hold an independent inquiry into the consequences of a no-deal withdrawal, as Keir Starmer and the former head of the civil service Lord Kerslake demand that MPs be given all the facts.The prime minister threatens not to honour our EU debts, which would guarantee that no free trade deal could ever be signed. But, he says, none of this is for parliament to decide. As we head towards the cliff-edge, it seems only this most cavalier and feckless of prime ministers is allowed to “take back control”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87f54347889ce8766a1f7b15b91a24717f682529/891_97_3069_1842/master/3069.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a71402d7f1b18c27ad59170c88e4910d","title":"second referendum labour no deal revoking article 50","story":"The anti-no-deal politicians meeting today need to find a way to work together – and Labour will have to compromiseYou can tell there’s a general election coming, because that’s the subtext to everything else that happens. Boris Johnson uses the G7 summit to grandstand to the domestic tabloids. Meanwhile the fractious coalition of anti-no-deal forces meets today to try and form a coherent plan to stop Britain crashing out of the EU – and to force an election.If the object was to fight no deal through parliamentary process, the only people you would need in the room would be Dominic Grieve and Keir Starmer, with maybe somebody taking notes for John Bercow. But today’s get-together, convened last week by Jeremy Corbyn, is as much about a general election, which few people now doubt will happen sooner rather than later. Given that, it would have been better to enter the room in the spirit of anticipated unity, rather than publicly set out your red lines beforehand, as Jo Swinson has done. She reportedly wrote a letter to Corbyn yesterday, arguing that his insistence on leading a temporary government of national unity would be likely to scupper a vote of no confidence in the government.One of the many things I look forward to, at the end of this whole ignominious business, is the prospect of politicians finally ceasing to flaunt their inflexibility as if it were a virtue. Because it isn’t.Yet if Corbyn, Swinson and co can recognise a few elemental truths about their predicament, the meeting today could yet deliver something invaluable to those of us outside it: hope.All remain parties and actors need to stop performing their oppositional moves and accept as an inevitability that they have to work together. Labour historically, and Jeremy Corbyn personally, have shown no aptitude or enthusiasm for progressive alliances, but the leader of the opposition must recognise that activists and members are going to work together regardless, as they did in 2017 (and as they did in 1997). There is a very plain advantage to be had for both Labour and the Liberal Democrats from reaching an understanding (the Greens stand to gain the least, I would guess Caroline Lucas, fortunately, doesn’t fight for her own or her party’s collective ego).According to yet-to-be-published projections made by Best for Britain, of the 150 marginals across England and Wales where a remain alliance could make the difference, in 111 the numbers dictate that the Lib Dems swing behind Labour. The benefit to Labour is obvious. For Swinson, 40-odd seats would still represent a massive uptick in her party’s fortunes.Remainers on the centre-right, who are currently cleaving to what’s been called the Meatloaf stance (“I’d do anything for Europe, but I won’t make Jeremy Corbyn prime minister”) have to think more deeply about their objections. Whatever threat Corbyn may pose to capitalism, it is as nothing compared to the threat from vulture capitalists and high priests of disruption and chaos emptying their pots of cash into Dominic Cummings’ cauldron.If the danger represented by this government bore any relation to its competence, we’d have nothing to worry about. But the disunity of the forces opposing it is giving it a potency it does not deserve. We will only haul ourselves out of this nightmare period when the politics of solidarity and co-operation wrests the controls from the politics of delinquency and destruction. That has to start in this meeting. There’s a good argument for them all to smoke a joint before they go in.It is also increasingly clear that Labour has an additional challenge of its own: the party needs to pivot to “revoke”. Not as a peace offering to the other parties, but because it’s the only position that now makes sense. The idea of a Labour-negotiated deal, which protects workers’ rights, drives forward international cooperation on the environment, and maintains the EU as our major trading bloc, while differing meaningfully from membership of the EU, is fanciful. A second referendum, meanwhile, is pointless given that any general election will, itself, function as one: the Brexit parties are there for Brexiteers to vote for. Of course, if a government of national unity itself chose to revoke article 50, then arguably that would create a democratic deficit. But if, in the context of an election, the country is asked point blank whether it wants to leave or revoke, no such crime against the will of the people has been perpetrated.The Conservatives and the Brexit party are making the vast unsubstantiated promise that a combination of grit, optimism and tech will solve every problem associated with Brexit. Some of us spend our time wondering why these arguments hold fast against any evidence to their contrary why they’re so immune to reality and reason. But Labour now needs to make a vast promise of its own: revoke. In that moment, Brexit will be revealed for what it is – a civil war embroiling all of us that should have stayed within the confines of the Conservative party, where it belonged.Boris Johnson and Cummings will not be waiting with bated breath to see if a vote of no confidence prevails. They will have their decision tree, with a general election on one branch, a no-deal Brexit on the other it all leads ultimately to the polling booth, and all who oppose them should be ready for an election on the first possible date: 17 October, six weeks after parliament reassembles. And readiness is not a reheating of Facebook ads and leaflets with slightly-too-complicated promises it is a united promise to revoke, from allies who put their nation ahead of their tired hostilities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/103b3110cecd4cb87edba873573fc606e92f7439/75_0_2197_1318/master/2197.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75261f15fe1abe18eab41d0d4e5a684b","title":"serengeti wildlife documentaries natural world","story":"We are watching the raw majesty of the natural world being smothered to death by human emotionThe BBC wildlife series Serengeti is an odd duck. If you haven’t seen it, it’s a dramatisation of a wildlife show. Masterminded by Pop Idol creator Simon Fuller, it contains real wildlife footage that’s been shaped into narratives by writers. Multiple animals represent the same character. John Boyega is credited as a “storyteller” rather than a “narrator”. My colleague Rebecca Nicholson called Serengeti “the Made in Chelsea of nature docs” for good reason. To watch it is to watch the raw majesty of the natural world being smothered to death by human emotion.This weekend, the show was hit by accusations that it inserted a composite shot of a zebra being swept down a river to heighten the drama of a scene. Serengeti is a bold experiment into humanity’s tolerance of anthropomorphism. If it had worked, similar tactics could have been used to heighten awareness of the climate emergency, maybe by letting James Corden provide the voice of a glacier as it crumbles into the sea. But it doesn’t work. It’s really weird.The incredible thing about wildlife documentaries is how invested you become in the subjects. I had such a visceral reaction to the Blue Planet 2 sequence where a marine iguana ran for its life from a teeming horde of snakes that I almost burst into tears when I saw one in a conservation park a couple of months ago. And, yes, that series benefited from beautiful photography, snappy editing and a pounding Hans Zimmer score, but it still managed to capture something as elemental as the frantic struggle for survival. That’s what viewers respond to – not a vague sensation that they are watching an episode of Hollyoaks Pets.Seagulls are awful. They have managed to get away with it for years, but now one of them has attacked beloved children’s entertainer Dave Benson Phillips, the public has reached a tipping point. There is serious talk of a cull. “Let local communities take action against the fat, aggressive urban sods,” John Woodcock MP said recently.Frankly, seagulls have brought this on themselves. It isn’t enough that they ebomb pensioners for their chips they also have the temerity to look and sound like characters from an ill-advised Pixar film about birds that enter the violent world of football hooliganism. Never has an animal been more in need of a makeover.

With awards split between longtime pop dominator Taylor Swift and the very 2019 star Lil Nas X, it was perhaps fitting that the night’s top honor celebrated the genre- and era-defying musical work of Missy Elliott.Swift opened the show with two singles from her new album Lover: the technicolor trailer park-themed You Need To Calm Down, and return-to-form acoustic track Lover. The colorful performance kicked off a big night for Swift, who took home Video of the Year for You Need To Calm Down: a song pitched as an LGBTQ anthem for Pride Month. In her acceptance speech, she pointed to the Equality Act, for which the video solicited petitions. “By voting for this video, you showed that you want a world where everyone is treated equally,” she said. Swift also took home the trophy for the “Video for Good” category.The night’s other major winner was Lil Nas X, whose genre-smashing hit Old Town Road spent a record-breaking 19 weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100, and took home the award for song of the year. “This is my first award ever,” he said as he unrolled a person-sized scroll as his “speech” – causing Lizzo to nearly drop her diamond-encrusted tequila.After the notable no-shows of 2018’s event, this year’s VMAs went deep on the talent bench, with performances from newer acts such as H.E.R. alongside veterans including Miley Cyrus, who performed Slide Away: a song released earlier this month, just days after news broke of her split from Liam Hemsworth.The MTV Video Music Award ceremony (VMAs) are an annual award show for music promo videos run by the music cable channel in the US. First held in 1984, as well as an award for the overall best video, there are awards in various music genre and for technical aspects of video production.Over the years the award show has seen several notable controversies, including in 2015 when Nicki Minaj and Miley Cyrus clashed on stage, and in 2009 when Kanye West interrupted Taylor Swift receiving her award to declare that \u0027Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time\u0027.To date the most successful artists in VMAs history are Beyoncé with 24 wins, Madonna with 20, and Lady Gaga and Peter Gabriel with 13 each. Gabriel set the record for the most wins in one night, when in 1987 the video for Sledgehammer won 9 awards, and Gabriel also picked up an award as a video pioneer.\u0026nbspThe music largely overshadowed host Sebastian Maniscalco, a 36-year-old Italian-American comedian who MC’d the event after last year’s VMAs went without a host. Following a muted introduction seemingly aimed at the dads – in which he admonished the kids to put away their phones, joked about MTV offering a “safe space” (“If you feel triggered or offended they’re providing a safe space backstage where you’ll get some stress balls and a blankie,” he said), and ensured everyone knew there were no participation trophies – Maniscalco was largely quiet for the rest of the night.Instead, the spotlight belonged to Missy Elliott, who received the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard award. The hip-hop icon earned the loudest cheers of the night and a standing ovation for her performance of hits – including Supa Dupa Fly, Get Ur Freak On, Work It and Lose Control – which was, in the words of presenter Cardi B, “FIRE.”“Nobody deserves to be the Video Vanguard more than Missy,” Cardi B said in an introduction for Elliott that highlighted the Virginia native’s influence on songwriting, fashion and, of course, music videos.In her acceptance speech, Elliott was visibly emotional: “I have worked diligently for over two decades and I never thought I would be standing up here receiving this award,” she said . She name-checked her video influences (Busta Rhymes, Janet Jackson, Peter Gabriel and Madonna), offered a tribute to Aaliyah (who died 18 years ago on Sunday) and celebrated “the dance community all around the world”.“This is the next generation,” she said, bringing out her youngest dancers, “and I promise y’all – I love y’all with all my heart.”Despite the choice of host, the next generation emerged as a theme of the night, with several performances illustrating the dominant global, meme-able, Spanish-seeking forces in music. Barcelona native Rosalia performed in Spanish, and took home the award for best Latin video Colombia native J. Balvin and Bad Bunny, of Puerto Rico, performed their hit Qué Pretendes in a 3D-accentuated emoji playland and former Fifth Harmony member Normani had a breakout performance of her dance showcase single Motivation.In a nod to the feverish coverage of their summer romance, Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello performed a teasing, nose-to-nose rendition of their duet Señorita. The couple topped favorites Lil Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus for best collaboration. Other winners included Jonas Brother’s Sucker for best pop, Cardi B’s Money for best rap, Billie Eilish for best new artist and an absent Ariana Grande for best artist.In the end, the final star of the night was New Jersey, the oft-second fiddle to New York which hosted the VMAs for the first time. In what frontman Joe Jonas called a “Jersey dream”, the Jonas Brothers – originally from Wyckoff, New Jersey – received their award from three stars of the Sopranos and the show closed with a tour of the state’s contributions to hip-hop, featuring New Jersey natives Ice-T (born in Newark), Fetty Wap, Naughty by Nature, Wyclef Jean, Lords of the Underground, Redman and Queen Latifah."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58f222e5571d6f91733c35f75f089f52c68f8afb/0_0_2800_1680/master/2800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d81ec1b8ac555b5bb0288b8861ba7445","title":"ugly kid joe how we made everything about you","story":"‘We used helium-filled sex dolls in the video. One broke loose and planes landing at the local airport could see it in the sky’I was in my last year of high school. Glam rock and pop rock were huge. Bon Jovi and the Scorpions were doing all their big ballads and it seemed like every frickin’ song was about love or sex. Y’know: “Chicks are rad, sex is rad.”I wanted the guitar solo to have that blues vibe, a little bit of Chuck Berry and CC DeVille from Poison. Writing it was easy, but then I had to recreate it. It’s so simple that, if you make a mistake, it’s very obvious. Every now and then, I’d miss that last note live and it was like: “Oh man, that was my moment and I screwed it up!”The record company wanted to choke us: “Please put hot chicks in your videos!” But we weren’t that kind of band. We made the video on a beach in Isla Vista, California. There were these two stray dogs running around and pissing on the drums. The director – Thomas Mignone – had this crazy idea to have all these floating blow-up sex dolls. They filled them with helium, but it turned out the plastic was too heavy, so they had to buy a bunch of balloons and tie them on to the dolls. The string broke on one of them – and I heard a news story about planes coming into the local airport and spotting this blow-up doll up in the sky.When you get overexposed on one song, it definitely has a backlash. We got a lot of flak for being this obnoxious joke band. But at the same time, hits open up doors. Everything About You made us almost a household name, almost overnight.I was young and I looked up to Klaus. When he played me the demo of Everything About You on a little analogue tape, I was excited that he was showing me something because it meant I could maybe be in a band with him. Back then, I was more than cynical – I was downright negative – and every line made me laugh. The song had humour. We were, like, the last “smile” band to get through the door before grunge came and decimated everybody.But I remember thinking, “It’s not heavy enough.” I wanted to be in Black Sabbath or Judas Priest. Everything About You didn’t necessarily sound like that. There was another song on the album called Mr Record Man that I made Klaus sing, and Everything About You went through a moment in time when I didn’t want to sing it either. But Klaus said, “Will you please just sing it?” and I’m like, “All right, all right …”I wrote the rap outro because we wanted to be Red Hot Chili Peppers – of course we’ll never be that cool. It sounds like I made that rap up on the spot – and I think I did. I wasn’t experienced enough to know where I wanted to take the song’s vocal. I was a good live singer, but I was scared of the microphone and the studio. When we made Everything About You, the record label weren’t expecting much of us, which gives you a lot of freedom. For the song’s intro, before the music starts, we got the comedian Julia Sweeney do a spoken-word sketch as Pat, her character from Saturday Night Live. I don’t know where the “shave and a haircut” riff at the end of the song came from. I think we were mocking the world. We were always a weird band, and I think we still are.But once the song blew up, the label wanted to grab hold of us and turn me into Bon Jovi II – and that’s when there was friction. Back in 1995, I wouldn’t play Everything About You live, because I wanted to prove myself as a heavy, badass rock’n’roll singer. Now, there’s a lot of water under the bridge, and it’s interesting to see the joy our old songs such as Everything About You bring. It’s a song that has gone around the world, and pays the electricity bill, thank God.• Whitfield Crane tours the UK, 4-18 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5bd2f4ebbce4c9220d7c0be6f763938209dc395f/462_636_7280_4370/master/7280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a737cb1aa6e4dee9fa753369ea65a96","title":"britain most influential teaching expert","story":"He’s the most popular educator on UK Twitter, with more than 200,000 followers. His blog tops a staggering 10 million readers and he’s one of the 500 most influential people in Britain, according to Debrett’s. He has also written three bestselling books on teaching and is about to publish a fourth.Ross Morrison McGill, a former deputy headteacher, is an education entrepreneur but he is no Lord Sugar. He is not motivated by the profit margin but by a love of teaching and frustration at the way schools are being treated, especially by the organisation he will refer to only as the Grim Reaper in his latest book. “I firmly believe that Ofsted – the Grim Reaper – can and does end the careers of senior leaders. It has happened to me twice,” he explains.His mission is to inspire teachers and senior leaders to take things into their own hands, helping them to use the findings of research and best practice to do what they believe is best for their pupils. He wants to equip them to challenge policymakers when they get it wrong. He knows it is hard to do, but he wants schools to free themselves from the straitjacket of accountability measures that he views as toxic and against the interests of children, especially those from tough and disadvantaged backgrounds.This modern-day “edupreneur” speaks in flat northern tones and has an endearing habit of fondling his chin, like a puzzled professor. He doesn’t boast or dissemble and makes you feel that what you see is what you get, unusual in today’s highly politicised public arena with its emphasis on presentation and media training.He’s grateful that, at the age of 45, after losing his job twice – first through taking redundancy and then through resignation after what he claims was “an unfair and inaccurate” Ofsted report – he is now able to make as much as he earned as a deputy head through his website, Teachertoolkit, and his books, teacher training and speeches.McGill had an unusual upbringing that he says influenced his decision to work in schools serving areas where children are most likely to be disadvantaged by home circumstances or special needs. Both his parents worked in social services for the Salvation Army and the family moved frequently, living in facilities for young offenders, drug addicts, homeless people and those suffering from mental illnesses. He started school in Scotland and ended up in Blackpool via Newcastle upon Tyne and Tonypandy in the Welsh valleys.Last year he surprised his many followers when he disclosed that he had stayed silent for 32 years about the sexual abuse he suffered as a 13-year-old. “It took me through my teenage years to realise that what happened wasn’t normal. When you are sexually abused it takes you a long time to process what has happened,” he says.At university and through his 20s and 30s he blurred it out but it would come up again, usually in the summer vacation. Recently, as his travels increased, he has had more time to think about the past. “I’d be on the road and hear something on the radio and it would bring it up and I might shed a little tear but I didn’t want to tell my mother because I didn’t want her to feel at all responsible.“I wrote letters to my mother and never posted them.I’ve been in rooms with her but never had the courage. But I’ve got older and wiser and my mum is 74 – my dad died suddenly of septicemia at the age of 62 – and when I heard other people, footballers, speaking out about being abused in their youth it gave me confidence. In February last year I reported it to the police and then told my mother and she was very supportive. I had built it up too much,” he recalls.The disclosure in a blogpost on his site raised awareness about male sexual abuse and he continues to wear the green #WeSeeYou badge in support of the campaign to break the stigma of male sexual abuse. More than 100 people got in touch with him with their stories and many more to thank him for highlighting the importance of safeguarding procedures to help teachers support vulnerable children.McGill lives in north London with his wife, also a teacher, who has given up her job to help with the website, and their eight-year-old son. He travels to schools across the UK and abroad collecting knowledge about what works and analysing research into teaching and learning, especially the latest neurological findings on how the brain accumulates and retains information. “I’ve just come back from China this week and now I’m off to Switzerland because I’m starting to work with schools internationally, which is giving me a global perspective,” he says.His new book, Just Great Teaching, due out next week, includes 50 practical ideas for tackling the key issues teachers face, such as workload, marking and assessment, planning, behaviour, teacher wellbeing and student mental health.It was 10 years ago, as a design and technology teacher, that he started blogging as Teacher Toolkit, offering tips and advice. He spoke up for the profession and highlighted injustice and harmful initiatives.In 2015, he was named as the “most followed” teacher on Twitter as @TeacherToolkit. That year he made the Times list of 500 most influential people in Britain, organised by Debrett’s, the only state school teacher on the list.In those days he worked as a deputy head at Quintin Kynaston, a large comprehensive in Westminster, London, which he joined in 2014 after Ofsted judged it to be in need of improvement. When the inspectors returned in 2017, however, they decided things had got worse and rated the school as inadequate. “It was a school in a tough area doing good things and we had already achieved a lot in just over two years but then five inspectors came in, walked around, talked to a few people and then said ‘you are shit’,” he says.Ofsted used wrong Department for Education data to measure pupil progress, he claims. He contends the objective was to fail the school so it could be taken over by a multi-academy trust (Mat). Despite serving some of the most disadvantaged children in London, the report admits that the school was inclusive, with a much lower than average rate of fixed-term exclusions, especially of those from disadvantaged backgrounds.“It was a risk to leave my job and a regular salary but my blog was already making money so I thought, why stay at the school when it is taken over by a Mat, and be bullied and made to work 80 hours a week doing things I don’t agree with?” he says.But given that he was a senior leader of a school declared inadequate, is he qualified to give advice to others, I wonder? “I’ve experienced at least nine Grim Reaper inspections throughout my career,” he says without missing a beat. “I have always done the same thing, regardless of the school I was in, and yet I received all the badges, from outstanding to special measures.” He argues that Ofsted fails to recognise many of the social and economic factors dominant outside the gates that schools have very little power to change.Though he doesn’t rule out a return to teaching one day, he is enjoying life. And now he’s able to reach thousands of teachers and schools and highlight key issues, such as the chronic underfunding of schools. “I’m on the side of the underdog,” he says. “It’s in my blood, and I hope I am making a difference.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a3074001a2202f86247ac51034088c4b6b8e0d8/0_239_6192_3715/master/6192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bac72b4483571f2d791fd3ec447e4e01","title":"extreme makeup girls boys generation z new subculture","story":"Many young people now spend hours in their bedrooms, perfecting extraordinarily intricate looks to put up online ‘It’s literally art!” exclaims 16-year-old Milly Provenzano, sitting cross-legged on her single bed. Her eyeshadow is like the plumage of a tropical bird: blue, pink and yellow, to match the rainbow lettering on her Pride T-shirt. On the wall above her, Provenzano has taped up photographs of her favourite Instagram makeup stars: drag artist Hungry, famed for transforming Björk into a vagina-flower hybrid for the cover of her Utopia album, and Antoinette Mahr, whose trademark multicoloured style was clearly the inspiration for Provenzano’s look today. I have asked the teenager from Kettering, Northamptonshire, to justify the many hours she spends alone in her room, perfecting fabulously complicated makeup looks. “That’s like saying to someone who does A-level art and is painting all the time, ‘Oh you shouldn’t be doing that, you should be doing something more academic.’ It’s just art, but it’s on your face.”Pulling out her phone, Provenzano shows me a list of makeup looks she would like to master. Her inspirations are erse and obscure. “I’d really like to do an Error 404-inspired look,” she muses. “You know when something glitches online? It’s mainly black and white, but also green and red.” I browse the list – what does the “eyebrow slits … but everywhere” entry mean? “I’ve already done that one!” she says. “I’d just given myself an eyebrow slit, and I woke up in the middle of the night and thought, why not do it everywhere on my face? So I got a tiny brush and concealer, and drew lines through my makeup.”Provenzano shows me a photo. Her eyes are orange. Her cheeks are a garish pink. There are thin lines down her face, as if her makeup has been stencilled around them. It is enormously impressive. After she finished the look, Provenzano uploaded a picture to Instagram, then washed the makeup off. “Sometimes I keep it on if I really like it,” she shrugs. “Then a few hours later, I’ll take it off.”Once, young people used makeup as visual code to gain admittance into different subcultures: black lipstick for goths, winged eyeliner for punks. Now, makeup is a subculture all of its own. In communities centred around Instagram and YouTube, young people gather virtually to look for inspiration, swap product tips and master tricky techniques. They often come to makeup through superstar vloggers such as NikkieTutorials (12.2m subscribers), Jeffree Star (15.6m subscribers) and James Charles, who boasts 15.9m subscribers, despite a series of scandals, one of which involved his former mentor releasing a 45-minute video claiming he had pressured heterosexual men to go out with him (claims he denied in another video), temporarily losing him millions of followers.In this community, your face is a canvas for incongruous, dreamlike, wearable art. All you need is some pocket money and a smartphone. But what is fascinating about this new subculture is that it is not taking place in crowded moshpits or twilit parks, but quietly in bedrooms. “I don’t go out much,” says Provenzano. “My friends come here or we go to their houses … but we don’t really go places.”Aiman Sheeraz, a 17-year-old from Manchester, says: “My favourite skill is blending. This is what YouTube has taught me – to blend my life away.” Sheeraz got into beauty because of her mum, who loved makeup. “We’d watch Asian bridal makeup tutorials and try to recreate them together. Looking back at the pictures, they were so horrific!”After her mum died two and a half years ago, Sheeraz started doing makeovers on her family and friends, posting the results online. “I thought, why not get my talent out there?” At first, Sheeraz did the makeup thing to honour her mum. But soon it took on a life of its own. “It was never what I wanted to do full-time,” says Sheeraz, who is studying for an apprenticeship in accountancy. “It’s more something to do on her behalf and make her happy. But now I really enjoy it myself. I guess I’m doing it for her in a way.”As with any subculture, there are different tribes. Fans tend to ide into two camps: the first are lovers of the haute-glam look popularised by the Kardashian-Jenners and makeup artists such as Mario Deanovic and Kevyn Aucoin. Sheeraz falls into this category, describing her style as “Asian glam”: “a very glowy base, full coverage, bright lips and eyes, but also something that you can wear to weddings and events – it won’t just look nice in pictures.” Meanwhile, creative makeup fans prefer art-driven, colourful looks. “With creative makeup there aren’t many rules, you can do what you want,” says Niamh Dunne, a 19-year-old supermarket worker from Corby, Northamptonshire. Dunne takes inspiration from films or TV shows such as Stranger Things. After the Lion King reboot came out, she freehand-painted the amber and ochre colours of an African sunset on her chest. It took three hours.Critics may say that young people shouldn’t be messing around with blusher – they should be focusing on their careers. But this is wildly missing the mark: beauty is a very lucrative career choice. Just ask Kylie Jenner, who built a billion-dollar fortune off the back of her cosmetics company (although sales are rumoured to be down). Of the 80 women on Forbes’s so-called “self-made women” rich list this year, 10 are from the makeup and skincare industries.Sheeraz wants to become like her idol, the beauty mogul Huda Kattan. “Being a woman of colour and getting to where she is from being an average person is really inspirational to me.”I wonder if any of the teens think it may be damaging to be so focused on their appearance. They all bat those concerns away. “Most of the time I’m actually barefaced,” Sheeraz says. “When I go to work, I don’t wear it, because I’d rather spend the time sleeping.” Dunne agrees: “With teenage girls, there is so much pressure on the way you look – getting surgery and lip fillers and all of that stuff,” she says. “I don’t think it should be like that. I don’t wear it because I think I need it. I wear it because I enjoy doing it.”It is not just girls who are perfecting makeup techniques you’ve never heard of, such as halo brows or lollipop lips. Brands such as Milk Makeup and Fluide have created genderless cosmetics ranges, while legacy players including Chanel and Givenchy have launched male lines. They are targeting consumers like 17-year-old Matt Tierney. “I remember sneakily telling my mum I had a Halloween party to go to when I was 14, so we could go to Superdrug and buy some makeup. She asked, ‘Are you sure this is for Halloween?’” He laughs. Through YouTube, Tierney built up the confidence to experiment with makeup. “If I didn’t see people doing it online, I’d never have gotten into it. I live in a little village in Northamptonshire. I’ve never seen anyone walking around with a rainbow eye or in drag. You don’t see that here.”Of course, marketing makeup to men doubles the amount of product brands can sell. And there is no doubt that consumerism is at the heart of this subculture – to an alarming extent. Provenzano takes me to her local Superdrug. “If I’m in town, I’ll come in to have a look,” she says, fingering a yellow Revolution eyeshadow lovingly. (Provenzano favours affordable brands – although she has a few high-end eyeshadow palettes by the US brand Lime Crime – that aren’t tested on animals.) Makeup influencers such as Jaclyn Hill have landed themselves in trouble with their young fanbases over the quality of their products – in one case, her lipstick was said to contain metal shards. Tierney bought the James Charles x Morphe palette after seeing it hyped online. “I didn’t think it was that great, to be honest. Maybe everyone saying it was amazing was on his payroll.”Regulators have started to step in. In the US, the Federal Trade Commission wrote to high-profile influencers to warn them against “stealth shilling”, where they fail to disclose they are being paid by brands. Earlier this year, the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority secured formal commitments from celebrities to be more transparent about paid-for endorsements.Even then, young people may not be able to recognise when their favourite online makeup artists are pushing products because they are paid to advertise them. “What we see in the research is that they don’t really recognise the advertising in vlogs or on Instagram as advertising, as much as they do on TV,” warns Steffi de Jans of Ghent University. She characterises most beauty vlogs as effectively advertising: the vloggers are either being paid by the brand directly, or receiving free products. And this isn’t just a 30-second cereal advert in a commercial break. “It’s hours and hours in a row of advertising messages, and they’re really engaging with it.”Subcultures have always been consumer-adjacent: you buy records, safety pins, miniskirts. But the act of consumerism isn’t peripheral to this emerging beauty subculture – it’s integral to it. This is consumerism as subculture. Sheeraz estimates she has spent about £1,000 on products from brands including Anastasia Beverly Hills and Huda Beauty, whose palettes retail for £40 to £60. Can a community that is so predicated on consumer consumption truly be considered a subculture?Probably not, says Dr Rehan Hyder of the University of the West of England, explaining that it is better to think of these teenagers according to the concept of creative fandom, as coined by academic Henry Jenkins. “Fans aren’t just consumers, but producers. They’re not participating passively, but creating a community in which you share expertise, skills and collective intelligence.” In the beauty world, they use makeup to establish themselves as persons of influence and skill – like Tierney, who aims to achieve 100k followers. “That would be a massive milestone,” he says.As teenage pursuits go, however, it is hard to think of a more clean-living way for young people to be spending their time – a bottle of shoplifted vodka being passed around a park this is not. “I’m not really a going-out person,” says Dunne. “You just get hungover and can’t be productive the next day.” Tierney thinks that makeup gives young people something to do. “It’s quite wholesome,” he laughs. “People who have no lives, sitting in their room with a ring light on, blending makeup on their eyes!” (He recently got one of these lights himself.)Ring lights, contour kits, an arsenal of brushes to make Picasso blush: for teenagers today, makeup isn’t a superficial hobby, but a way of expressing their creativity, hopes and dreams. Back in her bedroom, Provenzano does my makeup while telling me about her ambitions for the future – she aspires to be a makeup artist for fashion shows. “Going to London,” she says dreamily, eyeshadow brush in hand. “The fashion weeks – Milan, London, Paris. Obviously I can’t stay in Kettering and do runways, because it’s so small.” And as she applies my eyeshadow with precision of a surgeon performing keyhole surgery, I close my eyes and think: “You’ll get there.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8edbefe5c84078c5137770c1ee4afaf7a1ab0615/0_1560_5769_3460/master/5769.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46df9d519ab34a39eb689fc7a7cc85fc","title":"thomasina miers recipe piperade baked eggs chorizo","story":"A rich, savoury dish guaranteed to hit the spot after a long day – or a late nightWe went camping in the Pyrenees last summer. The food was simple but delicious, and this was a dish that really hit the spot after a long day of walking.We recreated it in our campervan later on in the holiday with some crispy chorizo that we bought at a local market. It makes a fine midweek supper dish and an even better brunch after a wild night out.The fennel and chorizo add incredible depth of flavour to an otherwise very simple supper or lunch dish.3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil100g chorizo, very thinly sliced1 large red onion, peeled and finely sliced3 large garlic cloves, peeled, 2 finely sliced, 1 left whole for rubbing1 tsp ground fennel seeds1½ tsp sweet smoked paprika1 red pepper, cut in half, deseeded and cut into ½cm-wide slices1 green pepper, cut in half, deseeded and cut into ½cm-wide slices5 large and juicy tomatoes, cut into rough 1cm cubes3 tbsp manzanilla sherrySalt and black pepper½ tsp soft brown sugar4-6 eggsSourdough bread, to serveWarm half the oil in a large frying pan (ideally with a lid) over a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the chorizo and fry for a few minutes, turning once, until golden and crisp. Remove and drain on kitchen paper.Keeping the fat in the pan, add the onion and cook for 10 minutes, until it is beginning to soften. Add the sliced garlic, fennel seeds and paprika and cook for a few more minutes, then stir in the peppers, tomatoes and sherry. Season well with salt and pepper, add the sugar and cook, uncovered, for 20-25 minutes, until you have a lovely, chunky sauce.Turn the heat down to medium-low, make four to six indents in the sauce and crack in the eggs. Season again, and either cover and cook on the hob or pop into a medium oven for about eight minutes, until the whites are just set (you can also do this under a grill).Take off the heat, spoon into bowls and scatter with the crisp chorizo. Serve with chargrilled slices of sourdough bread, rubbed with the whole garlic clove and drizzled with the remaining extra-virgin olive oil.Make double the quantity of sauce and keep some back in the fridge or freezer. It is great with sausages and lamb chops. Alternatively, try baking it with cubes of feta and lots of chopped oregano for an exceedingly good sauce for brown rice, or use it to top a pizza with black olives and more of that crispy chorizo."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3c60ef9ff4628d2da83137a7d0e2cef31349d20/0_0_3521_2114/master/3521.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6bcf16765cb1f67fa9c0365145ee2f3b","title":"premier league unpredictable manchester city liverpool stats","story":"So, if English football is travelling back in time, what does it mean? The short and simple answer is probably not a lot, other than you can throw a blanket over the majority of the clubs in the Premier League right now, so much so that Newcastle, who enjoyed a terrific win at Tottenham on Sunday, are second from bottom of the table and also one point off fifth.Watford, who are the only team without at least three points and already in danger of being cut adrift after losing their first three fixtures (said tongue-in-cheek, to be clear), travel to St James’ Park on Saturday for a meeting between the bottom two. An early relegation six-pointer. Or, depending on whether your glass of Newcastle Brown Ale is half full or half empty, a chance for Steve Bruce’s side to push for a place in the top six before the international break.That so many clubs are already up and running (there was only one previous occasion when 18 of the 20 Premier League clubs had registered a win at this stage), means the table has an unusually congested feel, even allowing for the fact we are talking about statistics after such a ridiculously small sample of games and at a time of the season when the kids haven’t even gone back to school.On the face of it the current state of play is no bad thing. Leaving aside the football accumulators that are being ruined, there appears to be much to welcome about the idea that Crystal Palace can win at Manchester United only six days after they lost at newly promoted Sheffield United, and that Newcastle, supposedly in crisis after being turned over by Norwich, can pick themselves up and vanquish Spurs, the Champions League runners up. After all, who wants predictability?The problem – if it is a problem – is higher up. Right at the top, in fact, where everything points to another two-horse race involving the same thoroughbreds who galloped clear last season. Yes, these are still very early days, but it already feels as though Liverpool and Manchester City are once again going to be playing in their own little league, largely because of their own brilliance but also as a result of the inadequacies of others.Indeed, neither club will have got too excited about Spurs struggling to break down Newcastle or Palace strolling through United’s expensively assembled new defence 24 hours earlier.The form of the top two is formidable. Liverpool’s win over Arsenal was their 12th in succession in the Premier League. City have taken 49 points out of the last 51, with the only blot on the copybook being the dramatic, VAR-dominated 2-2 draw at home against Spurs the weekend before last when the shot count was 30-3 in favour of Pep Guardiola’s team.Uncharacteristically, and much to the annoyance of Fantasy Football fans everywhere, Liverpool and City have been unusually generous in defence this season. Liverpool have conceded in each match and Harry Wilson’s brilliant free-kick for Bournemouth on Sunday means Ederson has already picked the ball out of the net three times for City.That is the good news for the chasing pack, if such a thing exists. The bad news is that Liverpool are averaging three goals per game at the other end of the pitch and City are just above that ratio. Perhaps most sobering is that neither City nor Liverpool have really got into their stride yet.In truth, the key question at the start of this campaign was less about how City and Liverpool would fare and more to do with whether the other members of that established “big six” could close the cavernous gap that opened up last season when Chelsea, in third place, finished 25 points behind Jürgen Klopp’s runners up.Reading a lot into a little is a dangerous game and, as Alan Hansen once discovered, August is no time to be writing off anyone’s chances. Equally, it really is hard to see much changing at the top in the near future, especially when Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United and Spurs have already lost as many games as Liverpool did in the whole of last season."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65eb759835ab6412d01108c2f3a161f9933f68a8/0_56_3888_2334/master/3888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53179c37bb04010505f289c94861619e","title":"kenya water hyacinth wonder source biofuel","story":"This invasive plant was reviled for clogging rivers but now it’s helping provide cleaner energy and protect healthIt is 9am on the shores of Lake Victoria’s Winam Gulf in Kenya’s Kisumu county. Tourists are arriving on the beach in droves, preparing to spend the day sunbathing and taking boat rides. Behind them, enormous marabou storks on spindly grey legs are pacing the beach, waiting for scraps.Nearby, a group of women scan the horizon, looking for the fishing boats that will soon arrive with their daily catch.But there’s something else on the horizon too, a sheet of water hyacinth pulled over the surface of the lake. The leaves of the floating plant extending like an oversized green shag carpet, rolling gently in the wind.Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), an aquatic plant native to South America, first appeared in countries in Africa in the early 1900s. Scientists there dubbed it the “world’s worst aquatic weed”, after it spread from the Cape in the early 1900s and started clogging up major dams and rivers.In east Africa, the nefarious invader arrived with Belgian colonists in Rwanda, who liked the look of its glossy leaves and delicate purple flowers floating in their garden ponds.But by the 1980s, it had slipped out of Rwanda via the Kagera river and made its way downstream to Lake Victoria.There, with no natural predators and perfect temperature conditions, the plant began gobbling up open space, choking off fishing routes and providing a new habitat for disease-carrying mosquitoes. But for women like Keita, it has meant dwindling income, as the boats that once brought silver lake fish to shore by the hundreds struggled to navigate the clogged waters.But water hyacinth isn’t her only headache. Like most women here, to smoke the fish she buys, Keita must gather huge quantities of firewood, sometimes walking as far as 10km each way to collect enough kindling to complete her work. And each day as she cooks, she breathes in the thick, grey woodfire smoke.“I have had chest complications a number of times in the last years,” says Keita, who is chairperson of the local fishmongers’ association.About three out of four families in Kenya depend on wood or charcoal to cook their daily meals, and the rate is even higher in rural areas, Kenya’s latest demographic and health survey shows.Using solid fuels like these for cooking increases indoor pollution. The World Health Organization estimates that about 14,300 Kenyans die annually from conditions linked to indoor air pollution – most of which is caused by cooking and heating sources, the most recent estimates released in 2009 show.Outside Keita’s home on the shores of Lake Victoria, piles of cleared water hyacinth left to rot were a common site. But buried in those decaying waxy leaves was a renewable energy gold mine.It turns out the floating plant isn’t just good at being abundant – its foliage also contains a high ratio of carbon to nitrogen. It’s a magic combination that has captivated researchers’ imaginations since as early as the 1980s when, across the world, they began to explore its potential as a biofuel. Just about 4kg of the dried plant was enough to cater for a large family’s daily energy needs, early research predicted.In 2014, Nigerian academics announced they had got better yields of the gas when they mixed the plant with sanitised chicken manure. A few years later, Kenyan scientists confirmed what their Nigerian peers and others had already found: animal dung worked to power charge the process of converting the weed into gas. In India, scientists took this idea and ran with it, mixing water hyacinth with the more famous Cannabis sativa, the same family of plants that marijuana comes from, as a proposed answer for periodic shortages of cow dung.In 2018, the technology came to Dunga promising a two-for-one solution to the dual menaces of the water hyacinth and dependence on firewood. The community received two donated biogas digesters – machines that would transform a mix of water hyacinth and cow dung into biogas for cooking, as well as material for other household tasks such as incubating chicks and purifying water.The “digesters” work a bit like a stomach. Food goes in one end – think of it as a mouth – and over the next 20 to 30 days, it ferments and breaks down, giving off gas that comes out the other end. From there, the clean-burning gas is piped to the point of use, just like traditional domestic gas.Kenya’s Biogas International company installed the stoves in partnership with the pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca and the University of Cambridge’s Institute for Sustainability.The project will test whether biogas can provide an effective alternative to firewood and charcoal in rural Kenyan communities.The programme is only months old but, anecdotally, it seems to be working. Keita says the members of her fishmongers’ association are already getting sick less often. And because they don’t have to devote hours a day to walking long distances to collect firewood, they’re making more money as well.Kanyiva Muindi is an epidemiologist and air pollution research fellow at the African Population and Health Research Centre in Nairobi. She says families who switch to the smokeless cooking method could expect fewer respiratory issues and even some forms of cancer because where there’s smoke, there’s PAHs – polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, a carcinogen released during burning of certain materials such as wood, corn cobs or cow dung, researchers recently reported.Women, young girls and children are particularly vulnerable because they spend so much time in the kitchen or outside over cooking fires. Worldwide, scientists are still exploring whether PAHs are linked to pockets of high rates of oesophageal cancer in the country.How much better the biogas stoves will be for the community’s health still needs more research, says Dominic Kahumbu Wanjihia, Biogas International’s chief executive. But unless the price of the digesters drops, it’s pretty clear that most communities will never be able to afford the machines, which sell for about $750.Kanyiva says affordability is a challenge worth addressing, given the huge health and environmental dangers posed by “dirty” fuels such as wood, charcoal and kerosene. If biogas could become affordable on a large scale, she says it “would be life-changing for millions on the African continent and beyond”.For Keita, meanwhile, one unexpected benefit of the stoves has been the way they have changed her view of water hyacinth. For years, she had regarded it as little more than a menace. But now, she says, “the hyacinth is becoming a useful resource!”"},{"url":null,"title":"guardian readers spend 25 hours phone screen time","story":"We received 500 answers from those unhappy with their screentime (10 hours a day!) to those who happily log just two minutesLast week, we’ve asked  readers to share their screentime with us. How long did they spent on their phone everyday? Did they think they controlled their phones, or that the phone controlled them?We received 500 responses and did the math: the average  reader seems to spend 2.5 hours staring at a screen each day.Among the lowest times is John, from Derby, who said his screen time average is a puny two minutes. He’d swap the time to boil an egg, instead he said, though “it would be a very soft one, though.”On the other end of the spectrum, some readers wrote to say they spent between eight and 10 hours a day (!) on their phone. (The responder, perhaps not surprisingly, asked to remain anonymous).Heavy users reported feeling stress and a foggy feeling when using certain social media apps. Overall there were 75 mentions of Instagram, 52 of Facebook, 41 of Twitter and 39 mentions of the  app (thanks for reading.)Of course, take those results with a grain of salt: this is a self selecting group.At six hours per day, Jessica Louise from Redhill says her average is affecting her relationship. “My partner often feels like there’s a screen between us”, she says. He wishes she could be more present while they’re watching movies at home. Yet, she is “awfully addicted to infantile games” like Candy Crush or Angry Birds.“What horrifies me is that I spend essentially a whole day on my phone each week” said Jennifer Corlington in Sitges, Spain. She is making an effort not to use her phone in front of her kids in an attempt to lead by example. “Either we’re with them or we’re on our phones but you can’t really do both,” she says.Ashleigh Young, from Wellington, says “I do the classic mindless, almost catatonic scrolling of Twitter and often it makes me feel stressed or just flat, so I have now deleted Twitter from my phone and just have it for my laptop, so it feels a bit more conscious.” She adds: “Maybe I should spend time differently, but then I’d have to face reality and that’s not a great option these days.”Mick Greer, from Saigon, said he has “no desire to learn the tuba or write the next great novel”, so he is not planning to change how he uses his one hour of daily screen time.Other responders were happy with their phone usage because they found their use of it was intentional, and spending four or five hours a day on it made sense to them.“Anyone who might judge a person for looking at their phone is clearly not thinking of the vast number of things they could be doing with it”, said Victoria from Swindon. Her daily eight hours helps improves her quality of life, as she trades messages and banters over Discord with her friends living abroad. Nightly guided meditations help her get to sleep at night, and music and games help her get trough a noisy commute.Then there are those who made the conscious choice to gear their use away from recreation — little to no fun, purely function.Natalie, from Birmingham, is embarrassed of her four hour time which racks up during her 40-minute train commute. She uses the Google Digital Wellbeing app to set timers on her commonly used apps. “I am now allowed only 15 minutes on Reddit and this is more than enough,” she discovered.Open headspace motivates reader Joseph Slater from Cambodia who reminds us what Rod Judkins wrote in The Art of Creative Thinking:There is an art to doing nothing, intensely. The geniuses of the twenty-first century will be those who can unplug from the unyielding flow of incoming communications: emails, texts, tweets, Facebook, phone calls, and on and on. There’s no hiding place from screens we work at them they entertain us … To work intensively for long periods you need to switch off occasionally for short periods.”Lee Rice, from St Asaph, decided to go back to the dark ages and sold his smartphone last year. He says “life is a million percent better with a dumb phone”.For others, like Judah from Oslo, keeping it simple has been enough: “The best solution is to put the phone down. Even gazing out the window on my commute would be more mentally productive.”The bottom line? If these responses say anything, it’s not about how much screen time you accumulate or how you use it, but rather how you feel about your use.Take a step back and consider your screen time: do you feel depressed about it? Do you know, deep down, that you’d rather learn Chinese or make pasta from scratch? Or are you happy being connected to your loved ones all day?Once you have your answer, go all the way and switch back to a Nokia brick. Or, keep your iPhone X if your eyes have developed an insatiable taste for blue light. If you’re happy, we’re happy.(But, we can agree that 12 hours is ludicrous, right?)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd3a67b4163fe19a747eb41a5da5ef324c9b6a71/0_211_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79d84aa854f92c348b6bd536db8db633","title":"how we met i was taken aback at how beautiful she was","story":"Clare and Ryan Moulder, who are in their 40s, met in 1997. They live in Slough and have two childrenOn Clare’s first day at work 22 years ago, Ryan was the first person she was introduced to. They were at the Mars confectionery company, in the wrapping area of the factory that made Twix bars. Clare was 24 Ryan was 20. “He’s 6ft 3in, dark and handsome,” she says. The head-to-toe white overalls look good on men, she adds. “I thought: ‘Wow!’ straight away. But I was at work and I thought: ‘I’m here to do a job, not find my potential husband.’”Did Ryan notice her? “It’s a very male-dominated area, and seeing a young lady walk into the factory, and especially one so pretty, yeah, it was a big day. I remember being taken aback at how beautiful she was.”Clare smiles. “I don’t remember you saying that.”Although they were part of a friendly, close-knit team, the couple found it hard to get time together. Their break times rarely coincided. On top of that, Clare says her factory outfit – hairnet, hard hat, steel-toe-capped boots, white overalls – was not the most flattering. “I had to do my best every day to look as good as I possibly could,” she says. “My eyebrows would be done, although I couldn’t wear too much makeup.”She says he was oblivious to the fact she liked him. “I would try to engineer it so we were on the same break pattern, and I’d try to organise lots of social events,” she says. Did he like her? “I did,” says Ryan. “But I’m not a very macho, chase-the-ladies sort of person.” It took about six months of Clare “being quite underhand”, she says, before they got together on a night out, and Ryan says they have been pretty much inseparable ever since.They moved in together six months later and worked together on the factory floor for another two years. “You spend a lot of time with those people who are working the same shifts as you,” says Ryan. “It was young love and we didn’t want that space – we were quite happy spending all our time together.”What did they like about each other? “The most important thing is our sense of humour is the same,” says Ryan. And their values, Clare adds. At work “you find a lot of people who share the same values. I think that was the thing that has kept us together, and at work as well – it feels like it’s all wrapped up in our life.”They are both still at Mars, a company they love, where employees are called Martians. Clare did a degree and now works in marketing Ryan is in factory planning. “There are days when I won’t see him at all, and there are days when I’ll see him in the canteen,” she says. “It never really gets too much.” And they rarely talk about work at home, he says.Do they eat chocolate all day? Ryan laughs and says he has type 1 diabetes, so has to watch his sugar intake. Working in a chocolate factory does have its advantages, however. “I’ve had a couple of low blood-sugar attacks, and chocolate is one of the things you can use to fight them.’” Their house is a magnet for trick or treaters at Halloween, says Clare.Is she surprised that she and Ryan are still together, more than two decades on? “It sounds so trite, but when you know, you know,” she says. “My dad used to say: ‘You and Ryan are cut from the same cloth.’”A few weeks ago, Ryan’s aunt died. She got Ryan the job at Mars, and worked for the company for a remarkable 73 years. They were close. “I was trying to be strong for my dad, keep a stiff upper lip, and then at the end when everyone was filtering out after the funeral, Clare came to see me and I broke down,” he says, “because it was Clare. She’s my person, the one I share everything with. You know that person means everything to you.”Want to share your story?

It is not managing mineTurning up to a Gymbox class called Cannabliss (membership from £73, gymbox) is my twofold nightmare. First, group exercise has always struck me as torture plus humiliation. Second, drug talk makes me feel 107 years old. When I hear anyone rhapsodising about hydroponics or closed-loop extraction or how to core an apple bong, I have a tremendous urge to shout: “Why didn’t you stay in school, you’re obviously smart?” Even if they’re in their early 40s. I suppose if we rebranded Stem subjects as Seed and Buds, we could stop failing our weed heads. Anyway, the idea of enduring their company while on a crosstrainer makes me want to pull a … whitey, is it?In my long shorts, I may as well have turned up to class wearing a baseball cap that reads: “How do you do, fellow kids.” I also arrive late, to fit in better with the apathetic stoners. It is my first mistake. They are all there, in their Lululemon and Nike athleisure gear, fit young professionals who regularly go to the gym and let their hair down with an extra broccoli floret at dinner. No one is here to get high. Cannabliss is a “recovery-focused class with the added benefit of CBD patches to help with inflammation”.The teacher glares at me for the disruption. I select a mat too close to his, having no choice because the other spots are taken. He hands me a translucent, spearmint-coloured square to apply to my upper arm. The fact that I have a photographer with me isn’t ideal, either. I am already feeling intensely uncomfortable, and we haven’t even begun.Perhaps we should back up, and explain CBD at this point. Cannabidiol has started springing up everywhere, in varied forms. In essence, it is just one of more than 100 chemical compounds that proliferate in the sweet flowers of Mary Jane and her wacky baccy. It is completely distinct from TLC, who were never able to match the highs of Waterfalls and No Scrubs, although Unpretty was pretty good. Hang on, hang on. *Squints* Oh, THC is the psychoactive element in cannabis – the main bit that gets you high, and there is little to none of it in CBD products. They are legal and said to help with pain relief, inflammation, epilepsy and depression. It is making use of the medicinal effects of cannabis, minus all the fun.I’m certainly not having fun at Cannabliss. I had hoped a class with the word “recovery” in the description would basically be lying down and listening to classical music, but in fact it is a series of intense stretches and body manipulations to help muscles recover after workouts. Rolling crossed thighs down foam rollers, putting a squash ball under our shoulders and riding all our weight on it, holding planks and twisting our cores. Sweat runs into my eyes relentlessly. Gimme the apple bong, I think. There is no drug talk, the patch being there to help manage the pain, then boost our recovery over the following 24 hours. It is not managing mine well enough, and I haven’t done the workout immediately prior to this that the masochists around me presumably have.I do think it is doing something, though. CBD patches are a more effective form of transferring cannabidiol into your bloodstream, unlike gummies or water infusions, which break down in the stomach along with your dignity. As I exercise, I can feel a light tingling under the patch. This is not as extreme as when you apply toothpaste to your swimsuit area, but more tingly than the beginnings of a cold sore. While CBD is not yet clinically proven, doctors and scientists are optimistic about its benefits. It is generally agreed there is something here worthy of study, and a weight of anecdotal evidence, not all of it from rock-loving dudes called Kevin or Cody or Sparrow.As far as this lazy, pain-averse, 107-year-old square is concerned, it is easier to not exercise so hard that you need to take either the recovery class or use the patches. Driven young professionals will find Cannabliss dope. After an hour of it, I’m ready to slap a DNR notice on my back.CBD is a pleasant thing to say. It rolls off the tongue, like BBC or DNA or FBI.CBD? CBA more like. 35"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b574c97293dce052aa3953ceca9e651793b9f624/0_0_5712_3642/master/5712.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=676adbeaa61c094ee636e540820f5941 960w","title":"the inside story of guardian cities a new kind of journalism","story":"The editor of  Cities, Chris Michael, explains the innovative approach he and his team take to covering stories from some of the world’s most under-reported locationsMy favourite Jakartan is Evi Mariani Sofian. It’s not just because she knows the city’s spiciest fish restaurants, cheerfully brings her seven-year-old son along on her assignments for the Jakarta Post, where she is managing editor, and relishes a bit of good-natured ribbing at the expense of naive journalists visiting from London. Rather, at the risk of sounding grandiose, one hot day when Sofian took me to the city’s waterfront she showed me a new kind of journalism.Thousands of residents of Jakarta had been living for decades on the waterfront, in what the authorities call slums. Certainly, they live in homes built with their own hands, denied access to municipal services such as electricity and running water, and support themselves informally, through fishing, kiosks and services such as cutting hair.They were told the bulldozers weren’t coming – but one night they did anyway, crushing the neighbourhood into a field of grey rubble. Grimly Sofian led me across a landscape that in devastation, though not of course in body count, rivalled the scenes then playing out in Syria. She introduced me to the men and women who’d lived here their whole lives, and whose world had been destroyed overnight because hotel developers wanted to build a chain of islands that would look from space like a giant mythical eagle.Some of the residents had rebuilt new shacks, on the same spot, using the very rubble of their bulldozed homes – an almost crazed but entirely human determination that floors me as much today as it did then. To Sofian, it was Jakarta’s most important story: about who has the right to the city. But nobody had died, it wasn’t a campaign issue, and in many other ways it wasn’t the kind of story we might have told before  Cities launched in 2014.The idea was for Cities to offer something different editorially from the political horse races and procession of fatalities that typically characterises the “news agenda”, but it wasn’t clear how. Fiery opinions? In-depth policy? Wonkish dissections of the minutiae of transportation planning? (Some readers still get annoyed that we don’t do more of that.) The Atlantic magazine had started Atlantic Cities in 2011 but otherwise there wasn’t really such a thing as “urban journalism”.I fancied myself a global journalist, and had written several pieces on international issues, but I was an editor on the ’s Film desk at the time, and  my only real qualification for a job on the Cities desk was that I’d lived and worked in four of them. I was a member of that semi-anxious, semi-rootless clan that seems to have proliferated globally due to the fertilisers of the internet and cheap(er) air travel. Before London I’d spent three years in Tokyo at the International New York Times tie-up with the Asahi Shimbun, and before that I ran a publication I still struggle to describe (a stunt-based conceptual magazine?) in Montreal and then Toronto with the artist Alex DeJong. (The magazine was called Trucker, and it borrowed Vice’s business model – parties and American Apparel ads – without the seedier edge, an omission that I posit to explain why I’m not living in a £20m villa in Santa Monica.)Luckily for me, Mike Herd, the founding Cities editor, took a punt on the idea that not being an expert in urbanism might be an asset for telling stories about cities. Mike decided he didn’t want Cities to be a site for talking heads, or for politics, or for transport minutiae. He decided Cities would be, in his words, “like the community wing of the foreign desk”, and his biggest idea was the “live week”: our team would decamp for a week to a global megacity, but not to report on a city’s issues for an audience back in London – we’d give a platform to locals, to tell their own stories in their own words to their own community.It was, and remains, a phenomenally successful idea, the heart of what “urban journalism” has become at the : reported feature journalism for global audiences, tackling the big issues of our time, from inequality to gentrification to how we move and live and work, without needing the justification of elections or death, although sometimes that happens too. We have now run live weeks in Mumbai, Mexico City, Lagos, Moscow, Atlanta, São Paulo and Jakarta, where I found myself on the waterfront with Sofian and realised that she, too, was doing urban journalism.Now, I see it everywhere I look. In five years, cities have become big business: universities offer urban studies degrees, multinational corporations such as Siemens and Google sell “smart city” technology to punch-drunk mayors, and there are dozens of “urban” websites, from Citymetric to Citiscope to the terrific US site Citylab, as Atlantic Cities was renamed. We now regularly attract more than 5m page views each month, and I’m even seeing a new kind of urban crossover journalist, brilliant architecture and design critics such as the ’s Oliver Wainwright, the Observer’s Rowan Moore or the New York Times’s Michael Kimmelman who have branched out into telling gripping stories about cities and people, not just buildings.Above all, we’ve been able to tell stories of people banding together to make their cities better when everyone above them is against them. Everywhere we’ve been, I’ve seen it: in the Seoul neighbourhood in the Mexico City community centre that declared a violence-free zone (and threw us a terrific neighbourhood block party), or the Juhu Beach shelter for street kids without parents in Mumbai, or the jaw-dropping 8,000-strong tent city of São Paulo, where the activist and presidential candidate Guilherme Boulos told me: “Brazil’s homeless have organised. This is what it looks like.”After our visit to the waterfront, Sofian took me to the city’s next target for demolition, the riverside kampung of Tongkul. I expected a shantytown clinging to the banks. What I found was a blissfully cool, tree-lined street of houses gloriously clad in tiles and bamboo and coloured plastic, with slow fans and lazy cats and bicycles and recycling bins and everywhere plants. Gugun Muhammad and the residents convened an impromptu lunch. They showed us how they’d built rafts to clean the polluted river, and voluntarily (voluntarily!) destroyed the front rooms of their homes to meet the city’s request that they not “crowd” the riverbank.The authorities called it illegal anyway. They’ll probably knock it all down. Sofian’s still fighting for the community and Cities will too. They have a right to their home. Of all the places we visited in Jakarta, from the malls to the monuments to the mansions, that “slum” was the nicest neighbourhood by far."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f5b674a683ed3ca08c9817530643ad86e8915c0/0_119_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b525dc92c9335b4930ac50a53d5423a","title":"taylor swift literally steven pinker","story":"Linguist Steven Pinker is among those who have implied the singer was wrong to say ‘I was literally about to break’In a frank interview with the  at the weekend, Taylor Swift revealed just how traumatic the summer of 2016 was for her. “I was literally about to break,” she confided. As fans lapped up the detail about her spat with Kanye and why she felt unable to endorse a presidential candidate, in a more specialised corner of the internet, all hell broke loose.Well, maybe that’s an exaggeration – the eminent linguist and cognitive scientist Steven Pinker did call her “The newest member of A.W.F.U.L. (Americans Who Figuratively Use ‘Literally’)”, implying that he wasn’t keen on her choice of words, and around 3,000 people backed him up. The point is, we have to assume Taylor wasn’t in fact “about to break”, unless there’s something she’s not telling us about her yoga regime.So here we are again, with the semantic pedants pitted against the language-evolutionists. “Literally” should only ever mean “In a literal, exact, or actual sense not figuratively, allegorically”, according to one group. This matches its origin in the Latin word littera, meaning “letter” (think “the letter of the law”).Another set of people sees it being used far more loosely, and is fine with that. Dr Jennifer Gunter responded to Pinker, tweeting: “Language evolves. Literally. Young women drive that change. Get on board, deal, or step aside.” (Incidentally, it’s odd that Pinker seems to be siding people he has gently mocked in the past as “language mavens”. Maybe he was just joking – but, to mix a metaphor, he should know that in stirring the “literally” pot, he’s playing with fire).So who’s right? And what it is about “literally” that gets people so riled up?Understanding the latter can help us with the former. Literally is a word in the midst of a change, as Michael Israel has argued. It sits a little way down a path that many other words have trodden. As such, it’s at an inbetween stage, where its meaning and function are up for grabs – and people tend to have a difficult time with ambiguity.To see what I mean, consider the following sentence: “Djokovic is really giving Federer a thrashing today”. Can you imagine anyone complaining that this is wrong, on the basis that in a tennis match no actual thrashing takes place? They might say it’s over the top, but I’d be surprised if anyone claimed “really” was being misused.But, in their origins, “really” and “literally” aren’t a million miles apart. Back in the 15th century, “really” wasn’t used for emphasis, like in the tennis example. It meant “in reality”, or “in fact”, ultimately deriving from the Latin res, meaning “thing”. Explaining the religious doctrine of the eucharist in 1450, one author wrote “within this bread all the sovereign good is put … bodily and really” – and meant that the bread actually had the presence of Christ in it. Given time, the word came to mean something more like “indeed”: “You have really told a very pretty story” (1751) and later still, it started to be used simply for emphasis: “A really pretty maiden” (1824).This is a fairly common process in language evolution, whereby words relating to the facts of a situation tend to become more subjective. They get bleached of their original meaning, and instead of saying something concrete about the matter at hand, say something about the speaker’s feelings instead. They are used to convince, to emphasise or to intensify a comment. This happened with “really” but it also happened with “very” (which used to mean “true”) and “actually” (which used to mean “in action, rather than thought”) – to the point that we have got completely used to those changes. Now it’s happening to “literally”.But literally hasn’t quite settled into its new role. When Swift says “I was literally at breaking point”, it’s fairly clear she’s adding that word to beef her description up, to tell us quite how strongly she feels about what she went through. There are still many people for whom the concrete meaning sounds more natural, though – and it jars. Some of them may also hold to the false idea that a word’s origin tells you what it should mean – but that’s easily disproved (for example, “silly” has its origin in a word that meant “happy”).All of which is a roundabout way of saying it’s fine to use literally, figuratively. It makes no sense to argue otherwise, unless you want to junk “really” too. In any case we’ll all soon be doing it. As for Pinker’s criticism? Just shake it off, Tay.• David Shariatmadari is the author of Don’t Believe A Word: The Surprising Truth About Language"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03369932ba812a37e95a61fcb9999f073bc91e5a/640_94_2714_1629/master/2714.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=482df9fd99b22debc191226191dd3c0d","title":"world leaders create their own realities at the g7 summit","story":"Biarritz gave Boris Johnson’s peers the chance to dream big so it was a pity he had little to say about BrexitOn the whole it had been a rather agreeable bank holiday weekend in Biarritz. Some of the assembled world leaders might have been a bit meh and it was always disconcerting coming face to face with someone with an even greater personality disorder than your own but by and large everyone had rubbed along OK.Factor in the great morning swims, the food being better than expected, that he had even managed not to spill any wine on the sofa and this was pretty much how Boris Johnson had always imagined being prime minister would be. Plenty of photo ops, high-level schmoozing and no obligation to do anything much at all. Just fun, fun, fun and endless music for the thirsty narcissistic soul.The beauty of the G7 summit was that it was perfectly tailored to everyone’s needs. Each leader could come away with their own personal wellness experience of what had actually happened without fear of being contradicted. If you wanted it to have been about Iran that was OK. And if you wanted it to have been about marine conservation that was OK too. Much like a Gwyneth Paltrow-curated five-star spiritual retreat on Necker Island, only without the hassle of having to interact with Richard Branson.Still, all good things must come to an end and Johnson was in a hurry to get back to the UK. There was just one problem: he was due to give a press conference and the podium was currently occupied by Donald Trump who had decided to close the G7 with an hour-long, free-association therapy session.Yes, the US president was very much looking forward to hosting next year’s summit at his Miami retreat because everyone would have their own bungalow and there was plenty of parking. Yes, he might invite Vladimir Putin but there again he might not. Yes, he couldn’t see what the problem with the Northern Ireland backstop was because the Republic of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom. He knew that because he had a golf course there. Not that he was obsessed about money and property, but being president had cost him $5bn and he was paid zippo for public speaking. And why didn’t people talk so much about Englandland these days? Boris? Great guy. He didn’t know why he hadn’t been made prime minister six years ago. Possibly because there hadn’t been a vacancy in 2013.Johnson’s irritation at having his plane held up on the runway gradually gave way to a sense of calm. The advantage of being the next guy up after someone who is certifiable is that almost anything he said would sound sane in comparison. Once Trump had finally been dragged off stage there was a 20-minute recovery period for reporters before Boris delivered his own comedown debrief from his Ayahuasca experience. The G7 had marked a huge step forward for the Sumatran tiger, he declared. And he loved the environment so much he was going to give it £10m. Roughly the same amount he’d put aside for alimony.Predictably, no one was much interested in the intensity of the prime minister’s drug-induced hallucinations. What they really wanted to know was what he was intending to do about Brexit. Here Johnson’s zen-like mask of self-realisation began to slip and the furtive, guilty smirk crossed his face. Because the whole point of Brexit was that he didn’t actually have a plan. Other than to gaslight the country with a succession of competing and contradictory visions.On one day a no-deal Brexit might be a million to one shot and on the next it might be the most likely outcome. He might withhold the £39bn or he might hand it over. Whatever it took to get him through the day and to keep everyone guessing. After all, this wasn’t so much about getting Brexit done as keeping him in power for as long as possible. He liked the house, he liked the privilege and he couldn’t bear to be parted from them so soon. And if he didn’t know what he was doing, then none of the other EU leaders would know either. Politics as a form of fetishistic, sexual role play. Only with no safe word.“Pifflepafflewifflewaffle,” Johnson said, as he was asked several times about his willingness to prorogue parliament. Maybe yes, maybe no. He was like the wind. And no he couldn’t imagine why Philip Hammond might have thought No 10 had briefed that he had leaked the no-deal documents. The very idea. Johnson breathed deeply, willing himself to flash back to his altered state of consciousness. One where he was at one with himself and the world.He promised to take just two more questions but only took one. So easy to lose count. Besides, nothing was more important than maintaining the G7 vibe of Club 45-70. And chill. The comedown could wait another day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e453a563600a4ee135b2d427563be68466b47ff/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50ba2bc90684d2c3da62b87c277356ca","title":"jeremy corbyn","story":"Labour leader exploring ways of thwarting Boris Johnson’s pledge to quit EU by 31 OctoberJeremy Corbyn would support Boris Johnson in calling a general election, even if the polling day fell just days before the 31 October Brexit deadline, the  understands.The Labour leader’s team are convinced a no-deal Brexit could be thwarted by securing an extension from Britain’s EU partners, even after the European council meets on 17 October.Johnson is widely believed to be plotting a snap poll if MPs try to thwart his Brexit plans – by passing legislation forcing him to ask for an extension to article 50, for example.However, under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, the prime minister would need a two-thirds majority to call a general election before the next one is due in 2022. Theresa May passed that hurdle easily in 2017, with Labour keen to take her on at the polls. But Nick Boles, a former Conservative MP who has been involved in cross-party efforts to find a Brexit compromise, has urged Corbyn to rule out supporting a general election before an extension to article 50 has been secured.Corbyn will host a meeting of opposition leaders and other senior parliamentarians on Tuesday, a week before MPs return to Westminster, as he seeks to put himself at the forefront of efforts to stop no deal.Declining the invitation, Boles wrote to the Labour leader urging him to “declare publicly that you will not facilitate an election before an extension of article 50 has been secured and a no-deal Brexit has been averted”.Anna Soubry, the leader of the breakaway Independent Group for Change, who will attend Tuesday’s meeting, said she would “absolutely not support” a general election, because it “will solve nothing”.Cracks have increasingly appeared among those MPs committed to preventing a no-deal Brexit. The Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, sparked a row with Labour earlier this month when she argued that if he won a vote of no confidence, Jeremy Corbyn should be willing to cede the leadership of any caretaker government to another senior politician. On Sunday, the shadow trade secretary, Barry Gardiner, accused Swinson of being petulant.Corbyn has suggested that if Labour could win a vote of no confidence, he would seek to lead a short-term, caretaker government whose task would simply be to request an extension of article 50 and then call a general election. Swinson has suggested Corbyn would be unlikely to be able to command a majority.Tom Brake, the Lib Dem spokesman on Brexit, said: “Jeremy Corbyn will be under a great deal of pressure if he does not commit to working with opposition leaders. If he does not have the numbers to form an emergency government he must stand aside and help find the best candidate, a respected member from either side of the house.”Corbyn warned that leaving without a deal would allow the Brexit vote to be “hijacked” by the Tories’ billionaire donors.“They will use the crisis to push through policies that benefit them and hurt everyone else, as they have since 2010. They will aim to reduce the power of workers, protections for consumers, the tax bills of bankers, the richest and big corporations, as well as the regulations that are supposed to stop them abusing their power,” he wrote in the Independent.“Johnson is cosying up to Trump because a no-deal Brexit is really a Trump-deal Brexit. It won’t return sovereignty, it will put us at the mercy of Trump and the big US corporations dying to get their teeth into our NHS, sound the death knell for our steel industry and strip back our food standards and animal welfare protections.”Johnson made just one appearance in the House of Commons after securing the Tory leadership in July, before MPs began their summer recess.The Commons will sit for two weeks at the start of September, before breaking once again while the parties hold their annual conferences.Labour will be reluctant to call a vote of no confidence until it believes it has the backing of rebel Tories – some of whom have said they will not support it while a Brexit deal remains a possibility.Soubry has laid out her own plan, which includes parliament sitting throughout September and October, until a no-deal Brexit is off the table."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d22955fb90f496c6d2af273263992f6bffa3b45/0_0_5905_3543/master/5905.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20256cb3edaa4560d1b499263d76b218","title":"menopause experts say compounded hrt is unsafe","story":"Women told not to use cBHRT because of concerns over ‘purity, potency and safety’Women are being warned not to use a form of hormone replacement therapy marketed as being “more natural” than that available from NHS doctors, with experts saying it is unsafe, expensive and could increase the risk of developing cancer.Compounded bioidentical hormone replacement therapy (cBHRT) is tailor-made for each person, using hormones identical to those produced in a woman’s body. The hormone combinations are put together, usually as creams or gels, by pharmacists working in private clinics. The dose of the different hormones used varies from one woman to the next.The menopause is a natural part of ageing and usually occurs between 45 and 55 years of age after levels of the hormone oestrogen have declined to the point where ovulation and menstruation stop. It is defined as a woman going 12 months without a period. In the UK, the average age for a woman to reach the menopause is 52. However, about one in 100 women have their menopause before the age of 40.Common symptoms can include hot flushes, night sweats, vaginal dryness and discomfort during sex, a reduced sex drive, low moods or anxiety and difficulty sleeping. Memory and concentration can also be affected.\u0026nbspThe British Menopause Society (BMS) and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) have warned women away from the products, which are becoming increasingly popular.Menopause experts said women should opt instead for the pre-packed regulated bioidentical HRT (rBHRT). These therapies, available on the NHS, are also duplicates of human hormones but are in fixed doses and licensed by the medicines regulator.Hormone replacement therapy is the main form of treatment for severe menopause symptoms, such as hot flushes, insomnia and low mood. Taken in the form of pills, patches, gels or implants, it acts by replacing oestrogen, or oestrogen and progesterone, in the body.The unregulated version has recently increased in popularity because of a proliferation of online pharmacies and active marketing to consumers. However the BMS and RCOG said there could be problems with overdosing or underdosing, the presence of impurities or lack of sterility, a lack of scientific efficacy and safety data (compounded products are not tested on humans) and a lack of labelling to outline risks.The experts also said the cBHRT practice of saliva and serum hormone testing to determine dosing was unreliable.The BMS and RCOG have become so concerned by the increasing use of cBHRT that they have taken the unprecedented step of issuing a full consensus statement.“Every expert in the field shares the same view and concerns about compounded hormones: it’s unsafe, untested and unnecessary. We are concerned by its purity, potency and safety,” said Haitham Hamoda, the chair of the BMS, spokesperson for the RCOG and a consultant gynaecologist at King’s College hospital foundation trust.The experts say the dose of oestrogen in cBHRT may be higher or lower than it needs to be to control symptoms, and that the dose of progesterone may not always be sufficient to protect the womb. “If the womb is not sufficiently protected, there is a cancer risk,” Hamoda said.Many cBHRT applications deliver progesterone through the skin. “Absorption is variable with fluctuating tissue availability and as a result, may not provide sufficient protection for wombs,” Hamoda said. “Again, that’s a cancer risk.”Dr Louise Newson, a menopause expert, said: “We see many women at Newson Health clinic who have spent considerable amounts of money on these bioidentical products and have experienced numerous side effects.“Compounded bioidentical products are not regulated or approved and so could potentially be harmful. In addition, there is no evidence that these bioidentical hormones have fewer side effects or are more effective than prescribed HRT.”In 2017, the Advertising Standards Authority ruled against the promotion of cBHRT as having greater safety and efficacy than rBHRT, and said there was insufficient evidence to back the practice of cBHRT practitioners using expensive serum and saliva tests to inidualise therapy.However, the Marion Gluck Clinic, which claims to be the leading UK medical clinic specialising in the use of bioidentical hormones, defended cBHRT.“Just like any other medical practice, the Marion Gluck Training Academy is registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC),” a spokesperson said. “In addition, compounding cBHRT is carried out under strict supervision of a qualified pharmacist on a named patient basis.”The popularity of cBHRT rose after the publication of findings in 2002 that conventional HRT carried a cancer risk. In the following years, there were a number of high-profile endorsements for cBHRT, including from Oprah Winfrey and Jeanette Winterson."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d19df985060b01b2aa77af69e64d0686de3432ab/0_52_5166_3100/master/5166.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4c61a12dddafe4eb697a446fdf0307b","title":"helping nine year old eating disorder recovery podcast","story":"We hear about the importance of early intervention in rare cases of pre-teen eating disorders.

He is the best cricketer I have played alongsideIn the biggest summer in English cricket history Ben Stokes has stood head and shoulders above the rest.He is the best cricketer I have played alongside and while it might be a massive shout – and admittedly he is a very close friend – I would argue he is now the greatest all-rounder this country has ever produced.To deliver an innings like the one he played at Headingley, just six weeks after winning us the World Cup final, and with the Ashes on the line, is what seals it for me. I know there are past greats like Ian Botham and Andrew Flintoff but we’re watching another legend in the making here. When everyone woke up on Sunday morning there was a sense that England could do something very special. I followed the run chase throughout the day but with two runs to win I had to be peeled away from the TV screen in the dressing room to go out and bat for Worcestershire in our T20 game against Lancashire.The match actually paused for a good minute or so when a huge roar went up – it must have been Jack Leach levelling the scores with that textbook nudge off the hip – and then soon after this it was followed by an even bigger one when Stokesy smacked that four. He was literally stopping games around the whole country.The thing is, none of it surprised me. Stokesy has always had the talent and potential. My beliefs are that good people who work hard get their rewards. There will be struggle at times and hurdles along the way – life throws up all sorts – but in the end, you will prevail if you stick to the right path.Stokesy first came on my radar when I saw him hitting an 88-ball century against India in the Under-19s World Cup in 2010. We didn’t become teammates until 2014 on a one-day tour to the Caribbean and he was going through a rough patch at the time, with some low scores and then a busted hand when he struck a locker.It may surprise some people when I follow this by saying he was already a mature guy at just 22, with a young family. And what I liked about him was that he treated everyone the same. It didn’t matter who you were, your background or what you looked like, he always had time for you. We hit it off straight away.Just before the incident in Bristol in 2017 I really thought he was coming into his own as a cricketer. That set him back a bit but since then he has become more aware of his surroundings and responsibilities. He has the Test vice-captaincy back now but he doesn’t need a label, because he leads any team he plays in regardless.What we witnessed on Sunday wasn’t a fluke, it was the result of the hard work I mentioned. Seriously, you will not find a cricketer more dedicated to self-improvement. He trains at 100mph and is just unrelenting with it. And over time it has made him into the player you see today. Those mammoth bowling spells at Headingley are testament to that.As a batsman he has become excellent at judging scenarios. He now has the all-round game and technique to adapt. Think about the start and end to that innings: his first 73 balls he scored three runs. His last 45? 74. Incredible. Even when Jos Buttler was run out, he kept his cool. Refusing to celebrate personal milestones sums him up too. It is team first, every time.Huge credit must also go to Leach for sticking with him. He is a better batsman than some would give him credit for. He gets in line, fights his corner and is harder to get out than you would think. Cricket is an amazing game because he scored one run and yet it is probably the biggest he will make in his life.The decision to give him the nod over myself after Edgbaston was one I couldn’t argue with. All I care about is England doing well and if that means I’m looking on for a bit, I won’t lose any sleep. Whatever happens will happen and I will support Leachy and the boys regardless. The schedule makes it tricky to get back in but I am enjoying my time at Worcestershire. A video of me bowling seamers went around social media the other week and while I’m not on it, I heard it caused a bit of a stir. People were thinking I’d lost confidence in my spin bowling but to be honest, that was nonsense.One of our quicks, Josh Tongue, was injured and after bowling some, ahem, half-decent seam last year, our captain, Joe Leach, asked me to switch for a spell. Sometimes the view from the sofa isn’t always the most informed. I am finding form with the bat too and when the time comes, I will be ready."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75792a4a203b9c9eb13534f30bf9765be54071fa/182_894_5728_3437/master/5728.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2e3bc78627f2b19505a413334b66218","title":"edinburgh festival 2019 in pictures","story":"Our photographer Murdo MacLeod captures more of this year’s eclectic Edinburgh festival shows, featuring everything from black holes to Basil Brush"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08cef27833c145fc3468cbfe0bff6f806e40dbf6/0_280_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=853e946921b745a684fe8f8a5e0cddb9","title":"uber contradicts own research with london congestion ad claim pool","story":"Poster displayed near two TfL offices said car-pooling service helped reduce trafficAn Uber advertising campaign in London has claimed that its car-pooling service reduces traffic, contradicting the findings of the US ride-hailing app company’s own research.A large billboard poster displayed in London this month said: “Uber Pool reduces traffic by moving more people in fewer cars”.It was displayed at a busy junction near two of Transport for London’s main offices in Southwark. The poster has since been replaced.In a blogpost accompanying the research Chris Pangilinan, Uber’s head of global policy for public transportation, acknowledged that the evidence showed that his company and Lyft were likely to be contributing to an increase in congestion.The effect of ride-hailing apps on congestion is contested. They could reduce traffic by encouraging people leave their cars at home, or they could increase the number of vehicles on the road if people switch from public transport.Uber faces a TfL decision on 25 September as to whether its London operating licence will be renewed. Last year the company won a temporary legal reprieve on a  ban by saying it had changed its policies on driver background checks and crime reporting. Last month Uber said it had 100 million monthly active users in 65 countries, and that its car-pooling service, which allows multiple separate users to share the same vehicle, had saved 1.7m driving miles in the UK capital this year. The company has been unable to provide the methodology for the claim made in the London ad, or to provide evidence of any assessment that took into account the overall effect of the pooling service on traffic.Asked about the poster, an Uber spokeswoman said: “We often run marketing campaigns all over the world to showcase the many features and products available through the Uber app, whether that’s our safety toolkit or Uber Pool. More than 350,000 people in London regularly use Uber Pool to share their journey, and in 2019 shared journeys have saved over 1.7m miles from being driven in London.”Ride-hailing businesses have repeatedly said they aim to reduce congestion on roads, but the inexorable rise of traffic has led Uber and others to look at different solutions. Uber’s Jump, Bird and Lime are among a number of startups that are launching, or have launched, electric scooters and bikes in US and European cities.Uber, Airbus and the German firm Lilium are among the companies hoping that light aircraft capable of vertical takeoff and landing will offer a different solution to congestion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1855affeddda754f2910199d4e7906ade3e0ecba/0_26_1881_1128/master/1881.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f747f5d6d2009d8dadb3f81d965c786","title":"bigger and taller masts lined up to improve rural phone signal","story":"Scores of super masts could be built across Britain to get rid of mobile phone blind spotsScores of taller phone masts could be built across the British countryside as part of government plans to eliminate mobile reception blind spots.The digital secretary, Nicky Morgan, said she wanted to shake up planning restrictions to allow mobile phone networks to build ground-based masts exceeding the current rules prohibiting structures over 25 metres on public land.The move came as the government launched a competition for rural areas to host tests of groundbreaking 5G applications as part of plans for a wider rollout of the communications technology.Writing in the Daily , Morgan said plans also included firms investing in shared masts, allowing phone users to switch between providers to find the best signal.She said: “To give such a proposal the best chance of success we need to make it easier for industry to build, share and upgrade mobile infrastructure. This means planning rules will be relaxed to enable existing ground-based masts to be strengthened without prior approval to enable sites to be upgraded for 5G and for mast-sharing.”She stressed the need to “get the balance right” between preserving the “sacrosanct” countryside and improving connectivity.The £30m 5G competition will select up to 10 rural locations to run trials of 5G-related technology, which would involve superfast 5G test networks being set up.The government said it hoped the programme, named the Rural Connected Communities competition, could help stimulate investment in 5G and help countryside communities take advantage of the technology.Similar schemes have already been set up in Orkney to remotely monitor salmon fisheries and improve the efficiency of wind farms, and in Shropshire, where 5G trials have been used to help the farming industry with targeted crop-spraying and soil analysis with drones and tractors.Morgan said: “We’re investing millions so the whole country can grasp the opportunities and economic benefits of next-generation 5G technology.“In modern Britain, people expect to be connected wherever they are. And so we’re committed to securing widespread mobile coverage and must make sure we have the right planning laws to give the UK the best infrastructure to stay ahead.”Tom Watson, the shadow culture secretary, said: “This funding falls far short of the ambitious rollout we need to boost our digital infrastructure nationwide. 5G and full fibre will be the basis of the innovative, green technologies that will underpin our future economy, but the UK’s digital infrastructure is lagging embarrassingly behind. “This government must take bolder, faster action to deliver the digital infrastructure we need.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d78c9820f7887e5906f7ee020bc9b7c0626b915/357_90_2648_1589/master/2648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19e7cb6a536122df55d4bbb302eb51be","title":"when chase is on his computer he feels like any other nine year old","story":"Nikki Hunter-Pike explains how accessibility technology has opened up the online world to her son, who has cerebral palsyIt’s Saturday morning at Nikki Hunter-Pike’s home. While she prepares breakfast, and her husband Daniel plays with their daughters Brooke and Harper, her son Chase is engrossed in sending an email to his beloved stepgrandfather, “Pops”, his face a study in intense concentration.Nine-year-old Chase, who has the neurological condition cerebral palsy, cannot walk, talk, feed himself or pick up a pen. Yet, thanks to technology that’s widely available, he can communicate, learn and explore the online world from his family’s home in Northfleet, Kent.On his computer, “Chase uses the on-screen keyboard (OSK) tool, because he doesn’t have the fine motor skills to type on a keyboard,” says Nikki. Running on Windows 10, “it displays a visual keyboard with all the standard keys. Using a joystick that he can control with just his thumb, once he switches on the OSK, he can do everything from browse the internet to search for videos on YouTube and write emails. We introduced him to it when he was six and it really has been life-changing for him.“Because he can’t speak or type messages on a phone, being able to write emails to his friends and close family is so important to him – it helps him feel connected.“The keyboard also has a text prediction function, which suggests words for him as he types. It makes it quicker for him, and, because he has learning difficulties too, it helps him with his spelling.“When I see him on his computer, and how its technology empowers him, it fills me with confidence that as he grows up he’ll be able to lead a fulfilling, independent life. That is all I’ve ever wanted for him.”Nikki’s hopes for her son are mirrored by Microsoft’s mission to empower every person through building inclusivity into technology, such as the Windows 10 operating system, which supports the OSK and its Office 365 suite.After a normal, healthy pregnancy, Nikki says she was devastated when Chase was born with brain damage, having been deprived of oxygen during her labour.“The hardest part was the uncertainty. No one knew how severe his level of disability would be, and for the first few years of his life it felt like I was living in limbo watching and waiting to see what milestones he would reach, or not,” says Nikki.“He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was nine months old, but it wasn’t until he was around three that the full extent of his disability was clear. He’s never spoken, he can’t stand unaided, and he suffers from almost constant involuntary movements of his limbs. His reading ability is closer to that of a five-year-old. He’s also incredibly loving, with a wonderful sense of humour and a very determined personality.”While Chase uses an electric wheelchair and requires round-the-clock care, Nikki says technology gives him the independence he craves.“He’s well aware his siblings and other children don’t need the same help he does. But when he’s on his computer, he feels like any other nine-year-old, because he’s in control and he doesn’t need any assistance,” says Nikki. “That means so much to him and it’s vital for his self-confidence.“I see how he puffs up with pride when he shows his little sisters, who are five and three, something he’s discovered online – his current obsession is looking at locations around the world on Google Maps. It gives him the chance to be the big brother and take the lead.”A keen gamer too, Chase uses his Microsoft adaptive controller to access his Xbox console.“We all game together as a family. It can be stressful going out because of the challenges Chase can face with poor disability access and toilet facilities. Sometimes it’s just nice to stay at home and have a relaxed afternoon gaming and cuddling up on the sofa.”Summing up how much the technology means to her son, Nikki says: “It’s no exaggeration to say Chase’s computer is his window to the world. I can’t imagine his life without it and I’m thankful he was born at a time when technology like this exists.“It’s so important to him and, thanks to its emphasis on inclusivity, it’s the one part of his life in which he can be completely independent.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

He tells  Lucy Jolin about how he started his travel blogging business with The Deaf Traveller, and the tech that helps himTravel blogger Ed Rex has had plenty of memorable moments in his career to date, from snorkelling in Fiji to marvelling at the Iguazu Falls on the border of Brazil and Argentina. But one of the most memorable was when he accidentally signed up for a job at a nudist resort in Australia.“The plan was to work at resorts in return for bed and breakfast,” he says with a grin. “The resort sent me a nice email saying they were looking forward to me coming and would pick me up – and by the way, we’re nudists: is that OK with you? And I had to be nude as well. That was a challenge! I’ve certainly never done naked gardening in the UK ...”Rex was born deaf, but he’s never let that stand in the way of his determination to experience life to the full. He studied environmental biology and science at the University of Leeds and worked in the sector for several years before jacking in his job to see the world.“I’d always had a love of travel but I didn’t have anyone to travel with, and I didn’t have the confidence to travel on my own,” he says. “Then, just before I left my last job, I had an operation to insert a cochlear implant into my right ear, as the hearing in that ear had gone completely. I was struggling to be involved in social situations, and feeling pretty down.”While the operation isn’t the preferred choice for all, for Rex it made a huge difference. “I was a completely different person,” he says. “Suddenly, I had so much confidence. So off I went, around the world. That was the start of the travel blogging, too. I realised I had a love of storytelling.”Rex charts all his travels on his blog, rexyedventures (strapline: “Adventures of a handsome backpacker travelling the unexpected”), which quickly caught the attention of major brands, including KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, MyDestination and Hotel.info. These days he’s a well-known figure on the travel blogger scene. He’s often asked to go on trips and to review accommodation and experiences – recent adventures include quad biking in Australia and two weeks in South Africa. And he’s written widely about his experiences as a deaf traveller too, on rexyedventures and his Deaf Traveller blog.There have been challenges, of course, as well as some some odd attitudes. “I remember one Australian guy saying: ‘Can I catch deafness from you?’ which was bizarre! I took out my hearing aid, which I use for my left ear, and said: ‘Quick, quick, the germs are on the loose!’ But most of the time, it’s fine. Sometimes people have questions but they are afraid to ask, so you have to start the conversation yourself. For me, deafness is not a taboo subject and you can make fun of yourself. It’s part of who you are.”But odd attitudes like the earlier one are rare, he points out. “Most of the time it’s just about looking after yourself and making sure you’re not in a situation where you could be vulnerable. I’ve always felt quite safe. And if something happens – like being dropped off by a bus in Thailand in the middle of nowhere – it’s fine if you don’t lose your cool and get stressed.”Rex is a keen user and advocate of better accessibility tech – he’s passionate about the need to get British transport right, particularly train companies that still use tannoys to make announcements. He’s pleased that Microsoft’s most recent software is taking steps in the right direction.“I particularly like the visual notification feature, which sets the screen to flash, rather than making a sound, and the accessibility checker on Word, Excel and Powerpoint,” he says. “Subtitling is great: it’s a massive thing to be able to turn on subtitles in Powerpoint,” he says, adding that it gets better every time you use it.“You can get subtitles for every video on the web, too. And I’ve used Skype for yonks, but I never realised before that you can turn on subtitles for every single Skype call, and you can download the transcript at the end of it. That’s so good for business meetings.”In the future, Rex is looking forward to more trips and continuing to use his platform to inspire others and break down stereotypes, particularly among young people.“Deafness is associated with people who are old! But there are so many deaf kids who don’t have any role models. And there’s a wide spectrum of deafness, too: people who use sign language, people who have mild hearing loss and so on. I want to say: you can do this. If I can do it, you can do it. It’s all about standing up and believing in yourself,” he says.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Computer software is essential to her dual career, writes  Sue George“Teaching yoga, hosting yoga brunch events and doing a full-time finance contract is pretty tiring,” says Jemma Ralston, “but it is so exciting because I am in control. All these things I am choosing to do. Yoga is my passion.”Ralston teaches ashtanga vinyasa yoga in classes across London and – alongside her new yoga business – she also works as an accountant.Ralston has a condition called Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) that leads to problems with blood clotting, causing easy bruising and prolonged bleeding. It also involves nystagmus – uncontrolled eye movements, leading to reduced vision and depth perception.After university in Glasgow, Ralston went to work in Jersey on a graduate training scheme. “I was thrown in at the deep end,” she says. “Being a trainee auditor and visually impaired wasn’t easy. A lot of my work was going through papers with a red pen.” She had to pass some tough accountancy exams. “Things take me longer to read than they might for a person with 20-20 vision. Yes, things were sometimes tough. But not that bad,” she laughs.While she was working in Jersey, Ralston started yoga classes and immediately felt the impact on her stress levels and long-term anxiety. “I felt at home. As someone who grew up with a few physical ailments, I thought: ‘I can do this! I feel relaxed!’ I understand what the instructor is telling me and I can listen to my body.”Three years later, she was working in London as a senior-level accountant at a large corporation. After a painful relationship breakup, she travelled on her own to Thailand, where she practised yoga every day for a month. “From then on, I knew I was going to be a yoga teacher. I didn’t know when. I had a successful job in the City and had worked very hard. But I knew I would when the time was right.”That time came three years ago. Her father was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and she had an incident with her blood condition where she went into cardiac arrest. “That was when I made the decision. A couple of days later, I booked my teacher training,” she says.She qualified in October 2017 and left her full-time City job three months later. Ralston began teaching classes all over London, soon deciding the best plan was to be a contractor in the finance sector while she established her yoga business.Her corporate background is a good complement to her yoga business. “Yoga teachers don’t do it for the money – we do it because we love teaching. But I would like to find a way where I can teach and live a comfortable life. I think my knowledge of finance and business models will help me on that journey.”As soon as she starts a contract in a new office, Ralston sets up Ease of Access Center in Windows 10. “I tend to ‘lose’ the mouse cursor, and the larger the monitor, the more space there is to lose it in. I make the mouse cursor bigger so I can follow it,” she says. Ease of Access options also allow her to use the Narrator function, meaning that she can hear audio descriptions of elements on the screen, something she may need if her sight deteriorates.The Ease of Access Center enables Ralston to increase the size of, and contrast within, documents. Working with spreadsheets for her own business, or with financial modelling for clients, she uses Excel and changes the text to be white on a black background. She also finds the search function helpful, rather than having to look through documents for particular figures.Right now, she has yoga brunch events to organise, and technology can help with that. “When I am on the computer for a long time, I use the Magnifier tool because my eyes get tired, especially for things like proofreading,” she says. “It’s about independence. These things are here to help everyone.“I can accept my body as not perfect – but no one’s is,” she continues. “We all have our limitations and have things we can excel at. It’s about appreciating what you can do.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Sue George finds out howLike many teenagers, Ella Warren-Roberts, 14, is very creative. She makes slate jewellery, she does woodcutting, and paints in watercolours. “She always has more than one project on the go,” says her proud mother, Glenda Roberts. “And she always completes them.”“So I don’t get too stressed out on one thing, I can relax by doing another,” says Ella. This lively, cheerful teenager also really likes science but, until recently, she wasn’t able to shine at it. She struggled reading science questions and her work took too long. But now, she is third in her year at chemistry.Ella is a day pupil, and Glenda is a teacher, at St David’s college, an independent boarding and day school in north Wales for children aged nine to 19. The school prides itself on teaching mixed classes, where pupils with additional learning needs, and those with none, work together to reach their full potential. Many of the pupils, like Ella, have dyslexia, and teachers, such as Glenda, have been trained at Bangor University to work with dyslexic learners. Some teachers bring their dogs to work, which pupils – including Ella – find very calming. “I have anxiety, and animals really help me. They aren’t judgemental,” she says.Using a computer for her schoolwork has also played a part in reducing Ella’s anxiety – which came about because it took her longer than others to complete certain tasks. “It made me feel more stupid than anyone else,” she says firmly. But now she realises that she isn’t stupid and her past problems with reading and writing have eased greatly.The apps and programs available with Office 365 allow this to happen smoothly. For instance, the school has a OneNote account used by both pupils and teachers. OneNote is a collaborative digital notebook that can be typed into, drawn or written on, and visual or audio clips can be added to it. Teachers use it to compile worksheets pupils then work on them online.Glenda points to the Microsoft Edge immersive reader, part of Microsoft’s learning tools, and the assistance this tool can give learners across a range of programs, including OneNote and Word. For instance, it can highlight words or sentences, or split inidual words into their component syllables – something that can also help anyone learning in an additional language.Ella uses it to change the background colour on her screen: she finds it easier to read on a sepia tone, where there is no glare. Previously, she relied on teachers printing worksheets on coloured paper. Then there is the choice of fonts. She can immediately choose a font she finds legible. “I used to be behind everyone else, but now I’m on target,” she says.For Glenda, Microsoft programs have also been a big help. Last year, she was away from work for nine months after being diagnosed with endometrial cancer. “I was in dire straits,” she says. “They gave me three months to live.” She is currently on the anti-cancer drug Avastin and is still going to the Christie hospital in Manchester for treatment.OneNote helped her feel less isolated when she was off work, and even in hospital the apps on her phone helped her keep track of how her pupils were getting on. “I might be part-time, but I am invested,” she says confidently.Using the Microsoft Teams platform, she was able to see what they were learning and could make comments to help their teachers.Both Glenda and Ella are physically active, doing the Race for Life 5k together. They live in an area where outdoor activities are popular people come to the family’s Airbnb to enjoy the nearby mountaineering. Her school also gives Ella the opportunity to enjoy another of her hobbies: wakeboarding. This sport is similar to waterskiing, but with one board instead of two skis. Ella describes it as “like snowboarding, if the snow had melted”.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops, whatever your need.

The house was bequeathed to the people of Dumbarton, but for many years lay in a sad state of disrepair until it was let to a Christian organisation.

Sited on a former second world war airfield, it has a number of trails through the woods, as well as smooth track perfect for cycling or skating. It is possible to hire a range of bicycles from Watchtree Wheelers to tour the perimeter, though cyclists aren’t permitted to disturb the peace of the wooded areas. Given that is was once the burial ground for thousands of animals caught up in the foot-and-mouth crisis, its transformation into to a nature reserve, wind farm and disability cycling charity is a serene triumph.• watchtreeJames CartwrightHengistbury Head, just south of Christchurch, is a beautiful, tranquil and constantly changing piece of coastline that has something for everyone. As a newly created dog walker, I can choose from flat grassland tracks that lead to high sand dunes down to the beautiful natural and often deserted beach. Or we can choose to go high on to the head and walk the path through heather and ferns, with views of Christchurch Priory and estuary on one side, and the Dorset coastline on the other. Then, right at the tip, you see Mudeford Spit and its beach huts.

The top of the hill is coated in beech woodland, which provides shady respite from the heat of the summer sun. The chalk downlands are the real attraction though, and you have to be prepared to go slow to appreciate its delights – multitudes of plants, all in flower, just centimetres from each other. The mind boggles at how so many different things can live cheek by jowl. The cherry on the cake isn’t just the song of the skylark, but the clouds of butterflies that erupt with every step. Here I am reminded of Pig-Pen, the character in Charlie Brown, as silver-spotted skipper butterflies surround me in their hundreds.• gov.ukRobFor a slice of serenity in the heart of London, I love Millwall Dock on the Isle of Dogs. Dwarfed by the skyscrapers of Canary Wharf, this expanse of open water is the perfect contrast to fast-paced urban life. Whether it’s observing the mischievous birdlife squabbling over possession of the tern raft in the old graving dock, or partaking in a bracing open-water swim from the Docklands Sailing \u0026amp Watersports Centre, or simply watching the sun set over the City of London with an array of dinghies in the foreground, there’s always something to amuse, refresh or inspire. And for those more interested in llamas, goats and donkeys, Mudchute Farm is just a stone’s throw away.Jack StookesSandwell Valley, near West Bromwich, is a one-of-a-kind place full of hidden gems, with surviving bits of real countryside, open pastures and grass meadows. It also has a nice old farm turned into a museum and two large, well-equipped playgrounds. Or you can visit the priory ruins – said to be haunted – with its Saxon stone coffins, surrounded by old dark woods with hidden medieval ponds. More recent history lies in the second world war ack-ack gun emplacements, still in good shape, but more and more engulfed by the vegetation every year.

May it remain undeveloped for ever.• sandwell.gov.ukStanleyMy absolute favourite green space is the Dalston Eastern Curve Garden. This small urban community oasis is set back from the madness of busy Hackney on a disused train line. It’s a beautifully layered garden with a magical wooded area, raised beds with vegetables, and beautiful pots full of seasonal flowers. The main reason I come here is for inspiration – I love the creativity, especially across the seasons. I especially love visiting in October: despite the year growing old, it is transformed into a beautiful autumnal space, using the changing plants, hundreds of carved pumpkins, and coppery red crispy leaf garlands.

Spotlit in the early evening light, the geometric buildings of Noah Surf House are as incongruous as they are striking, as if someone has airlifted a Californian beach resort and accidentally placed it in an unremarkable Portuguese town.The Portuguese coast is dotted with surf hostels and hotels, many of them between Lisbon and Figueira da Foz, a 300km stretch of shore that draws everyone from world record-breaking big wave riders to beginners dipping their toes in the sport for the first time. In the middle of this surf mecca is the little town of Santa Cruz, a summer escape for Lisbonites – it’s often a good few degrees cooler than the city – but usually bypassed by foreign visitors, who make a beeline for the surf towns of Ericeira to the south and Peniche to the north.Lacking the cobbled-street charm, food and drink scene and chic boutiques found in the more famous surf towns, Santa Cruz seems an odd choice of location for a designer surf hotel. Yet Noah Surf House became an instant hit when it opened here in July last year, particularly among families in search of an active beach holiday. It’s also a prime example of the government’s new tourism strategy.“Our goal is to spread tourism all over the country and all through the year,” secretary of state for tourism Ana Mendes Godinho told me when I met her in Lisbon after our stay. Godinho’s mission is the holy grail of tourism – encouraging more tourists spending more money while acknowledging that overcrowding, most notably in Lisbon but increasingly in Porto too, is a problem she can’t ignore. “We grew too fast and we weren’t prepared for it,” she said.The government’s response is a €100m programme aimed at encouraging tourism developments outside the hotspots of Lisbon, Porto and the Algarve. Since it launched two years ago, more than 600 public and private projects have received support, ranging from wellbeing retreats to literary, surf and religious breaks, Jewish heritage sites to river beaches. Santa Cruz is one such project – a series of events, including the Pro Santa Cruz surf competition, are putting the town and the surrounding beaches on the map. It was this investment that encouraged the couple behind the nearby luxury hideaway Areias do Seixo to open Noah Surf House. It doesn’t matter that sleepy Santa Cruz only comes alive for July and August. There are 11 beaches to explore and surf year-round. That’s if you ever leave this excellent accommodation.My immediate thought the first time we climb the Noah Surf House’s spiral staircase up to the funky open-plan reception and restaurant, was wow, immediately followed by, “I’m going to have a job persuading my son, nine, to do anything other than hang out here.” He’d never seen anywhere like it: walls and ceiling hung with an old fishing boat, nets and octopus traps a giant TV screen playing big wave surf videos on a loop a rack of surf boards standing by the reception desk an infinity pool overlooking the beach a skatepark a table tennis room a hot tub a garden with chickens – basically a very cool playground with, best of all, loads of children his age to play with. He loved the hanging bunk in our bungalow room, too.Before the Surf House came the Noah Beach House restaurant (more distressed wood and artfully arranged fishing paraphernalia and driftwood), which offers surprisingly reasonable lunches (€3.50 sandwiches and a substantial burger for €8.90) in a mesmerising setting on the sand. Dinner is a more sophisticated menu, featuring razor clams, grilled octopus, tuna steaks and other fish. We ate there for a treat one night – a huge slab of cod for me, and two giant shrimps on rice for my partner.There’s a cheaper dinner option a five-minute walk along the beach. Casa do Pisao is a small family-run restaurant with a simple menu – we ordered rice with prawns and clams for €7.50, which was delicious and exactly what we wanted on a windswept beach. It was chilly and windy when we were there, so we sat inside and watched the steel-blue sea. A few kilometres north at the Santa Rita car park there’s another no-frills option – Grão d’Areia overlooking the long, sandy expanse of Praia de Santa Rita Norte, though it was sadly shut on the afternoon we pitched up in search of ice-cream after a windswept walk on the deserted beach.You can’t come to Noah and not surf. Or so I thought. My partner was happy reading a book by the pool and, as predicted, my son was reluctant to leave his gang of new friends and so it was just me who joined a few other guests for a lesson. The waves on the nearby beaches were too strong for our group of novices so our instructor, Nuno, drove us up to Peniche, telling us how he had left a good job working for a construction company to teach surfing and “found his tribe”.Once we were on the beach, Nuno explained how to find our centre of balance on the board, which made perfect sense when I was practising on a stationary board on the sand. In the water, the theory washed away. I couldn’t stay on the board while lying down let alone standing up nonetheless, an hour and a half of paddling into the waves, waiting for the right one and attempting to ride back into shore without falling off was was both exhilarating and calming as my mind emptied of all thoughts other than what the sea was doing and how I should respond to it.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

(James Morton, adorable Scotsman, series three.) In the 10 years since a show about a disparate bunch of amateur bakers measuring out flour and whimsy in a countryside tent was commissioned by the BBC, more not-great British stuff has happened than in many other peacetime decades combined.Bake Off was born into a country reeling from its first hung parliament since the 1970s. It turns 10 as the UK prepares to crash out of the EU without a deal. In between, lots of other nasty things have been stuffed, like an inedible victoria sandwich baked in hate. What I am really wondering, while being waylaid by extended cake metaphors in the grand tradition of #GBBO reportage, is whether The Great British Bake Off is all that is left of what’s great and British in this country?Everyone has their own theory as to why the show has been such an unprecedented global success. For some, it is Bake Off’s magical ability to induce the warm contentment, sprinkled with mild hysteria, of eating cake. For others, it is the unbridled joy of a lion made out of bread by a prison governor. It combines the bunting-encircled days of the village hall fete with an irresistible, if concocted, vision of modern, erse, harmonious Britain. In fact, The Great British Bake Off may be the last acceptable form of nostalgia in the UK.In preparation for the 10th series, why not smooth on a few more layers of wistfulness with our rundown of the best moments from the past nine …There is a wonky charm to these six homespun episodes. In the first, Mark Whithers’ marmalade tea loaf sank in the middle because he kept opening the oven door to check on it. “You put your heart and soul into this,” said Sue Perkins, as he burst into tears. She straightened his tie. Gave him a little pat. “I’m ready for the next challenge,” he said shakily. “Which will probably be a saltwater cake, unless you dry those peepers,” Sue gently teased. A prototype pep-talk containing all the ingredients of Bake Off’s future success: pathos, humour, a rounded teaspoon of melancholia, and words like “peepers”.Remember when Robert Billington became the first twee heartthrob in the tent? All boyband hair and clumsy puppy paws. But even the sight of Bake Off’s own Captain Poldark dropping his chocolate genoise mousse cake couldn’t compete with a squirrel’s enorma-balls in the final. It was the equivalent of that lingering shot of Elizabeth Bennett and Mr Darcy eyeing each other up over a piano in Andrew Davies’s Pride and Prejudice. Subtle, subversive and deeply naughty.This was when Bake Off began to quietly scale the meringue-peaked heights of greatness. Brendan Lynch greasing up his arms to stretch his dough! John Whaite confusing salt and sugar in a technical round, causing Paul Hollywood to retch over his rum babas! James Morton’s Fair Isle knits! But no, the winner must be Cathryn Dresser. In episode six, Hollywood’s advice to “build up the resistance” of strudel dough by grabbing, twisting, slapping and tossing it until you win virile baker of the year at the county fair was taken too enthusiastically by Cathryn, who catapulted hers to the floor. “It’s so hairy!” she laughed. “I’m not serving Mary Berry green carpet.”The controversial one, and not just because Sue elbowed Howard’s muffins. This was the series in which Ruby Tandoh – in the top five contestants of all time for her technical skill in folding bad attitude into false modesty – was accused of being favoured by Hollywood. Which turned out to just be vintage misogyny. Best moment, however, goes to #Custardgate, in which Howard became a victim of theft after Deborah used his crème anglaise in her trifle. Was it, to quote Sue, “the most incredible case of baking espionage” ever seen? Whatever, he ended up a national hero. This may seem insane now, but #Bingate (a bolder, richer #Custardgate, do keep up) was actual front-page news. To attempt to boil this complex saga down to its essence is as pointless as tweeting the plot of Game of Thrones, but, basically, Diana Beard removed Iain Watters’ baked alaska from the freezer. He had a tantrum, threw it in the bin and stormed out of the tent. Then he came back, presented the bin to the judges and was duly voted off. That’s actually it. Anyway, 800 people complained to Ofcom, Iain appeared on Newsnight and Diana’s doctor got involved. Lessons learned: we really didn’t have much to worry about then, did we?Winner of not just series six, but every Bake Off past and future, the nation’s heart and anything worth dying on a hill for, is Nadiya Hussain. Her facial expressions were gif gold. Her levitating-can showstopper was a metaphysical masterpiece. She was funny, wise, self-deprecating and always magnificently herself. She showed us what Britishness, at its best, could be. And her victory speech was so moving it made everyone, including Mary Berry, cry. “I can and I will” is all I need to reprise here to bring it back in its full Larkin-esque glory.The best moment in the series touted at the time to be Bake Off’s last goes to Selasi Gbormittah or, as he came to be known, the king of chill. He baked from the floor a yogi practising shivasana while checking on his savarins. He referred to puff pastry as “puff”. He did bump ’n’ grind rolling pin moves for Benjamina Ebuehi. Baking never got cooler than Selasi saying to Mel Giedroyc, when she observed smoke billowing from his dampfnudel, that “it’s the kind of burn that you like”.The move to Channel 4 shocked, in the mild and comforting way only Bake Off can, by remaining exactly the same. This was no season six, but what it lacked in Nadiyas it made up for in fiendishly clever bakes. What could top Steven’s chess set made out of a hundred inidual biscuit elements, each one purpose-baked to achieve checkmate? It even sharp-elbowed his own manchego clutch with breadstick chain out of the limelight. Actually, Steven was so good the palette knives came out. Let’s face it, there is no greater crime in reality TV – apart from sabotaging someone’s baked alaska – than being too good to be true.“I’m not confident with anything happening around my life … so how can the baking temperature be different?” With this profound ululation of self-effacement, the Eeyore of Bake Off shuffled into our lives. Rahul Mandal, an Indian research scientist who, in the best possible way, looked like a baby moulded by Aardman Animations, confessed he baked to make friends. He had only made his first cake two years earlier and, in his day job, continued to do “first-rate research using lasers”. Can you even imagine 2018 without Rahul? It would be as drab and joyless as a world without cake. No pressure then, series 10 ..."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3ed9c67711b910dc60a325d45cbd1701461e175/0_143_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ca46f6785b534c33448b777863d1b9d","title":"peaky blinders recap series five episode two the shelbys face a brutal new foe","story":"The Billy Boys plan to muscle in on the racetrack business. But they’re not King Tommy’s only worryPhew. I thought the opening episode set a cracking pace, but everything was ratcheted up a notch further tonight as a dangerous new player entered the mix, trailing bloody retribution and clouds of brimstone in his wake (alas poor Bonnie Gold, that was no way for a brave “fighter boy” to die).Nor was the brutal Jimmy McCavern’s arrival the only problem facing the Shelby family, with hints of betrayal everywhere and pressures mounting both in parliament and Birmingham. No wonder an increasingly paranoid Tommy is beginning to resemble a 1920s version of Shakespeare’s Richard III. A winter of discontent is almost certainly coming. If the king falls, who and how many will he take with him?As the old quote has it: “Just because you’re paranoid, doesn’t mean they’re not after you.” Certainly Tommy, swigging morphine in his very big house in the country, is not exactly at his most stable but it’s also true that he has good reason to feel besieged.At work, the saturnine Oswald Mosley clearly hopes to use him for his own gain, at home, the Billy Boys, led by the fearsome McCavern (Brian Gleeson), have designs on the racetrack business. Worst of all, there’s clearly more than one traitor in the family, given that Aberama Gold’s campsite location, which Michael couldn’t have known, was betrayed. (It is one of the few absolute truths on this show that Johnny Dogs is no traitor).So what of Michael? Long-time readers of this blog will know that I’ve never been convinced by the Shelby princeling. He’s always carried the whiff of unbridled ambition around his shoulders and that’s only got stronger since the move to New York. Is he being set up by the IRA or has he had contact with the Billy Boys?It’s a measure of the ambivalence of Finn Cole’s performance that I’m genuinely unsure. He could have his eyes on the main prize but he could equally easily be exactly as he seems – a hot-headed fool of a boy and out of his depth.I’m more interested in new wife Gina (Anya Taylor-Joy) who is clearly a lot sharper than she’s letting on. I wouldn’t be at all surprised if she turns out to be very dangerous indeed. (I also wouldn’t be surprised if she ends up training her sights on Tommy.)Finally, what about Lizzie? It was interesting to learn that the house and the legitimate business is in the second Mrs Shelby’s name and nice to be reminded that in the right mood she takes few prisoners. I’ve always felt that the Shelby clan, and the men in particular, have a tendency to underestimate Lizzie, and tonight’s episode underlined that. In fact, I rather think that Tommy’s great tragedy might be that she’s actually a good match for him, but he’s only going to realise it when it’s far, far too late.This is clearly going to be a series in which the Shelbys are under siege and the introduction of McCavern added a whole new dimension to the battle in hand.Fans of Irish crime thriller LoveHate will know that Gleeson is quite brilliant at being unhinged and the brief moments we saw of chief Billy Boy Jimmy suggested that he’s going to have a fine old time bringing vengeance to Small Heath. That said I have my doubts about his understanding of game theory given that the brutal death of Bonnie Gold is only going to send Aberama on the sort of revenge mission that wouldn’t be out of place in a Sam Peckinpah movie.If Jimmy kills first and deals with the consequences later, Mosley is an altogether more slippery beast. I enjoyed the conversation between him, Tommy and Ada, not least because Sam Claflin is clearly having so much fun with the role. We also learned that Mosley has made some sort of contact with whom I would presume are the UVF, given the later suggestion that the Billy Boys provide security at his rallies, although it was kept just ambiguous enough to suggest that the MP might be trying to play both sides. That said, I suspect that the “Irish question” is just so much obfuscation on Mosley’s part – his real interest lies in both Tommy’s populism and his brutality, which he hopes to harness to his own ends.Full marks for the use of Nadine Shah’s haunting Evil, a song about the corrosiveness nature of hate, ahead of Tommy’s meeting with Mosley.“May Carleton spoke about you the way I imagine one might about a party they barely remembered, where you crash the car into the dovecote and live on champagne and cocaine for three whole days – you know that kind of party?” He’s a terrible human being but Mosley appreciates a good bash.So what did you think? Can Tommy possibly escape all his enemies? Who is the traitor in the Shelby camp? Or is there more than one? And where do you stand on the great Irish v Scottish whisk(e)y debate? As always all speculation and no spoilers welcome below … "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/403c97415c9fcf37a9aa482b488d23bd27f99619/0_240_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8da255c9f4b643aafa574aeae4cc2b99","title":"poldark final episode review as gloriously hammy and cheesy as a croque monsieur","story":"The finale nearly sent me over the edge – but, like that moment in episode three when Dwight saved George as he was about to go over a cliff, they pulled it back - justPoldark recap: a big finale that was maddening, stressful … and joyousGeorge Warleggan appears, pistol in each hand, before taking out a French general and wounding the man who is about to kill Ross, and it may go down as the moment the show really lost it. I laughed out loud – for all Poldark’s intentional light relief, it is the earnest parts that make me want to giggle, although until now it has somehow managed to stay on the right side of ridiculous.It was the last ever episode – supposedly – of the gloriously entertaining show that has run on BBC One for five series. It has pushed me to my limits with its jumpy approach to time and ludicrous storylines, and the finale nearly sent me over the edge. And yet, like that moment when Dwight Enys grabbed George as he was about to go over the Cornish clifftop in episode three, they pulled it back. Just.Five months have passed since the penultimate episode. Morwenna is heavily pregnant, Caroline is still – implausibly – on at Dwight about being in love with Kitty Despard and Ross is acting strangely (as he warned Dwight he would). Demelza knows he is up to something, but suspects that something is troublemaker Tess Tregidden – devastatingly confirmed to her when she follows him. Heartbroken, she packs for Killewarren, Caroline’s house. “When did I lose you, Ross? I look in your face and see a stranger.” He can’t tell her the truth, which is that he has infiltrated a French gang – ahead of a French invasion – and stringing Tess along is supposedly all part of it.But the invasion is on – and before the peace agreement is to be signed! French general Jules Toussaint turns up at Nampara, news of which finds its way back to George and the slave traders at Trenwith. They are delighted that Ross appears to be betraying his country.But Ross – of course – has a plan. Dwight has to hide under a floorboard, and Zacky and the Carne boys have to do something with gunpowder. With Poldarkian speed, it all gets going – Ross and the general discuss plans, while Dwight, hidden under the floor, takes notes. But the document – bound for Wickham in London – is intercepted. Huzzah! Proof that Ross is a traitor. But what’s this? He is actually acting as an undercover agent? “Damn him. So he’ll be crowned as a hero,” sulks George. Unless they inform the general that he’s been had, they decide, treacherously.There follows a sequence as hammy and cheesy as a croque monsieur. “Forgive me if your carpet is stained, madam,” says Toussaint to Demelza, now he knows of Ross’s double-crossing, “but I must perform a small execution before we resume our conversation.” Demelza, always the quickest-witted Poldark, pretends to side with the Frenchman. “Can you truly think to rid me of this fiend?” she says, standing between her husband and Toussaint, stalling for time. For some reason – something to do with artistry – Toussaint decides not to shoot Ross and have a duel instead.Their moonlit swordfight seems to go on for so long that by the time Hanson decides to take matters into his own hands and shoot Ross himself, you’re almost cheering him on. And then George appears in his Tarantino moment, guns blazing. “I’d rather you kill the other one but we mustn’t be greedy,” says Ross, before they discuss whether to finish Hanson off and dispose of the bodies. If you have stuck with Poldark this far, you have a fairly high tolerance for such nonsense. There is a kind of rapprochement between George and Ross, arch-enemies all this time. “I’m indebted to you, nonetheless,” says Ross, “which is not a position I relish.” George smirks: “Whereas I revel in it.”There is just time to wrap it all up, and fairly satisfying it is too. Morwenna and Drake have a baby girl. Dwight and Caroline have a most touching scene, confronting the grief of losing their daughter but with hope for their future. Sam and the sweet-faced Rosina get married. Geoffrey Charles has his place back at military school. Even Valentine (Ross’s secret son) gets his own mine – but not the knowledge of his true father. George, his supposed dad, asks the Poldarks not to see him any more. “He is, after all, no relation,” he says, all pride and gritted teeth. Most importantly, Horace, Caroline’s pug, seems to have recovered from the poisoning incident. Which just leaves Ross and Demelza. With everything they’ve been through – and put the other through – they end the show as equals. Ross says she saved his life. “As you saved mine, long ago. When you took me from a dog fight, made me your scullery maid, and then your wife,” she replies. Quite why, even now, she puts up with him – he’s going off to be a spy in France while she’s pregnant – is one of the enduring mysteries of her character. Still, it allows the tantalising prospect that this isn’t the end, not really. She expects him back for the harvest (a chance for him to get that scythe out again). One last bit of Poldark smouldering: “I swear to you, my love, I will return.” It’s silly, eye-roll-inducing and the perfect farewell."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ddbff4f984dbd8a689675fbf820fc028c2d24d4/0_386_5906_3544/master/5906.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a8cf0370b5dc8d868fc9b3edd79385b","title":"israel accused of targeting iran allies in lebanon bombing","story":"Israel has also allegedly bombed Iraq recently, and claimed an attack on SyriaThe United Nation has called for maximum restraint after a reported drone attack in a Hezbollah stronghold south of Beirut that was blamed on Israel.A spokesman said the UN was unable to confirm the reports about Sunday’s incident, the latest in a series of reported attacks that have stoked a proxy conflict raging between Israel and Iran across the Middle East. “The United Nations calls on the parties to exercise maximum restraint both in action and rhetoric,” he said on Monday night. “It is imperative for all to avoid an escalation.”Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said Sunday’s strike was Israel’s first such hostile action since the 2006 war. It was followed by another alleged Israeli attack yesterday on an armed Palestinian faction in eastern Lebanon, according to the group and Lebanon’s national news agency.The Lebanese prime minister, Saad Hariri, told ambassadors from the UN security council’s five permanent members his government wanted to avoid a “dangerous escalation” of tensions, but that to do so would require the international community to reject Israel‘s “blatant violation”.Lebanon’s president, Michel Aoun, a political ally of Hezbollah, said the Israeli strikes were “similar to a declaration of war” and that the country had a right to defend itself. “We are a people seeking peace not war, and we don’t accept anyone threatening us in any war,” he said. Israel’s military said it would not comment on either of the two alleged attacks.A deepening confrontation between arch-enemies Iran and Israel has threatened further violence this month, as Israeli attacks have reportedly spread from Syria to Lebanon, and even as far as Iraq.The target of Monday’s attack, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command (PFLP-GC), is an ally of Hezbollah, Iran’s main proxy in Lebanon, and of the Syrian government, which is close to Tehran.Abu Wael Issam, an official with the PFLP-GC, said the strike was carried out by Israeli drones and did not inflict any casualties. He said his group’s “alternatives are open in confronting the Zionist enemy” but did not specify.Israel is concerned about Iran’s growing influence in the region and its ability to target the Jewish state as it spreads its own forces and alliedmilitia across war-torn Iraq and Syria. The US and the regional powerhouse Saudi Arabia have also sought to limit Tehran’s reach.In Lebanon, Iran has maintained a foothold for decades through Hezbollah, which fought a devastating month-long war with Israel in 2006. That war killed about 1,200 people in Lebanon, mostly civilians, and roughly 160 in Israel.Since then, the once-volatile border between the two countries has been mostly calm under a tacit agreement largely interpreted as a way to avoid a repeat of the destructive conflict.Instead, Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes in Syria, including on Hezbollah and other Iran-allied militia. Last year, Iranian forces retaliated by firing a barrage of rockets at Israeli military positions in the occupied Golan Heights, the first such direct attack of its kind.The semi-covert fight heated up this weekend when the Israeli army said it had taken action in Syria to prevent an Iranian force from launching an attack on its soil with “kamikaze” drones armed with explosives.Israel rarely acknowledges its attacks in Syria publicly. But according to a statement issued minutes after the army announced the strike, the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, congratulated his military. “Iran has no immunity anywhere,” he said. “Our forces operate in every sector against the Iranian aggression.”In less clear but potentially more consequential circumstances, the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said on Sunday Israel had also launched a failed “drone attack” on his Shia movement’s Beirut stronghold.“The time when Israeli aircraft come and bombard parts of Lebanon is over,” he said. “I say to the Israeli army along the border, from tonight be ready and wait for us. What happened yesterday will not pass.”Addressing Israelis, he said: “Do not live, do not rest, do not be reassured, and do not bet for a single moment that Hezbollah will allow ... aggression of this kind.”Hezbollah said both drones crashed and one damaged a media centre it runs in a residential building, causing “minor injuries”.In a statement issued late on Monday, Hezbollah said that two Israeli drones which crashed in Beirut on Sunday were carrying explosives. The suburbs “were subjected to an attack by rigged drones”, it said, with the first one failing to cause a blast and the second exploding.The Israeli army spokesman, Lt Col Jonathan Conricus, said the military had “listened closely to what Hassan Nasrallah said in his screaming and quite rampant speech”.“We are alert. We … are left wondering whether Hassan Nasrallah really wants to drag Lebanon into fighting with Israel,” he said.Israel’s military has acknowledged some of its attacks on Syria but has not spoken on the allegations it bombed Lebanon and Iraq.The Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/239a67e0bfbfc7e20b842117008f7e90e983a76b/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=986e140210e210280d7dee4c4280f900","title":"optimism may hold secret to longer life study suggests","story":"Research claims people who ‘look on the bright side’ stand better chance of reaching 85Seeing the glass as half full may mean a longer life, according to research suggesting that optimists not only live longer in general, but have a better chance of reaching 85 or older.It is not the first time optimism has been linked to health benefits. People of an upbeat disposition have previously been found to have a lower risk of heart conditions and premature death. Researchers now say it could also play a role in living a long life.The team behind the study say their findings could also be cause for cheer.“A lot of evidence suggests that exceptional longevity is usually accompanied by a longer  of good health and living without disability, so our findings raise an exciting possibility that we may be able to promote healthy and resilient ageing by cultivating psychosocial assets such as optimism,” said Lewina Lee, the lead author of the study at Boston University School of Medicine.While such a possibility has yet to be tested, Lee noted that other studies have shown optimism levels can be raised.Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Lee and colleagues report how they analysed data from two previous long-term research projects, one involving female nurses and the other focused on a cohort of men. The former were assessed for optimism in 2004, with participants having an average age of 70, and followed until 2014. For men, optimism was assessed in 1986, with participants having an average age of 62, and deaths tracked until 2016.The team split about 70,000 women into four equally sized groups, based on their scores for optimism. They then compared life for the most optimistic with the least, taking into account factors including age, sex, race, education, depression and other health conditions present at the outset.Research suggested people who are more optimistic might also lead a healthier lifestyle, thereforethe analysistook into account factors including exercise levels, diet, smoking and how much alcohol participants drank.These figures remained almost unchanged for women when social life was considered, although for men a clear link to optimism was no longer present – possibly because of the smaller size of the male group.Most of the participants in the study were white, and few had low socioeconomic status – meaning more research is needed to see if the findings hold in other groups. Also, income was only considered among the men, and for men and women optimism was only considered at one point in time.Lee said it was not yet clear why optimism is linked to longevity. “In our study, healthier behaviours, fewer depressive symptoms, and more social ties only partially accounted for the association from optimism to exceptional longevity,” she said, adding there are likely to be other mechanisms at play, such as optimistic people coping better with stress.Dr Catherine Hurt, an expert in health psychology at City, University of London, said the study highlighted the importance of psychological wellbeing alongside physical wellbeing for living a long and healthy life.“The results suggest that as well as educating and encouraging people to eat a balanced diet and exercise regularly to maximise longevity we should also be promoting psychological wellbeing and the importance of optimism,” she said. “An optimistic outlook appears to be a key part of a healthy lifestyle.” Lisa Bortolotti, the professor of philosophy at University of Birmingham, added other forms of optimism could also bring benefits. “We can also have biased views of our abilities and our future: we may think that we are excellent drivers, or that we will never get a orce, when evidence suggests otherwise. These biases can be good too. If we believe that we can attain our goals, we are more likely to persevere when difficulties arise.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba12e9b2cfa0025a744ba07f10a869ab4d5abff0/0_72_1350_810/master/1350.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ccb0b60b09ea3d33415626379585816e","title":"thai palace releases rare images of kings royal consort","story":"Informal pictures show Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi aiming a rifle and piloting planeThailand’s palace has released rare images and a biography of the king’s newly anointed royal consort, including candid and action-packed photos of her aiming a weapon on a firing range, piloting a plane and preparing to parachute.King Maha Vajiralongkorn bestowed the rank of “Chao Khun Phra”, or noble consort, on the 34-year-old former army nurse Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi on his 67th birthday in July.She is the first woman to receive the noble rank in nearly a century. The publication of the more than 60 photos and a 46-page biography was dated last week, but did not start circulating online until Monday.“The king has ordered the creation of a royal biography for Chao Khun Phra Sineenat Bilaskalayani,” a statement from the royal office said, using her full title.The images and details provide an unusually intimate glimpse into the private lives of the powerful, ultra-wealthy monarchy, which is protected by a royal insult law that carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison per count.They show Sineenat in camouflage fatigues, taking part in military drills, flying a small plane, and laughing at a table with the king, with both wearing casual clothes.In one of the photos she is shown in traditional Thai dress standing next to Vajiralongkorn and holding his hand.Born in the northern province of Nan, she graduated from the Royal Thai army nursing college, trained as a pilot in Thailand and abroad, and served in the king’s royal bodyguard unit, reaching the rank of major general in May.A cycling and aviation enthusiast who spends much of his time abroad in Germany, Vajiralongkorn was crowned in May in an elaborate three-day ceremony in which Sineenat participated.The ceremony took place days after a surprise announcement that Vajiralongkorn had married Queen Suthida Vajiralongkorn na Ayudhya, a former flight attendant and deputy commander of the monarch’s security detail.Suthida is the fourth wife of the monarch, who has a teenage son from his third marriage and six other children.The king is not as well-known to the public as his father, Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died in 2016. In the run-up to his coronation, billboards and government offices were peppered with large imposing portraits of him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb62718562a1f3ba6758f0465102a06840cfc70b/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2886190dfc9f9a59e824bc28d5928ecd","title":"upside kindest thing i ever saw","story":"’s Upside series asked readers to tell us about random acts of kindness they have witnessed. Hundreds of emails later, we collate the best.In the age of hysteria, polarisation and antagonism, it’s a relief to know that simple acts of kindness are not a thing of the past.’s Upside series asked its readers to write in this summer with stories of the kindness of strangers. Here is the best from the mailbag.I suspect most of us, distracted by whatever, have gone into a mall and paused in confusion upon leaving, trying in vain to remember where we parked in the relentless sea of cars the same colour as ours (in Arizona, white is popular for obvious reasons). That happened to my wife Mary yesterday.She is 83 and moves a little slowly. Part way down the first aisle, she realised that “lost car syndrome” had struck her. It was 105 degrees out.A young woman in a huge SUV stopped, lowered her window, and asked if she was having trouble locating the car. When Mary nodded, the woman said: “Happens to all of us. Get in. We’ll find it.”Mary has a handicapped tag, but doesn’t always use it. She didn’t think she had this time, but it turned out she was wrong. After a few circuits around the parking lot, she spotted it — in a handicapped space.The young lady let Mary out and with a wave and a smile, she drove off to her own parking challenge.Oh, how I would like to give that gracious young lady a warm hug. She made my day, and I wasn’t even there! Al Bell, Peoria, ArizonaA few months ago, I travelled from London to Liverpool for an interview at National Museums Liverpool. After the interview I thought I would visit some of the museums. My train was just before 5pm. And I hadn’t clocked quite how late I had cut it.Unfamiliar with the city, I thought getting a bus would take forever, so I jumped in a cab – with 12 minutes to spare before my very expensive ticketed train was leaving Liverpool Lime Street. Little did I know that some cabs in Liverpool don’t take cards. I had no cash on me. When the taxi driver dropped me off, I told him to wait and I would get cash out to give to him. He knew I was running late for the train, and waived the fee. Instead he said: “Don’t forget me if and when you get that job in Liverpool. Us Liverpudlians aren’t so bad.”He was such a kind man. Four months later, I got the job and moved to Liverpool. And I have never forgotten that first taste of Liverpool and its people.I made my train. And got the job. And just wanted to thank the taxi driver.Sahar Beyad, LiverpoolEver wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theMy daughter and I were visiting my elderly mother at her nursing home. We went into the lounge where the residents were sitting in a semicircle facing the tv which was on but which nobody was watching.As usual my mother beamed as she saw us draw up two chairs to sit in front of her. Conversation was difficult because my mother had no short-term memory but it didn’t seem to matter. About half way through our visit, the frail looking lady sitting next to my mother began to weep silently. Tears poured down her face and I’m ashamed to say I froze, not knowing what to say or do.My mother, who has dementia, knew exactly what to do. She took hold of her neighbour’s hand and stroked it gently with her thumb all the time looking with great concern into her face until slowly the crying ended.I was deeply moved, upset and worried about the reasons for the distress and put to shame by my mother whose immediate reaction was deeply humane. No words were exchanged between them, there was no need. I left feeling I’d been taught a valuable lesson.Jan Forster, CardiffOn my 29th birthday (I was in medical school then) I went to a restaurantbar with some friends for drinks.We had a bottle of wine and some other drinks and when we wanted to pay, the waiter said the wine had already been taken care of. The couple at the table next to ours had overheard us talking about our studies. They said they had once been students themselves without a lot of money and therefore wanted to do a nice thing for us. Oh and happy birthday. It completely made my night.Nina Loretz, ZurichI’d buggered my knee and was in a huge brace and on crutches, feeling wretched, miserable, afraid to go out in case I fell over and broke my arm, and in fairly constant pain.One day I was crossing the road at one of those big intersections that has a diagonal crossing. The countdown started and I could tell that I wasn’t going to make it across before the lights changed. A guy crossing at the same time saw me shooting panicked looks at the flashing sign and slowed down to walk at the same speed as me so I wasn’t alone in the middle of a busy intersection when the traffic resumed.Obviously the cars wouldn’t have run me over but it still made me feel much safer to not be the only one in the oncoming traffic.Kate Alley, LondonWhen I was sixteen (in 1965) I ran away from home. I lived on the streets for months and got into a pretty dire state. A girl I knew looked at my decaying teeth and told me: “You must come to see my father.”I was taken to a smart flat in Hampstead and was introduced to Dad, who was a Jewish refugee from the Nazis. Dr Frankel was a dentist with a private practice in Harley Street. He invited me to his surgery and, over several sessions, he gave me sixteen fillings – for free. Dear Dr Frankel, I still have all of my teeth (at seventy).John McAllister, BristolLast year my daughter and I were on the train from Carlisle to Manchester. There was a stag party, loud and pretty annoying, and getting cross looks from some passengers.Then along comes an older lady, who couldn’t find her case. She was going from compartment to compartment, desperately searching. One of the lads stands up, puts a hand on her shoulder and says: “Don’t worry love, I’ll help you find it.”The pair of them set about searching. Her station comes, and goes, and still the case isn’t found. She starts to cry. He takes her in his arms, gives her a soft hug and tells her that he’s not leaving her. He’ll stay with her till the case is found and until she’s gets to where she is going, even if it takes all day. She asks him about his plans and says that she can’t ruin his day. He says that it doesn’t matter. He won’t leave her. He tells his mates that he’ll see them tomorrow and then the pair of them go off to find the conductor. Over the next hour or so we watched as the case was found, and the two worked out a plan for how to get her back to her station. The lad had found a double seat in front of us and they spent the rest of their journey having the loveliest chat about her family, his family and the silly things they had both done in their lives.It was the sweetest thing I have ever experienced. And I wished it had been me who had jumped up to help. That lad sacrificed a stag night to help someone who could have been his Nan, and I think everyone in that compartment wished we were him, and we all had a smile on our face and a tear in our eye.Judith RaddatzMy husband is English and I’m Indian. In 2018, we decided to have a small register marriage ceremony in England to get a head start on the visa application process.As everything was done on a really short notice, none of my friends could make it to the wedding, so there I was at the hotel getting ready all by myself on the big day, wishing at least one friend was there with me to share my excitement, anticipation, happiness and everything associated with a wedding day.At this point I was interrupted by a knock on the door. I opened the door to a girl from the downstairs bar holding a small bottle of prosecco in one hand and a glass in other. She hugged me, handed me the prosecco and said she was sorry my friends couldn’t make it, but no bride should be getting ready by herself without a little bridal party.I barely knew her, but she made me a little less homesick for my friends and I felt a little less alone. Her kindness and thoughtfulness is one of my fondest memories of my wedding day.Surya Vishnu, WinchesterToday an unknown friend came to my rescue in the supermarket when I had put three items through the self-checkout and found I had left my debit card at home. Next in the queue, she stepped forward and put her card on the machine and paid my small bill, saying it was just her good deed for the day.I hope she has had the same warm glow that I have had for the rest of the day! Also that I see her again to repay her random act of kindness!Elise ForbesI had grabbed a coffee and was lingering outside Kings Cross station waiting for a train. Amidst the busy lunchtime throng I spotted a young lady walking towards the station’s entrance with a takeaway bag of food. It was fairly large and I presumed she was doing the lunchtime run for her colleagues.But to my surprise she casually approached a nearby homeless man and gave the bag to him. She said a few words and quietly returned the way she came. A heartwarming moment.Tim Bechervaise, WiltshireToday I was walking to the shops with my ten month old in a sling, when it started absolutely pouring down. I tried huddling under a tree with an umbrella and a waterproof coat around us both, but the rain was too heavy and we were both still getting wet.I looked up and there were people hurrying out of the park. A lady seemed to be headed towards us purposefully, but I didn’t think much of it. As she approached she said “I live just up here – would you like to come in and take shelter from the rain?” She let us wait inside for the rain to pass before we set off again for the shops.  This is just one of several random acts of kindness I have been the lucky recipient of since having a baby. It has really restored my faith in humanity in these testing political times. Lizzie Thomson, SheffieldIn the days before we all had mobile phones, I’d been invited to give an address at a conference held at a Dutch university. My contact person there seemed a classic absent-minded professor when it came to travel arrangements and was forgetful about answering emails requesting clarification. The result was that I got off the train from Amsterdam at the station he’d instructed, but it was tiny, apparently out in the middle of nowhere and seemed all but deserted.As I looked around baffled, a Dutch man who’d got off the same train asked if I needed help. I explained I was going to the university and was supposed to take a taxi from the station. He told me I was a long way from the university and there were no taxis, but he’d be happy to drive me.It must have been a 20-minute drive and it was, I ascertained, out of his way. When he dropped me at the university reception, I thanked him profusely and asked if I could pay him, but he just waved me on with a smile. I don’t know what I would have done without him!Anne Marie KarlsonWhen I was in university in Dublin I was working late one night and ran to get the last bus home. I was the only person left on the bus when the driver shouted back to me asking me where I was going. I said I was going home and told him where I lived, the bus driver then changed his route and dropped me at my door!Miriam Phelan, LondonAt our academy, I gave up my office space for an additional student entrance and lobby space at school and was going to move my stuff into a new, unfurnished space over the summer holidays.When I came back after the first week of the holidays, our site manager had moved everything out of my office, hung all of my posters, pictures and display boards and set the new office up better than I ever could have, and even included a USA feature wall to remind me of home. After such a long school year and all the challenges of maintaining our site I was completely knocked out that he would think to do that, take the time and make such a kind effort.

Politics editor Heather Stewart writes that it appears Corbyn may be willing to support Boris Johnson in calling a general election – but the Labour leader is being called on to do so only if an extension of article 50 has been secured first and a 31 October no-deal Brexit averted.The shadow attorney general and barrister Shami Chakrabarti has given legal advice to Corbyn that if Boris Johnson shuts down parliament to force through a hard Brexit, it would be the “gravest abuse of power and attack on UK constitutional principle in living memory”. Johnson has refused to rule out proroguing parliament, instead calling for “parliamentarians to do the right thing” and not further delay Brexit. As the G7 summit concludes, Heather Stewart explains what we learned from Johnson’s performance – most of all, that this is his dream job “and he is absolutely loving it”.‘False and dangerous’ – Johnson \u0026amp Johnson has been ordered to pay $572m in compensation in the state of Oklahoma for running a “false and dangerous” sales campaign that drove America’s deadly opioid epidemic. The judgment is the first of its kind against the drug industry in the United States, where a raft of opioid makers, distributors and pharmacy chains face more than 2,000 other lawsuits. The Oklahoma judge found Johnson \u0026amp Johnson acted in concert with other companies to escalate prescriptions by pushing the false narrative that there was a desperate need for painkillers and “there was a low risk of abuse and a low danger of prescribing opioids”. Opioid prescribing peaked in 2012 at about 250m prescriptions, one for every American adult.‘Outrageous persecution’ – The Australian novelist and former Chinese diplomat Yang Hengjun has been charged with espionage in Beijing. Yang has been detained in China since January, and is being held in Beijing by the ministry of state security. The Australian embassy has been informed that Yang has been formally charged, “suspected of committing espionage crimes”. Dr Feng Chongyi, an academic at the University of Technology Sydney and a friend of Yang’s who was previously detained and interrogated by authorities in China over a study trip, said there was no evidence to support any allegation of spying against Yang. “I am furious at the news,” he said. “This is outrageous political persecution. I hope the international community will join hands to demand the release of Yang.”Hot, then fresh – Heatwave conditions are set to continue for some parts of the UK, with southern and eastern parts expected to see a fourth day of temperatures in the early 30s today. It is expected to remain largely dry with scattered showers and fresher air gradually moving in from the south-west coast and through the midlands. The Met Office said heavy rain and thunderstorms could come later in the week. A high of 33.2C (91.7F) at Heathrow yesterday made it the hottest August bank holiday Monday on record.“A battle is being fought today in the public squares, at political conventions, on the television, in the opinion pages: a battle of storytelling about migrants,” writes Suketu Mehta. “The recent elections across the world illustrate the power of populism: a false narrative, a horror story about the other, well told. In all the rich countries, people think immigrants are a much bigger share of the population than they really are. A quarter of the French, one in five Swedes and one in seven Americans think immigrants get twice as much in benefits as the native-born – it is not remotely true in any of these countries.“But there are also countertrends and counterexamples. Multiple studies have found that people who have direct contact with immigrants have much more positive views about them. And there are leaders who welcome migrants: France elected the unapologetically pro-immigrant Emmanuel Macron, while Germany under Angela Merkel welcomed a million refugees in 2015. In Canada Justin Trudeau’s government declared its intention to increase immigration and the economy had the strongest growth in the G7 in 2017. When countries safeguard the rights of minorities, they also safeguard the rights and economic wellbeing of their majorities, or other minorities within the majority. The obverse is also true: when they don’t safeguard the rights of minorities, every other citizen’s rights are in peril.”In the biggest summer in English cricket history Ben Stokes has stood head and shoulders above the rest, says Moeen Ali.

Meanwhile,  cricket writers are weighing in on whether Stokes’s century was the great Test innings of all time.A few hours after the unveiling of a statue to honour the great Althea Gibson, the American’s spiritual heir, Venus Williams, progressed to the second round of the US Open in a blistering hour and six minutes.

Photograph: iStockThe number of calls to St Vincent de Paul (SVP) regarding the cost of going back to school has increased by almost 5 per cent this year, the charity has said.Last week, it received between 250 and 300 calls per day from concerned parents who feared they would not be able to pay for books, uniforms and other school necessities.Calling for action to alleviate the financial pressure on families, the charity said the number of families seeking help with school costs has increased for the third year in a row, with 6,250 calls received on the issue this summer.However, the charity believes the true number of families struggling with school costs is much higher because some parents seek help to pay for other bills, after already prioritising back-to-school expenses.A recent survey by the Irish League of Credit Unions found that 78 per cent of parents were struggling with back-to-school costs this year, up from 68 per cent last year.Over a third fell into debt this year, and 24 per cent said they would go to moneylenders to find the funds for school supplies.Alleviate pressureIn an effort to alleviate this pressure, SVP is calling on the Department of Education to make school books free across all primary and secondary schools, and to end the voluntary contribution system in all non-fee paying schools.Marcella Stakem, SVP policy officer, said if these measures were implemented it would “significantly reduce the financial stress placed on parents”.“The underinvestment in our education system at both primary and secondary level limits the potential of children and puts significant pressure on low-income families,” Ms Stakem said.“It is imperative that long-term measures are taken now to ensure that the current and future cohorts of students can participate in school on an equal footing regardless of their parents’ economic status. Education is a powerful predictor of life chances in adulthood.”She added: “If we really want all children and young people to have access to good opportunities, we have to stop making cost a barrier to participation.”Meanwhile, Minister for Welfare Regina Doherty has urged any parents with school-going children, who have not yet applied for the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance, to check out their entitlement to the scheme as they may qualify for a payment, depending on their financial circumstances.Eligible childThe allowance is a once-off payment of €150 for each eligible child aged between 4 and 11, or €275 for each eligible child aged between 12 and 22.Eligible children must be in full-time education and the total household income must be below certain thresholds, depending on the family situation.To date, more than 130,000 families have received the allowance payment in respect of 239,230 children since July, when this year’s scheme commenced.Ms Doherty said this time of year can be “particularly stressful” for many families.“The Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance provides valuable support to eligible families to assist with the extra costs when children start school each autumn and this year we are providing for an additional €25 payment per child,” she said.“I would urge anybody who has not yet applied to check their eligibility for the scheme, which provides a once-off payment to assist with the costs of school clothing and footwear.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3997762.1566832954!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"who are the beef plan movement","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe group said it had not organised the recent pickets on Sunday and Monday where a number of farmers resumed protests outside plants, which had been called off prior to entering the talksThe Beef Plan Movement started off as a WhatsApp group made up of a number of farmers, primarily based in the Meath area. Before it took off the social media messaging app groupchat totalled around 300 members, that was nine months ago.Now the organisation estimates it has around 20,000 members across the country, with 25 county committees set up.The grassroots organisation formed around a draft plan for better conditions and pricing for beef farmers. In its own words, the organisation states it was set up in the “hope of saving and rejuvenating beef farming in Ireland before it’s too late”.The organisation gained national prominence in recent weeks, following pickets outside of meat processing factories. The protests later led to talks hosted by the Department of Agriculture.The negotiations included Beef Plan Movement, the Irish Farmers’ Association, Meat Industry Ireland, the representative body for processors, and Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed.However, despite a range of concessions for farmers, Beef Plan Movement has said it does not endorse an agreement reached at the talks last week.Eamon Corley is co-founder and chairman of the group’s national committee, and runs a farm in Co Meath.Hugh Doyle, is co-founder and vice-chair, and runs a herd of 100 Limousine, Charolais and Simmental suckler cows on his farm in Summerhill, Co Meath.The organisation has incorporated a company, Beef Plan Movement Company Ltd.

The group said it had not organised the recent pickets, in place at around six plants, following the conclusion of the negotiations.Another factor that will compound difficulties is the volume of animals for sale peaks in the Autumn every year, such is the production cycle.All this is re-applying pressure on Minister Creed to intervene again to resolve a dispute that has quickly become repolarised."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3998608.1566894646!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"optimism may hold secret to longer life study suggests","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSeeing the glass as half full may mean a longer life. Photograph: iStockSeeing the glass as half full may mean a longer life, according to research suggesting optimists not only live longer in general, but have a better chance of reaching 85 or older.It is not the first time optimism has been linked to benefits. People with a chipper mindset have previously been found to have a lower risk of heart conditions and premature death. Researchers now say it could also play a role in living a long life.The team behind the study say their findings could also be cause for cheer.“A lot of evidence suggests that exceptional longevity is usually accompanied by a longer  of good health and living without disability, so our findings raise an exciting possibility that we may be able to promote healthy and resilient ageing by cultivating psychosocial assets such as optimism,” said Lewina Lee, the lead author of the study at Boston University School of Medicine.While such a possibility has yet to be tested, Lee noted other studies have shown that optimism levels can be raised.Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Lee and colleagues report how they analysed data from two previous long-term research projects, one involving female nurses and the other focused on male military veterans. The former were assessed for optimism in 2004, with participants having an average age of 70, and followed until 2014. For men, optimism was assessed in 1986, with participants having an average age of 62, and deaths tracked until 2016.The team split about 70,000 women into four equally sized groups, based on their scores for optimism. They then compared life for the most optimistic with the least, taking into account factors including age, sex, race, education, depression and other health conditions present at the outset.The results show the most optimistic group of women had a life almost 15 per cent longer than the least.Similar results were seen in men, even though optimism was measured slightly differently. When the team compared the fifth of men boasting the highest optimism scores with the least optimistic, they found the most positive men had lifes almost 11 per cent longer.Research suggested people who are more optimistic might also lead a healthier lifestyle, thereforethe analysis took into account factors including exercise levels, diet, smoking and how much alcohol participants drank.The resulting effects were smaller - although still pronounced - with the most optimistic group of women having a 9 per cent longer life than the least optimistic. The most optimistic fifth of men had a 10 per cent longer life than the least.These figures remained almost unchanged for women when social life was considered, although for men a clear link to optimism was no longer present - possibly because of the smaller size of the male group.‘Exceptional longevity’But being optimistic was not only linked to a longer life. For men and women it was also linked more specifically to living to 85 or older - “exceptional longevity” when health behaviours were taken into account, with the most optimistic group of women having 20 per cent better odds of reaching age 85 than the least.Most of the participants in the study were white, and few had low socioeconomic status - meaning more research is needed to see if the findings hold in other groups. Also, income was only considered among the men, and for men and women optimism was only considered at one point in time.Lee said it was not yet clear why optimism is linked to longevity. “In our study, healthier behaviours, fewer depressive symptoms, and more social ties only partially accounted for the association from optimism to exceptional longevity,” she said, adding there are likely to be other mechanisms at play, such as optimistic people coping better with stress.Dr Catherine Hurt, an expert in health psychology at City, University of London, said the study highlighted the importance of psychological wellbeing alongside physical wellbeing for living a long and healthy life.“The results suggest that as well as educating and encouraging people to eat a balanced diet and exercise regularly to maximise longevity we should also be promoting psychological wellbeing and the importance of optimism,” she said. “An optimistic outlook appears to be a key part of a healthy lifestyle.” Lisa Bortolotti, the professor of philosophy at University of Birmingham, added other forms of optimism could also bring benefits. “We can also have biased views of our abilities and our future: we may think that we are excellent drivers, or that we will never get a orce, when evidence suggests otherwise. “These biases can be good too. If we believe that we can attain our goals, we are more likely to persevere when difficulties arise.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Optimists not only live longer in general, but have a better chance of reaching 85 or olderThree students have been harvesting vegetables to supply to local hotels and restaurantsUptake of MMR vaccine in several wealthy areas slides, according to official figuresOireachtas group critical of Government reluctance to identify flawed tendering processPotentially lethal virus can trigger cervical cancer in women and carcinomas in menDiarmuid Martin calls for radical reform of St Patrick\u0026rsquos College, of which he is a trusteeCourt grants three-year barring order preventing husband from being near family homeTwilight years can be enhanced by focusing on the physical environment, say expertsGovernment department says it may be necessary to share identity \u0026lsquoon occasion\u0026rsquoSVP charity calls for free school books and the abolition of voluntary contributionUSI report on mental health finds that almost one in four \u0026lsquovery unlikely\u0026rsquo to seek helpI often wonder how my pupils will have changed over the holidaysFestival\u0026rsquos 60th edition competes with All-Ireland build-up for Kerry\u0026rsquos attentionGarda\u0026iacute appeal for witnesses after Vincent Parsons died at Tallaght Hospital on Monday eveningClosure of Donegal Animal Hospital in Letterkenny caused significant difficulties for local farmersExposes them to accusations they are legacies of or agents for western interventionProfessional body would engage with Government over funding and staffing levelsSelf Help Africa joins the country\u0026rsquos effort to plant four billion trees this year"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3998147.1566854781!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"electric vehicles time to start paying for power","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe ESB has missed two deadlines to introduce “charging for charging” and now says it will make an announcement on the matter next month. The announcement on Monday of extra charging points for electric vehicles (EVs) is welcome news for early adaptors to the green technology. But local authorities rolling out the scheme need to learn from the experience of ESB and ensure charging is not free.That may seem like a strange argument for an EV-owner to make but anyone who has, like this reporter, tried to charge their vehicle at an ecar point will testify to the problem of freeloading.Because fast chargers are rare, and because electricity is free at the ESB points, some motorists are choosing to overstay their welcome thus leaving their cars plugged in for an unnecessarily long time, thereby preventing others from charging up.Where once EV drivers felt camaraderie at charge points, now they are more likely to feel frustration as they witness someone squeezing the last ion of electricity out of a cable, a process that gets slower as the car fills beyond 80 per cent.It is particularly galling to meet someone who paid over €100,000 for a big battery Tesla S, hanging on for an hour or more at a “fast” charger because they don’t want to spend a relatively small sum to complete the charging at home.Of course, owners of big battery cars like the Teslas and the Hyundai Kona – the model recently purchased by Minister for Transport Shane Ross – have as much right as anybody else to use the public charging network. But charging is fast up to about 80 per cent, then the machine slows down to a point where the car would fill as quickly at a “slow” or standard 22kWh charger.Photographs of EVs “hogging”chargers for an hour or more are now regularly posted on social media in an indication of growing frustration among users, among whom there is no consensus on etiquette.At shopping centres as erse as Bray, Co Wicklow Lucan Co Dublin and Drogheda, Co Louth people debate – sometimes hotly – whether you are allowed to hook up to the power supply and go shopping.There are less than 80 fast chargers in the Republic. Between Blanchardstown and Monaghan on the M3N3 there is one. It is in Navan and this reporter has met a lovely man there who told me he pops in to leave the car to charge and walks up to the town to do his shopping.Fast chargersThere are no public fast chargers within the canal cordon in Dublin. Why?Another issue is the use of public chargers in train stations. Somebody decided that these should not only supply free electricity, but parking should be free while vehicles are charging - thus incentivising some EV owners to overstay.In the Republic, Tesla is developing its own fast charging network. Ionity, a pan EU charge network, has multiple fast chargers at two points on the M8 and M11. EasyGo has chargers at the Supermacs Plaza at Kinnegad as well as in Monaghan Town. But the industry is in its infancy here because nobody can compete with the ESB giving electricity away free.Pat McDonagh of Supermacs recently announced he would pick up the cost for electricity at Kinnegad, simply because electric vehicles were queuing at Enfield for the free ESB charger.The ESB has missed two deadlines to introduce “charging for charging” and now says it will make an announcement on the matter next month. It needs to happen soon because free fuel is iding EV users into the truly green, and the truly mean."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons august 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Order The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Brexit latest news: Sir Keir Starmer says Remainer parties should focus on finding legislation with \u0026#39legal bite\u0026#39UK weather: Stay out of the sun, Met Office warns as heatwave extends into fourth day Audio Briefings: Sign up to our WhatsApp group for essential twice-daily updatesTuesday morning news briefing: End of mobile blind spots?Comment: Fixing Mrs May\u0026#39s deal won\u0026#39t be easy, but Boris deserves a chance to try\tComment: Sunshine, Stokes and Sanditon.

With the government declaring that we must be carbon-neutral within 30 years we need to find a way to take the carbon out of our heating system.“The opportunity that has become clear to the decentralised energy community is the idea of capturing waste heat and putting it to use locally.”British Sugar’s factory in Wissington, Norfolk, pipes excess heat produced from cooking syrup into a neighbouring 18-hectare (45-acre) greenhouse used to grow medical cannabis. It also pumps some of its carbon emissions into the greenhouse for the plants to convert to oxygen.Brexit latest news: Sir Keir Starmer says Remainer parties should focus on finding legislation with \u0026#39legal bite\u0026#39UK weather: Stay out of the sun, Met Office warns as heatwave extends into fourth day Audio Briefings: Sign up to our WhatsApp group for essential twice-daily updatesTuesday morning news briefing: End of mobile blind spots?Comment: Fixing Mrs May\u0026#39s deal won\u0026#39t be easy, but Boris deserves a chance to try\tComment: Sunshine, Stokes and Sanditon.

When someone of his standing makes a statement like that, it should give pause for thought.But according to Daniel Pitchford, co-founder of AI Business, this view, while pretty common, is over-egging the situation slightly.Pitchford set up AI Business, an “online content portal for artificial intelligence and its real-world applications” back in 2014 with the intention of demystifying AI for businesses and trying to cut through some of the more hyperbolic beliefs about AI.There is no doubting Musk is not alone in his apocalyptic view of AI so Pitchford clearly has his work cut out in converting the business masses but what, in his view, is behind this rather extreme reaction?\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

What is the ROI and outcome before you start. Is that realistic?\u0026nbsp“A lot of people think AI is going to change the world and if they plug a piece of software or application on top of what they are already doing\u0026nbsptheir business is going to transform overnight, and then end up bitterly disappointed when it isn’t,” he says.The fear stems from change. Whether it is AI or whether it is the industrial revolution – whatever the change is – that is what people fear because humans don’t really like to changeWhich is where he hopes his business can play a crucial role. Starting out as a blog written in his and his business partner’s spare time, AI Business quickly grew to become a trusted source of AI insight for business across the world by producing business-useful content, in contrast to the academic content that dominated at the time.But with his background in business event production, Pitchford was aware that for AI Business to become truly indispensable to the business community, it had to adopt a thoroughly analogue approach and bring vendors and businesses together face to face.From 400 attendees at its\u0026nbspinaugural AI Summit in London in 2016, AI Business is now the leading brand globally hosting events in London, New York, San Francisco, Munich, Hong Kong, Singapore and Cape Town. The 2019 Summit in London alone drew 25,000 AI enthusiasts.So clearly there is an appetite to understand the applications and implications of AI in the business world,\u0026nbspbut what is the destination?\u0026nbsp“Ultimately, the future of AI is about increasing productivity and that’s what politicians and governments get excited about – what can it do for our GDP? That is the big end goal,” Pitchford explains.Elon Musk’s AI project to replicate the human brain just received $1bnA 2017 report from PWC estimated that UK GDP could increase by more than 10 per cent\u0026nbspby 2030 as a result of AI, a cash equivalent of £232bn, which is no small shakes.But the UK is not the only nation eyeing the benefits of AI, with Pitchford outlining a global AI arms race between China and the US, each vying for the position of the world’s AI superpower.“A lot of people are saying China will emerge as the AI superpower. Over the last two years, Asia has overtaken Europe in terms of the amount being invested by enterprises and businesses in the adoption of AI whereas two years ago, Europe was ahead.”He says that China’s rapid emergence can be explained by the level of investment the Chinese government is putting into AI with latest estimates placing it as high as $300bn\u0026nbsp(£240bn): “As you move from innovation to implementation there is a massive opportunity which they are acutely aware of, hence the investment they are pouring in.”Such is the rate of change in AI development and implementation, it would be foolish to bet on any one nation or region becoming the dominant power just yet. But in the meantime, AI Business\u0026nbspintends to build on its own dominance in this space following its recent acquisition by publishing giant Informa.“The future is scale,” Pitchford says. “What we have with Informa is that opportunity of scale. The scale of the events and other acquisitions made by the group help that in terms of collaboration and opportunities.”And as for the allegedly demonic heart of AI? Pitchford says that proponents are acutely aware of the potential dangers and are actively addressing it.“There is a lot being invested by the big players in understanding how AI can support society rather than just generate profit,” he says.\u0026nbspSo perhaps the robot apocalypse might yet be averted by traditional human compassion.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

And I’d enjoyed it.\u0026nbspI couldn’t tell you the last time that happened.\u0026nbspThis led me to ask a question: with the British town centre in crisis –\u0026nbspthe number of vacant premises at its\u0026nbsphighest level for more than four years –\u0026nbspis there anything we could learn from the place?Labour promises free wifi in town centres and scrapping ATM chargesHigh streets propose five-year plan for digital technology sales boostYou have to be a little bit careful at the outset. We’re talking here about a picturesque and historic walled town in the middle of a region that attracts a large number of visitors.You’re not going to be able to replicate what it has across Britain. \u0026nbspBut here’s the thing: similarly\u0026nbsptouristy places\u0026nbspon this side of the channel are struggling in a way that Dinan at least doesn’t appear to be.Nationally, the British Retail Consortium puts the vacancy rate at 10.3 per cent. Footfall declined by 1.9 per cent in July.\u0026nbspIt isn’t just economically deprived areas that are struggling either. Last year it was reported that there were 42 vacant premises in the picturesque city of Bath, for example. It’s a good deal bigger than Dinan, but is a similar tourist trap thanks to the world-famous Roman baths, which have given the city the status of a Unesco\u0026nbspworld heritage site and put it high on the itinerary of visitors to the region.\u0026nbspCampaigner Luke John Emmett successfully drew attention to the city centre’s plight with the aid of a camera. He says while landlords have made efforts to make some of the empty premises look less unsightly since then, and new tenants are promised, the problem continues.\u0026nbspAs retailers continue to close stores, the issue of empty shopfronts looks set to continue to plague the British high street.\u0026nbspSo to Dinan. What made mooching around the place such a pleasure was the sheer variety of what this small town had to offer.\u0026nbspOf course we saw places catering for the tourist euro, but there were also bookshops, a toyshop, bakeries, a place where a bloke was selling lights built out of scrap, an indoor market.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We even found a steampunk and Harry Potter emporium.Add in the inevitable profusion of cafes, something France does so very well, and you’ve an enticing mix.\u0026nbspThe lack of the chains that have homogenised British shopping centres, and made them boring, was a big plus point for me. It’s not that they aren’t there. There was, of course, a Carrefour convenience outlet, broadly equivalent to Tesco . There was also a bookie, in the form of a PMU bar. But they weren’t dominant features in\u0026nbspthe same way that they are in Britain.\u0026nbspThe retreat of the chains could provide an opportunity for small and more specialist outlets to move in, especially in places like Bath which have a ready supply of visitors.But, of course, there are high rents to contend with and the running sore of business rates linked to property values that are far\u0026nbsphigher in town centres than they are on the outskirts where internet retailers like Amazon build their warehouses.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

It would certainly help if the nation could find a government willing and able to breathe it in.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

On Friday, the website still showed the remaining property – a five-bedroom house – as available for sale at a price of £875,000.One HAB investor, who put in several thousand pounds, was quoted as saying: “I’m disappointed that what I saw as an idealistic project seems to be collapsing on a sour note, with the original directors having departed and investors seemingly left to bear the entire financial burden of a failed enterprise.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pretty Woman certainly isn’t good, with an undercurrent of sleaze so disquieting that it’s no real surprise to learn it was once planned to be a gritty sex work drama that ended in tragedy. But Julia Roberts is pure star-is-born loveliness here, beloved by the camera and endlessly watchable as a result, her joyous pluck overshadowing the rest of the film’s murkier elements. That Disney, the studio behind the film, imagined its aspirational romcom hero as a rich businessman prowling Hollywood Boulevard for an escort is slightly maddening. That Pretty Woman somehow pulls it off… even more so.There are a few moments in this high-school re-telling of George Bernard Shaw\u0027s Pygmalion – in which, due to an elaborate bet, popular jock Zach (Freddie Prinze Jr) attempts to turn artsy nerd Laney Boggs (Rachael Leigh Cook) into the Prom Queen in six weeks – that pull the rug out from under your feet. One such moment is when Laney finds out about Zach’s ploy. “Am I a bet? Am I a bet? Am I a f**king bet?” It is raw, painful, and elevates the film well above your average high-school romcom.Saving Face is both a romantic comedy about gay women, and a romantic comedy about two Asian-Americans, making it a double rarity in the genre. But its loveliest quality is its Manhattan earthiness, with its smoky streets, subway cars, fire escapes and cheap take-out places, all backdrops to the tentative relationship between surgeon Michelle Krusiec and dancer Lynn Chen.Partly because she was its last high-profile “queen”, Katherine Heigl has often been positioned as the actor that killed the romantic comedy. Which is unfair for a host of reasons, but specifically because both Knocked Up and 27 Dresses are such pristine examples of how great the romcom can still be. 27 Dresses is the more traditional of the pair, Heigl surrounded by stock characters (including Judy Greer once again cast as the sad-sack best friend, as she did in the Jennifer Lopez vehicle The Wedding Planner) and playing a brunette and therefore unlucky-in-love single New Yorker obsessed with weddings. But she is such a delightfully prickly and neurotic presence that it makes up for the film’s lesser qualities. We truly didn’t appreciate her at the time.530 26. Playing by Heart (1998)Not strictly a romantic comedy, buoyed as it is by serious drama involving everything from infidelity to AIDS, Playing by Heart is one of those talky, interconnected, Robert Altman-esque indies that dominated so much of American cinema in the Nineties. But the reason it’s here is because two of its many storylines feature lighter pairings that appear unlikely on paper but somehow become incredibly compelling and tender in execution. In one, Angelina Jolie and Ryan Phillippe meet at an LA bar and begin a romance in another, Gillian Anderson and Jon Stewart meet in a bookstore and begin dating. Both stories develop from there, with Sean Connery, Gena Rowlands, Ellen Burstyn and Madeleine Stowe among the recognisable faces orbiting them. But whatever the tone of each seemingly unrelated story, Playing by Heart is driven by a lovely, nostalgic sense of Los Angeles ennui at the end of the 20th century. No one has heard of this movie, and that’s a shame.Crazy Rich Asians may not have saved the romantic comedy last summer, as everyone predicted it would, but it remains a breathless celebration of the genre – with a far-too-late-in-the-day but still wholly appreciated ersity at its centre. Constance Wu is the New York economics professor who discovers her apparently Average Joe fiancee is in fact Singapore royalty. What follows is a fish-out-of-water comedy that both indulges in its gorgeous opulence while never becoming too in awe of it. Michelle Yeoh is a standout, as a high society matriarch intimidatingly protective of her son.Few romantic comedies are more nakedly aspirational about big-city jobs, capitalism and the social power of being busy than One Fine Day, a mid-Nineties comedy about two single parents thrust together when their hectic schedules mean their children miss the class trip. There are far too many big cellphones here, but Michelle Pfeiffer and an ER-era George Clooney, as the squabbling pair at its centre, must surely rank as one of the most beautiful romantic comedy couples in recent memory.The first black, mainstream romantic comedy to possess the same aspirational sheen as their white counterparts, Boomerang is a lively battle-of-the-sexes comedy with Eddie Murphy as a powerful, womanising advertising executive spurned by his female doppelganger (Robin Givens). Grace Jones, Eartha Kitt and a young Halle Berry make for wonderful supporting players, but Boomerang’s secret weapon is Givens, who gives a performance with so much sparkiness that it’s enraging her volatile marriage to Mike Tyson overshadowed much of her acting career.Released a decade after Knocked Up, Seth Rogen’s adorable if occasionally bro-heavy first stab at the romcom, Long Shot bears the fruits of a man who has fixed some of his more regressive tendencies in the interim, producing something smarter, more sensitive and as interested in the feelings, neuroses and dialogue of his female co-star as he is to himself. He is a left-wing journalist recruited as a speechwriter for his former babysitter (Charlize Theron), who is now the US Secretary of State, and the pair forge an unshakable bond despite their wildly juxtaposed looks and vocations in life. Against the odds, Theron and Rogen are adorable together, while the film strikes a wonderful balance between sweetness and crudity. Long Shot may have flopped at the box office, but it’s the closest thing we’ve had to a romcom classic in years.A perfect encapsulation of the Fifties, specifically the allure of the European jet-set, the idealised rat-a-tat-tat magic of big-city journalists, and the otherworldly regality of Audrey Hepburn, Roman Holiday is more of a time machine than most of the films here. But it’s also a true-blue classic, its “famous woman paired with ordinary man” plot inspiring everything from Notting Hill to The Lizzie McGuire Movie, and appropriately beloved as a result. There’s no Hilary Duff, obviously, but we won’t hold that against it.Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a bit like peering into a time capsule a reminder of a time when Russell Brand was (nearly) a Hollywood A-lister, and people believed Jason Segel could be a movie star. Of the post-Judd Apatow era of romantic comedies, this remains the best, however – nicely balancing genuine sweetness and pathos (Mila Kunis is at the peak of her adorability as Segel’s love interest) with A-grade smut (Segel’s two full-frontal nude scenes remain hilariously shocking no matter how often you’ve seen them). There’s also a puppet musical thrown in for good measure, which is never not welcome.Very loudly not fun but still something quietly extraordinary, The Break-Up is a romcom in reverse, with Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn a couple at the end of their tether, who really shouldn’t be together and break up before the opening credits roll, and then muddle through the following 90 minutes figuring out what to do next. Aniston, always underrated as a movie star, is brilliantly magnetic, while Vaughn nicely downplays the manic energy that tends to suffocate his on-screen partners in his other roles. The film’s closer, a thoughtful, heartfelt celebration of having once loved someone regardless of how it all ended, is one of the bravest things an expensive studio romcom has done in recent decades.This satirical comedy set at a gay conversion camp has, quite clearly, a lot more than romance on its mind. But Jamie Babbit’s pink satin-coloured debut is most memorable for the brewing relationship between Clea DuVall’s Graham and Natasha Lyonne’s Megan. One is more in denial about their sexuality than the other, but they discover a mutual attraction while being held under the thumb of Cathy Moriarty’s conversion camp den mother – who, it should be said, is somehow more of a drag queen than her colleague (played by a de-glammed RuPaul).1430 17. Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994)An underwritten female lead in the form of Andie MacDowell’s Carrie is the only fly in this wry, warm-hearted ointment. Revolving around a group of friends as they attend – you guessed it – four weddings and a funeral, this film marks the first of many collaborations between Hugh Grant and screenwriter Richard Curtis. We can probably all agree that the hopeless, stuttering Charlie should have ended up with his best friend Fiona (Kristin Scott-Thomas), but without his devastating indifference towards her, we would never have been blessed with one of the most magnanimous displays of unrequited love ever committed to film. The film’s worth your time, too, for its quietly progressive, heart-wrenching gay subplot.As much a ludicrously beautiful romcom as it is a nostalgic snapshot of the New York hip-hop scene at the turn of the 21st century, Brown Sugar casts Taye Diggs as an A\u0026ampR executive for a record label and Sanaa Lathan, magnetised to so many black romcoms during this time, as the editor for XXL Magazine. Friends since childhood, they’re perfect for one another, but involved with other people (the similarly too-beautiful-for-words real-life couple Boris Kodjoe and Nicole Ari Parker). Queen Latifah and Mos Def are their perfectly cast best friends, just to add to the film’s early-Noughties charm.Most great romcoms are lucky enough to have one stand-out set piece that becomes embedded in the cultural landscape. Love Actually, the annually inescapable Christmas romcom behemoth from Richard Curtis, has about six or seven. Because it’s as famous as it is, Love Actually oddly has a tendency to be underrated, dismissed as too cutesy or misogynist, too awkwardly Blairite in its politics. And all of that, in fairness, is true. But it’s also a real classic of the form – masterfully structured, endlessly watchable, and filled with familiar faces, sweet romances and heartache. It’s love in all its colours, often cringeworthy, sometimes monstrous, but always compelling to watch unfold.The secret masterpiece of the teen movie boom birthed in 1999, and truthfully one of the last of that era, Get Over It grabs so many elements from its subgenre predecessors (a Shakespearean undercurrent, sexually excitable animals and cameos from one-hit-wonders of the time) that it’s a wonder it’s so brilliant. Ben Foster is the recently-dumped high school basketball player who signs up for the school play (a musical version of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, naturally) to woo back his ex, only to fall for the adorable younger sister (Kirsten Dunst) of his best friend. Surrounding them are an array of recognisable faces, including Mila Kunis, Martin Short, Zoe Saldana and the literal Sisqo, while it features one of the finest Backstreet Boys-era boyband spoofs this side of Josie and the Pussycats.1830 13. 500 Days of Summer (2009)Beloved and loathed in equal measure, 500 Days of Summer is notorious among a certain generation of young people who grew up with Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel as quirky hipster pin-ups. And it’s likewise already something of a nostalgic masterpiece, beloved in first-year university film studies classes if then loudly rejected come graduation. There’s a lot to say about where its allegiances lie (is Deschanel’s Summer the movie’s villain, or its rational, realistic hero?), but that discussion also swallows up appreciation for what is for the most part a clever and funny comedy, and a movie that sincerely celebrates the conventions of the genre.It is funny in hindsight that there was such a stink over the casting of the Texan Renee Zellweger as the very English Bridget Jones. Because could you now imagine anyone else playing her? Her accent flawless (in that very prim, written-by-Richard-Curtis way), Zellweger similarly nails the spirited, neurotic melancholy that makes Bridget such a likable character, despite all the reasons we probably wouldn’t be able to stand her in reality. Like most of Curtis’s work, there is a lovely comfort to Bridget Jones, full as it is of slapstick, silly jumpers and new-Millennium London, featuring Colin Firth and Hugh Grant as “adorable dork” and “magnificent bastard”, respectively, and a perfect Christmas finale. It’s truly one of the best of the genre.2030 11. 13 Going on 30 (2004)If every romantic comedy is a fantasy, then 13 Going on 30 is the ultimate fantasy romcom. As if she has watched too many herself, unhappy tween Jenna Rink wishes she could be 30, flirty and thriving, and wakes up one morning a high-powered magazine editor who looks like Jennifer Garner, and whose dorky neighbour has transformed into Mark Ruffalo. By turns incredibly touching and genuinely funny, 13 Going on 30 is brought to life by Garner, who plays the adult-bodied Jenna as a guileless spark plug of self-doubt, glee and determination. Also features none of the weird child molesting undertones of Big, which we should forever be thankful for.With Nora Ephron having slipped off this mortal coil, Nancy Meyers has more or less claimed her spot as Hollywood’s most dependable creator of sensitive and funny love stories set within designer kitchens. She has a largely great filmography, but Something’s Gotta Give remains her masterpiece. Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson, both twinkling with lived-in Seventies-movie-star ease, play variations on their off-screen personas: her the exasperated neurotic, him the womanising letch. They’re thrown together in the Hamptons, stumble upon an unexpected attraction, and wrestle with what it all means. Keanu Reeves, as Keaton’s doctor and secondary love interest, is additionally a dream.There’s a great Arrested Development storyline in which Jason Bateman’s character doesn’t realise his love interest is mentally ill because she’s an eccentric British woman who looks like Charlize Theron. It may or may not have been inspired by Serendipity, the greatest romantic comedy ever made about a deranged and beautiful Englishwoman fixated on fate, chance and the cosmos. Kate Beckinsale and John Cusack meet by chance at Christmastime in New York, share a blissful evening together but then go their separate ways, Beckinsale sure that they must only date if the universe doesn’t otherwise intervene. Some time later, the pair are engaged to other people, but can’t shake their memories of that fateful Christmas Eve. Sweet, cosy and completely irresistible, Serendipity is a rare Christmas movieromantic comedy twofer and features two lovely performances at its centre. Absolutely bonkers, to be fair, but few films on this list aren’t.2330 8. 10 Things I Hate About You (1999)Gut-wrenching to watch in the wake of Heath Ledger’s death, but still one of the smartest, most convincingly heartwarming comedies of the last 20 years. Ledger and Julia Stiles are a pair of “unappealing” high schoolers whose romance is engineered by Stiles’s younger sister, who can only date once she does. There is much to love here, from the film’s feminist politics (10 Things remains the holy grail of its era, in that regard) to its delightful supporting cast. But it’s Ledger and Stiles that burn the screen. Their chemistry is so authentic, charming and sexy that it’s almost uncomfortable to watch, with only the fact that they’re both ridiculously beautiful encouraging you never to turn away.Christmas has never been better presented in all its melancholy splendor than in Billy Wilder’s The Apartment, with two lonely souls both left dispirited by the holiday season yet finding each other hopelessly up in one another’s lives. Jack Lemmon is unsurprisingly wonderful as one half of the film’s central twosome, who loans out his apartment to his lecherous bosses so they can conduct their affairs, but it is Shirley Maclaine who provides the film with its heart – she is bruised and brittle but eager for connection, and perfectly embodies the dizzying emotions of the winter season.Considering how many people adore My Best Friend’s Wedding, it’s always surprising to re-discover how monstrous its apparent heroine is. Julia Roberts has had better-received roles before and since, but there’s something fascinatingly daring about her work here, playing a single woman in love with her best friend and determined to destroy his wedding to a lovely if naive rich girl she has decided is evil. Cameron Diaz, as the bride-to-be, is an adorable revelation, Rupert Everett a hoot as Roberts’s then-radical “gay best friend”. And the sheer darkness on display here, mixed with that funny and expensive Nineties-romcom sheen, makes it one of the most intriguing romcoms in history, and secretly one of its very best.You could argue that June and Joseph – the dead, park bench couple – have the most poignant love story in this film, but the one between world-famous movie star Anna (Julia Roberts) and very-much-not-famous bookshop owner Will (Hugh Grant at perhaps his most charming, foppish and floppy-haired) comes a close second.A fizzy treasure of a comedy that set the tone for much of what came after it, The Philadelphia Story casts a never-haughtier Katharine Hepburn as a feisty heiress stuck between three men: her dull fiancé (John Howard), a prickly journalist (James Stewart) and the ex (Cary Grant) still hopelessly in love with her. Everyone speaks incredibly fast, romantic tribulations occur in elegant mansion estates and the film’s central trio embody an impossible movie-star glamour you can’t help but begin to miss as soon as they appear on screen.We know. Where you stand on Woody Allen’s work, particularly the stuff not revolving around the apparent inability of young women to resist the allure of a scrawny, bespectacled middle-aged neurotic, is one of those endless pop culture questions we’ve all asked ourselves in recent years. If anything, though, watch Annie Hall for Diane Keaton at her most Diane Keatonish – daffy, stylish and impossibly cool, she becomes so much more than an idealised fantasy figure through sheer force of will. Annie Hall, admittedly, is a masterpiece, if you can look past the obvious.While Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan’s most famous prior romcom collaboration, 1993’s Sleepless in Seattle, has a dark melancholy that makes it less immediately pleasurable to watch, their 1998 reunion in You’ve Got Mail is the kind of movie built for comforting rewatches beneath a blanket. Or at least once every year at Christmas. The pair play sworn enemies waged in a war over the future of Ryan’s ludicrously serene independent book shop, but find love when interacting anonymously online. Despite the dial-up modems and archaic dialogue (“What’s email?” everyone seems on the verge of asking), You’ve Got Mail hasn’t aged poorly, proving how timeless chemistry-driven love stories between beautiful movie stars can be. And considering how brilliant Ryan is here, oscillating between tough strength and soft vulnerability, it is no surprise that she is still regarded as the star most associated with the genre.Truthfully, it couldn’t be anything else. Not only did When Harry Met Sally kickstart the romcom boom that dominated the Nineties, it also invented much of what we recognise today as clichés: from the sardonic best friend (played to perfection by Carrie Fisher), to the late-night phone calls while watching old movies, the ChristmasNew Year’s climax, the “neurotic Jewish man”“Shiksa goddess woman” pairing at its centre, and the hilarious honesty when it comes to sex, never bettered than in the film’s iconic diner-orgasm scene. Romantic comedies are only clichéd because When Harry Met Sally set such a glorious benchmark for why these films work in the modern era, assisted by Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan at their most golden, and a gorgeously structured script that leaps through time, written by the queen of the genre herself, Nora Ephron. Nothing will ever better this.Pretty Woman certainly isn’t good, with an undercurrent of sleaze so disquieting that it’s no real surprise to learn it was once planned to be a gritty sex work drama that ended in tragedy. But Julia Roberts is pure star-is-born loveliness here, beloved by the camera and endlessly watchable as a result, her joyous pluck overshadowing the rest of the film’s murkier elements. That Disney, the studio behind the film, imagined its aspirational romcom hero as a rich businessman prowling Hollywood Boulevard for an escort is slightly maddening. That Pretty Woman somehow pulls it off… even more so.There are a few moments in this high-school re-telling of George Bernard Shaw\u0027s Pygmalion – in which, due to an elaborate bet, popular jock Zach (Freddie Prinze Jr) attempts to turn artsy nerd Laney Boggs (Rachael Leigh Cook) into the Prom Queen in six weeks – that pull the rug out from under your feet. One such moment is when Laney finds out about Zach’s ploy. “Am I a bet? Am I a bet? Am I a f**king bet?” It is raw, painful, and elevates the film well above your average high-school romcom.Saving Face is both a romantic comedy about gay women, and a romantic comedy about two Asian-Americans, making it a double rarity in the genre. But its loveliest quality is its Manhattan earthiness, with its smoky streets, subway cars, fire escapes and cheap take-out places, all backdrops to the tentative relationship between surgeon Michelle Krusiec and dancer Lynn Chen.Partly because she was its last high-profile “queen”, Katherine Heigl has often been positioned as the actor that killed the romantic comedy. Which is unfair for a host of reasons, but specifically because both Knocked Up and 27 Dresses are such pristine examples of how great the romcom can still be. 27 Dresses is the more traditional of the pair, Heigl surrounded by stock characters (including Judy Greer once again cast as the sad-sack best friend, as she did in the Jennifer Lopez vehicle The Wedding Planner) and playing a brunette and therefore unlucky-in-love single New Yorker obsessed with weddings. But she is such a delightfully prickly and neurotic presence that it makes up for the film’s lesser qualities. We truly didn’t appreciate her at the time.530 26. Playing by Heart (1998)Not strictly a romantic comedy, buoyed as it is by serious drama involving everything from infidelity to AIDS, Playing by Heart is one of those talky, interconnected, Robert Altman-esque indies that dominated so much of American cinema in the Nineties. But the reason it’s here is because two of its many storylines feature lighter pairings that appear unlikely on paper but somehow become incredibly compelling and tender in execution. In one, Angelina Jolie and Ryan Phillippe meet at an LA bar and begin a romance in another, Gillian Anderson and Jon Stewart meet in a bookstore and begin dating. Both stories develop from there, with Sean Connery, Gena Rowlands, Ellen Burstyn and Madeleine Stowe among the recognisable faces orbiting them. But whatever the tone of each seemingly unrelated story, Playing by Heart is driven by a lovely, nostalgic sense of Los Angeles ennui at the end of the 20th century. No one has heard of this movie, and that’s a shame.Crazy Rich Asians may not have saved the romantic comedy last summer, as everyone predicted it would, but it remains a breathless celebration of the genre – with a far-too-late-in-the-day but still wholly appreciated ersity at its centre. Constance Wu is the New York economics professor who discovers her apparently Average Joe fiancee is in fact Singapore royalty. What follows is a fish-out-of-water comedy that both indulges in its gorgeous opulence while never becoming too in awe of it. Michelle Yeoh is a standout, as a high society matriarch intimidatingly protective of her son.Few romantic comedies are more nakedly aspirational about big-city jobs, capitalism and the social power of being busy than One Fine Day, a mid-Nineties comedy about two single parents thrust together when their hectic schedules mean their children miss the class trip. There are far too many big cellphones here, but Michelle Pfeiffer and an ER-era George Clooney, as the squabbling pair at its centre, must surely rank as one of the most beautiful romantic comedy couples in recent memory.The first black, mainstream romantic comedy to possess the same aspirational sheen as their white counterparts, Boomerang is a lively battle-of-the-sexes comedy with Eddie Murphy as a powerful, womanising advertising executive spurned by his female doppelganger (Robin Givens). Grace Jones, Eartha Kitt and a young Halle Berry make for wonderful supporting players, but Boomerang’s secret weapon is Givens, who gives a performance with so much sparkiness that it’s enraging her volatile marriage to Mike Tyson overshadowed much of her acting career.Released a decade after Knocked Up, Seth Rogen’s adorable if occasionally bro-heavy first stab at the romcom, Long Shot bears the fruits of a man who has fixed some of his more regressive tendencies in the interim, producing something smarter, more sensitive and as interested in the feelings, neuroses and dialogue of his female co-star as he is to himself. He is a left-wing journalist recruited as a speechwriter for his former babysitter (Charlize Theron), who is now the US Secretary of State, and the pair forge an unshakable bond despite their wildly juxtaposed looks and vocations in life. Against the odds, Theron and Rogen are adorable together, while the film strikes a wonderful balance between sweetness and crudity. Long Shot may have flopped at the box office, but it’s the closest thing we’ve had to a romcom classic in years.A perfect encapsulation of the Fifties, specifically the allure of the European jet-set, the idealised rat-a-tat-tat magic of big-city journalists, and the otherworldly regality of Audrey Hepburn, Roman Holiday is more of a time machine than most of the films here. But it’s also a true-blue classic, its “famous woman paired with ordinary man” plot inspiring everything from Notting Hill to The Lizzie McGuire Movie, and appropriately beloved as a result. There’s no Hilary Duff, obviously, but we won’t hold that against it.Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a bit like peering into a time capsule a reminder of a time when Russell Brand was (nearly) a Hollywood A-lister, and people believed Jason Segel could be a movie star. Of the post-Judd Apatow era of romantic comedies, this remains the best, however – nicely balancing genuine sweetness and pathos (Mila Kunis is at the peak of her adorability as Segel’s love interest) with A-grade smut (Segel’s two full-frontal nude scenes remain hilariously shocking no matter how often you’ve seen them). There’s also a puppet musical thrown in for good measure, which is never not welcome.Very loudly not fun but still something quietly extraordinary, The Break-Up is a romcom in reverse, with Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn a couple at the end of their tether, who really shouldn’t be together and break up before the opening credits roll, and then muddle through the following 90 minutes figuring out what to do next. Aniston, always underrated as a movie star, is brilliantly magnetic, while Vaughn nicely downplays the manic energy that tends to suffocate his on-screen partners in his other roles. The film’s closer, a thoughtful, heartfelt celebration of having once loved someone regardless of how it all ended, is one of the bravest things an expensive studio romcom has done in recent decades.This satirical comedy set at a gay conversion camp has, quite clearly, a lot more than romance on its mind. But Jamie Babbit’s pink satin-coloured debut is most memorable for the brewing relationship between Clea DuVall’s Graham and Natasha Lyonne’s Megan. One is more in denial about their sexuality than the other, but they discover a mutual attraction while being held under the thumb of Cathy Moriarty’s conversion camp den mother – who, it should be said, is somehow more of a drag queen than her colleague (played by a de-glammed RuPaul).1430 17. Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994)An underwritten female lead in the form of Andie MacDowell’s Carrie is the only fly in this wry, warm-hearted ointment. Revolving around a group of friends as they attend – you guessed it – four weddings and a funeral, this film marks the first of many collaborations between Hugh Grant and screenwriter Richard Curtis. We can probably all agree that the hopeless, stuttering Charlie should have ended up with his best friend Fiona (Kristin Scott-Thomas), but without his devastating indifference towards her, we would never have been blessed with one of the most magnanimous displays of unrequited love ever committed to film. The film’s worth your time, too, for its quietly progressive, heart-wrenching gay subplot.As much a ludicrously beautiful romcom as it is a nostalgic snapshot of the New York hip-hop scene at the turn of the 21st century, Brown Sugar casts Taye Diggs as an A\u0026ampR executive for a record label and Sanaa Lathan, magnetised to so many black romcoms during this time, as the editor for XXL Magazine. Friends since childhood, they’re perfect for one another, but involved with other people (the similarly too-beautiful-for-words real-life couple Boris Kodjoe and Nicole Ari Parker). Queen Latifah and Mos Def are their perfectly cast best friends, just to add to the film’s early-Noughties charm.Most great romcoms are lucky enough to have one stand-out set piece that becomes embedded in the cultural landscape. Love Actually, the annually inescapable Christmas romcom behemoth from Richard Curtis, has about six or seven. Because it’s as famous as it is, Love Actually oddly has a tendency to be underrated, dismissed as too cutesy or misogynist, too awkwardly Blairite in its politics. And all of that, in fairness, is true. But it’s also a real classic of the form – masterfully structured, endlessly watchable, and filled with familiar faces, sweet romances and heartache. It’s love in all its colours, often cringeworthy, sometimes monstrous, but always compelling to watch unfold.The secret masterpiece of the teen movie boom birthed in 1999, and truthfully one of the last of that era, Get Over It grabs so many elements from its subgenre predecessors (a Shakespearean undercurrent, sexually excitable animals and cameos from one-hit-wonders of the time) that it’s a wonder it’s so brilliant. Ben Foster is the recently-dumped high school basketball player who signs up for the school play (a musical version of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, naturally) to woo back his ex, only to fall for the adorable younger sister (Kirsten Dunst) of his best friend. Surrounding them are an array of recognisable faces, including Mila Kunis, Martin Short, Zoe Saldana and the literal Sisqo, while it features one of the finest Backstreet Boys-era boyband spoofs this side of Josie and the Pussycats.1830 13. 500 Days of Summer (2009)Beloved and loathed in equal measure, 500 Days of Summer is notorious among a certain generation of young people who grew up with Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel as quirky hipster pin-ups. And it’s likewise already something of a nostalgic masterpiece, beloved in first-year university film studies classes if then loudly rejected come graduation. There’s a lot to say about where its allegiances lie (is Deschanel’s Summer the movie’s villain, or its rational, realistic hero?), but that discussion also swallows up appreciation for what is for the most part a clever and funny comedy, and a movie that sincerely celebrates the conventions of the genre.It is funny in hindsight that there was such a stink over the casting of the Texan Renee Zellweger as the very English Bridget Jones. Because could you now imagine anyone else playing her? Her accent flawless (in that very prim, written-by-Richard-Curtis way), Zellweger similarly nails the spirited, neurotic melancholy that makes Bridget such a likable character, despite all the reasons we probably wouldn’t be able to stand her in reality. Like most of Curtis’s work, there is a lovely comfort to Bridget Jones, full as it is of slapstick, silly jumpers and new-Millennium London, featuring Colin Firth and Hugh Grant as “adorable dork” and “magnificent bastard”, respectively, and a perfect Christmas finale. It’s truly one of the best of the genre.2030 11. 13 Going on 30 (2004)If every romantic comedy is a fantasy, then 13 Going on 30 is the ultimate fantasy romcom.

So it feels like men have been the beneficiaries of the patriarchy, but I don’t know if it’s necessarily the case.“Modern men mostly feel a lot of guilt for the fact that we’re men, even if, most of the time, I feel I haven’t done anything wrong. But I’m a man. White, middle-class — so I must’ve done something wrong?

On Friday, the website still showed the remaining property – a five-bedroom house – as available for sale at a price of £875,000.One HAB investor, who put in several thousand pounds, was quoted as saying: “I’m disappointed that what I saw as an idealistic project seems to be collapsing on a sour note, with the original directors having departed and investors seemingly left to bear the entire financial burden of a failed enterprise.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

No prizes for guessing where this is…From one mighty ocean to another – ships passing through the Panama canalIn 2005, astronomers discovered a dwarf planet called Eris that was 27 per cent larger than Pluto. A year later, the International Astronomical Union laid out its official definition for what constituted a planet. Pluto was not included.Since then it has been classified as a dwarf planet, though the icy object has attracted a dedicated following of people who claim Pluto should be considered a planet.In 2015 Nasa’s New Horizons mission to Pluto made several major discoveries that added fuel to the debate.Alan Stern, the Nasa scientist who led the New Horizons mission, subsequently co-authored a paper calling for Pluto to be reclassified.\u0026nbspThe Society for the Preservation of Pluto as a Planet has campaigned for Pluto’s status to be upgraded.“For over 75 years school children all over the world have learned that our solar system has nine planets,” the group’s website states.“Pluto’s status as a planet has sparked the human imagination for decades... Now is not the time to downgrade Pluto’s status.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

With them sit a pair of slippers\u0026nbspand a straw hat – items to prepare the 85-year-old Zimbabwean native\u0026nbspfor the unpredictable British weather. Little did she know that a month later they would be gathering dust.The 60-year-old care home worker, who moved to Britain in 1999, had been looking forward to her father’s visit for months. Paul Tipa, an agriculture worker, has never left landlocked Zimbabwe, so it would be a chance to not only show him around London, but to take him to the seaside for the first time. Plus, he would be able to meet his\u0026nbspthree-year-old,\u0026nbspBritish-born\u0026nbspgreat granddaughter, Ariella.Tipa, 85, had been looking forward to visiting his daughter Celia in the UK for the first timeCeclia\u0026nbspsays she had ‘everything lined up’ for her father’s visit, including clothing, slippers and toiletries“I feel it’s so unfair. I felt part of the country, part of the culture. But this really proved to me that I don’t belong. I feel like an outsider,” says Cecilia.\u0026nbsp”I have worked so hard, contributed. I am law abiding. I just want him to come this one time. Now I’m going to work and I’m thinking, why am I doing this?“He is my father. He is the one who gave me the opportunity to be doing what I’m doing here. So he should have the right to visit me. He has no reason to overstay, especially in the cold here. He doesn’t like to be cold.Ariella\u0026nbsp(left), for the first time”Caring for elderly patients every day, other elderly fathers, and I am denied the right to see my own.”Cecilia is one of many African nationals who have lived and worked in the UK for decades, yet have been denied the right to have their elderly relatives visit them on the grounds that their family members do not have sufficient income in their home country.African people twice as likely to be refused UK visas, finds reportLawyers say\u0026nbspthese refusals amount to a “misapplication” of the immigration rules and are\u0026nbsppotentially unlawful, as the applicant’s own financial circumstances should be “entirely irrelevant” if a third party – such as their offspring in the UK – has proven they can fund their visit. They also argue that citing their income and background in this way is a form of racism.It comes amid existing concern about\u0026nbspracial bias in the visa system, after a report last month found that African people were more than twice as likely to be refused a UK visa as applicants from other parts of the world.In another case, Zimbabwean national Spiwe Jaji, 49, who was granted refugee status after coming to the UK in 2002, and has since worked as a nurse, says she feels\u0026nbsp“betrayed” by the UK after the Home Office refused her mother’s visit visa for a similar reason.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Since her father past away three years ago, she has longed for her mother, 74-year-old Rettia Jaji, a farmer, to spend some time with her in England. \u0026nbsp“When I do go home I’m just rushing around seeing relatives. I don’t have time to stay with my mum properly. When my dad passed away I didn’t even have time to get closure,” says Spiwe.“My mum wouldn’t even want to stay for the full six months of the visa, let alone stay longer than that. She has got livestock. She has been in that village or more than 50 years. How can she abandon it? She goes to see her husband’s grave every day.passsed away three years ago, she has longed for her mother, 74-year-old Rettia Jaji, a farmer, to spend some time with her in England (Spiwe Jaji)“I look after older people in this country with compassion and love. I see old ladies like my mum every day and take good care of them. But they won’t allow me to have my mum come and just stay with me for even just one or two months.“It feels like they are racially discriminating against Africans. I don’t think they are even assessing our applications, just denying them.”In a third case, London-based Nigerian national Elizabeth Ezeronye, who has been living and working in the UK for more than a decade and has British citizenship, says she feels\u0026nbsp“let down” by the UK government after her 64-year-old mother, Regina Chukwu, was denied a visit visa.Ezeronye and her husband Okezie, who both work with vulnerable people, were disappointed when the Home Office rejected Regina’s visa application to see her grandson for the first timeThe 34 year old, who works as a team leader in a care home, and whose husband Okezie is a support worker for vulnerable adults, says she wanted her mother to meet her eight-month-old baby, Charles, for the first time and help her to care for the child during the remainder of her maternity leave.Describing the moment she saw the refusal letter, she says: “I cried. We had provided a letter saying we have a two-bedroom flat and that she was going to stay with us. All the bank statements, pay slips, to prove it. It feels like they didn’t look at any of those documents.“I work with vulnerable people, and the one thing we ask for, for my mum to visit, on all our expenses. Is it because she’s an African? Because she’s Nigerian? I don’t know. It feels racist and unjust.“I treat vulnerable people everyday. It is my passion. I give back to the system. I have been loyal to the country, a law-abiding citizen,\u0026nbspBut when I ask them for one thing, for my mum to come visit, it is refused.”Elizabeth says she wishes\u0026nbspto challenge the decision, but that she couldn’t afford to pay a solicitor, adding: “Now that I’ve got my bundle of joy, they treat me this way.”Human rights barrister Jan Doerfel said\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspsuch cases are “not uncommon”, and accused\u0026nbspthe Home Office “systematically misapplying the rules and rendering them more restrictive”, which\u0026nbsphe said in turn undermined\u0026nbspthe rule of law\u0026nbspand constituted\u0026nbspracism.Mother blocked from attending daughter’s graduation“When there is a reason for a visit and there are finances available, then a visa should be granted. But they’re saying you are too poor to intend to return. And that is racism,” he says. “It directly discriminates on the basis of income, and it indirectly discriminates on the basis of country or origin, which amounts to racism.“Income should be irrelevant when you’ve got someone paying for your trip. It’s not in the immigration rules that if you earn less than ‘X’ you can be refused.“It stems out of the hostile environment. We used to call it a \u0027culture of disbelief\u0027, but I think it’s a refusal culture, because it’s not that they don’t believe it.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “All cases are considered on their inidual merits and on the basis of the evidence available, in line with the immigration rules.“We are clear that applicants must be able to maintain and accommodate themselves during their visit without working, and prove that they have a genuine intention to leave the UK.”Asylum and Immigration\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

This is a country pop song is a prime example of Swift’s skill as a story teller – one who understands the power of a forbidden romance.720 14) “Out of the Woods”   Swift emulates Bruce Springsteen on this Eighties synth-pop “get in the car and go” epic, which lasts not a second too long and ends so abruptly that it leaves you gasping to catch your breath.Photo by Mark MetcalfeGetty ImagesOne of the most underrated songs on Reputation has Swift embracing the role of villain after years of being accused of using men as a songwriting tool, along with the fallout from her feud with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian. There’s so much more bite on this track than “Blank Space”, despite the similar themes – here she is merciless upon learning a man has used her name, or spent her money, behind her back. (Photo by Mark MetcalfeGetty Images)There’s something very moving about Swift opening her first album with a song that intertwines the old and the new. Nashville is notoriously unkind to female country artists, particularly young ones, so you can’t help but admire a then-16-year-old Swift, who offered a profound respect to one of her biggest inspirations on her debut single.This song is essentially one big, lustful sigh: Swift seems to delight in a secret romance where she “only bought this dress so you could take it off” and quite literally pants with anticipation.Getty Images for TASA tender Sixties-style acoustic ballad that shows Swift experimenting with rhythm and meter in a way that’s impressively bold this far into her career.Dia DipasupilGetty Images for ABAWhile Red signalled Swift’s full-blown transition into pop music, she couldn’t resist putting the odd country twang on songs such as “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together”, which mocks an ex for being snobbish about his “indie record label that’s much cooler than mine”. The most spectacular is really the beginning of the song, where she delivers an astounded “what?” upon being told the guy needs space: “We hadn’t seen each other in a month.”John Mayer lashed out over this song in 2012, clearly upset after Swift alluded that it was about their past relationship. He called it “cheap songwriting” in reference to using their personal lives for material – whatever you think of that, it’s features of her best vocal performances and brilliant songwriting – right down to the Mayer-ism of that wavering electric guitar line. Then there are the lyrics themselves: “You are an expert at sorry And keeping lines blurry And never impressed by me acing your tests All the girls that you’ve run dry Have tired, lifeless eyes ’Cause you burned them out.” Medic!One of Swift’s greatest talents as a songwriter is to encapsulate those small moments, often in a new relationship, that you as a listener cannot. Her skittishness on “Delicate”, about the danger of rushing into something, of sharing too much of yourself too soon with someone you’re still getting to know, is all too palpable as the beat switches up like a nervous heart.(Photo by Dimitrios KambourisGetty Images for TIME)The lyrics here are more open and willingly vulnerable than anything Swift had done before that line on the chorus where she sings: “My baby’s fly like a jet stream high above the whole scene loves me like I’m brand new” hits hard. The song appears on Reputation, released after Swift’s lengthy hiatus from the spotlight, and its lyrics speak of a person blissfully content in her relationship – to the point that the outside world is just white noise. It includes some of her finest lyrics, too, with superb references to those castles of old crumbling “overnight” and nods to her Anglophilia (“my baby’s fit like a daydream”).“Mean” is beaten only by “Our Song” as Swift’s most “country” release, helped a lot by her endearing portrait of “the slam of screen doors” and driving along country lanes listening to the radio. Swift is a master of the meta-narrative, so her making a song about a song based on sounds from real-life is all kinds of perfect.On “Getaway Car” Swift channels one of her friend and producer Jack Antonoff’s favourites – Kate Bush – as she belts that epic “go, go, go!”, while the song in its entirety recalls Bonnie Tyler’s “Total Eclipse of the Heart” – cellos and violins enhancing the drama.Getty Images for NARAS“Blank Space” was a real moment for Swift, where she turned all of the tabloid gossip, all of the malicious scrutiny around her love life, back on the world with a wink and a nod. “Got a long list of ex-lovers They’ll tell you I’m insane,” she trills on the chorus, throwing out punchline after punchline until the exquisite: “You’ll come back, each time you leave ‘cos darling I’m a nightmare dressed like a daydream.”Against a similar soundscape to Wildest Dreams, Swift is at her most confessional as she explains how her own insecurities can lead to self-destruction in a relationship – and pleads with her lover to be patient with her. “It’s all me, in my head, she sings. I’m the one who burned us down But it’s not what I meant Sorry that I hurt you.”Swift’s mastery of storytelling has never been better than on this, a standout song not just from Red, but of her career to date. It’s the slow-build from those bittersweet memories of “dancing in the refrigerator light” to a devastating, stadium-sized anthem that leads to her delivering arguably her best-ever line – with one of her best vocal performances: “You call me up again just to break me like a promise So casually cruel in the name of being honest.”This song is sadly marred by the controversy that surrounded its accompanying video (its references to films such as Out of Africa drew accusations that it presented a “white colonialist fantasy”.) The track itself is a dreamy, lush soundscape filled with breathless sighs and dramatic pauses that recall Swift’s fellow old Hollywood obsessive, Lana Del Rey.A pop-punk song!

The most spectacular is really the beginning of the song, where she delivers an astounded “what?” upon being told the guy needs space: “We hadn’t seen each other in a month.”John Mayer lashed out over this song in 2012, clearly upset after Swift alluded that it was about their past relationship. He called it “cheap songwriting” in reference to using their personal lives for material – whatever you think of that, it’s features of her best vocal performances and brilliant songwriting – right down to the Mayer-ism of that wavering electric guitar line. Then there are the lyrics themselves: “You are an expert at sorry And keeping lines blurry And never impressed by me acing your tests All the girls that you’ve run dry Have tired, lifeless eyes ’Cause you burned them out.” Medic!One of Swift’s greatest talents as a songwriter is to encapsulate those small moments, often in a new relationship, that you as a listener cannot. Her skittishness on “Delicate”, about the danger of rushing into something, of sharing too much of yourself too soon with someone you’re still getting to know, is all too palpable as the beat switches up like a nervous heart.(Photo by Dimitrios KambourisGetty Images for TIME)The lyrics here are more open and willingly vulnerable than anything Swift had done before that line on the chorus where she sings: “My baby’s fly like a jet stream high above the whole scene loves me like I’m brand new” hits hard. The song appears on Reputation, released after Swift’s lengthy hiatus from the spotlight, and its lyrics speak of a person blissfully content in her relationship – to the point that the outside world is just white noise. It includes some of her finest lyrics, too, with superb references to those castles of old crumbling “overnight” and nods to her Anglophilia (“my baby’s fit like a daydream”).“Mean” is beaten only by “Our Song” as Swift’s most “country” release, helped a lot by her endearing portrait of “the slam of screen doors” and driving along country lanes listening to the radio. Swift is a master of the meta-narrative, so her making a song about a song based on sounds from real-life is all kinds of perfect.On “Getaway Car” Swift channels one of her friend and producer Jack Antonoff’s favourites – Kate Bush – as she belts that epic “go, go, go!”, while the song in its entirety recalls Bonnie Tyler’s “Total Eclipse of the Heart” – cellos and violins enhancing the drama.Getty Images for NARAS“Blank Space” was a real moment for Swift, where she turned all of the tabloid gossip, all of the malicious scrutiny around her love life, back on the world with a wink and a nod. “Got a long list of ex-lovers They’ll tell you I’m insane,” she trills on the chorus, throwing out punchline after punchline until the exquisite: “You’ll come back, each time you leave ‘cos darling I’m a nightmare dressed like a daydream.”Against a similar soundscape to Wildest Dreams, Swift is at her most confessional as she explains how her own insecurities can lead to self-destruction in a relationship – and pleads with her lover to be patient with her. “It’s all me, in my head, she sings. I’m the one who burned us down But it’s not what I meant Sorry that I hurt you.”Swift’s mastery of storytelling has never been better than on this, a standout song not just from Red, but of her career to date. It’s the slow-build from those bittersweet memories of “dancing in the refrigerator light” to a devastating, stadium-sized anthem that leads to her delivering arguably her best-ever line – with one of her best vocal performances: “You call me up again just to break me like a promise So casually cruel in the name of being honest.”Lil Nas X, whose mega-hit “Old Town Road” spent a record-breaking 19 weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot 100, took home the award for Song of the Year. “This is my first award ever,” he said, unrolling a lengthy scroll as a joke ahead of his real speech.Missy Elliot received the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard award, along with a standing ovation for her medley performance of hits including “Get Ur Freak On”, “Work It”, “Supa Dupa Fly” and “Lose Control”.See the full list of VMA 2019 winners below“You Need to Calm Down,” Taylor Swift *WINNER“You Need to Calm Down,” Taylor Swift“ME!,” Taylor Swift ft.

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song.

Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads.

Clark Mindock reports from IowaClick to followThe Independent USWith the UK facing an uncertain future as Boris Johnson marches the country towards a no-deal Brexit, American farmers can’t help but see something of a golden opportunity to bring their goods into a new market.While many US farmers have historically been turned away from trading with the UK over fears for the implications of practices such as washing chickens in chlorine, or the use of genetically modified crops, Britain’s impending exit from the EU has left some dreaming of a change to that situation.On a blistering summer day in Iowa, the idea is hard to avoid for farmers such as Leon Sheets, a pork producer from the northeast of the state who also maintains 600 acres of row crops.“Hey, let’s have the conversation. Let’s work out a deal,” Sheets says, emulating the kind of language one might expect from Donald Trump.When prodded further, Sheets acknowledges\u0026nbspthat he hopes to see a post-Brexit trade deal that would allow for the introduction of products that have previously been off the table: “That’s what the goal is – no restrictions, so products can move freely back and forth.”It is an issue that has received backing from prominent American farming executives, even if some lip service has been given to having “a conversation” about the US food standards that have worried some in the UK.Currently farming exports to Britain – including wine, nuts and fruit – are worth only about $1.8bn (£1.47bn), a fraction of the total overall sales of $133bn. That means there is potentially massive room for growth, under the right circumstances.With the US saying that the UK will be “first in line” for a trade deal following Brexit, Zippy Duvall, the head of the American Farm Bureau, recently said that they are eagerly watching for ways to begin a trade partnership – but that Britain had to accept US standards.PM warned US trade deal ‘highly unlikely’ if Ireland has hard borderGovernment finally hands firms customs numbers for post-Brexit tradeTrump vows to continue China trade war even if recession hits USAs Britain seeks new trade deals, can we learn a lesson from Poldark?UK told to accept US food standards in any trade deal“You know, here in America we treat our water with chlorine,” Duvall, a poultry farmer himself, told the BBC.He claimed it was not a public health issue, saying: “So there is no scientific basis that says that washing poultry with chlorine wash just to be safe of whatever pathogens might be on that chicken as it was prepared for the market should be taken away. If there was something wrong with it our federal inspection systems would not be allowing us to use that.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailChlorine-washed chicken was banned by the European Union in 1997, which virtually stopped all exports from the United States of US chicken meat, which is often treated with the antimicrobial wash.The wash itself, though, is not the issue.US farmers say Trump’s trade war is hurting, but they still back himThe EU’s Food Safety Authority said in 2005 that “exposure to chlorite residues arising from treated poultry carcasses would be of no safety concern”. Chlorine-washed bagged salads are sold in the UK and other countries in the EU, for instance.But what is of concern is that relying on chlorine washes – which proponents say makes harmful bacteria virtually undetectable – at the end of the process allows farmers to keep unsanitary conditions for the chickens earlier on. And the wash could allow for crowded abattoirs where disease could theoretically spread with greater ease.While it is tricky to compare the rates of food-borne illnesses between two countries, two separate studies would suggest that the US experiences higher rates of salmonella infection. One British government study from 2014 found that there were roughly 55 salmonella infections per 100,000 people, when analysing 2009 data. A separate study of the US found a rate of 350 infections per 100,000 people, using data from 2002-08.When it comes to deaths, the US also reports higher numbers. While the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention reports around 380 deaths a year due to food-borne salmonella, England and Wales had zero such deaths between 2006 and 2015, according to the most recently available data from Public Health England.Gail Soutar, the chief European Union exit and international trade adviser for the National Farmers Union (NFU), says there was a considerable level of anxiety that a hasty and chaotic Brexit could leave UK farmers competing against a flood of international goods coming in, and undermining their prices.Soutar says she is particularly concerned at the prospect of a no-deal outcome, and the impact that subsequently high tariffs on UK agricultural products could have. Farmers, she worries, could be threatened by a flood of new goods being brought in from the US, which could undermine efforts to honour European Union standards – with the EU, for now, a much larger trading partner than the US.“There is a concern that we are going to see an increase of imports coming into the UK under a no-deal situation,” she says. “It remains absolutely key that we get a deal with the EU.”UK politicians have at least paid lip service to the notion that standards will not be abandoned in pursuit of a deal, with former environment secretary Michael Gove telling an NFU conference in\u0026nbspFebruary that they would not abandon those requirements “in pursuit of trade deals”.But thousands of miles away in Iowa, the outcome of negotiations between the UK and EU are understandably less of a concern for farmers. Whereas UK farmers may be feeling some anxiety, American farmers are clearly sensing opportunity.Bill Tenneger, a pig producer in northwest Iowa, says\u0026nbspDonald Trump’s trade war with China had been hurting farmers like him, but he thinks Mr Trump could potentially capitalise on a weak negotiating position following Brexit.But he adds\u0026nbsphe hopes\u0026nbspit would help British people out too: “I think trade agreements are good. Hey, it’s a small world. We’ve all got to get along in the world.

A disaster. A “catastrophic ­national danger”, according to the feverish .They say Britain is on a “clf edge”. If we leave without a deal it will be a “car crash”.It will bring the “hardship of war” raining down upon us, says one Brexitphobic columnist. These people seem to live in a permanent state of dread.They’re forever fantasising about a desolate post-Brexit world in which there will be “riots, looting and disorder”as zombied Brits fight each other for scraps of food and bottles of medicine.The rest of us, however, have a rather dferent take on No Deal. Across the country, far from the political bubbles and ivory towers inhabited by these anti-Brexit hysterics, people are far more chilled out about the prospect of No Deal.You hear it in everyday ­conversations: “If the EU won’t give us a good deal, let’s leave without one.”You see it on Question Time when the audience applauds a list who says we should walk away from the EUit keeps messing us about. And you see it in opinion polls, too.Much to the horror of the Brexit-bashing elites, polls show that ordinary people do not think No Deal will be the end of the world as we know it.A recent Opinium poll asked people what we should doBoris Johnson fails to wring concessions from the EU and to change the Withdrawal Agreement to make it more palatable to MPs.A whopping  per cent said we should go ahead with Brexit on October  — Boris’s ­promised exit day — evenwe don’t have a deal.Just  per cent said we should cancel Brexit altogether and  per cent said we should continue with negotiations.This echoes a YouGov poll from a few months ago. It asked what we should dothe EU refused to grant an extension to talks on the exit deal.Forty-four per cent said we should say adios without a deal. Forty-two per cent said we should revoke Brexit and stay bound to Brussels.This is all incredibly revealing. No, it does not suggest millions of us are reckless and crazy and hell-bent on jumping off the “clf edge”.Most Brits, including Boris himself, would prefer to leave with a deal,a good one can be struck.No, what the polls show is that there is only so much baloney from the EU that we are willing to take.If Eurocrats carry on behaving stubbornly and arrogantly by refusing to reopen talks about the Withdrawal Agreement, then we should show some self-respect and walk away — that is what people are saying.This captures one of the key ides between the elites and ordinary people today. The political and media classes dread No Deal because they have lost faith in Britain.They view the UK as a tiny, pathetic island that could never possibly cope outside of the EU.They think we need to be looked after by the apparently caring, maternal figure of the Brussels bureaucracy. Andwe do the political equivalent of cutting the apron strings, we will be doomed, apparently.In the rest of the country, meanwhile, people have far more faith in the nation.They believe we are more than capable of being a sovereign, independent country that strikes its own trade deals and writes its own laws.They see the country not as a useless little island, but as a plucky, resourceful nation that should reach out to the world without being beholden to any of it.The ide over No Deal reveals how much disagreement there is between the political elites and the people today.It is hard to remember a time when the chasm between Us and Them was as wide as it is right now.The th Century Prime ­Minister Benjamin Disraeli once said the UK feels like “two nations”. In one nation there are the posh and well-educated, and in the other there are ­ordinary working people.These “two nations” have entirely dferent “habits, thoughts, and feelings”, he wrote. It is asthey are “inhabitants of dferent planets”.It feels like that again today. On the planet of the Remainer elites, No Deal will be terrible, Boris is the worst PM ever, and anyone who ­disagrees is probably a racist.But on the planet inhabited by the rest of us, No Deal will be fine. And support for the Boris-led Conservative Party is rising. Surging, in fact.The latest Britain Elects ­opinion poll shows that  per cent of us would vote for the Tories, compared with just  per cent for Labour.But their shrill cries make no impact on our planet. In our more sane world, we still want Brexit to happen and we think Britain is a good, decent, capable country.The elites should come over to our planet. It’s a far happier place.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

From next June, only those over-s on pension credit will be eligible for free TV licences — just one in five people.That means .million pensioners, including more than , service veterans, will have to find £. a yearthey want to continue watching television.To add insult to injury, the BBC then disclosed how much money it is paying its stars.Anti-Brexit activist and Match Of The Day presenter Gary Lineker is on £,,, Graham Norton is on £, and Claudia Winkleman is on £,.Lineker’s salary alone would pay for more than , TV licences.Asthat wasn’t bad enough, earlier this month the Beeb said it intends to spend £million on an advertising campaign to attract young viewers and listeners.That’s more than the annual budget of Radio .It’s particularly high, given that the BBC can advertise on its own TV channels and radio stations for free. Apparently, the money is going to be spent on targeting young people on social media.Are we really supposed to believe that the BBC cannot afford to pay for pensioners’ TV licences, but can fritter away £million on Facebook adverts There’s almost nothing Auntie won’t stoop to in its desperate pursuit of the “yoof” audience.It has earmarked £million to promote its new Sounds app — including spending £, to transform the London Eye into the “London Ear” — and poured money into a series of increasingly tawdry podcasts, such as Gemma Collins talking about her le, a reality-show round-up called Reality Tea, and Unexpected Fluids, in which teenagers tell embarrassing ­stories about when sex goes wrong.It’s all a far cry from Lord Reith’s mission to explain.No doubt the BBC is concerned about how few young people it manages to attract — and this manests itself in other ways, too, such as its massive investment in apps and podcasts and its extensive online coverage of ITV’s Love Island.Last year, Ofcom revealed that  to -year-olds are spending an average of an hour and  minutes per day consuming BBC content, which is about half the amount for all age groups.Even more worrying for the Corporation, one in eight young Brits consumes no BBC content at all. Why should they fork out £. for the licence fee, particularly as many of them will already be paying for subscription TV services The fundamental problem the Beeb faces is that consumers are becomingly increasingly accustomed to paying for the TV content they want to watch and resent having to pay a mandatory flat tax to a single provider.The equivalent would beeveryone who owns a phone, tablet or laptop had to pay £. for an “internet licence” to fund Apple’s iTunes, regardless of whether or not they use the service.It’s time to do away with the licence fee — for everyone, not just the over-s.That would mean stripping down the state-funded parts of the BBC to its core news and current affairs output and funding that out of general taxation.It should sell off its profitable private isions — such as BBC Studios, which has annual revenues of more than £billion — and plough the money into creating its own subscription service.With its global brand recognition and unrivalled back catalogue, not to mention its reputation for high-quality drama, the BBC could easily compete with commercial providers such as Netflix and Amazon Prime.Promising to scrap the licence fee would surely be a vote-winner for Boris Johnson.No s, no buts.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBrits are being warned to prepare to be baked as this August Bank Holiday is set to be the hottest one ever.The Met Office has issues a level three heatwave warning and is urging people to staying inside between am and pm on Monday because the weather will be so hot.Brits are also being urged to take heatwave action during the amber warning, which is just one below a red, which would be a national emergency. Those most in danger are the elderly, people with underlying health conditions and babies and very young children.The level three heatwave  warning is in place for the East of England, where temperatures will likely hit -C between Saturday and Monday amid a number of big events, including Ed Sheeranaposs homecoming gigs in Ipswich, Suffolk.  The rest of England is under level twoor level one status, while no critical weather warnings have been issued for Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales.And with the temperatures reaching record breaking levels this weekend people will be finding it hard to sleep in the heatwave. However, one expert has come up with an unexpected tip to help people nod off when temperatures are soaring. Believe it or not, a hot water bottle could be just the thing you need to kelp you get a good nightaposs sleep. Expert James Wilson, AKA The Sleep Geek,explained: It can take us a bit of time to get used to the warmer weather at bedtime, particularlywe are staying in a place that doesn’t have air conditioning.    It is important that we feel cooler before bed as one of the important parts of the process our body’s go through to sleep is a drop in core temperature. If we are struggling to sleep because of the heat a great tip is to trick your body into thinking its core temperature has dropped. To do this you can either have  a lukewarm shower or alternatively, and this is a particular favourite of mine, fill a hot water bottle with lukewarm water and place your feet on it about half an hour before bed. The lukewarm water raises our core temperature slightly and our body reacts to it by trying to shed the excess heart, which means we then get a drop in core temperature and voila. We have created the right conditions core temperature wise for us to get better sleep.    The change in weather comes after weeks of unseasonable and unsettled weather which led to heavy rain and flooding in parts of the country. The Met Office said: There is a  per cent probability of heat health criteria being met between am on Saturday and am on Monday in parts of England.  High pressure will build across England, bringing very warm or hot conditions to many parts of the country during Saturday and Sunday.  Highest temperatures look to be across the eastern England, with western parts turning less hot Sunday.  "},{"url":null,"title":"familys dream holiday limbo after","story":"NewsFamilys dream holiday in limbo after BA cancel flights and charge them double to rebookTyrone Emmett and his family had hoped to go on a ten-day holiday to Greece before their plans were derailed by strikesShareCommentsByRobert HarriesNeil Murphy:,  AUG NewsTyrone Emmettwith his parents Teresa and Wayne \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

They just have a recorded message which says they are experiencing high call volumes. When they e-mailed me on Friday, they gave us two options - pick another set of flights on another date or get a full refund. “We’ve booked a villa out in Greece for six nights and a hotel for another four nights, not to mention everything  we’ve organised out there for those dates, so flying at another time wasn’t any good to us. Because of this I asked for the refund. The next day, they told me all is fine with the flights. But my refund has already been actioned, andI want to book on the same flight now the tickets have all of a sudden gone up in price by almost £,, from the £, we paid originally to £,.” The trip was something the family were looking forward to after a particularly dficult period.

Mr Emmett said: I’m supposed to go with my parents and a friend and his mother.

Theyaposre not the only ones impacted and British Airways says it is extremely sorry and that they are working tirelessly to put things right. But the family say they are in limbo and havenapost had an update from the airline. The remote nature of their destination, getting last-minute flights with another airline is not an option. We chose British Airways because you don’t expect any problems with a company like that. I wish we had booked flights with another airline now.” “I just can’t get hold of them,” he added. “It’s not our fault.

Shocking footage shows Kyle Spencer, , being grabbed by the neck and violently dragged out of the John Lewis in Westgate, Oxford on August . New dad Kyle, was out shopping for baby clothes for the arrival of his firstborn child, Emilia, when he said he was “assaulted” by the security guard. The family claim the scuffle started when the security guard asked the family to leave after Kyle’s -year-old sister accidentally pressed a button on a speaker, causing loud music to play. John Lewis have announced that the security guard no longer works at the store and have apologised for his actions.    Kyle said I physically couldn’t breathe. It was absolutely terrying. He had my neck so tight that I thought I was going to die. “For a good week or so after it happened I was scared to go into town again. “My sisters were in absolute distress. No child should have to see their big brother get attacked like that. “He was full of anger. I thought he would never let go.” Kyle was visiting the store at around pm with his two sisters, one who filmed the incident on her phone. The clip shows the guard grab Kyle, from Oxford, by the neck and wrestle him out of the store. The family claim the scuffle started after Kyle’s -year-old sister pressed a button on a speaker causing loud music to play. Security guards were then called by store workers to investigate reports of disruptive behaviour, and Kyle was hauled out of the shop.    Kyle says his sister turned the music on by accident and panicked having caused a disruption. The group were approached by the security guard, who asked the three of them to leave the store, Kyle said. But Kyle claims the guard became aggressive when he asked to see his ID badge. He asked to see some form of identication because the guard, dressed in shorts and a polo shirt, “didn’t look like” someone who worked for John Lewis. Kyle said: “To me he just looked like a normal person in normal clothes. “He refused to show me his badge and started to get angry about it. I didn’t try to cause an argument or try to be awkward. “He asked us to leave but when we were talking he pushed me twice.” Video footage then shows the guard spin Kyle around and grab him by the neck. Kyle said he tried to defend himself by resisting the “heavy-handed” guards attempt to grapple with him.    After dragging Kyle out of the store the guard continues to hold Kyle by the neck. His sisters can be heard screaming in distress as their brother is taken to the ground. Kyle reported the incident to Thames Valley Police. An investigation was launched but no action was taken against the guard. Kyle said he went to AE later that night with neck pain and bruised ribs. He claims doctors diagnosed him with a sprain and whiplash. Following the closure of the police investigation Kyle reported the incident to John Lewis directly, on August . He received a letter of apology from the guard the next day, in which it is claimed Kyle used abusive and threatening language, which he denies.

Vicky Mitchell, from Halax, matched all five numbers and the Le Ball in the Set For Le draw - making her one of the five top prize winners so far. The -year-old, who has two children, initially thought sheaposd won £ before the scale of her prize sunk in. She will have the huge sum paid into her account each month for the next  years. Vicky said: “In a million years you never think you’ll win big but this is le changing.”    She used the last £. from a previous win in her online account to buy the line for the draw on Monday August . Vicky plans to go on holiday to Spain - which had been booked before her win - before moving house. She said: “Getting my own car so I don’t have to share one or get the bus, and moving to a bigger house with a nice garden are on the cards. I want to stay grounded but I know le is going to change.” Vicky, an admin assistant at an accountancy firm, doesn’t play The National Lottery regularly, occasionally picking up a ticket for one of the games.    It was only because she went away for a weekend that her run of luck, which ended with her being Set For Le, began. “I pick up Lucky Dips every now and then for whichever game I fancy, she said. I was heading off to Skegness and so quickly thought to play online. I won £ on Thunderball which was great and I used that win to buy a ticket for dferent draws across the next few days. I won again, this time £ on Set For Le, so I put that back on ious draws. It was the last ticket I bought with this win, a £. Set For Le Lucky Dip for the Monday, that I won on and which has changed my le.” She discovered sheaposd won when she got an email, which she read after getting up early to ensure her son was up on time for work.  She said: “I was half asleep when I saw the email and thought ‘great it’s another fiver’. I couldn’t work it out and see what I had actually won, it said I had to log on.” Vicky continued: “I woke up my partner, Adam, and shoved my phone in his face saying that I’d won the lottery. He said, ‘what a pound ’ and I just shouted ‘no, look, look, look’. It was still early so we then had an agonising wait to call The National Lottery line to get it all confirmed.” She said it now means she can now make purchases she would have had to avoid before. Vicky stated: “It’s still sinking in but whereas before I would see a jumper for one of my sons and think that I couldn’t afford it I can now just buy it.” She also wants to live somewhere more spacious.

The first things she splashed out on were houses for herself and some of her family, as well as cars, and gts for other people.She told the Today show : “I liked being able to help my family and doing stuff for people I cared about, but I wanted to just go back to work and live my normal le again.“All of a sudden I couldn’t open my front door with photographers and stuff being there and, obviously, you have people begging for money, friends who weren’t friends before wanting to be your friends.”    And from there things spiralled out of control as people she didnapost know tried to take her money and sell stories about her. Even an ex tried to sell a story that she was addicted to cocaine, she said. She added:that’s what I had done, when I hadn’t - He was going to get a lot of money off it.

I had a lot of fake relationships.”  She said there were advisers provided to her on how to manage her money, but said that at that age you don’t have any concept of that amount of money or what to do with it. “You are only a , with all that responsibility.

Now I have a driver and I am too old for public transport.“But I still love doing live gigs. It’s smashing. Anywhere where there’s people is greatI’m doing my stuff.“I am working on my book of poems right now.

For me, the s squad does not bother me. There have been thousands of boys down the years that’ve got  caps in the s and never had a career in the game.“For us it’s about first-team football, getting them into our team and seeing what happens after that.”That desire to get his kids first-team football is why Robbie has loaned out the likes of Declan Glass and Matty Smith, both now at Cove Rangers.Youth players Alassan Jones and Michael McArthur have also gone out to juniors Broughty Athletic, who were instrumental in Appere’s development last season.“There is no point in having guys here that are real good prospects and not getting them a game.“They just end up fading out and their career gets ruined.“We have to make sure we give them the best opportunity to play here.“If they are not quite there yet then they go somewhere  and come back in six months# time but, when they do, we have to make sure there is an opportunity for them here.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.41437609-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.41437609-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.41437609-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.41437609-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"james mcpake accepts share of blame for dundee draw with inverness caley thistle","story":"Boss James McPake has accepted his share of the blame for Dundee’s below-par performance in Saturday’s goalless draw with Inverness Caley Thistle.After pushing Aberdeen all the way to extra time in the Betfred Cup six days earlier, the Dark Blues looked sluggish as they could not find a way past the Highlanders at Dens Park.While the gaffer was unhappy about that, for him, it was a case of collective responsibility that stretched beyond those on the park.“We’re inconsistent at the minute. We’re getting periods of games where we look really good, then periods where we look not convinced at what we’re doing,” he said.“A lot of that lies with me as well.“I’m changing it, putting people on and changing shape, so I’ll go away and, as a staff, we’ll have a look at that and seewe can pinpoint where we’re going wrong as well.”He refused to use either the sticky conditions or the fact his team had taken Aberdeen to extra time as a reason for the drop in levels.“There was no issue with that at all. There are no excuses. Teams will come here and make it stuffy. We need to create an atmosphere.“The atmosphere was created last week because we were in Aberdeen’s faces and there was an extra , Aberdeen fans.“We could have created that same atmosphere by being the same Dundee team that came out on Sunday last week and had a right go at Aberdeen.“That’s the bit I need to get right, me and my staff – and we will.”There was an injury scare when teenage midfielder Fin Robertson came off in the second half after feeling his hamstring.Dundee are confident, however, the problem was no more than cramp and they expect the -year-old to be available for Friday night’s derby at Tannadice.Likewise, fellow-midfielder Jamie Ness is expected toafter missing out on Saturday because of a bought of sickness.“Jamie had a bit of sickness. That’s football, you get injuries, you get illnesses, you get suspensions,” added the manager.“It’s disappointing but again that’s not an excuse as to why we weren’t at it and why we failed to break down Inverness.”Dundee’s few hundred remaining tickets for Friday night went on general sale today and are expected to be snapped up quickly.That will make the first derby in over three years a complete sell-out despite it being shown live on television."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/08/5d4d4fe53f1f97.56655478.jpg ","title":"pawlett is ready for starting place after heroics for dundee united against partick","story":"Peter Pawlett is back in contention for a Dundee United starting place after his super-sub heroics at Partick Thistle.And fellow-attacker Osman Sow did his prospects no harm by smashing in a hat-trick for the reserves yesterday.Pawlett made a surprisefrom his summer-long knee trouble when he came on at Firhill in the Tangerines’ last outing and grabbed the winner.That and a week-and-a-bit’s hard work in training since, as well as a run-out yesterday, has convinced boss Robbie Neilson the -year-old can be considered for  minutes at Dunfermline on Saturday.And Sow, who’s had a calf injury since pre-season, has also been building up steadily.“Peter came on the last game, got the last  minutes and did great, so he’s ready to go when we need him,” said Robbie.“Osman’s not far either. He’s been playing in the reserves and bounce games, he played yesterday as well.”Several others in need of game time also got a run-out as United’s second string thrashed Kilmarnock - at St Andrews yesterday. Adding to Sow’s treble, Ian Harkes grabbed two.As he looks to add to his squad, Robbie has not given up hope of securing the services of former Motherwell wide man Elliott Frear, with whom he was strongly linked earlier this month.The -year-old spent a few days training with the squad and travelled to the friendly at Shrewsbury but, so far, has not penned a deal. That might still happen, though.“We tried to get him in earlier in the month and the way things worked out we just couldn’t quite do it but we’re still hopeful,” Robbie added. “It’s like anything with transfers, they take time.”He will resist the temptation to recall attacker Declan Glass, who’s been in top form during his loan spell at Cove Rangers.The -year-old grabbed a double against Cowdenbeath to take his tally to four goals in seven appearances so far and United are happy for him to continue his good work at Cove.“I think the thing for Declan is he needed to go and play games.“He’s at a level where the reserves are not pushing him and he wasn’t quite ready for the first team and we saw it as a good chance to go up there.“I’ve spoken to Paul Hartley and he’s delighted with him.

We were incredibly grateful to get all, or most of the fish donated, which allowed us to give all the profits to the festival.

They also make for an excellently contrasting pair.From Mendelssohn’s exuberant opening bars, we are swept through music that is complex yet captivatingly, joyously melodic throughout, while Enescu’s is moody, breathlessly dramatic and, in parts, simply volcanic.Guest directed by Marianne Thorsen, SE will explore the specic charm of seeing a small group of musicians performing live. With fewer instruments, the fabric of the music becomes more tangible, subtle shts in mood may have a new-found presence, and pieces you think you know well might offer surprising new colours when heard live. With fewer musicians on stage, it is easier to follow each inidual path and witness the beautul alchemy of eight artists creating something together.Thorsen is an acclaimed soloist and passionate chamber musician. Former leader of the Nash Ensemble, she regularly performs with Norway’s Trondheim Soloists, one of the founding ensembles of The Bridge network and festival.The first half of the tour, which is called Chamber Notes, will call at Crear Studio, Kilberry, on August , followed by a performance at Mull Theatre, Tobermory, on August  before moving on to Inverness and Dundee.Other Scottish dates, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, are programmed for February .PIC:Marianne Thorsen. no_aMarianne Thorsen"},{"url":null,"title":"kilberry sportive well supported in sunshine","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Kilberry Loop Sportive saw around  cyclists take on a -mile route starting and finishing in Tarbert.All eyes were on the forecast for the non-competitive cycling event on Saturday August .

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

The deadline was broken on  minutes when Lee MacLean broke from midfield and managed to beat the offside trap, his cross from the left channel was met by the in-form Stuart MacLean whose shot beat Martin to give Star the lead.Tarbert looked to commit bodies forward in a bid to get back into the game which made for a more open contest, however the Star defence of Coll McCallum, Ricky Reid and Kyle Selfridge coped well throughout.Red Star should have made the closing stages a lot more comfortable for themselves with Gregor Peacock going close with a couple of opportunities and Aaron Moore having a shot well blocked but in the end Stuart MacLean’s goal was enough for a hard-fought but deserved win.On Saturday August  Star welcome Dunoon to the joint campus for their final game of the group stage, where a victory for the Lochgilphead side will see them progress to the quarter-finals.The kick-off time will be announced on the club’s social media pages during the week."},{"url":null,"title":"heres to ewe gordon","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowA -year-old  shepherd left the recent Mid Argyll Show with a clutch of prizes for his Texel sheep.Gordon MacLean, from Tarbert, saw off fine specimens of the Texel breed from more experienced sheep men and women to win the ewe lamb class.

The means for  protection is the European Union PGIdesignation, to promote and protect names of quality agricultural products and foodstuffs.Ruth, an experienced journalist, explained: #I became concerned about two years ago when, during Japan EU Canadatrade talks, the UK government did not submit one PGI for protection.#Across Europe, , food names were protected. It worries me greatly.#She continued: #I am also concerned about how hard it is becoming to source local food and drink. I live in rural Angus, and the carrots grown down the road from me started le just as Angus carrots, but they went away for packaging and came back as Great British carrots. Technically that is correct, butwe believe in supporting local farmers and making clear choices about food miles and quality, this is ridiculous.#She stressed: #This is not a protectionist campaign. I welcome trade with any part of the world as long as the farm assured quality is there.##Keep Scotland the Brand is about valuing the integrity of our food and drink and recognising that Scotland is the brand. Across the world, people recognise Scotland as a quality brand.#One in five Scots is employed in the food and drink sector, so it is vitally important to keep our brand quality.#We trust the food on our shelves at the moment. Butthe trade deals being proposed go through we#ll end up with a multi-tiered system of quality. If the Americans get the trade deal they want, the high food standards we have are really only going to be accessible to those who can afford to pay.#It#s bad enough people having to go to food banks to survive, without people not knowing why their kids are getting ill.Ruth Watson is keen to emphasise that Keep Scotland the Brand is not a political campaign and it#s not about Brexit.#It is a campaign looking at the realities of what is before us,# she says. #I think that we have to look with some alarm at the trade deals that have been done. The UK government just has not protected our food brands.##I do this campaign on a voluntary basis from my kitchen table,# she went on. #Many people do not know what is coming. Food is treated as a commodity rather than something we should be grateful for every day, that is how successful our farmers have been.#I just believe thatfarming fails, my community is going under.##I#ve been talking to elected representatives, I go round shows. I#ll talk to anyone about this.#But what can ordinary people do Ruth is quite clear. #Get out there and talk to each other, spread the word on social media, speak to politicians.#But most of all support our local farmers.#"},{"url":null,"title":"get dancing get fit and have fun","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowBack in April, the Mid Argyll branch of the Royal Scottish Country Dance Society held a ‘Bring a Friend’ evening.The result was a super evening of dancing and laughter, not to mention some delicious home baking at half time, and the branch was delighted at the number of people who came along.Now the dancing season is starting again after the summer break and the members are hoping to welcome those friends – and others – to their regular Monday evening classes.Scottish Country Dancing is a really great way to stay physically and mentally fit while having a lot of fun and listening to some lovely music at the same time.

It will reopen in spring .The closure plan was greeted with dismay in Campbeltown, with board members attacking the #scandalous# plan # with a promise to fight the #tooth and nail#.Chairman Allan McKie told The Courier this week that the move was finalised last Friday.#The decision was taken as the coreof the office is being moved to Oban,# Mr McKie said.#Membership was being handled in Campbeltown for the whole board area, and there is far bigger back-up in Oban. It was not a financial decision # it was an administrative one.#Pressed on whether he thought the closure would have an adverse effect on tourism, Mr McKie said: #I don#t think Campbeltown will suffer at all.#He continued: #In winter months, it was totally unrealistic to stay open and serve tourists, for all that there are. It is unfortunate. We took a long time to come to this decision and it is highly regrettable.#FIFTY YEARS AGORoad bridge row comes to an endThe #dry bridge# at Bridgend, Islay is to be raised to give clearance of ft ins.This was announced at the meeting of the Islay District Council on Monday.The total cost of the improvements will be borne by Western Ferries and several of the island#s distillery companies. Work is expected to start at the end of the month and should be completed by the send of September.Councillor Frank T. Spears stated that the work would not involve any long-term closure of the main roadway.The #dry bridge#, owned by Lord Margadale, has been the subject of much discussion and minor rows for the past several months. Since Western Ferries Ltd. began their sea service, heavy articulated lorries carrying malt and grain to the island#s distilleries have been unable to go under the bridge. Matters came to a head three months ago when Argyll County Council re-imposed a weight limit on the Glen road # the ersion used by the transporters to avoid the bridge.The bridge owners came quickly to the rescue and allowed the heavy traffic to use their private road at Bridgend for a three-week period, but following local protests and legal consultations the transporters were again allowed to use the Glen road.Leboat saves three on rocksThe crew of a lobster fishing boat were marooned on a partially-submerged rock for more than two hours when their vessel foundered off the north-east coast of Islay on Thursday morning.The ft #May#, owned and skippered by -year-old Mr Lachlan Clark of Port Charlotte # the veteran of several sea-dramas # struck the rocks while they were lting lobster creels.The Islay leboat was called out to rescue the skipper and his crew # Alastair MacDonald, a -year-old fisherman, and Norman Gardiner, a -year-old Colonsay doctor#s son who was making his first trip and deputising for a sick crew member.Following the rescue, the crew # who were unhurt # were landed at Port Askaig.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGONational Health Insurance ActA number of contraventions of the National Health Insurance Act were the subject of prosecutions in Campbeltown Sherf Court on Thursday # Sherf MacMaster Campbell on the bench.The first case was that of a Clachan merchant who was charged with neglecting to stamp the card of a female servant.Mr M. Dick, solicitor, who appeared for accused, tendered a plea of guilty, and said the observations he was about to make would apply equally to all the cases subsequently to be heard. These were the first prosecutions of the kind in this court. The Act, as his Lordship knew, was a most voluminous and complicated measure.The sherf observed that some excellent and very lucid summaries had been circulated.Mr Dick, proceeding, asked his Lordship to examine the contribution card. He would find that the part which was the very kernel of the offence was embodied in the middle of Art.  in very inconspicuous type. The employer was there required to stamp the card #not later than the time at which wages are paid# but to read that one required to hold the card at about  degrees.The sherf askedhe was to understand that this was the first occasion on which a domestic servant had been employed by accused  If not, he must have been trained in the use of this wonderful document years ago.Mr Dick said his Lordship must consider this, that in cases of this kind there were two standards of clearness. What was clear to the judicial mind might be very far from clear to the lay mind.It was a matter of common knowledge that there was a very general belief in this part of the country thatinsurance cards were stamped at the time they were run out the Act would be complied with.The card, of course, bore that the stamps must be affixed #not later than the time wages are paid#. He asked his Lordship to consider the phraseology. These cards came into the hands of many rustic employers of labour. Why should it not be stated in bold characters on the card that the stamps must be affixed at the time wages are paid In the country wages were paid sometimes by the half-year, sometimes by the month, and sometimes at irregular periods suitable to the circumstances of the worker.The cards represented not the half-year of the feeing terms, but the calendar half-year. All these circumstances contributed to the confusion of the lay mind, and encouraged the widespread impression thatthe cards were stamped at the end of the period the duty of a citizen was thereby fulfilled."},{"url":null,"title":"leader august 23 2019","story":"The Courier is honoured to deliver news to the community # during the good times and the bad.This week we were delighted to share the news that Campbeltown now boasts the #whisky bar of the year#, according to judges at the Scottish Bar and Pub Awards , who bestowed the title to the Ardshiel Hotel.Since buying the hotel more than a decade ago, Flora Grant and Marion MacKinnon have more than tripled the number of whiskies on offer, turning the hotel into something of a tourist attraction in itself.However, we also revealed that nine jobs have been lost at Campbeltown Creamery.While it is still hoped that a take-over by local farmers is the future for the site, it is terrible for the iniduals who have lost their jobs, some after many, many years.We know there is a market for Campbeltown cheese, and while the number of farms supplying the creamery has fallen over the years, there are still almost .Here#s hoping the future is bright for both Campbeltown#s whiskies and cheeses."},{"url":null,"title":"filming-taking-place-port-seton-high-street","story":"A short film called Fishing by LS Productions means that a rolling road closure has been created.This is when the road is mainly open, but traffic will be lsquopausedrsquo to clear the road at times.It is a system commonly used in cycling and road events.There will also be parking restrictions in place.When asked, LS Productions marketing team informed the Courier that due to signing non-disclosure agreements, they were unable to say anything more about the film."},{"url":null,"title":"surge-39-struggling-39-families-sees-demand-kids-39-lunch-club-soar","story":"More than  children took part in this summerrsquos club compared to just  when it began in .And Universal Credit has been blamed for the dramatic increase in families who need help providing their children with a healthy meal, during the holidays.Sandra King, from Preston Seton Gosford Area Partnership, who help fund the club, which runs in Prestonpans and Tranent, said there was no doubt the impact of East Lothian being used to pilot the roll-out of Universal Credit was being witnessed.She said: ldquoIt is like being back in the Seventies: the number of families who are struggling and need support is high and the Universal Credit pilot in East Lothian has definitely had an impact.The outward appearance of East Lothian as an affluent county was misleading, she added, with families in all of its town and communities struggling.She said: ldquoEven in places like North Berwick we are seeing families affected.

I think for many parents who have childcare challenges,there can be a real sense of relief as the summer holidays end, and to some extent I feel that myself.The pressure to fill six weeks with entertainment and activities, and go on holiday, can be immense, especially on a tight budget. For some children too, the holidays can be a dficult time and school can offer them ato some familiar routine.However, I remember the impending dread I felt when I was a child in the final days of the summer holidays. I hated the back to school adverts on TV as they heralded the end of free days playing on the rocks at the Pans shore, and of loosely defined bedtimes.So I was glad that our youngest daughter Skye was looking forward to school as she enters P. She met friends she hadnrsquot seen in weeks this morning and smiled as she said hello to George the lollipop man.She seemed slightly anxious as she waited in line in a new place, but the friendly manner of her new teacher visibly lted her mood and she went in with a smile, unknowingly tracing my childhood footsteps and those of her big sister.But then as I walked home, I was suddenly overwhelmed with anxieties: money worries, work worries, deadlines, bills etc. It seemed asduring the holiday period I had consciously decided to put such thoughts aside, to just enjoy the family time. Now was the pay back, we had ed to lsquorealityrsquo.But then I suddenly remembered a tale a fellow storyteller had told me many years ago. It just popped into my head and it spoke to me as I wandered back. And the truth in the story was the antidote I needed in that moment. And so I will share it with you in case you may one day find you need it:There was once a weaver who was weighed down with worries. He had so many things to do, so many responsibilities he looked into the future with dread. His worries kept him awake at night, which of course made his worrying worse during the next day. It was a vicious cycle.Then one day, he was sitting at his loom working and his worries got in the way. He couldnrsquot concentrate and he made mistake after mistake. He cursed and this was heard by an auld guidewe who happened to be passing by his window.ldquoFir whit reason dae ye curse at yer loom son, is there nae joy in yer work  she asked.The weaver looked up, feeling ashamed: ldquoIrsquom sair sorry fir ma words. Itrsquos just that as I work I think aboot orsquo ma troubles.The old woman nodded in understanding. She knew about troubles herself.ldquoAye, she said with an understanding nod, ldquotroubles can fair get ye doon.Then she paused and thought for a moment. She could see in the weaverrsquos face that he was riddled with anxieties.ldquoCan I show ye something that will tak ye awa frae yer work fir only a few minutes The weaver was happy to have a break so he left his loom and came outside.ldquoDae ye hae a bucket  asked the guidewe.ldquoA bucket ldquoAye a bucket, tae put some water in, she explained.The weaver fetched his bucket, wondering what the old woman was going to do with it.She took it to the well and filled it with a little water.ldquoNoo son, I dinnae kenthis will be tae heavy fir ye tae hold up.The weaver laughed: ldquoOrsquo course itrsquos no too heavy, fir ye only put a wee drop orsquo water in it.So the woman asked him to prove this by holding up the bucket with arms outstretched. The weaver had strong arms because of his work and held the bucket before him without any effort.ldquoAh, said the guidewe, ldquosae itrsquos nae tae heavy.ldquoIt isnae heavy at arsquo, replied the weaver.The old woman smiled: ldquoIn that case, keep haudin it afore ye like that fir  minutes. He wondered why she was asking him to do this, andshe was just trying to make a fool of him. But he was also intrigued and knew her to be an honest old soul, and so he did as she asked.After a few minutes of holding the bucket in front of him, it began to feel much heavier. After five minutes, his arms began to ache and soon they began to shake. The pain began to spread to his back as he desperately tried to keep the bucket in position.ldquoIs  minutes no over yet  asked the weaver desperately.ldquoIf the bucket is now tae heavy fir ye, put it doon son.He was reluctant to admit that the bucket was now too heavy to hold and so put it down.ldquoThe water got heavier son, didnrsquot it ldquoThe water wasnae heavier, protested the weaver, ldquoye just made me hold the bucket for tae lang.ldquoSae the water did get heavier, no in itself, but for you!The weaver looked confused and the guidewe continued.ldquoWater can get heavierye haud it ower lang afore ye, evenitrsquos just a wee drop. Yer worries are like that water, son. I am sure that they are many but ye mak them much heavierye try tae haud them in yer thochts arsquo the time.She smiled at him: ldquoTry an put the bucket doon as often as ye can,ye ken whit I mean. Dinnae mak it heavier than needs be. When ye need tae, haud it, but no arsquo the time.ldquoIn fact, she added while raising a pointed finger, ldquohauding it arsquo the time gies ye pain and paralyses ye. Yersquoll hae nae ability left tae empty the bucket.And so the old woman wandered off, leaving her words with the weaver. He looked down at the bucket. He lted it again and held it in front of him. It wasnrsquot as heavy now as before, but still had the same amount of water in it. She was right, water can get heavieryou hold it for longer, even though itrsquos the same weight.He chuckled to himself and watched the woman as she waddled down the street.ldquoThank ye! he called out.He ed to his loom. This time he whistled and sang as he worked. He enjoyed his creation and made no mistakes, for he had put his bucket of worries down for a while.Later they would still be there, but they might seem lighter and easier to manage now that they had stopped paralysing him with anxiety.And so that was the story. And as I arrived home, I realised that although I needed to deal with lots of things, I wasnrsquot going to give my worries more weight by holding them constantly in my thoughts.Itrsquos really important to put your bucket down every now and then, and that can make it easier to empty as well."},{"url":null,"title":"letter-railway-isn-39-t-perfect-39-s-better-driving","story":"Sure, things

years. While the name of these types of promotions seems to imply that players will be on the receiving end of totally free spins, during which anything won can be kept and withdrawn, the truth is often a bit murkier than that.The UK Gambling Commission has played no small role in attempting to clear up the matter. According to them, to use the term ldquofree spins casinos must genuinely offer free games with no strings attached, such as wagering requirements. The old, standard spins are to be referred to as ldquobonus spins instead.When Free Spins Are Not Truly Free SpinsThere are several occasions when free spinsarenrsquot free. Any spins which come with wagering requirements, for instance, breach the concept of being truly free. Wagering requirements, also known as playthrough rates, denote that a player must wager whatever they win a specic number of times before they can withdraw those funds.Wagering requirements are common in deposit bonusesbut shouldnrsquot be included in any offer which proclaims itself to be free.Free Spins With No Wagering RequirementsFortunately, the new regulation issued by the UK Gambling Commission, Swedish Gaming Authority and others are aiming to fix this issue. True free spin deals should come with no hidden terms and no strings attached. They should be offered to players with a genuine chance to win real money for free, money which can ndasha player desires ndash be withdrawn from the start. This doesnrsquot mean to say that there arenrsquot other terms and conditions.Many top free spin bonuses tend to come with dates attached, only being valid during a predetermined period. Moreover, they may only be valid on select slot machines and could be limited to players in a specic region.Only a Handful of Chances to WinThere is a downside to the new ldquofree spins offers at casinos. They generally tend to provide a limited number of spins, far fewer than the old no deposit bonuses with wagering requirements, and deposit offers. Moreover, they are often only valid on slot games which do not offer substantial cash prizes, including many simple - line games from NetEnt and others.Promos Which Are Ideal for Test Driving CasinosSuch free spin bonuses which come with no wagering requirements at all are hardly going to be appealing for players who fancy landing big wins. As mentioned, they tend to be valid on slots which donrsquot offer such epic wins. However, these promos and deals may make the ideal introduction to slot gaming for new players, or those who wish to test-drive a slot before deciding to wager real money on it.The East Lothian Courierencourages readers to gamble responsibly.

The procedure for iding matrimonial property, which is any money and other assets owned jointly or inidually is that it is to be ided fairly, which may not simply mean equally. If the situation has to be resolved in court that can result in a decision that is far from satisfactory to one ndashor both ndashof the partners.ldquoItrsquos important that we advise clients about the fact that Alternative Dispute Resolution is available. These situations emphatically donrsquot involve an inevitable progress to court ndashwhich should be regarded as very much the last resort, he says.In fact, some % or more of cases are now dealt with through negotiation rather than a court order that determines the ision of assets. People who proceed to court, says Ferry almost inevitably have an urgent issue such as suffering from a serious shortage of money or protection issues resulting from circumstances of domestic abuse.The alternative routes principally involve collaboration or mediation. Mediation, involves an independent mediator guiding the parties toward a solution. The mediator does not usually give them legal advice as to their entitlements though in assisted mediation both parties have their solicitors in the background .ldquoThat is an option that sometimes works out well ndash but many people are looking for veriable answers, and this can be achieved through the collaborative approach which I find is generally a better way to resolve disagreements.Ferry, a trained collaborative lawyer, believes this route is best to minimise conflict and secure financial choices ndashwhile also, importantly, ensuring the best future for the children. He explains that collaborative law involves the parties and their advisers in four-way meetings with discussions around the table, in private and without the delay of correspondence and court proceedings. And this, he says helps to avoid subsequent, and potentially costly, misunderstandings.The problem with pensionsPensions, for example, can become very contentious. ldquoIn our experience pensions are frequently overlooked by clients when considering orce settlements. However, the value of the pensions built up during the marriage or civil partnership is taken into account and can be substantial. Our clientsrsquo settlements often involve pension sharing agreements.ldquoHowever, pensions can be extremely complicated ndashnot only in terms of valuing them and iding them but itrsquos also important to get the best advice on which pensions should be shared and which should not. Some have more benefits attached to them than others.

A failure to identy pension interests or to correctly apportion the value of a pension may have dramatic long-term implications for either spouse and there is a strict timescale involved after orce for implementing the pension share.Business assetsFerry says that clients also need advice about business assets and shareholdings, as to what constitutes matrimonial property as these can, inadvertently, be converted into matrimonial property in the course of, for example, restructuring a company that was founded or bought before marriage.ldquoShareholdings that may be worth several millions can be transferred into the joint matrimonial pot and that possibility is not often considered by the accountant or tax advisor involved, he says.These are just a few of the issues to be considered but despite the obvious vexations that separation and orce involve, Ferry believes in confronting them in a positive, proactive way.

His missionary work took him all over Scotland, including the coastline of the Forth. It is said his arrival at this small natural harbour gave the place its name.Last weekend, artist Andrew Crummy, who lives in the village, organised three lsquosunset eveningsrsquo at the Boat Shore. Local musicians, singers, artists and actors gathered on the beach with an audience of fellow locals to share the sunset.I sadly couldnrsquot attend the first two but was able to make the last evening with some of my children. It was a wonderful mix of music and song, with a very funny short drama, and a setting sun as the backdrop.It was a poignant evening for myself, and I know for some others too a moment of reflection as well as coming together. I had planned to tell a tale about St Kenneth, but I changed my mind just before the event.Instead, I told a tale of a friendship between a tortoise and a butterfly and what sunsets meant to them. In story, anything is possible, and I made this tale to help ease someonersquos sadness in experiencing an ending.I was later askedI could share it, and so here is the story:There was once a tortoise who became friends with a butterfly. On the first day of their friendship, the tortoise invited the butterfly to sit with him on his favourite rock, to watch the sunset.However, Butterfly had no idea what a sunset was, and so when she saw the sun fall gradually from the sky she became concerned.ldquoWhatrsquos happening to the sun  she asked in a worried tone.ldquoItrsquos the sunset, said Tortoise, ldquoitrsquos when the sun goes down and ends the day.ldquoWhat, already! Thatrsquos it  asked Butterfly, horried. ldquoThis is just my first day being a butterfly and my days are over Tortoise smiled: ldquoNo my wee friend, itrsquos not all over. The sun will come back and there will be another day.But Butterfly remained anxious: ldquoHow can you be sure the sun will come back ldquoTrust me, I know. Irsquove seen many sunsets, said Tortoise. ldquoThe sun always comes back. Sometimes it takes longer than others, sometimes you canrsquot see the sun because of clouds, but it always s and makes another day.Butterfly was now reassured and so settled down to watch, as the sun dipped lower, painting the sky. She expected the sun to sizzle and the sea to steam when they touched each other, but of course that didnrsquot happen. The sun slid quietly below the horizon, leaving a trail of bright red and orange.ldquoThat was beautul, wasnrsquot it  Tortoise said.But Butterflyrsquos reply was unexpected: ldquoI think I donrsquot like sunsets very much.Tortoise curled up the wrinkles on his old face in surprise: ldquoWhy not, donrsquot you think it was spectacular, the way it painted the sky ldquoSuppose, but it was sad, really sad, said Butterfly.ldquoSad ldquoYes, because the sunset ends the day and thatrsquos sad. Endings are sad.Tortoise nodded in a way tortoises do when theyrsquore thinking: ldquoYes thatrsquos true, endings can be sad. But everything ends sooner or later. Nothing lasts forever.ldquoBut thatrsquos what I mean Tortoise, itrsquos so sad. I donrsquot want to sit and celebrate the end of something.Tortoise thought for a moment: ldquoAlthough endings can be sad, they also give meaning and value to our time. Without sunsets we would not treasure our days. Our le would become one long blah of sameness.ldquoA blah of sameness ldquoYes, my expression, smiled Tortoise proudly.ldquoBut thatrsquos easy for you to say, Tortoise, because you have more time than me, you will have more days.ldquoPerhaps, but that means your time is more precious than mine. And your sunsets are greater celebrations of your days.Butterfly thought about this. ldquoYou seem quite wise, Tortoise, she said, looking at her friend.ldquoYes, he replied immodestly, ldquoI do have that reputation. I suppose I have a lot of time to think, sitting on this rock.It began to get dark and colder.ldquoNow itrsquos time for our dreams. Soon there will be the sunrise, said Tortoise.ldquoSunrise  Is that when the sun s Tortoise nodded: ldquoYes, you see you donrsquot get a sunrise without a sunset. Although endings can be sad, they open the door to new beginnings. At the other side of a sunset there is a sunrise.Tortoise was indeed wise and Butterfly felt reassured by his wisdom.That summer, the two friends watched many sunsets together. They would share stories about their day as the sun went down. Then one evening, as flocks of geese were flying overhead, Butterfly spoke sadly.ldquoTortoise, I need to go. Itrsquos getting cold. Irsquom off to Africa. Do you think there are sunsets there ldquoIrsquom sure of it, replied Tortoise.ldquoI love sunsets now, said Butterfly. ldquoThey have shown me to treasure and celebrate my days. But I am sad this is our last one together.ldquoMe too, said Tortoise.The two friends sat together on their rock as the sunset commemorated their summer with a blaze of colour. Then they said goodbye.A new dawn now lay ahead for them both, for the end of one story is the beginning of another.And at the other side of a goodbye, there is a

The world is a much better place as a result but, unlike with family, the bonds and obligations of friendship are less clear-cut. Sometimes ties wither naturally, at others, rash or destructive relationships have actively to be severed. This is an unpleasant fact of le and one that Prince Andrew is discovering belatedly to his cost.For some time now, speculation has been mounting after the publication of a photo showing the Prince walking in a New York park with his friend, the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was recently found dead in a prison cell, where he awaited trial on charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy to engage in sex-trafficking.The headlines must have made the Palace shudder, their insinuations all too clear. After details of a US lawsuit mentioning him were released, a terse statement was issued distancing the Prince from historic accusations made against Epstein, and claiming that ldquoAny suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.:Prince Andrew hosted Jeffrey Epstein at BalmoralClose observers of Buckingham Palace might have noticed a cloud of dust around the flagpole as the house was shaken to its foundations. When the Daily Mail published footage recently showing the Duke of York ushering a young woman out of Epsteinrsquos Manhattan apartment in , a further statement was issued. The Duke, it said, ldquodeplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.Poor Prince Andrew. He is discovering what every child in the playground knows: that you are tarred and feathered with the same brush as those with whom you mix. If one of your gang throws a brick through a window, you are deemed guilty too, evenyou did nothing wrong.In the case of His Royal Highness, letrsquos put aside for a moment the suspicions his closeness to Epstein, following his release from prison, arouse. Bad enough that Andrewrsquos personal contacts are so dodgy they raise serious questions about his judgement, let alone his behaviour.If nothing , these images suggest one of two things: that the Prince was a loyal chum who stuck by Epstein, despite his ruined reputation and the risk it posed to his own. Or that, living as he did in a gilded cage, removed from real le and the consequences of any stupid decisions he made, he was utterly unconcerned about the effect their friendship might have on his prospects. When you are cocooned from birth in a cradle of privilege when you are feted, indulged, and pandered to by sycophants and liggers from the minute you can shake a rattle, it must be easy to believe you are above the normal rules and standards by which society works.Meeting in the park with Epstein was, at best, decidedly odd for someone in Prince Andrewrsquos position. Going to his apartment, however, where a stone satyr presides over the front door, was simply crazy. According to police who raided the property, they seized photos of underage girls. These and the fetishist decor would have led most ordinary visitors to make a swt exit.These images of the Duke of York date from the period when he was acting as British ldquoSpecial Representative for Trade and Investment. A bespoke role for an aimless aristocrat, it gave him licence to roam the globe, meeting fat cats in rich countries and opportunistic states in the hope that some of their wealth would find its way into Britainrsquos Treasury.:In Pictures: Commonwealth leaders gather for state dinnerDuring his deployment as an envoy, Prince Andrew made ious embarrassing ldquomissteps, among them some politically unwise associations. Nothing, however, could compare with being identied as one of Epsteinrsquos cronies, after which revelation he relinquished the post.As the grapevine quivers with anticipation over other high-profile names likely to be found in Epsteinrsquos fat address book, the Dukersquos predicament is increasingly grave. He can hide behind the Palace gates and hope the storm will pass, but this is a story that has been brewing for years. Until certain questions are satisfactorily answered, as far as hersquos concerned it is far from over.Doubtless, it will go against every royal instinct, but would he not be wiser to face the cameras, do an in-depth interview, and silence ndash perhaps even charm ndash his critics  In a situation like this, where unfettered gossip is fuelling supposition, Prince Andrew surely needs to explain his connection with Epstein and help suffocate the scandal. It would, of course, be a historic move. No member of the royal dynasty has ever voluntarily gone on record to put their side of a wildfire story, with the exception of Princess Diana. In her unforgettable, kohl-eyed interview with Martin Bashir, she was more focused on scoring points against Prince Charles than in illuminating her own often dubious actions.Sticklers for Palace protocol might feel sick at the thought of Prince Andrew going public. Even in the hands of the most measured journalist ndash Kirsty Wark, say, or Fiona Bruce ndash it would be viewed as stepping into the lionrsquos den, a suicidally reckless act. Added to which, the Windsors do not explain. They take a long view, recognising that the passage of time usually allows even the most unsavoury episodes to fade into oblivion.In this instance, however, that seems unlikely. So what is worse  Staying schtum, and waiting for more seedy revelations to be added to the blaze, or allowing the Duke to get ahead of the story, and give his version of events By remaining aloof, the Palacersquos response suggests it hopes to avoid further fallout. The implication of this is all too plain: royals might not be above the law, but its arm would have to be very long indeed to winkle one of them out of the front door and into a Black Maria. Inviting a Windsor to a police interview, let alone into a courtroom, would require Herculean effort, and a mountain of cast-iron evidence. By contrast,Andrew were willing to face, refute and defuse the rumours, it would be an act of bravery to restore family pride."},{"url":null,"title":"dads-army-peaky-blinders-series-five-episode-one-sanditon-episode-one-reviews","story":"Peaky Blinders, BBC****Sanditon, ITV****HOW would you like your Sunday evenings served, madam: with bare naked laddies, cuddly nostalgia, or machine guns  Those were the dining options as the main channels attempted to lock viewers in for the autumn.Peaky Blinders made the move from BBC as a reward for its Bafta-winning, young audience-grabbing ways, while ITV was offering Sanditon, which sounds like a DIY product but is in fact an unfinished Austen brought to a close by Andrew Davies, the writer who puts the bonking into bonnet and carriage dramas.But who do you think you are kidding, Mr Scheduler  For a certain vintage of viewer, the main event was Dadrsquos Army: the Lost Episodes.

Given its outward-reaching and positive attitude to the EU, and the desire to see Scotland remain at the heart of Europe and with a seat at the United Nations, perhaps it there ever was to be a name change, a better reflection on where the SNP stands would see it known as the Scottish International Party.Ruth Marr,Stirling.ldquoWHEN I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean. The Humpty-Dumpty theory of language is obviously endorsed by Mark Smith.I am an unapologetic supporter of Scottish independence, but I never describe myself as a nationalist. Why  Because this word must be the most ambiguous in the English language, so much so that it has long ceased to have any practicalin discourse. It has no taxonomic value.Just think: Nelson Mandela was a nationalist, so also were Radovan Karadzic, Ho Chi Minh, Mladko Radic, Slobodan Miloscaronevi#, Mahatma Gandhi, and Adolf Hitler. A word that includes such contradictory definitions is meaningless.Mr Smith is hideously wrong in claiming that Anglophobia is at the heart of the SNP. In fact, many of its supporters are English.One cannot be a true internationalist without recognising the existence of nationalism.Brian Quail,Glasgow G.THE England Get Out of Scotland Banner, the subject of comments made recently by Nicola Sturgeon is not racist, bigoted or anti-English. The banner is a copy of an older Irish banner saying the same and is all about the conquest of Scotland by England in  when the parcel of rogues in a nation, our nobles, accepted the equivalence of more than pound, in bribes to sell out Scotland. The banner in its true meaning is calling for English institutions like Westminster, the Bank of England, the BBC, the English Monarchy and the Ministry of Defence at Faslane with Trident to leave Scotland so that we are no longer a province of England, no longer a colony of England.With regard to English people who live, work and retire in Scotland, they are always welcome. It is a mark of the timidity of some that such a banner has been unfairly criticised when Boris Johnson when Editor of the Spectator in  allowed a poem to be published that talked about putting the Scots in ghettoes and calling for our extermination and hardly an eyebrow was raised. That is truly racist and Scotophobic and should be condemned by all right-minded people but very few voices are raised.The banner will be shown in future with no apologies from me and I will give the final word to Police Scotland to whom complaints have been made about the banner when it was shown. When I explained what the banner was about they allowed it to be displayed as we had not broken any law.Sean Clerkin,Barrhead.I AM engaged in correspondence with the Electoral Commission about the conduct of a further independence referendum. The Commission appears to be unaware that in Scotland the people are sovereign and not the Scottish Parliament.

Study senior author Professor Laura Kubzansky, of the Hard TH Chan School of Public Health, said: ldquoOther research suggests that more optimistic people may be able to regulate emotions and behaviour as well as bounce backfrom stressors and dficulties more effectively.The findings were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences."},{"url":null,"title":"south-scotland-welcomes-1m-tourism-boost","story":"Ministers said the South of Scotland Economic Partnershiphas awarded a total of pound,, to five projects ndash including a scheme to improve Galashiels town centre.Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing announced the funding while on a visit to the Philiphaugh Estate near Selkirk, which received pound, to create a golden eagle visitor centre among other plans.He said: ldquoThe Scottish Government, working with SOSEP, is determined to help the south of Scotland to realise its full economic potential.ldquoWersquore doing that by targeted investments in projects which we believe will act as the catalysts for creating new businesses, providing vital skills, and making the region an even more attractive place to visit.ldquoThe work of SOSEP, the establishment of a new enterprise body for the region, and the poundm we are investing in the Borderlands inclusive growth deal, underline our commitment to continuing to deliver for the south of Scotland and its people.It comes after the latest population estimates published by the National Records of Scotland showed swathes of rural Scotland have experienced decline.Almost  per cent of ldquodata zones ndash small areas used to provide local statistics ndash in Dumfries and Galloway saw a drop in the number of people living there.Scottish Borders Council performed better, but still saw populations fall in  per cent of its data zones.A new enterprise agency for the south of Scotland is expected to be up and running by early next year.Mr Ewing previously said it would work to ldquotransform the arearsquos economy by building on its strengths and its traditions.SOSEP was established to allow the region to ldquobenefit from a fresh approach to economic development, while work to establish the new enterprise agency is ongoing.Backed by poundm of investment across -

This appears to be on the basis that Alex Salmondrsquos contrary claim is ldquounsupported by independent legal opinion . I would challenge that latter assertion.Ms Redingrsquos letter is itself unsupported by legal opinion. The situation of a member state splitting in two has not occurred in the history of the EU . So there is no legal precedent.However there is a legal precedent to support Mr Salmondrsquos case for a third country joining the EU without the requirement to go through any negotiations or any revision of the Treaties. When East Germany joined the EU in  it was deemed to be effective from the moment unication with West Germany took place. It was seen to be merely the enlargement of an existing member state with the new combined entity being called lsquoGermanyrsquo.:Neil Mackay: Where have all the big ideas on independence gone An independent Scotland would be in a similar situation, but this time as a third country formed by the reduction in size of an existing member state as opposed to enlargement. Unlike East Germany, however, it would already have met all the criteria for membership by dint of having been in the EU for  years. As such it would be unique and therefore unlike any other third country applying for membership. That is the key point.If the Commission stipulated that Scotland would require to apply for membership like all other third countries, it would have to explain to the European Court of Justice why the legal precedent established by East Germanyrsquos accession to the EU was being disapplied in this instance.By any measure this would be an extremely spurious legal argument for the Commission to advance, especially when Scotland has a stronger economy than East Germany had, was fully compliant with EU rules, and was a known and respected European country with no history of secret police involvement.

On the Yes side, nothing has substantively changed, when it comes to big ideas, since the SNP laid out its blueprint for independence in .Brexit has altered the backdrop of the constitutional debate, but apart from a decision by SNP members to support the creation of a new currency as quickly as possible after independence, which many Yes voters donrsquot agree with, therersquos been little in the way of political imagination, creativity and innovation. The plan for Citizensrsquo Assemblies was visionary but itrsquos been undermined by SNP politicisation.Thatrsquos not to say that hard work hasnrsquot been done on the nuts and bolts of independence. The SNPrsquos Growth Commission report on the finances of an independent Scotland presented some serious economic thinking, but this is not the stuff upon which visions of new nations are built, this is the stuff of the seminar room.: Neil Mackay:Irsquom a Yes voter, but Irsquom now sick and tired of my own sideThe No side is even worse. All thatrsquos heard from the No camp is the word lsquoNorsquo. Wherersquos their vision of what a Scotland remaining in the union will look like  Brexit has shown both the Tories and Labour to be intellectually bankrupt when it comes to the future of Scotland. Yoursquod get more vision walking around a darkened room with your eyes closed than you would listening to most unionist politicians in Scotland.The new co-leader of the Scottish Green Party, Lorna Slater, seems to share concerns about the level of intellectual debate around the future of Scotland. She too worries about the vision thing.Slater has identied a few problems. Firstly, the impression that the SNP ldquoowns the idea of independence. Many Yes voters donrsquot support the SNP ndash yet itrsquos the SNP which dictates most of the discussion around independence. When a monolithic, managerial party controls debate then the drain on vision wersquore experiencing is inevitable. Whatrsquos good for the SNP in terms of holding on to power isnrsquot necessarily in the best interests of independence.A resurgence of all those grassroots Yes organisations which sprung up as the first referendum approached would provide an intellectual counterweight to the SNP, and a laboratory for new ideas.Slater is also concerned that ldquomuch of the debate around independence has focused on whether or not there should be a referendum. We should be focusing on what we want an independent Scotland to look like.Shersquos right. A second referendum will happen at some stage in the relatively near future, but what really matters,you are a Yes voter, is making sure the vision for the country is in place in order to convince the people that independence is the right course of action when the time comes.Brexit has taught us hard lessons. There was no real discussion, no real vision, about what a post-Brexit Britain would look like. A national conversation needs to begin in Scotland about the kind of country we want to be after independence.What about a constitution  The monarchy  The nature of the army  Our relationship with America  A second parliamentary chamber  Our role in Europe These issues cannot be left up to the SNP. Politicians make decisions in the best interests of their party, not the country. Parties care about power not people.We need to know the substance of what wersquore voting for, rather than the intellectually bereft binary of Yes and No. The Greens are certainly setting out a clear vision for Scotland after independence. The environment will be the top priority, there will be a move away from oil and gas.Of course, the Greens also flatlined on around eight per cent of the vote during the European elections in May. However, that disappointment may account for their renewed push for a big vision for Scotland now.The Greens need to get out from under the shadow of the SNP. Being seen by voters as \"the other party which also supports independence\" isnrsquot a strategy, especially when Greens can provide a clear, progressive vision for the country which the SNP with its disparate factions cannot.The SNP is ready to splinter into left, right and centre the moment Scotland becomes independent. In the era of climate change, the Greens have a simple and important story to tell which other parties do not.However, honesty is the greatest storyline ndash the strongest vision ndash to present to Scotland. So letrsquos be honest. If Scotland votes Yes to independence in any future referendum, we need to accept that it is inevitable that the nation will need a confirmatory referendum on any deal negotiated with the rest of the UK regarding separation.Dr Alan Renwick, of University College Londonrsquos Constitution Unit, has raised this issue saying that a confirmatory vote would avoid the ldquoacrimony and gridlock of Brexit. He refers to the ldquograve democratic quandary where the public has not been allowed to make ldquoan informed choice about the type of Brexit the country goes through. Renwick suggests opting for a confirmatory vote might increase the turnout for Yes with the public willing to back independence in theory and then see what the politicians negotiate.A future independence referendum would be a ldquopre-legislative ballot, instructing politicians to negotiate a deal which we then vote on. That seems perfectly democratic and the kind of vision we need for this country.:Majority now want Scottish independence, says phenomenal new pollIt immediately shows a commitment to democracy over party politics, a willingness to tackle emotional and isive subjects in a collegiate way, and it projects an adult image of this nation while many other countries seem to be reverting to childhood.The First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and some of her inner circle may be publicly voicing their discomfort with the baggage that comes with the concept of nationalism of late, in an attempt to woo soft No voters, but the one thing which will change swithering minds is honestly tackling the dficulties which the journey towards independence will involve.It will not be easy - it will be hard.

Behind the headlines, the IPCC report includes a much more positive message about the potential agriculture has for helping to mitigate climate change.:Fe farmer bids to put buffalo mozzarella on the menuUnlike other sectors, agriculture can, through appropriate changes in land use and new land management practices, not only reduce its greenhouse gas emissions but sequester more carbon, offsetting emissions in other sectors.The same changes in land use and land management will also help stem the decline in bioersity and our natural resources, or what the economist Dieter Helm and others refer to as our ldquonatural capital.In his latest book ldquoGreen and Prosperous Land, Helm argues that protecting and enhancing our environment is one of the best investments that a society can make and that agriculture, with the support of appropriate policies, has a key role in moving us towards a sustainable future.The signs are that, post-Brexit, UK agricultural policy will place more, rather than less, emphasis on the environmental objectives of farming.It follows that farmers should welcome the increased attention being given to the environment.In reality, agri-environmental policies explicitly focused on ensuring farming delivers environmental public goods are not new. However, despite the clear and long-standing policy support for protecting the farmed environment, and notwithstanding recent commitments by farm lobby groups to achieving net-zero production, many farmers see their primary, and in some cases sole, role being that of producingfood.Why is this  In part it could be attributed to the nature of some past agri-environmental schemes.Many have been bureaucratically demanding while others have, inadvertently, included conditions which placed future farm support payments at risk.While some measures have clear environmental gains and are relatively easy for farmers to adopt, eg restoring peat bogs on land, not in productive use, often the schemes are necessarily more complex.:Five Scottish farm-themed wedding venuesNatural habitats need to be connected toeffectively, often across farm boundaries, therefore requiring new levels of co-operation between neighbouring farmers the right sort of trees need to be planted in the right types of land for net positive carbon sequestration to occur, and the time period within which the trees will generate income may not align with a farmerrsquos needs.

A recent Scottish Government study found that  per cent of the public rated the environment as one of the top three government portfolios that should be prioritised in terms of spending.Agriculture came much further down the list, with just % of the public rating it.

The nine-nil reverse at Celtic Park was undeniably sore and damaging to the football club.However, it was fty-nine minutes of complete and utter madness that saw Celtic convert every one of their attempts on target bar two.It followed a decent half hour for the Dons that included a great chance for Chris Maguire.The game was of the freakish type that beset a far better Dons side at MacDiarmid Park under Alex Smith for example.Paul Hartley knows that he let his new club down but to criticize our skipper would be churlish in the extreme, given what he has already contributed to the cause.It was a miserable afternoon that will have been incredibly welcome for Doogie McDonald, the debacle temporarily removing the untruthful official from the media glare.The heavy loss understandably made Tuesday night’s Inverness clash take on extra importance but Aberdeen’s luck was totally out.If anyone thinks any of the Dons players didn’t give % against ICT they don’t know football.Watching the game upon getting home from the match you actually started believing that the Dons had to win, given the total dominance in the second half.Inverness took the lead due to simulation of the most repulsive type.The poor referee had a night to forget from beginning to end and the last thing he needed was players feigning and faking.The farcical penalty only served to double the Dons’ resolve.First half additional time was measured at two minutes which means that no injury time was played once factoring in the four yellows that had been flashed in the first period.The second half saw the passing and movement back to what we were enjoying back in August and the goal from Velicka was a belter, sent on his way by the best player of the field by a country mile – Scottie Vernon.The ref was given the chance to correct his penalty howler by awarding one to the home team but one assumes he must have been unsighted for the blatant hand-ball.The Inverness winner came from a free-kick that never was at the half way line, poor defending but rough, rough justice on a Dons team that gave everything.There was still time for Foran to try and get Ifil sent off and the game’s close saw the classless Butcher provocatively gesticulating in front of the RDS, doubly stupid given the pressure on a fellow boss.

His musical collecting and recordings pre-dates the Folk Revival of the s and s and consequently are unique.David Cook, sub-committee chair of Live Le Aberdeenshire, said: “We are delighted to accept this unique collection of local and national signicance into the permanentcollections of Aberdeenshire Council Museums.“Whilst the recordings are in good condition, they are threatened by physical degradation and some are stored on formats that can no longer be played. Being part of this national initiative will ensure some of our local recordings of Scots music will be digitally preserved and available to folk at home and abroad for future enjoyment and learning.”Alastair Hardie, one of the trustees acting on behalf of the late John Junner, said: “In his will, John Junner asked for his collection to be kept ‘at a suitable location in northeast Scotland’.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.deesidepiper webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Rehomed Horse of Year  Tinto and Fiona Bell.\"  Tinto has been so much more than a friend viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"\"Ten years after his death, his wish has finally been fulfilled with this donation.

The aim is for all recycling centres to reach % by .Up to  new staff are due to be in place by mid-September and will provide advice and assistance to householders about what can be recycled. The additional roles are part of package of improvements agreed by councillors in January.However, a new permit scheme is also being introduced to move business waste away from recycling centres to create more space for new recyclable materials to improve services to householders.While most businesses pay the necessary fees to dispose of their waste and recycling responsibly, the current open access to recycling centres means some business waste is being presented as household waste so that it can be processed free of charge.To tackle this, a new permit scheme is one of the measures being introduced next year to prevent such abuse. Under the new scheme householders using commercial type vehicles - vans, pick-ups, minibuses or trailers - to take materials to recycling centres will require a permit to do so.The permits will be free of charge and can be used at any of the  recycling centres operated by the council.Households will be able to apply for the free permits in advance and a yearrsquos supplywill be issued at one time to minimise inconvenience.Permits can be applied for online or by post at any time of the year and will be valid for  months.Aberdeenshire Council does not expect the new scheme to have an impact on most householders as permits will not be required for cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs or xs, unless they tow a trailer or a horse box.Permits can be obtained for trailers up to  x  ft in size.Certain types of vehicle typically used by businesses will not be permitted at HRCs, specically those over . tonnes gross weight, tippers, tractors, large trailersand vehicles with twin wheels or more than four wheels.Aberdeenshire Councilrsquos Waste Manager, Ros Baxter, said: ldquoThe approval of the new permit system is very good news as it will allow us to make space for more recyclable materials at recycling centres and improve services for householders.ldquoMost households will not be affected by the permit system at all as cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs and xs will continue to have unlimited access to recycling centres.ldquoWe are keen to minimise inconvenience to those householders who use commercial type vehicles or trailers to take materials to recycling centres.\"Only one application is required to get a yearrsquos supply of permits and we have also increased the number of permits to  per year to make sure householders have enough permits to cover the grass cutting season.ldquoWe will be communicating the details of the new permit scheme over the coming months, so there will be plenty of time to apply for the permits before the new scheme starts.ldquoBusinesses will be provided an alternative service at waste transfer stations, and with a lower price for recycling, will be encouraged to segregate and recycle as much of their waste as possible.ldquoWe will be monitoring closely how the new schemes settle in and can tweak them in future based on feedback received.More information about the new recycling permit scheme is available on www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk recyclingcentrepermitsdata-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..!

Free parking of up to one hour will apply as usual in metered car parks over the winter period.Tankerness Lane will be closed to vehicles throughout the works, with one-way systems in place at ious times on Broad Street and Palace Road — with Victoria Street closed to vehicles for approximately five weeks from  January . Pedestrian access will be maintained throughout.The council has said the key aspects of the Place and Spaces project are to improve the area at the bottom of the Strynd and top of Castle Street, provide a new path to the war memorial to enhance it as a place to stop and reflect on the signicance of the monument and improve the head of Victoria Street to encourage more people into this part of the town.Depute council leader, councillor Leslie Manson, said: “The works carried out in Kirkwall’s town centre through our Townscape Heritage Initiative Scheme have given our streets and buildings a much-needed new lease of le, whether that be improvements to the shop fronts or the attractive new paving at the head of Broad Street.“This latest phase is aimed at improving the entrance to Victoria Street to encourage more shoppers and visitors to take a wander down this street — a long-held aspiration of the businesses that are situated there.“There will, of course, be some inevitable disruption, but we’ve worked hard to ensure that this is kept to a minimum, including suspending works for the Christmas period. I look forward to seeing the improvements that are made and the effect these have on our historic streets.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

A refurbished and extended museum is expected to re-open during the summer of .Council leader James Stockan said: “This is a project of tremendous signicance for Hoy and for Orkney as a whole.“It has taken longer than we first hoped to get to this stage and it will be excellent for all involved to see work getting underway soon.“I am delighted that, like the council, the project’s external funders remain fully committed to the scheme.“When complete, the restored and extended museum will for the first time in many years open all year round, encouraging more people to visit Hoy and boosting tourism throughout the island.”The museum’s role is to chart Orkney’s military involvement in the First and Second World Wars and provide a safe home for a major collection of wartime artefacts, many of national and international importance.After a competitive tendering exercise, the contract for the work has been awarded to Orkney BuildersLtd.A temporary exhibition on the wartime history of Scapa Flow is on show at the Hoy Hotel while the museum is closed.

Christ, how many times  IT’S RAPE, you troglodytes.However discomfiting these examples may be, they have nothing on the disingenuous coverage of Boris Johnson’s encounters with Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron. I mean, we could all see him sitting beside Merkel as protesters screamed “Liar” and “Stop Brexit” we could all see him stick his feet up on Macron’s side table like a self-entitled brat .The most inexperienced of analysts would have understood that turning up in Berlin with bluster and braggadocio, but no actual plan B was hardly a masterstroke and that Merkel and Macron’s agreement to give him a month to come up with aalternative was just a tactic to keep him occupied while they get on with important affairs of state.And yet the Express and the– cheerleaders for the worst Prime Minister in history – presented his bilateral talks as a triumph. The Express carried a photo of him raising his arms behind a fence with the headline “Brexit Victory Salute”, ashe were Winston Churchill giving his “Finest Hour” speech rather than a floppy-haired fop back from a European jolly. Thewent with the headline “Johnson Demands Fresh Border Plan”while columnists lined up to explain how he had seen off Macron’s attempts to intimidate him and had reset the EU negotiations. Neither paper pointed out that Macron reiterated that the Irish backstop was “indispensable” and that this is the position they have held ever since Theresa May’s withdrawal deal was negotiated.Their spin – or as Byrne would doubtless prefer us to frame it, “lie” – would be troubling at the best of times but as we are hurtling towards a No Deal, it is utterly irresponsible. At a time when journalists should be pointing out the perils of his misplaced ebullience, many are egging him on, feeding his self-delusion.In her MacTaggart Lecture, Byrne called out the inadequacy of much of our current news coverage and scrutinised some of the reasons for it. She blamed our contemporary leaders – May, Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn – for refusing to submit themselves to scrutiny as previous leaders including Margaret Thatcher did, and went on to compare the way Johnson does his own pieces to camera as Vladimir Putin-style politics.But she also castigated news organisations for believing audiences no longer crave forensic investigations and for talking down to young people. Citing Carole Cadwalladr’s Facebook Cambridge Analytica investigation and the popularity of hard-hitting podcasts, she said there was still an appetite for in-depth exposés, although she didn’t point out that they require resources as well as courage – and that such resources are not widely available.Finally, Byrne talked fearlessly about the need for more ersity: for more women, certainly but much more pressingly for more BAME employees. Although she rejected the phrase “pale, male and stale”, pointing out that many middle-aged white men make excellent programmes, she said TV made by a clique of posh boys was never going to challenge the status quo. “When you change who is making TV, you change TV,” she said.Much of what Byrne raised, we see in action every day the cabal of male presenters who revel in their outmoded attitudes . And the courting of a younger demographic with nattily-dressed presenters, bite-sized news items and YouTube influencers when what many of those who are politically engaged want is to be confronted with new perspectives on giant issues such as climate change. There are exceptions, of course: Jon Snow stands out as a journalist willing to challenge the prevailing orthodoxy, and Five Live journalist Emma Barnett has earned a reputation for skewering political interviewees.But time and time again, especially in  shows and radio phone-ins, broadcasters yield to the demand of  balance, treating journalism as a stand-off between two opposing sides rather than a quest for truth. Nor is BBC Scotland immune to these problems though much of the new channel’s output has been admirable, it is still overwhelmingly white. Meanwhile, The Nine has twice invited alt-right mouthpiece Brendan O’Neill to spout his anti-scientic climate change-denying views. Shouldn’t we be better than this As the spectre of a no-deal Brexit casts its increasingly dark shadow, there does appear to be a collective raising of the game. Over the past week or so, the BBC has been running a series of news packages analysing what a no-deal Brexit might mean in terms of the supply of fuel and medicine and the slaughter of animals that can no longer be exported.But as Byrne says, whatever happens with Brexit, our country is undergoing seismic changes and our broadcasters must do much morethey are to play a crucial role in holding those responsible to account. “We must find courage in this time of crisis,” the Scot said. “We must unite to use the power of television to protect democracy because it is being seriously undermined.” The following day, the Express gave its default response, which was to refer to “an online backlash” invisible to all but them.As Johnson engages in some pre-US trade talk willy-waving – insisting he will tell the US president “the NHS is not on the table” – Byrne’s rallying cry could not be more relevant. As men who couldn’t be trusted to tie their own shoelaces set the global agenda, the public is being failed. We need journalists to be less cowed. But we also need broadcasting companies to be willing to take risks, and newspaper owners to be interested in the actual news. And we need this to happen sooner rather than later.

And the fact we have patter - an entire lexicon of made-up words, converted words and perverted words - would seem to suggest we’re absolutely bloody hilarious.Well, the Big Yin doesn’t agree. “I will get into trouble for this but I don’t think there is such a thing as Scottish humour,” he says. “I have bought books of Scottish jokes and then I go through them and there is nothing Scottish about them. There’s funny and there’s not funny, and that’s the beginning, the middle and the end of it.”Connolly makes his remarks in the introduction to another book of Scottish jokes - his own. Maybe this one will confirm the existence of a tartan-trimmed sense of humour because I cannot imagine Connolly’s gag about the bloke who murders his we emanating from anywhere  in the world.You know it well so I don’t need to repeat it. If I did repeat it I might get into a whole lot of #MeToo - #MeTae  - trouble. If not his most famous or even his best gag, it’s certainly his breakout.His very telling of the joke on Michael Parkinson’s chat show in  - with Parky nervously tightening his tie when Connolly says: “I hope I can get away with this it’s a beauty” - speaks of Scottish bravado laced with ach-what-the-hell  fatalism.The central character in the joke - the bumper-off-er - is sardonic but more than that, he’s - good Scottish word - pawky. The joke is absurd. It is bleak and black. It is grim almost to the point of being macabre. Now, is the Big Yin of today really saying that these are traits with which the Scottish character is unfamiliar  There is local colour: “A close is the entrance to a tenement,” Connolly advises. Finally, there is resourcefulness - thrt, even - in the corpse being buried bottom-up. Very Scottish, that. The events sound far-fetched but the narrator with the Jesus haircut and the big-collared leather jaikit hints at veracity when he says he was told about them by a man in the street. If they’re fiction, however, and Connolly did hear the yarn second-hand, then it would seem that there’s at least one other guy out there with the same sense of humour - Scottish humour - as him.Of course there are many. Connolly’s Glasgow in particular is full of comedians. They might drive taxis or run pubs or go to the football. Their humour is not affected or aimed at any more of an audience than those in the immediate vicinity. When something bugs them or amuses them they feel compelled to let rip with their point of view. Iniably this is funny.Before the Fringe became overrun with stand-ups, the Olympic-standard test of a comedian was Glasgow’s Pavilion Theatre. There, would-be wits regularly stfed. Maybe they didn’t end up being used as bike-racks but they never worked that town again - further proof that Scotland in particular does not have a casual relationship with comedy, knows what it likes, is often funnier than the advertised act . In the years BC - Before Connolly - the funniest man in Scotland to my mind was Lex McLean. Stanley Baxter was a bigger star but “Sexy Lexy” - the only time his history that a bauchle in a bunnet has managed to acquire the epithet - seemed more subversive, the Rolling Stones next to the Beatles. Not that I knew what subversive meant, aged ten .Chic Murray’s droll observations, tinged with the surreal, continue to inspire, judging by the sample gags from this year’s Fringe. It was Connolly, though, who took the comedy of Scotland - and often the comedy implicit in being Scottish - onto the world stage. Being Scottish, maybe unfortunately, is funny. It was Frankie Boyle who quipped: “Glasgow was a great choice of venue for the Commonwealth Games - a place where they think Hepatitis B is a vitamin.” But in Kevin Bridges’ genius joke about the traditions of the “empty” we refuse to become homogenised and certainly not Americanised. Wha’s like us  Nobody, and none funnier.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"solidarity not subsidy underpins union between scotland and england brian monteith","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Politicians should nurture ties among people that have more in common than drives them apart, writes Brian MonteithScottish unionists who bang on about a union idend are playing a very dangerous game, one that risks playing directly into nationalist hands and leaving them without arguments for remaining in the United Kingdom.Last week we had the annual announcement of the Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotlandfigures and with it the usual claims and counter claims by unionists and nationalists seeking to gain partisan advantage from the data provided. Please note before I go any further that the information is released by the Scottish Government it is prepared by its own statisticians and carries with it the First Minister’s seal of approval, even though she could not be bothered to give this key publication the time of day. Over the years the methodology has been refined to take account of any possible gaps in the information presented, while politically motivated hoaxes, such as the whisky export tax, or “missing” allocations of public spending projects like Crossrail and HS have been debunked. Importantly, allowance is also made for looking at the figures with or without tax revenues from oil and gas production.The essential finding was that for the period of - Scotland had a public sector deficit of £. billion, slightly down on the year before. Average tax revenue per head was demonstrated to be £ lower in Scotland than in the rest of the UK, while spending per head has climbed to £,. Put together, these two figures define the fiscal transfer of £, per man woman and child that takes place seamlessly between the UK Treasury and the Scottish Government, including apportioned UK spending for defence and other mutual services Scotland benefits from.By themselves the GERS figures cannot and do not sayan independent Scotland could be economically sustainable. What they tell us is where the likely starting point would be were we to decide to leave the UK, before any changes could be made in Scottish government policy to alter the existing landscape. There would be notional Scottish spending of £.bn supported by an income of only £.bn – giving the estimated deficit of £.bn. Against Scotland’s Gross Domestic Productthe deficit was  per cent, compared to a deficit of . per cent for the UK. To put this in context Scotland would have the largest deficit as a share of GDP in the developed world, certainly the worst in Europe and way beyond the EU’s guideline limit of  per cent for its members.Taking account of the regional figures available via the UK’s Office of National Statistics there can be no doubt that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland provide a deficit against England’s surplus that leaves the whole UK in deficit, albeit reducing. Given the foregoing, Scotland’s receipt of this fiscal transfer is obviously not unique, indeed within England itself the tax revenues from the three regions of London, the South East and East notionally transfer to support all the other English regions, including the North West, North East, Yorkshire and West Midlands.This is the nature of fiscal transfers, where economically prosperous nations or regions fund a pool that is used to support those parts of the UK that are enduring harder times. Contributions and withdrawals to and from this pool will y over time, with some requiring help one year – or even decades – while at other times being the source of community municence.It is dangerous to justy participation in a country purely on economic terms while ignoring the greater historical, social and cultural bonds or strategic interests that make an entity greater than the sum of its parts. It is a good thing that when oil revenues collapsed the UK was able to ensure there was no catastrophic impact on Scottish public finances – as there would have beenScotland had voted for independence in . It is not a good thing for Scotland to run a large deficit and be reliant on the UK to make that forever possible.To justy Scotland’s place in the UK because it receives a “union idend” of nearly £, per person is like accelerating towards a blind summit, unaware of the hard landing that awaits politically.If unionists rely upon a figure to define the union idend then they must accept that correspondingly there will in some years be a union premium – a time when Scotland’s allocated tax revenues are greater than the spending it makes. Personally, I think this is a good thing, for it is what the union idend is really all about. It is a process, not a number a process that is built upon British solidarity, a shared experience of helping each other in times of great need from our hardest endeavours, creative genius or even just fortunate bounty.Indeed we can see from the official figures over the last  years that there have been times when Scotland has contributed to the maintenance of the UK and others when it has itself been supported. Since  Scotland has contributed a net £bn to the UK in real terms – a figure that shall undoubtedly be cancelled out by next year’s GERS figures. I know it is hard to imagine at a time when the SNP Scottish Government demonstrates with impressive regularity its ability to miscalculate it own economic forecasts and deliver poorer results in too many sections of the pubic services year-on-year – but the deficit could eventually change were the politicians to alter their centralising and incompetent ways.The private sector of the Scottish economy does relatively well despite the Scottish Government, rather than because of it. It could, with a change towards lower taxes and fewer regulations, achieve greater results and therefore contribute higher revenues while spending is restrained. When that day comes where stands the argument about the union idendit is measured by price alone How then will the argument fare that we should remain in the UK because of the Union Dividend when the GERS figures allow the SNP to complain about a similarly ridiculous “Union Premium”  Unionist politicians should stop focussing on the number and start concentrating on the shared benefits of giving and receiving help amongst people that have more in common than drives them apart. They should instead talk about how the deficit is reduced and how Scotland can help the weaker parts of the Union just as we have been helped when we needed it.Brian Monteith MEP is editor of ThinkScotland.org©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"picture gallery oscar marzaroli s priceless photos of a bygone glasgow returning home","story":"His photographs of children playing around the tenements in the Gorbals and people going about their daily lives in the s are regarded as being some of the most evocative and iconic ever taken of le in Glasgow and the west of Scotland.Now the priceless photography of Oscar Marzaroliare ing to Glasgow, his adopted city, after his family donated his works to Glasgow Caledonian University.Italian-born Marzaroli moved to Scotland with his family at the age of two and later attended Glasgow School of Art.

He also reacted angrily to the news that Mr Goodlad could not be in attendance, shaking his head as Mr Halcro Johnston explained his absence.SNP candidate Tom Wills began by saying that #Shetland is ready for a change# and asked for  months to show what he can achieve in Holyrood, while Lib Dem competitor Beatrice Wishart opened her speech with a defiant message: #If you want an MSP who will speak up for Shetland, I’m your woman#.The first question of the night revolved around transport, with Ms Wishart and Mr Wills clashing immediately, interrupting each other#s answers as Mr Johnston appealed for both candidates to let the other finish.Mr Halcro Johnston responded to Mr Wills# five-point transport plan by saying that #Tom Wills has a load of great ideas but they won’t be delivered#, while independent candidate Ryan Thomson added that #nothing gets done” because “Shetland is the pawn” in mainland politics.Councillor George Smith directed a question at Mr Wills, asking him how he expected the SIC to afford one of his election pledges, free foot passengers on inter-island ferries.Mr Wills responded to say that this could be paid for #, and when# the Scottish government provided additional funding to the council.Mr Thomson criticised the NorthLink ferries in response to a question about increased capacity on the ferries. He focused his attack on the much-maligned sleeping pods, not for the first time, saying that we had been #lumbered# with these pods and said he was reticent to even call them pods, instead saying #it#s a chair#.#Bigger ships# and #daytime sailings# were potential solutions that Mr Thomson suggested as alternatives.On the subject of Brexit, only Conservative representative Mr Halcro Johnston said that he was in favour of Brexit, although he admitted that he voted to remain in the EU.Mr Scott and Mr Wills attacked the coalition of the Tories and the Lib Dems, with Mr Scott saying that the #Tories and Liberals approved austerity and that they had #turned to the racists and the fascists# which garnered wide applause.Mr Halcro Johnston responded to say it was #always very amusing listening to Ian but I’m afraid he’s wrong#, which was met negatively by the audience.Mr Wills said that the SNP #could stop Brexit#, and added thatthey were pulled out of the EU by Westminster then a vote for independence could put Scotland back into the European Union.He expanded on Mr Scott#s point by saying the #reason why people voted for Brexit is because of the coalition of Lib Dems and Tories which approved austerity# to a rapturous reception. Ms Wishart responded to the issue of Brexit to say that it was #time for a peoples vote and time for people to work together across parties# to stop Brexit.Scottish independence was the next topic up for debate, and understandably provoked perhaps the most isive reactions of the night.Mr Scott, Mr Wills and the Green Party#s Debra Nicolson all came out in favour of an independent Scotland, while Mr Halcro Johnston, Ms Wishart and independent Peter Tait were against it. Both independent candidates, Michael Stout and Ryan Thomson, said they would wait to see what benefit Shetland could get from Scotland becoming independent before deciding how to vote, should another referendum come up.Mr Scott#s positive attitude towards independence was because, he said, # nothing  we#ll get rid of these damned Tories#.Ms Wishart wanted the audience to #imagine the chaos#Scotland tried to break up the union, citing Brexit as an example. She said the vote was supposed to be #once in a letime# and that there were better priorities for funding, such as healthcare.Mr Wills responded to this point: #which has been cut by the Tory Liberal coalition#, to audience applause.Conservative representative Mr Halcro Johnston said that #I think SNP talk about independence because its easier than talking about their failings#, and added that nobody would be surprised to find that he was against independence.I#m sorry, Tom Wills is havering. Independence will not keep Scots in, or bring us back into, the EU. EvenBritain stays in, Scotland will leave, automatically, with #No Deal#, on Independence Day and will have to reapply to join. The EU has confirmed this, in writing.Also,nothing changes, our starting budget deficit will be £. billion per annumversus the EU#s limit of about £ billion . The UK will stop paying funding that.We shall have to cut spending raise taxes by some £ billion p.a. on an annual budget of about £ billion, to satisfy the EU#s economic conditions for joining.That means we shall face years of withering austerity, just when we need to spend more to stimulate the economy.We also need to set up our own independent central bank which the nationalist think tank #The Common Weal# says will take nine years from an Indy Yes vote. So we shall be out of the EU, with #No Deal#, for at least, seven years from Independence Day.Scots are canny folk. They will not vote for such an independence prospectus.John, your oft repeated notion that an independent Scotland will start with a budget deficit of £. billionis an entire fancy. Whatdebt an independent Scotland may have to take on as a share of the current UK#s debt, in the event of Scotland becoming independent, will be a matter for negotiation and agreement . Similarly, matters such as whether, and for what fees , the rest of the former UK might be permitted to retain its weapons of mass destruction on Scottish soil will be for negotiation agreement in the event of Scotland becoming independent.I would not hold my breath waiting for their answer.Ian Scott and Tom Wills have very selective memories. The austerity cuts introduced by the last Conservative  Lib Dem coalition were in response to the mess Brown and Blair made of the British economy. The outcome of this prudent handling of the deficit was obviously popular with the British people because David Cameron’s government won an overall majority in the subsequent election. David Cameron also delivered on another election pledge to have an in out referendum on Europe. How can the SNP criticise any party for that they have never delivered on an election pledge in their le. Finally, the only racism and fascism that has come out of this by-election has been promoted by the SNP anti-English racism. The SNP are Tartan Fascists.It#s like I wasnt even there.No mention of Labours position on Brexit or Independence. Thanks guysYou#ll have to listen tonight folks, there isnt even any mention of VE which was discussed@Brian Hill, It is you who fantasise, not I. I did not mention #national debt#. So let#s set aside the #smoke and mirrors#. I am talking about the £. billion gap between Scottish tax revenue raised last year and money received from Westminster. We have been running similar, sometimes larger deficits for many years. Unless something changes this will become our annual budget deficit on obtaining independence as Westminster will no longer fund the shortfall.Don#t take it from me. A couple of years back, the SNP#s own Sustainable Growth Commission conceded that we would start independence with a budget deficit of .% of our GDP, around £. billion per year, and proposed a multi-year plan to reduce it to less than %, which just happens to be the EU#s maximum permissible limit..."},{"url":null,"title":"a68 currently closed after serious collision","story":"UPDATE ON CRASH ONLINE HERE: https:www.thesouthernreporter news crime update-man-charged-by-police-in-connection-with-a-crash-- A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: “Officers were called around .pm to a report of a serious collision on the A, south of St Boswells, involving two vehicles.“Emergency services remain at the scene. “The road is closed in both directions and ersion#s are in place.”"},{"url":null,"title":"no question about mp s determination to help walkerburn","story":"z Pictured: Mr Mundell presents the cheque to Walkerburn village hall representatives, from left: Win Pennel, secretary Kinta Lindsay, committee member and Denise Hanks, vice-chairwoman."},{"url":null,"title":"these could be the 16 messiest car interiors in the whole of the uk","story":"These car owners are really taking the biscuithowever.

This would be completed over the next two or three months, he said.On the issue of smell, the two sources are from the -metre chimney and from the hatches of the fish meal boats. The former was cleaned out last week after contaminants were discovered inside the base of the stack, said Mr Jonermark, and the amount of bacteria used to pury the air in a filter chamber has been increased. Highland Council would be approached to seethey would agree to a -metre extension to the height of the chimney.As far as the feed boats are concerned, Mr Nilsson said the problem arises when the hatches are opened so that the fish meal can be delivered to the plant. This will occur for about  hours per year, he said, and the firm is currently working on a solution to that.Mr Jonermark added: #We do not want this to be a problem for anyone. We do not want this situation to continue.#We want to make a positive contribution to the village and we will continue to invest to make sure the problems go away. By next summer the plant should be quiet and there should be no smell.#"},{"url":null,"title":"community spirit shines in cullybackey","story":"RHS Britain in Bloom judges visited Cullybackey this week, taking in a tour of the village and seeing first hand the community efforts.As winners of the Ulster in Bloom Large Village category in , Cullybackey was nominated to join other high achieving communities across the UK in the RHS Britain In Bloom  finals.RHS judges Geraldine King and Jim Goodwin also met with community representatives during their visit.Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor Maureen Morrow said: “Here in Mid and East Antrim we have established a reputation as an award winning borough, thanks to our Mid and East Antrim In Bloom campaign which encourages everyone who lives in the borough to think about their local environment and how flowers, plants and gardens can enhance it for people and wildle. “By actively supporting our ‘In Bloom’ campaign, residents not only brighten our borough but can help boost the economy and tourism.“Cullybackey is a prime example of this.

The disease can lead to early loss of le, cause preventable sight loss in working age people, and is a major contributor to kidney failure, heart attack, stroke and even amputation, yet the illness is often preventable by adopting healthier lestyle changes.The new Diabetes Prevention Programme is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic – those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range – by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor.Cullybackey patient Thelma Shanks from Cullybackey was referred onto the programme this year. She said: “There is a history of hypertension and diabetes in my family. “Several of my paternal aunts sadly passed away due to complications that came with the disease, and my mum was found to be diabetic following admission to hospital for routine tests. “I was born in London, but grew up in my parent country, Jamaica. I ed to the UK for good in , and my husband and I moved to Northern Ireland, where all my children were born, in . “As a nation, we from the Caribbean tend to be a bit more susceptible to diabetes than others, so it wasn’t a complete surprise to be told I was at risk of developing the disease. “I am also a trained doctor so despite having given up my profession when I had children, I have knowledge of the medical risk.“I have a wonderful busy family le. I have four children, all of which I home schooled, and of course, their needs always came before mine. “When you’re running a busy house and looking after everyone  it’s easy to forget to look after yourself. However, in  when I heard that a health fair was coming to the area I decided to go along. For a small fee they carried out multiple tests which showed I had hypertension or high blood pressure. “I decided to make an appointment with my GP who put me on a number of drugs, first Irbesartan, then Amlodipine and finally a diuretic to bring my blood pressure under control.“I realised I needed to be more careful with my diet and tried to be a bit healthier but I admit it was a bit half-hearted. TESTS“My blood sugar levels were border-line they weren’t going down but they weren’t going up either, so I thought everything was all right. I was having routine check-ups with my nurse at this stage so I was on her radar and having blood tests taken intermittently. In April  I had my regular tests done and then hopped on a plane to London. “It was my daughter’s birthday and I had decided to treat her by going away for the week. We had just made it to the hotel when I received a phone call from my nurse. “She said tests showed my sugar levels were up and I was actually diabetic, which was the wake-up call I needed. Let’s just say it wasn’t quite the luxury week that I had planned! My daughter certainly ate well, but no sugar passed my lips that trip. “Needless to say, I had the blood tests repeated soon after our , and was delighted to learn that due to my dietary sacrices, my blood sugar levels had again receded into the ‘pre-diabetic’ band.“Prior to our trip away, my doctor had called me. She said there was a new Diabetes Prevention Programme starting soon in my area being run by the Public Health Agency. She askedI would be interested and of course I agreed.“The class has  others in it and we meet on Wednesday afternoons. There are eight women and two men, and together we re-learn what we should be eating, what to avoid, and how to step up our exercise routines. “I’ve found it really helpful because everyone is in the same boat and we can share our experiences and encourage one another. “Each week we build on the goals of the previous weeks, paying attention to diet and exercise and gaining strength from each other.“I used to believe that running after a busy family was exercise enough but now I’m walking every other day, trying to increase my pace and my distance. My daughter and I often walk together and I try to keep up with her. LONG TERM“One day I managed , steps in one walk and  of those miles were uphill. I’m trying to make long term changes and make sure these become habits I’ll stick to for the rest of my le. So far I’ve lost  kg, and my exercise levels have increased signicantly too. My blood sugar levels have decreased, but more importantly I feel better physically and psychologically. “The Diabetes Prevention Programme and the team who deliver it have been amazing. I’m looking forward to seeing a new me at the end of the nine and a half month course.”Thelma was referred onto the Diabetes Prevention Programme by her GP Dr Jean McCaughern, Maine Medical Practice, CullybackeyThe practice serves around , patients that live within a six mile radius of the surgery. Dr Jean McCaughern joined the surgery around  years ago and was placed in charge of the practice’s diabetes clinic.At first she managed this alone, today she heads up this specialist clinic with the help of two practice nurses. She does this alongside her normal GP responsibilities.She said: “When I first started the clinic around % of our patients were diabetic and that included those who had both type  and type  diabetes. Today that figure has more than doubled. In  we have a prevalence rate of .%. That’s how quickly the disease is on the rise. “Often patients don’t realise just how serious the illness is. I have overheard patients saying ‘I just have a touch of diabetes’ or ‘I only have diabetes’, but it’s a serious illness which can cause deterioration of vision, contribute to heart disease, kidney disease, stroke, and vascular problems which at their worst can lead to amputation.“Patients of mine have had all these problems and more. The reality is dferent to the perception and it’s only when dficulties start that people begin to understand what living with diabetes can mean. The longer you have the disease, the more likely you are to have any one of those complications.“Having diabetes presents practical problems too. In some cases the DVLA can revoke people’s drivers licensestheythey believe there is poor management of diabetes. This can include raised sugars, but more importantly sugar levels dropping and causing confusion in patients as is would be unsafe to drive.“For some people having diabetes is out of their control. Those with Type  diabetes have no choice but to manage it using medication. “For others who spot heightened blood sugar levels early, termed pre-diabetic, they have a window of opportunity to reverse or delay a diagnosis of Type  diabetes through healthy eating and exercise. That’s who the Diabetes Prevention Programme is aimed at and who it can help.“Once higher sugar levels are discovered, the earlier people can make changes and the higher the chance they have of reversing the outcome. Sometimes, it’s not about changing the diagnosis but delaying it by a decade or so. “The longer you can hold it off the longer you can hold off the complications that come with it. “It’s not all bad news though, having diabetes, whether Type  or Type , is largely manageable either by medication, treatment or diet. “Insulin, used primarily for treating type  diabetes, lowers blood sugar levels when diet and exercise alone aren’t sufficient, but the effectiveness of these medications depends on how early the disease is diagnosed and the size of the dose.“I was happy to get involved in the Programme. Having an interest in diabetes I was approached by the Public Health Agency at the operational stage to look at the programme’s viability in my area. I’m a big supporter. “So far I’ve referred around  people from the practice onto the programme which educates and empowers people of the contents of foods, the need to exercise and develop better eating patterns. “Often I’ve heard people say once they have to go on a special diabetes diet but that’s not the case, it’s just healthy eating, it’s the way we should all be eating.“As far as the success of the programme goes, it’s a little early to tell. The first cohort of people started on the programme in May and early results are positive. Certainly weight loss as a group has occurred and people have more knowledge of food, portion control and exercise.“So, there are benefits for all and for some the course is working really well. When you join the programme as a group you bond as a group, you encourage each other, you don’t want to let your group members down. “That shared experience and cohesiveness is a real motivator and works across all ages and all groups. For many the programme offers them a chance to turn a future diagnosis around and gives them the tools to change their future. “That can be le changing and what the programme is designed to do”.KEY FACTSThe Diabetes Prevention Programme is run by the Public Health Agency.It is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic – those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range – by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor.The Diabetes Prevention Programme is delivered over a nine month period and is free of charge.It is facilitated by health coaches who offer help and assistance to participants, helping them change their lestyle, diet and physical activity with the aim of postponing and even preventing type  diabetes.For more information on the ‘Diabetes Prevention Programmeemail your local Health Trustdiabetespreventionni@northerntrust.hscni.netst  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2094373.jpg--.jpg?1566376242000\n","title":"talent galore at music mania event","story":"Broughshane was alive with the sound of music last weekend when the Music Mania event rolled into the village.Local people were given the chance to take to the stage and show off their musical abilities and talents, both with instruments and voice.Many turned out to not only take part, but also to watch on and support those on stage.Bob Esler was the compare for the evening where there was live music on stage from pm with an open mic session and a BBQ proving popular with everyone.

Whether it’s further education or the world of employment, the important thing is not to panic. There are loads of options available and, as McDonald’s Westwood’s Business Manager Katie McManus can attest, an unexpected road can often be the best one.The -year-old began working in McDonald’s in Glengormley while studying for her A-levels. Aged , Katie had plans of going to University and becoming a Mental Health Nurse, but completely changed direction following her time at the fast food restaurant. “I decided not to go to university and to take a gap year after my exams,” she explained.“I went Crew Member to Sht Manager and then realised that’s what I wanted to do. I got promoted the whole way through to Business Manager. “Personally, I wouldn’t advise anyone to go to university until they know what they want to do. There’s no point wasting the time and money doing it. I would encourage people who are maybe panicking about grades not to worry. There are dferent things out there, and you’re not always taught that in school or given all the options. I never thought I would be working in McDonald’s but the option found me.”She continued: “It’s not what people would assume – it’s very business orientated for me. You’re very driven to work towards targets and it’s competitive. The teamwork and morale is amazing too, you literally feel like you’re with your family away from home.”As well as offering a career, McDonald’s also offers a range of educational and professional development courses to help employees attain everything from GCSE’s to university degree.“There are so many opportunities,” Katie said. “You can constantly get promoted towards Business Manager and then after that you have options to become a franchiser one day, which is a big opportunity butyou really want it you can push for it. “We have people at the minute studying for the GCSEs through our apprenticeship programmes, so they’re getting their Maths and English qualications, which will help them in the future le. Because I didn’t go to university, the option is there for me to do a business degree, which I’m planning on doing next year, so I didn’t miss out on that.”She continued: “I was quite anxious and nervous about making the decision not to go to university. It’s hard to knowyou’re making the right decision at that age. “Looking back, I’m glad it turned out that way. I would say to some of the young ones in here not to panic. Everything happens for a reason and you don’t know what path you’re going to go down until you go down it. GCSE’s and other exams are important, but there are other avenues that you can go down to get dferent jobs.”She added: “McDonald’s don’t really on experience and what you have in your qualications – it’s all about your attitude, your attitude to doing well and how hard you work. “If you are hard working and they really want to make something ofyourself then you should come here.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"front door side door always a welcome","story":"BORN and bred in North Belfast, Brendan Rafferty is a well-known figure to many in the food and catering industry. With over thirty years experience in the field, he has been the head chef, first manager and then owner of the popular The Side Door restaurant, located at Febro Buildings on the Antrim Road in Glengormley for  years.Brendan grew up on the Cltonville Road until he was  years old when his parents moved to the Antrim Road. His first part-time job came in the old Lansdowne Court as it was known back in the day.Ever since a young age, Brendan was interested in the food and catering industry and decided to pursue a career in the field when he left school at . After three years at the College of Business in Brunswick Street in Belfast, he went on to complete a B-Tech qualication and an advanced catering course.Subsequent employment followed in the shape of a full-time role in the Lansdowne before spells in Belfast Castle, the Crawfordsburn Inn and Chimney Corner.But it is with his current venture The Side Door that he has made his name, establishing the -seater restaurant ever since taking over six years ago as the new owner.Brendan explained: “The Side Door is basically a family-style restaurant with something on the menu for everyone. The menu is very mainstream.“The previous owner’s menu was something close to fine dining but people were still ordering pizzas. I thought it wasn’t right so I changed the menu about a bit.“I had my own ideas and kept it mainstream to attract anybody and everybody.“The pressure was there to get bums on seats and it has worked ever since so I have no intention of changing it.”Brendan also acts as Head Chef at The Side Door and thanks to his wealth of experience, he has put his own style and spin on food.“I would cook things like lasagne, carbonara, scampi and burgers,” he added.“Everything is home-made. I am experienced enough to know what way things are cooked best and what sells well.“I used to be a sauce chef and I suppose sauces and soups are still my forte.It is still probably my favourite aspect of being in the kitchen.“I was brought up in the catering industry on a French theme which is something I still like doing, especially with some of the specials in the restaurant in some shape or form.”As for how things have changed in the industry, Brendan points to a number of ious things he has noticed over the years.“The food industry has changed massively over the years,” he explained.“Themes and customers needs and wants are like night and day now since when I started off over  years ago.“Food takes waves now, much like politics. whether Italian or Mexican themed.“There are more vegans and vegetarians than ever before but allergies is such a big thing these days. Celiac is definitely the main one and you just have to be so careful.“I probably wouldn’t have taken as much of an interest in allergies but when I found out my daughter had a nut allergy, it changed everything. It scared me.”Looking ahead to the future, Brendan reflected on what he has achieved so far at The Side Door.“Glengormley is a perfect setting. People thought I was mad taking The Side Door on with the amount of competition but my idea wasyou want to buy a washing machine and there is more than one shop available in the same area to buy it, you will still compare it, just like restaurants.“I think we stand out because we are not pretentious. Many restaurants are, in my opinion. We are not – what you see is what you get: fresh food bought from a number of dferent suppliers who I have built up a relationship with over the years. I buy the best produce that I can get but at affordable prices for customers.“I believe also in good service and to my knowledge, we are still the only bring-your-own restaurant in Glengormley.“As for the future, I am not getting any younger. I thought around two years ago about looking for a bigger premises. What I have to turn away from a Thursday to a Sunday now is scary some weeks, but I thought here was working. I decided to stay because things are good and long may it continue.“Customers keep coming back so I must be doing something right.”Brendan Rafferty is Owner, Manager and Head Chef at The Side Door restaurant in Glengormley.The Side Door,Febro Buildings,Ballyclare Road,Glengormley,BT DZ.Tel:   "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"portrait honour for campaigner raymond","story":"A PORTRAIT of a local victims campaigner has gone on display as part of an exhibition by an artist who believes he embodies the true spirit of the north.The painting of Raymond McCord is among  by artist Shauna Fox that have gone on display at the exhibition in the Sea Holly Gallery in Hill Street.Shaunawas born in Bangor but is now based in London, where she is studying fine art painting at Camberwell College of Arts. She makes paintings, sculptures and installations related to being a woman in st century Britain and, more recently, issues related to the north.Shaunw asked her father to pick someone for a portrait who he believes unites communities here. His answer was Newtownabbey man Raymond, who became well-known for his work as a victims campaigner after his son, Raymond Jnr, was murdered by the UVF in .Shauna explained: “Raymond McCord is a victims’ campaigner and he’s a man I’ve always admired – an archetypal Ulster man, brave, unrelenting and he believes that the only way we can deal with the past and move forward isboth communities deal with it together.“My work focuses a lot on ethical issues and human rights. I have explored the destruction of Aleppo by barrel bombs, the oppression of women in relation to honour and sacrice and the Troubles in Belfast.“I studied Ethics at school and from there I became interested in humanitarian and ethical issues. I knew my peers knew little of the atrocities, injustices and inhumanity being carried out at home and abroad on a daily basis and so I based my artwork around these issues in an attempt to raise awareness and present my thoughts, views and responses to them in an innovative and stimulating way.“This body of work is mainly based on my experience of living in Northern Ireland for  years, moving to London and then looking at it from afar. Moving away has made me interested in finding out more about where I’m from, but the more I discover about where I’m from, the more I question whether it’s somewhere I can be proud of and want to live in again.”Raymond said he was “honoured” to be featured in the exhibition.“It is an honour to have a portrait done. I never ever dreamt something like this would happen to me. Unbelievable. I can#t thank the artist enough.“The portrait itself will be dedicated to my son young Raymond and the rest of the innocent victims and in particular to the many from North Belfast.

has rejected the findings of a poll which revealed that almost three out of five voters in Northern Ireland would prefer a border down the Irish Sea to a hard Brexit.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the idea that more people here would rather remain closely aligned with the EU than the UK is in no way reflective of the community he represents.The survey carried out by Belfast-based polling and market research company LucidTalk asked people how they would vote in a referendum proposing that Northern Irelandremained aligned to the European Union, \"perhaps staying in the single market and the customs union\".Read MoreDire Brexit warnings of no-deal listed in leaked document dismissed by DUPAlex Kane: Boris Johnson could be tempted by Brexit backstop only for Northern IrelandCorbyn: Brexit

in the Irish Sea\" and would rather Northern Ireland remained more closely aligned with the EU than Great Britain.Some .% said they would reject the compromise, while .% said they did not know.Within the response, unionist voters were largely opposed to the prospect of breaking away from the United Kingdom in favour of the EU, with some % of Democratic Unionists and % of Ulster Unionists rejecting the idea.However, Sir Jeffrey questioned the level of support for staying aligned with the EU indicated by the LucidTalk poll, saying it contrasts with the views of his constituents in Lagan Valley.\"These polls by LucidTalk I dont think accurately reflect opinion,\" he told the Belfast .\"Their polling methods are not reflective of the wider community, especially on the unionist side.\"In contrast to the  of people that they poll, the people that I talk to in my own constituency do not share that view at all. data-dfpadtargetingSir Jeffrey Donaldson\"A clear majority of them would not support Northern Ireland being separated from the UK.\"As the UK hurtles towards its exit from the European Union, which Prime Minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly said will go ahead with

position of opposing the backstop and protecting links with the United Kingdom. data-dfpadtargetingMartina Anderson\"We believe that it is not in Northern Irelands best interests, economically or in any other way, to be torn away from Great Britain,\" he continued.He said the UK is one of the largest economies in the world.\"We export far more goods to Great Britain than we do to the rest of the world, including the EU combined, so I dont think it is a credible or rational approach that we should create barriers between ourselves and what is by far our biggest market.\" However, nationalist politicians said the poll is an accurate reflection of public opinion in Northern Ireland and comes as no surprise.An overwhelming number of nationalists opted for closer alignment with the EU, with % of Sinn Fein and SDLP voters who responded to the poll backing the Northern Ireland only backstop.Sinn Fein MEP Martina Anderson said the survey reinforces her view that more people would prefer a united Ireland as a means to staying within the EU than a potentially catastrophic crash-out.\"Opinion poll after opinion poll has shown that the majority are in support of a pathway back into the EU,\" she said.\"I think we need to acknowledge that the vast majority of people in the north voted against Brexit.\"If faced with the choice, they would prefer an enhanced border in the Irish Sea.\"Ms Anderson added: \"If unionists are surprised, they dont have their finger on the pulse of the people that they represent,\" she said.\"The majority of the people quite clearly dont want to see a hardened border.\"Also responding to the survey, SDLP Brexit spokesperson Daniel McCrossan said his only surprise is that the number of people who favour a border in the Irish Sea over a potential hard Brexit is not higher.\"Brexit has been an absolute calamity which looks about to end in a disastrous no-deal,\" the West Tyrone MLA said.\"This will be bad for business, trade and commerce.\"It will especially hit people hard along the border.\"A united Ireland has become a reality for many now and not just an aspiration.\"It should be no surprise to anyone that a further majority wants to avoid a hard border on this island that would interrupt integrated supply chains, damage our economy and bring hardship to border communities.\"Its sadly also no surprise that the DUP continues to ignore the wishes of most people.\"The Tory-DUP Government at Westminster has no mandate for a no-deal exit.\"The majority of middle ground voters also supported the compromise, with % of Alliance voters and % Green Party voters backing the proposition."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38421911.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/2008192-_Read-Only_.jpg","title":"1000 children on waiting list yet trust returns half its

Businesses realise the importance of and indeed the opportunities created by going beyond environmental compliance.\"The British Government has recently carried out a consultation on a depositscheme. \"Scotland is moving ahead with theirs and again we in the north run the risk of being left behind - particularly in the absence of a government to drive this forward.\""},{"url":null,"title":"leading economist describes latest electricity price rise as unfair burden on consumers","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Where are the checks and balances here \"He added: \"Customers should not be suffering the result of inefficiencies.\"A spokesman for The Consumer Council said it \"remains disappointed\" with the electricity tarf increase which he said \"is in contrast to the wholesale gas market which has fallen by % over the last  months\".He added: \"The electricity market in Northern Ireland is complex and therefore consumers in Northern Ireland need to receive information and reassurances that they are receiving from the Utility Regulator and Power NI the best possible regulated electricity price.\"A spokeswoman for the Utility Regulator defended its recent decision and said: \"Power NIs tarf remains around % less than the GB price cap and around % less than the Republics average standard tarf.\"We continuously monitor all the drivers that impact on the NI electricity market and intensively challenge the Power NI tarf alongside key stakeholders,\" she said.\"We have analysed and confirmed all elements of the Power NI tarf to ensure it reflects the forecast costs of supplying electricity for the coming period. We are satisfied these costs are accurate.\"A Power NI spokeswoman defended the price rise in light of a fall in wholesale natural gas prices, which represent the biggest single part of costs.\"Power NI, like all suppliers here, is obliged to include costs such as electricity network and market costs in our bills,\" she said.\"These costs are not ours and not within our control.\"Wholesale prices are not a factor in this price rise as they are largely flat, but there were some seasonally high prices last winter, which had to be covered.\"The Utility Regulator approves all of the input costs that go towards making up an electricity bill from us and would be best placed to provide information on how inidual costs are derived.\"Writing in todays Belfast , Mr Simpson said that Northern Ireland energy market observers \"were surprised to learn that the Regulator had approved a .% increase for domestic customers\".He pointed out that it follows \"UK-wide comment on the prospect of reduced electricity prices as the wholesale cost of natural gas has recently been falling\".\"A contrast between lower wholesale prices and higher NI prices is possible, depending on any major local dference in costs, but it merits a careful explanation,\" he said.He also criticised the Utility Regulator for asking the public \"to accept on trust the hidden arithmetic\" that \"demonstrates how a % fall in wholesale gas prices converts into a .% household price increase\".Mr Simpson concluded: \"The Regulator and the official consultees have done a disservice to customers by failing to offer an adequate explanation of the tarf decision.\""},{"url":null,"title":"minister says loss of psni station linked to vandalism at his church","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Police continue to work with the local community representatives, statutory and partner agencies in an effort to combat incidents of anti-social behaviour and criminal damage and will continue to do so.“Dedicated local policing team officers and a neighbourhood policing team patrol Ballyclare in line with other priorities.“Neighbourhood officers work alongside community bodies such as Ballyclare street pastors, community safety wardens and the local community to address local and community issues and concerns. We encourage the reporting of incidents of anti-social behaviour and any other issues so that we can address these and keep the community safe.”"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It featured dramatic images of the famous Selma to Montgomery civil rights march in , alongside work on the Northern Irish civil rights struggle, from the first march in August  to the Battle of the Bogside in .Picturing Derry brought together some of the most iconic images from the Troubles and the most recent exhibition explored anxieties around Brexit which were part of a series of cross-border projects.Local artists were also regularly showcased at the gallery.Earlier this year plans to build a whiskey distillery in Ebrington fell through.But last week positive news emerged of plans to build two Grade A office blocks and a -apartment retirement village at the Waterside site.The Nerve Centre was contacted for comment regarding the gallery’s closure but did not respond at the time of going to press.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"new cain documents highlight unresolved political issues","story":"A new batch of documents added to Ulster University’s CAIN archive demonstrate how important issues affecting Northern Irish politics twenty years ago remain pertinent today.The newly released material provides a valuable insight into the period between -, mostly notably in relation to the Brooke Mayhew talks.In addition, it also charts developments in Anglo-Irish relations for these years, ongoing discussions around ious political and security matters, as well as important issues such as fair employment, the Irish language and community relations.The Brooke Mayhew negotiations took place to secure “a new, more broadly based agreement” which would replace the Anglo Irish Agreement.On the  March, , the first roundtable negotiations, excluding Sinn Fein, took place in an attempt to end the political stalemate in N.I., and continued through to November .Although they appeared to achieve little the Brooke Mayhew talks were the first to have \"three strands\", the relationships within Northern Ireland, between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and between London and Dublin. A basis had been laid for future discussions.The CAIN website, whose workers are based at the Magee campus in Derry, provides an extensive range of information and source material on the conflict and politics from  to the present day.The site is used by a worldwide audience and has received more than  million visits since it was launched in March .Earlier this year, the Derry News revealed that it was under threat of closure but thanks to a staunch defence of the site mounted by academics and researchers, Ulster University announced a nine-month reprieve while funding options are explored.Around  documents relating to the years  and  have been added to the CAIN website as part of ongoing work involving the Ulster University and the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland .The latest additions will bring to more than , the number of PRONI records available on CAIN.Dr Brendan Lynn, CAIN Deputy Director, said the archive is delighted to have been able to continue its cooperation with PRONI and to update the existing section with material dealing with the years  and .Mr Lynn commented: “CAIN has always sought to work with and iniduals, groups and organisations with relevant information relating to the Northern Ireland ‘troubles’ in order to make it available on-line.“An obvious example of this has been the partnership that CAIN has developed with The Public Record Office of Northern Ireland . As the official archive for Northern Ireland, one of PRONI’s many responsibilities is to receive government records from the early s onwards and to make them available for researchers.“The development of ‘PRONI Records on CAIN’ therefore provides people with an opportunity to gain access to a selection of material from the official files, that to date, chart the period from  to .“Looking ahead both CAIN and PRONI hope to continue this work to enable researchers to examine the events and personalities involved in the evolving ‘peace process’ of the s which culminated with the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in April .”‘Political stalemate’In terms of the latest documents, one of the most striking features of this material is that some of the issues which are so prominent today are the same ones which confronted politicians and policy makers back then.“For instance the search for an end to the political stalemate in Northern Ireland was dominated by a series of long, drawn out discussions – often referred to as the Brooke Mayhew talks of -. Whilst these were ultimately to end in failure they did leave behind an important template that was to be used at a later date,” Mr Lynn added.Dr Michael Willis, PRONI Director, has welcomed the publication of previously secret records through a continuing partnership between PRONI and Conflict Archive on the INternet .He said: “PRONI’s mission is to identy, preserve and promote public access to Northern Ireland’s archival heritage.“This latest addition of official documents to the CAIN website enhances the opportunity to view and read key documents from the time. It is an invaluable resource for anyone studying our recent past.”To access the documents you can visit: https:cain.ulster.ac.uk proni googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot

Then I got a local engineer to sandblast it and paint it so that is was like new and that cost another few thousand.ldquoThe rest of the cost will be spent on the build and the fit out inside. I reckon that even after we live in it for a while, it would still retain some valuewe wanted to sell itwe decide to travel again or rent it out. I see the cost as the equivalent to three yearsrsquo rent and itrsquos money not wasted as we still have something at the end of it.The tiny home concept mdashnormally one bed studio-style homes mdash has become popular for people looking for a simpler way of living in locations that they can change and without tying themselves down to massive mortgage.Michael, who is from Whiterock, and Alex, who is from Saintfield, discovered the concept while travelling and living in a small van in New Zealand for a year.ldquoI had been aware of tiny houses before we went to New Zealand and over there it is really popular, explained Michael. ldquoThey really are everywhere. Seeing how people live in these tiny houses inspired me that it could be done here too.ldquoWe lived in one of them during our time in New Zealand and loved it. It did simply our lives and it was a bit more sustainable which is a big thing is for us.ldquoWe donrsquot like the idea of renting for the next few years or being tied down to a mortgage and this allows us to be flexible, plus it is a bit adventurous.The couple, who first began to date after getting together at their leaving formal at Down High School, have designed their home with a galley kitchen with sitting area, a small shower room and loft bedroom in a building that is six metres long by . metres wide and . metres high.The house should be finished in time for Christmas and is kept near Lisbane where the couple try to work on it every day.Michael, a design engineer graduate, and Alex, who graduated in textile and design, are both working part-time jobs at the moment in order to devote themselves to the build.Michael said: ldquoWersquove done all the work ourselves in order to save money and to gain more skills. The exterior is nearly finished so we will be moving on to the interior soon.ldquoRegarding installing the utilities, some have pretty easy solutions and some are more dficult. As we would like some flexibility as to where we can park it, we donrsquot want to plug into mains electricity or the sewerage system, so the shower will be a standard shower with an instant water heater. Any grey water from the sink or shower will be probably be handled by some kind of natural filtration.Michael and Alex donrsquot yet know where they will site their home when it is finished but hope to place it on land owned by friends, or to rent out a field.They say that part of the reason to build their tiny home is financial, but also down to the way of le that living in such a small space brings with it.Michael said: ldquoWe like to do something more meaningful with our money and prefer travel experiences. We would rather not spend loads of money on a sofa mdash we would prefer to go travelling.He added: ldquoI would love to convert a camper van and go around Europe. I really donrsquot see the sense of buying up stuff and would rather have experiences that I would remember more.The couple want to have a cosy feeling to their home but not something too modern.Like caravans or boats, space is at a premium in a tiny house and Michael has designed stairs up to their loft bed so that extra storage can be built in.ldquoWe donrsquot have that much stuff which is good. Often when people do move into these small houses they find it dficult to get rid of a lot of stuff, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Call for play park upgrade  ","story":"MOTHERS in Ballynahinch are demanding that immediate improvements are made to the play park in Hillfoot Crescent.The women claim that due to vandalism and a lack of maintenance, the play facility is in dire need of an upgrade and is not fit for purpose to serve the needs of local children.The members of Hillfoot Crescent and Windmill Residents Association also say that the play facility is long overdue for some general weed tidying up by Newry, Mourne and Down Council which is responsible for it.A large group of women and children held an open meeting at the park last Thursday and invited local councillors to attend to see at first hand the poor state the park has declined into.Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews told the mothers, grandmothers and children that Hillfoot Crescent was one of three local parks due to be upgraded by the council within the next two years.However, while Ursula Jess, secretary of Hillfoot Crescent and Windmill Residents Association, welcomed the news, she said that the association would still be pressing for some interim improvements.ldquoItrsquos good to hear that a new play facility upgrade is supposed to be in the pipeline but we need something done between now and then, she said.ldquoWe urgently need it upgraded as therersquos no summer seats and parents and minders either have to stand or sit on the grass to keep an eye on the children and itrsquos not good enough. The seats were burnt one by one years ago and never replaced sowe were to get summer seats between now and the upgrade, it would be helpful.Mrs Jess said that Hillfoot Crescent got a Lottery grant in the late s to install the park and over the years broken equipment has not been replaced.She added: ldquoItrsquos a massive park with a lot of potential. We still have some tyre swings, a climbing frame, a slide and baby swings. There used to be a basket ball hoop but that is away now.ldquoItrsquos all been down to vandalism and general wear and tear. When the little elephant rockers were broken, the council just came and took them away but they werenrsquot replaced.She said that the play arearsquos summer seats were only replaced on one occasion after local vandals burnt them and had have not been replaced for years.Mrs Jess said that the community has done its best to keep the play park safe by sweeping away any broken glass and rubbish and have raised money for equipment in the past.The play facility caters for a large numbers of families at Millbank Grove Windmill Gardens, Windmill Drive, Windmill View, Carlisle Park and further afield, added Mrs Jess.Cllr Andrews said that he welcomed the residentsrsquo invitation to come along and to find out about the play facility.He said: ldquoThe play facility at Hillfoot Crescent serves a big catchment area with new developments being built in recent years.ldquoI was very impressed by the excellent turnout of parents, neighbours and children to convey their frustrations, worries and concerns about the condition of the existing playground here and the sense of being forgotten about.ldquoThey are calling for an upgrade to state of the art play parks that others in the Rowallane District Electoral Areahave been supplied with in recent times.ldquoI was able to tell them that Hillfoot Crescent is included in the line-up for an upgrade to new state of the art equipment.ldquoI will be lobbying and supporting this call at council level for this much-needed new play park to go ahead speedily along with those for Darragh Cross and Kilmore.The councillor said the council will encourage local residents and children to have their say and input into the new playground.He was presented with a heart-felt plea from the children for their park to be improved which was written as a poem and presented to him.It read: ldquoOur park is dying, itrsquos so sad, No one cares that it looks so bad.A lick of paint a bench or two, A modern slide area all overdue, So come on Council what do you say  Help us out and let us play..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Call to clean up Mary Street area of Crossgar  ","story":"CALLS have been issued for a clean-up of the Mary Street area in Crossgar.South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews have highlighted the need for the work to be carried out following a recent visit to the village.Mr McGrath mdash who was in Crossgar along with Cllr Andrews to listen to residentsrsquo concerns mdash is keen to see a resolution to the issues in Mary Street.ldquoPaths at this part of the village have become very poorly neglected and a dumping ground for some, the MLA explained.ldquoThis is totally unacceptable at a location adjacent to residentsrsquo garages and homes and the issue needs to be addressed as soon as possible.Mr McGrath suggested that the Mary Street problems are indicative of a wider issue people and groups across the country are going to have to get to grips with mdash determining who is responsible for certain pockets of land.He continued: ldquoBy the time it takes to actually determine ownership of areas, the issue could have been sorted multiple times over.

The remaining minutes of the half were played at a hectic pace with some tremendous play on show.Sheila McGrath and Greville handed Westmeath a three-point lead before Mallon and Dowdall swapped points as the game entered added time.However, Down had the bit between their teeth and three inspirational scores from Finnuala Carr, Aoe Keown and Mallon brought the sides level at - to - with time practically up.Westmeath were not to be denied a first half lead and a converted Greville free sent her side in at the break with a hard-earned - to - lead.The second half was every bit as competitive with Down again dominating the share of possession, but they continued to struggle to put that advantage to good use.Frees from Greville and Mairead McCormick and a magical strike from McGrath suddenly had Westmeath - to - ahead after  minutes.Down went for broke and minutes after Mallon and McCormick exchanged points, the predatory Saoirse Sands struck with venom when she netted after taking control of a Fionnuala Carr free.Paula Gribben reduced the deficit to two points before Greville and Mallon again exchanged scores. Mallon was unerring in front of the posts and with four minutes remaining she left a point in it after scoring from play.Unfortunately, McCrossan took advantage of two more Down wides from frees when she gave her side a - to - lead with two minutes of added time played.Sara Louise Carr kept the pot boiling with a th point for Down, but this was the last score of the game as the referee blew the final whistle on the resumption of play.Down: M McNally, N Kelly, A Savage, C McGilligan, C Rocks, D Magee, K McMullan, A Keown , P Gribben , S L Carr , D Savage, S McCartan, N Mallon , C McGourty, F Carr .

Within hours, the three Belfast brothers were back in Newcastle harbour where anxious relatives awaited news of their ordeal.Philip Sharp and his brothers Johnand Markhad left Minerstown Park Caravan Site wearing only trousers, pullovers and with only two lejackets between them. They started to fish about  yards offshore, but it was when they decided tohome that they hit trouble.They struggled to make any headway against the strong outgoing tide. ldquoWe just drted further and further away until the shore was just a haze, Philip said.They did not realise, as they drted six miles out to sea, that the alarm had been raised and the Newcastle leboat was on its way to their rescue, along with the helicopter..ldquoThe helicopter circled over us until the leboat came, Philip continued. ldquoThey took us on board and gave us hot soup and a tot of rum.ldquoI donrsquot think we have ever been so glad to see anyone in our lives.

He fired one shot straight at the lsquokeeper, one went wide and a cross which narrowly evaded everyone in the box.Killyleagh did prove menacing and in the th minute nice link up play between Charlie Holland and Darren McConnell allowed him to release Jamie Sharvin, but he hot straight at lsquokeeper, Mark Hynes.Thomas Healy was next up for the Whites in the th minute. John Murray won possession on the half way line and drove through midfield, linking with Neale, who released Healy on a one-on-one with Hynes, but the stopper stayed upright to deny him.Rosario were happy to let the YC play in front of them and hit on the counter and their best chance in the first half fell to Conor Murray after some clever link up play with Michael Johnson. However, his driven shot ended safely in the arms of YC goalkeeper Aaron Carberry.The visitors then had their best chance of the half in the th minute. Neale did well to hold off a defender and release Healy on the edge of the box, but his shot was fired just over.Both teams changed formations in the second half and Rosario really started to create some great opportunities.The game sprang into le when Johnson was put through one-on-one with Carberry, but once again the lsquokeeper stood up and made a smart save, with Murray missing the rebound.In the th minute Rosario were awarded a penalty. A long ball over the top caught the Killyleagh defence out with John Murray conceding a penalty and then seeing red in the resulting melee.Up stepped Ciaran Gillan, who struck a sweet penalty only to see it saved superbly by Carberry.In the th minute Killyleagh reminded Rosario that they were still in the game as Niall Walsh nodded a corner back into the path of Dylan Kelly who just couldnrsquot make contact with the goal at his mercy.It proved not the Gillanrsquos day. In the th minute he had a great chance, but managed to smash it over and in the last minute his shot hit the crossbar.With  minutes of football unable to separate the two teams it went to extra time and it was going to take a special goal to break the deadlock.

Earlier this year, a planning application was submitted to formally designate the area as a car park for council vehicles and staff cars as well.Concerned residents who live nearby and Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran expressed opposition to the move, describing the unofficial parking area in front of the remains of the townrsquos former workhouse as an ldquoeyesore, highlighting the noise created by heavy refuse vehicles starting up in the morning.Council officials say they have sold part of the existing Strangford Road site to the Education Authority to pave the way for the development of Down Highrsquos new multi-million pound campus.They explained that part of the land which has been sold to provide a new main entrance to the school includes an area which is currently used for council staff parking.The local authority is seeking planning approval to develop remaining land at the front and side of the old workhouse to provide parking for staff and its fleet of vehicles.In papers submitted ahead of todayrsquos planning meeting, it is confirmed that  homeowners who live close to the Strangford Road site were informed about the car park proposal, with some expressing concern about the impact it will have on property values.Concern was also raised about vehicle engines starting as early as .am, particularly at weekends, with those opposed to the planning application insisting that commercial vehicles should not be parked close to residential properties.Outlining their reasons for recommending that the planning application should be approved, planners admit that the car park plan will impact on the remains of the former workhouse which is of special architectural and historic importance.However, they confirm that the Department of Communities Historic Environment Division accept the parking plan in principle, provided the scheme respects the character of the area, suggesting that ldquosoft landscaping between banks of spaces with a low wall constructed to the western boundary.ldquoThe site is well established as the former Down Council offices, with a refuse depot to the rear, the planning papers continue.ldquoThe area has been used for staff parking with this application to formalise the arrangement with staff parking to the front and small vans to be parked at the side. The works proposed will aim to upgrade the existing frontage and use hardstanding to provide a more formalised parking arrangement.Planners say the existing land is to be regraded and resurfaced with low walls and have confirmed that external lighting also forms part of the proposal, with the current entrance set to be widened and new gates installed.

However, just hours before it was due to start someone painted lsquoIRA on the wall in front of the nearby Pilson Hall.The spokesperson revealed that when the graffiti appeared last week they contacted a specialist cleaner to have it removed and were prepared to meet the financial cost. However, the businessman agreed to do the work for free.ldquoNo one in Mount Crescent or Bridge Street wants sectarian graffiti. It does not reflect the good people who live at this part of the town, the spokesperson declared.ldquoWe were left disgusted at what happened given that we are working hard to promote our area and secure new investment, just like many other community groups across Downpatrick. This despicable act was not done in our name and we condemn those responsible.ldquoWe are not prepared to let those responsible have a negative impact on the good people, from all religions and races, who live at this part of Downpatrick.

We cannot emphasis enough that what happened was not done on our name and we condemn those behind this. We will not let people tarnish the work that we are doing or the good name of the Mount Crescent and Bridge Street area.ldquoWe hope the fact that we took steps to contact a specialist cleaner when we were made aware of the graffiti speaks volumes about our views on this matter. Those responsible are clearly not aware of what we are about and the respect we have for all our neighbours across Downpatrick.The spokesperson added: ldquoWe will not allow what happened to drive a wedge between us and others.

Images of him turning on the Christmas tree lights in Belfast would travel around the world as a symbol of how Northern Ireland was being transformed.Ahead of the visit, America officials told the Foreign Office that communications equipment, helicopters and cars for the US president’s motorcade would arrive in Northern Ireland on three huge CS Galaxy cargo planes over several days before Mr Clinton’s arrival..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button On November , senior NIO official Mike Maxwell said: “I maintain regular contact with the Americans and the FCO in a so far vain attempt to elicit some fuller information about the visit.”A restricted memo from Mr Maxwell seven days later said that “the Americans are still proposing to include a tour of the Belfast peace line. This is a proposal which the secretary of state has been seeking to discourage, and he may therefore wish to raise it when he meets [US Ambassador to London] Admiral Crowe this afternoon.”The previous day, fellow Stormont official David Watkins said in a memo: “I am distinctly unhappy at the idea of a walk on the peace line.“At a meeting last month the secretary of state drew attention to the likelihood of televised coverage of a walk along Belfast’s Berlin wall, with all the negative imagery that this contains.“It may be that the Americans are rather simplistically imagining that images of pre-ceasefire peace wall conditions can be juxtaposed with images of the peace-to-all-men switching on of the Christmas tree lights.“But the lunch time news in Europe and breakfast TV in the USA will have only the peace line to focus on ... I find this a thoroughly bad idea, and I think the Americans need to be told so quickly and firmly.”In the end, the president did not visit a peace wall, but went to the Falls and Shankill.The government obtained an up to date copy of Bill Clinton’s itinerary from the BBC. On November  , NIO official Mike Maxwell said that in a meeting with FCO officials “Mr Woods [Stormont’s top press officer] produced the latest version of the Clintons’ programme which he had obtained from the BBC who in turn had received it from the White House press office … it is broadly similar to the programme advised to us by the recce team.”Referring to a reception being hosted by the secretary of state, he said that they had told US officials that “we would work closely with the Americans in drawing up the guest list. We would not seek to exclude guests for political reasons... Lady Mayhew had pointed out that the guest list should be gender-proofed”.Ireland’s Europe minister denies Brexit deal is ‘dead’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF |

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

In April , the St Augustinersquos ward in Penarth had the most long-term empty homes, with  empty for more than six months and  for more than two years.Penarthrsquos Plymouth ward had more than  empty for more than six months, and more than  empty for more than two years.The proposed strategy calls on the council to maintain and improve its empty homes data, provide financial incentives to landlords, prioritise empty homes for enforcement action such as enforced sales and compulsory purchase orders, and to raise awareness of the issue of empty homes.The strategy says: ldquoA voluntary way forward to renovation and re-occupation is always the preferred option, and officers make all available endeavours to encourage and persuade such progress.ldquoHowever, in instances where owners cannot be traced or where exhaustive attempts to encourage and promote progress from known owners prove unproductive, orthere is an imminent risk to health and safety, there is little option but to proceed with a statutory solution,The draft empty homes strategy will be put to public consultation after the councilrsquos August recess. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The  edition of the Top  incorporates analysis of figures filed at each companies year end and posted at Companies House and primarily relate to financial periods ending in late ,  and . SUMMARY Sales have grown to £.bn from £.bnwhich is a growth of .%. While extremely encouraging this result needs to be tempered with the fact that profits for the top companies decreased by nearly % to £.m. Shareholder value for the Top  companies increased by .%. Revenue sales Sales revenue is the income received by a company from its sales of goods or the provision of services. The performance of the Top  showing a .% sales growth to £.bn is exceptional in what is a dficult trading environment and period of uncertainty for the provinces businesses. The Brexit question came to the fore on June ,  so all the financial figures shown in the listing have come post the referendum and in essence since the suspension of the Assembly in January . Moy Park continues to hold sway with the highest turnover, currently £.bn, up from £.bn previously – snapping close at their heels is WR Barnett Ltd . Next in the listing are a number of high fliers, LCC Group Ltd and John Graham Holdings Ltd. John Graham Holdings Ltd, which trades as Graham, is another privately owned company based in Hillsborough and specialising in building and civil engineering projects – Graham posted annual sales of £.m in its latest financial accounts up from £.m – an increase of some .% year on year. One of the perennial high performers of the Top  showed a signicant decrease in sales dropping it from a position last year of  to a position this year of .

Profitability Since the Ulster Business Top ’s inception in , we have identied the top companies by measuring turnover, while also accepting that both profitability and tangible shareholder value are also key measures of performance. This year has seen a drop in profit margin for the Top  companies from a margin of .% to .% with total profits now sitting at £.m compared to £.bn for the corresponding companies in their prior year. Northern Ireland Water Ltd has retained its position as the most profitable business within the listing, posting pre tax profits of £.m on a turnover of £.m a margin of .%. Northern Ireland Electricity Networks Ltd is second most profitable with pre tax figures of £m against a turnover of £.m . While the reduction in profitability of the Top  is disappointing this can be tempered by the fact that a number of the companies made signicant losses during the last filed figures recorded for the compilation of the listing.
