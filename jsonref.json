To most non-animal lovers I suppose I do, but I’m not the only one. Nowadays, increasing numbers of Britons are digging extremely deeply into their pockets for vet bills. Last month, teacher Nicki Dyson made headlines after she vowed to remortgage her house to pay the £20,000 needed to cure her Chow Chow Narla’s painful elbow dysplasia — a soft tissue abnormality.But these huge sums are a relatively new phenomenon. Just a decade or two ago, if a pet became seriously ill, the chances were you’d have it put down without question.Yet technological leaps in the veterinary world mean that there are now myriad sophisticated operations available that can mend the hitherto unmendable, usually at significant cost. Hugely popular TV shows, such as Channel 4’s The Supervet, starring Noel Fitzpatrick, have popularised these incredible treatments, making the choice even more difficult for owners. Not everyone has insurance that covers the huge cost, however. Sometimes, companies won’t pay out due to small print or because it’s a pre-existing injury.In my case, I couldn’t afford pet insurance. With seven dogs (yes, seven), it would cost £200 a month to insure them all, which would rise incrementally as they aged, so we decided just to take our chances.Bebe is one of those dogs everyone falls in love with — cheeky, courageous, loving and with a constantly wagging tail that thumps so loudly, I have to hang on to it at the vet’s so her heartbeat can be heard through the stethoscope. She was one of the first dogs Pascal and I got together when we married and definitely became our substitute ‘baby’ when we found out I couldn’t have children.Her problems began in the spring of 2017, ten months after she’d been sterilised. Noticing an opening on her side, and thinking she’d brushed against some brambles, I took her for a check-up. I left with antibiotics and a bill for £100. But the wound refused to heal.By the July, she was limping and was diagnosed with tendonitis. I was told she would need pain-relieving injections for the rest of her life — the first two sets cost £500.In August, the vet performed an X-ray, and then an ultrasound, which revealed a shadow next to her kidney. Cue another trip to a specialist for an MRI scan.It turned out she had peritonitis, an infection of the intestine caused by a foreign object found near her kidney. When it was removed, it turned out to be a plastic clip used in the operation to sterilise her.By now, we’d spent £5,000 the MRI alone cost £2,000. But Bebe’s internal organs had become so inflamed, the stitches wouldn’t heal.Over the next four months, she was operated on a further four times, at £1,000 a time.I knew I should probably seek financial compensation from the vet practice that had performed the sterilisation — but that would involve engaging lawyers and yet more financial outlay.By January last year, she was finally discharged. The vet allowed us to pay off the balance in instalments and the rest went on our credit cards.Holidays have been out of the question since then, but those thoughts fade when I see my Bebe, now nicknamed The £10,000 Dog, jumping through flower-filled fields.

They spent £20,000 on treatment for husky Botus, four. Nikki says:\u0027I knew Botus was going to cost us a lot of money when we got him, but I had no idea how much. His hips had been damaged by an abusive owner so, when he walked, he was in pain.\u0027He’d been rescued but, because of his injuries, no one wanted him.\u0027When I heard his story, it broke my heart. I decided that, as a human had hurt him, it was up to a human to fix him, so we adopted him.

They spent £20,000 on treatment for husky Botus, four\u0027He arrived in July 2016 and I immediately fell in love. Despite what he’d been through, he was so trusting and loving.\u0027We could have left him on painkillers, but knew hip replacements were a better option. Our vet referred us to The Supervet Noel Fitzpatrick, as the surgery would be so complex.\u0027Before we went, they called us with an estimated price. I thought they’d say around £8,000 in total, but it was £7,500 per hip. I was stunned, but there was never any doubt — we were going ahead.\u0027My mum loaned me the £2,500 we needed to pay upfront to get his new hips specially made and, in April 2017, Botus had his first operation. When Noel called to tell us how it had gone, my heart was racing, until he said all was fine. We’d hoped to delay the second op for a year to save up, but waiting could have damaged his back, so, three months later, we were back at Fitzpatrick’s.\u0027This time, it didn’t go so well. It was a more complex operation and he was sick during surgery, which burnt his oesophagus.\u0027Two ops on his throat and three months of expensive hydrotherapy and physiotherapy followed to get his leg working properly again.\u0027In total, the bill came to £20,000 —we had no insurance, as it was a pre-existing condition. At one point, I had £16,000 on various credit cards.\u0027For more than a year, we didn’t go on holiday, buy clothes or have nice meals out. We lived on £40 a week, but have now managed to pay it off — except the loan from my mother.\u0027Botus has now fully recovered and leaps on the bed every morning for a snuggle. He’s adorable and, if I had to, I’d do it all again. He makes my heart melt.\u0027He saved my life, so I had to save hisSusie Sexton, 55, has three grown-up children and lives near Motherwell in Scotland. The former marketing director spent £14,000 on treatment for Paddy, a 15-year-old Yorkshire terrier-poodle cross. Susie says:\u0027Paddy was my Yorkshire terrier Penny’s pup. I didn’t even know she was pregnant when she gave birth, so he’s always been special to me.\u0027No more so than when I was diagnosed with cervical cancer on New Year’s Eve 2010. Throughout my treatment — a radical hysterectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy — Paddy was there for me, so, when he needed help, there was no question I’d do my best for him.         Susie Sexton (pictured), 55, has three grown-up children and lives near Motherwell in Scotland. The former marketing director spent £14,000 on treatment for Paddy, a 15-year-old Yorkshire terrier-poodle cross\u0027That moment came in August last year when I went shopping with a friend. Paddy was sitting on my lap when we pulled into the car park and, as I opened the door, he leapt out and ran over to a patch of grass because he needed the loo.\u0027At that very moment, a 4x4 was reversing and he went under the wheels. It happened so fast, I didn’t see it. I just heard my friend scream.\u0027I ran over to find Paddy in a state — his leg was mangled and he was trembling in shock. I scooped him up and we drove straight to the vet.\u0027He bandaged Paddy up and phoned the Vets Now hospital in Glasgow, telling us to take him there immediately.\u0027Paddy spent the next five days in intensive care — they didn’t tell me until later that they didn’t expect to be able to save his life, let alone his leg. Somehow, they did. Throughout it all, I never let myself believe I’d lose him. I’d lost his mother Penny only a few months before, so the idea of not having him was devastating.\u0027After eight days in hospital, the final bill came to £14,000 — I had £1,000 of insurance, my children clubbed together to raise £3,000 and the rest came from a loan.\u0027It was worth every penny to save Paddy, as he’d always been there for me. Nowadays, he runs around normally — he loves his walks and playing with his ball. He’s back to being my boy.\u0027I\u0027d have sold my house if necessaryNatalia George, 28, runs Flori’s Friends animal charity and lives in Chartham Hatch, Kent. She spent £18,000 on treatment for her crossbreed Mishka, now 12. Natalia says:\u0027Out on a walk one day, just a few weeks after I’d adopted him in June 2015, I noticed Mishka limping. Then his leg started to shake and he began screaming. It was terrifying. I rushed him to the vet, who delivered the bad news: an X-ray showed a plate that had been inserted in his hip after a car accident before I got him had come apart. The only option was to amputate his leg, which would cost £2,500.\u0027A few days after the operation, however, the amputation site became horribly infected. For the next three weeks, Mishka was put on every antibiotic going, but the infection was resistant to them all. Eventually, rather than put him down, I took him to the Royal Veterinary College (RVC).         Natalia George (pictured), 28, runs Flori’s Friends animal charity and lives in Chartham Hatch, Kent. She spent £18,000 on treatment for her crossbreed Mishka, now 12\u0027They opened him up and scraped away all the infected tissue, but it didn’t work — when we got home, Mishka couldn’t stand, eat or drink and was clearly in agony.\u0027When his gums turned blue — meaning he was losing oxygen — I rushed him back. MRI and CT scans showed the infection was in his pelvic bone and spreading fast. The bone needed to be amputated immediately.\u0027Putting Mishka to sleep was mentioned as an option, but the vet didn’t advise it at this stage. So we went ahead with the op. By now, the RVC treatment had cost £6,000, but the second operation was another £4,000. So I sold my car for £900 and set up a crowdfunding page. A wonderful friend also gave me £2,000 towards the cost. If they hadn’t, I’d have sold my house.\u0027Thankfully, the amputation was successful and, two weeks later, I brought Mishka home.\u0027Now he can jump on furniture by himself and needs so much exercise — in December, we even climbed Mount Snowdon together. His attitude has taught me so much — he doesn’t think he’s disabled, he just gets on with it. With aftercare, it has cost me £18,000, but Mish isn’t just my dog, he’s my life. He’s irreplaceable.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"a baby born today the climate and their future","story":"Life-support systems that nature provides – an intertwined web that sustains humans, plants and animals – are at risk of unravelling in a matter of decades.Deforestation, intensive agriculture, overfishing, development and other human activities are breaking the bonds that combine to make a healthy planet. Their destruction, fuelled by rampant consumption and obsession with economic growth, is accelerating.“The evidence is crystal clear: nature is in trouble. Therefore we are in trouble,” declared Sandra Díaz, who co-chaired the completion of a global assessment of bioersity published this week.There is a dual threat to life on Earth: species loss and climate change. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Bioersity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) ranked the main factors causing species loss: changes in land and sea use exploitation of organisms climate change pollution and invasive alien species.These are “eroding the foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide”, and climate breakdown could soon become the main driver.Nature is being destroyed at such a rate that a million species are at risk. On the day the IPBES report made headlines, Dr Allan Mee of the Golden Eagle Trust checked for sightings of the Ring Ouzel in the MacGillycuddy’s Reeks in Co Kerry, one of just two of its remaining habitats in Ireland. “No birds located. Sad but likely witnessing local extinction of the species, once found in 28 Irish counties,” he tweeted. Pádraic Fogarty of the Irish Wildlife Trust replied: “This is mass extinction unfolding before our eyes.”How is the potentially lethal cocktail of bioersity loss and climate disruption going to impact on coming generations in contrasting parts of the globe? Equally, what does it mean for an animal that dominates the Irish landscape (the cow), and the majestic lion, not critically endangered yet rapidly disappearing?The baby born in IrelandConscious of what the next generation is facing, Australian Jim Scheer helped set up the FridaysForFuture climate action movement in Ireland, which is driven by young people. As for the babies of today, “their freedom is limited”, he believes. As a child, “the most I had to worry about was, ‘is there air in the tyres of my bike?’” he says.They are facing a whole different world of realities, a place where the First World problem of “where will I go on my holidays?” may be replaced by “where is my next meal coming from?”The issues weigh heavily on the current generation of young people, he believes, which is why “coming together to grieve” – a feature of recent protests – matters, and is part of telling the truth. There is much frustration too at the inaction of elders.“Uncertain” is the future of that child, says climate activist Dr Lorna Gold. Hope is emerging through the climate movement but, looking at the timelines required for transformational shift, there is “more and more uncertainty”.Children growing up in Ireland will be relatively protected, by location, wealth and assets they will have access to, “but even in the best-case scenario, it will be a diminished world.”This will be due to loss of species and a more complicated world, disrupted by climate and associated conflict, where Dr Gold fears the freedom to explore and travel in relative peace is undermined. It’s a place of learning from the internet rather than real life. The pluses will be better local connectedness with “their own earth” and nearby food production.That Irish child will never hear the corncrake or the curlew, says climatologist Prof John Sweeney, and, as they grow, they will be confronted with hard choices on lifestyle and mobility. The fossil fuel-driven car will be forced out by regulation, he says, but different ways of getting off the island, for example, will be needed if aviation does not overcome its emissions issues.By mid-century, most will live in green cities with an almost total absence of the private car. The transport revolution will be in urban areas but slower to come to the countryside until battery technology improves, Sweeney notes.A near zero-carbon world will mean less air pollution. Clean energy in their home and workplace will mainly come from offshore wind.A downside will be more extreme weather events attributable to climate change more intense storms and rainfall, increased flooding with sea level rises – and yet water shortages in summer.The child born today in Ireland – and the adult they become – will cope far better than their counterpart elsewhere.The developing world babyA baby born today in a developing country, on the other hand, will be at the frontline of climate disruption, says Christian Aid Ireland policy and advocacy adviser Jennifer Higgins. They will have to contend with stronger cyclones, warmer days and nights, more unpredictable rains and longer heatwaves.“Here in Ireland we will have the resources and ability to adapt and deal with these unprecedented weather events, but in many parts of the world, going to Tesco to stock up on sliced pan won’t be a possibility.”They will be the ones who will suffer the worst consequences of our inaction on climate change. “Sustained periods of unseasonably heavy rain can have a damaging impact on agriculture, causing the loss of topsoil and serious nutrient leaching,” says Higgins.In Ireland, save for the odd hosepipe ban, water is always on tap for domestic, industrial and agricultural use. “But in the developing world, where most people depend on agriculture to earn a living or just stay alive, it’s a scarce and precious resource.”Those living in coastal regions will suffer a loss of coral reefs, which half a billion people rely on for fish. For those born among indigenous communities in tropical rainforests, not only will they lose their homeland – already being eroded by increasing industrialisation – but there will be loss of habitat that acts as the lungs of the earth and regulates rainfall.Children will be most susceptible to the increasing diseases that a changing climate will leave in its wake, she adds. Their education may be disrupted when schools are used as shelters when disaster hits their communities.If temperatures increase in already hot areas, it will diminish scarce resources to sustain life and will force many to become refugees.But this may “dwarf numbers caused by conflict or political and economic necessity. When their land becomes uninhabitable because of drought, flood or sea-level rise, they will have to seek a safer place to live,” Higgins predicts.It may be a world where techniques such as conservation agriculture transform crop production and smartphone technology helps drive rural economies backed by deployment of cheap solar PV. But extreme weather events will continue to threaten food production, as seen with recent cyclones in southern Africa.Gold fears a business-as-usual approach means such circumstances can become an intractable problem very quickly, and says solutions are beyond most communities on cost grounds. Therefore the child is facing increased malnutrition, chronic hunger, dependency on external aid, and political instability – an existence marked by inequality and injustice.The IPBES report starkly outlines how indigenous peoples and the poorest are most reliant on land and sea for survival. The combination of land grabs by multinationals facilitated by corrupt governments, extreme climate events and bioersity loss add up to a very bleak future for their offspring, Gold concludes.The future of the cow Humans are not the only beings whose lives will change. The IPBES report emphasises that the effects will be felt first among animals and other living things.In Ireland, there are currently more cattle than people, and they are the most common large animal. For many, the cow (for beef and milk) is the bellwether of Irish agriculture and rural life. For others, it’s the problem because of associated carbon emissions.Teagasc’s head of communications, Eric Donald, says cattle numbers are currently a matter for inidual farmers. With no quotas, no policy instruments are in place. In future we are likely to have fewer beef and more dairy cattle.On emissions, Donald says there is wide acceptance of the need to implement mitigation measures – a process is already in train.Having a grass-based system to feed those cattle will be critical to sustainable farms from an environmental, economic and social perspective, Donald adds. Ireland will need to find export markets for 80 to 90 per cent of its product. Meat consumption may decrease on an inidual basis and there may be a shift to plant-based diets, but increased population growth will mean “demand won’t drop significantly”.But cattle will have to compete for space due to a more erse range of crops, land being used for bioenergy and afforestation (increasingly native woodlands and not just on marginal land) that will act as important carbon sinks, and hedgerows ensuring better bioersity and pollinator capacity.To question beef consumption may currently be an Irish “no-no”, but the reality is the consumers of tomorrow will be confronted by a wide range of new plant and synthetic proteins that will taste surprisingly good and be cheaper, which is likely to mean less red meat is consumed – in line with health guidelines.Eric Donald defends the pursuit of higher genetic quality as a means of increasing efficiency and lowering emissions, especially “because lifetime productivity is better”. With extending grazing seasons, it’s the key measure in improving farm sustainability guidelines. It also complements changes in fertiliser use and slurry management.But John Sweeney says the Irish cow is “reaching limits in terms of genetics”. Like pedigree dogs, they are less able to cope with change and stress compared with native species.Unquestionably, there will be fewer of them, he believes, “if we want to maintain bioersity for future generations”.Expansion in the cattle population has coincided with deterioration in water quality, with widespread glyphosate contamination (one study has found 20 per cent of Irish adults have traces of the herbicide in their urine), nitrates pollution and an emerging ammonia problem.“Continued expansion of the national herd is not compatible with this report. That’s where the crux comes.”The future of the lionJennifer Higgins joins in a lament for so many endangered mammals.Of all species threatened, IWT campaign officer Pádraic Fogarty is shocked by the latest indicators for hippos, giraffes and lions. In particular, “it would be an absolutely travesty if lions were to go extinct . . . The magnificent animal has permeated our culture and imagination, from children’s stories to the pillars on Trafalgar Square.”But maps don’t lie. In 1950 there were 400,000 lions in the wild. Today there are 23,000-39,000 lions in all of Africa, which is “extremely low” in global terms, when once they lived in Ancient Greece and North Africa, and became extinct in Greece only around 100BC.Outside of southern Africa, numbers of lions in 23 unfenced reserves in 11 countries are estimated to have dropped by 62 per cent between 1993 and 2014. Asia is home to a small subpopulation in the Indian state of Gujarat, where numbers are growing, but it’s just a pin on the globe.“There is no data to say that lions are about to disappear, but their populations are shrinking fast,” he explains. The species is classified as vulnerable but the slide into the “endangered” and then “critically endangered” categories looms, while “threatened with extinction” is applied to its current status.For Fogarty, the same pressures apply to other mammals, but the lion’s wellbeing is further undermined by gametrophy hunting and false western-world notions that it is somehow good for population numbers. All told, we are facing a scenario where lions will “shrink to a few corners of the planet”.What to doThis is not going to be sorted by putting bird tables in back gardens. The Ipbes report shows nature-based solutions can help bring “transformative change”, but there is a greater systemic problem.In the past 50 years, the human population has doubled, the global economy has grown nearly four-fold, and global trade has grown tenfold, together driving up the demands for energy, food and materials.Thinking that endless economic growth is possible and not valuing the essential services provided by nature is a delusion leading to catastrophe, Sweeney believes.“Until we get away from euros and cents and GDP, we will be in a cul-de-sac . . . Unless we rethink how we value the services provided by the natural world and include them explicitly in a wellbeing measure, we delude ourselves that a sustainable future is possible.”That was the core message in a submission this week to EU leaders meeting on the future of Europe by the European Environmental Bureau (EEB) and more than 200 academics, including John Sweeney, policy experts and civil society groups.There is an onus too on iniduals to act, according to EEB vice president Attracta Uí Bhroin. “It’s not enough for us to sit on the sofa and watch David Attenborough’s latest breathtaking and terrifying documentary and shake our heads. Every politician coming near your front door needs to know environmental sustainability is your priority, and must be Europe’s priority.”Fogarty hopes people now see the connections between climate breakdown and mass extinction, that they are two sides of the same coin. “We have all of the solutions to hand, but what we’ve been lacking is any sense of urgency to get on with it.”He senses momentum moving in the right direction, though the lack of a response from the Taoiseach or any Government minister “makes me feel that they are still hoping it’s an issue that will go away. We can’t really afford this level of disengagement when we need to be getting on with things.”Scheer is brutally frank about future voters born today. “I don’t think people get a choice of what games they play.”They will have to be focused on survival. “It feels as we have handed them a shitstorm.”As for the current generation, too many are stuck in business-as-usual mode. There is a need to raise consciousness quickly. “Ignorance is not a choice” given the IPBES report. “It’s not an opinion, it’s scientific. It’s happening.”Kevin O\u0027Sullivan is Environment and Science Editor and former Editor of The "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3910100.1559244402!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"docklands height increases likely but too late for salesforce tower","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tImpression of Salesforce tower – to the immediate left of the Central Bank’s docklands headquarters.\tDespite intensive lobbying in recent months, developer Johnny Ronan can expect his hopes of increasing the height of his so-called Salesforce tower and a second residential and hotel development in Dublin’s docklands to be, formally, dashed on Friday.Mr Ronan’s Spencer Place Development Company on Thursday failed in a High Court challenge to Dublin City Council’s legal interpretation of building height guidelines.The council will on Friday issue its decision on whether to grant permission for an increase in height sought to both developments up to 11 storeys for the Salesforce office development and to a maximum of 13 storeys for the apartmenthotel development. Although the developer was seeking to add just two extra floors above what had already been permitted, it is unlikely the application will be successful. It is the council’s position it has no authority to increase heights beyond what is permitted for the area.The SDZ planning scheme sets a range of uses, and of heights, for different parts of the zone to ensure coherent development, ie that there is the mix of offices, retail and residential, and amenitygreen space considered appropriate for the area. While this restricts landowners in what they can do with their lands, it also affords them the security of knowing that, as long as they comply with the terms of the SDZ scheme, their application will secure permission.Height restrictionsThe SDZ allows heights up to 22 storeys, but not on the two sites in question. On these sites the maximum permitted heights are five to eight storeys for commercial development, and six to 10 storeys of residential with one possible setback floor.Mr Ronan’s representatives argued that a decision last December by Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy that removed “blanket numerical limitations on height” should take precedence over the height restrictions in the SDZ, allowing the council to grant permission for the additional storeys.However, it was the council’s contention that this did not apply in relation to the SDZ, rather that the Minister’s height guidelines required that the council “carry out a review” to ensure those guidelines were “reflected” in the SDZ scheme.It is the council’s view that the SDZ does not provide for “blanket numerical limitations on height” as there is a range of heights designated for different areas. The council could, following the review of the SDZ, determine that no action is needed in relation to altering the scheme to reflect the height guidelines.However, it is understood that the council has now completed its review, and will, on Friday coincidentally, submit that review to An Bord Pleanála, with proposed alterations to some heights in the zone.The board could decide the SDZ required amendment, and could also decide that these proposed amendments need to be issued for public consultation before it makes any decision, a process which could take some considerable time.This will not bring any comfort to Mr Ronan, who has stressed a decision is needed urgently in relation to the Salesforce tower, which is already under construction and will soon be too far advanced for the floors to be added.A spokesman for Mr Ronan’s development company on Thursday night said it would be appealing the court’s decision."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3909467.1559222523!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"labour s corbyn shielded from media as he visits taoiseach and president","story":"UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says he and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar had a very good discussion over the proposal of a customs union between the UK and EU post-Brexit. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Labour Party leader  Jeremy Corbyn is welcomed to  Áras an Uachtaráin in Dublin by  President Michael D Higgins. British Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is meeting Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on Thursday morning for discussions about Brexit as part of a low-key visit to Dublin.Earlier, Mr Corbyn held a short meeting with President Michael D Higgins at Áras an Uachtaráin.Mr Corbyn briefly answered journalists’ questions after arriving at the headquarters of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on Wednesday evening, but has otherwise been shielded from the media.A statement issued by the Government after the meeting said Mr Varadkar had “a good meeting” with Mr Corbyn. “The Taoiseach and Mr Corbyn held detailed discussions for an hour and a half on Northern Ireland, Brexit, and the current political situation in Westminster.“Discussions focused principally on the need to restore power-sharing in Northern Ireland and the importance of ongoing engagement with all political parties in the North. These talks continue this week in Belfast involving the Tánaiste and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.“They also considered Brexit, with both sides sharing serious concerns about a no-deal scenario and its inherent dangers, including the possibility that the UK may end up in a no deal situation by default unless alternatives are pursued.”The statement added that the Taoiseach and Mr Corbyn also discussed the importance of avoiding any return of a hard Border on the island of Ireland and pledged to stay in touch. A Government spokesman said earlier there would be no opportunity for the media to question Mr Corbyn after his meeting with the Taoiseach. Asked if this was at the request of Mr Corbyn, the spokesman would only say that this is what had been agreed between the two sides. It is usual for political leaders visiting Government Buildings to hold a press conference or other opportunity for the media to ask them about their trip and the discussions they have had.Meanwhile, in a statement on Thursday morning, a spokesman for Áras an Uachtaráin said: “The President and Mr Corbyn had a lengthy and comprehensive meeting at which they discussed a range of current issues including Irish-UK relations, Brexit, the future of the European Union and Northern Ireland. The President and Mr Corbyn have known each other for several decades.”On Wednesday night, Mr Corbyn said that he would seek to renegotiate Brexit to get a better deal for the UK that avoided a no-deal outcome, even though the EU has been clear that the Withdrawal Agreement will not be reopened.In the past, Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer has accepted that the agreement will not be reopened, but has suggested that the political declaration - the basis for the future trading relationship between the EU and the UK - could be rewritten to reflect Labour’s desire for a customs union-type arrangement. There is broad agreement in the EU for this.Second referendum Mr Corbyn also suggested that any second Brexit referendum should not be a repeat of the 2016 vote in the UK but instead a referendum on a new deal with Europe. Asked if a second referendum was now the only way forward for the UK, Mr Corbyn said: “The referendum would be on a negotiated deal or alternatives to that. It’s not a rerun of 2016.”Asked if it was not a second “in-out” referendum, Mr Corbyn said: “It’s not a rerun of 2016, it would be on the basis of whatever we have succeeded in negotiating.”The Labour leader also met his Irish counterpart Brendan Howlin on Wednesday night, as well as other opposition figures. Again, he did not meet the media after these meetings, though Mr Howlin’s office issued a statement afterwards, describing the meeting as “constructive”.“Following my meeting with Jeremy Corbyn I am confident that parliament will block a no-deal Brexit. Britain needs a general election to break the deadlock,” Mr Howlin said in the statement. “I am assured following our meeting that no matter who wins the Tory leadership election, Parliament will not back a no-deal Brexit.” Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Andy RainEPAFor a politician who likes to describe himself as a “details man”, Dominic Raab’s account of the details of his negotiations with the European Union is outstandingly unreliable. Almost everyone involved during the Conservative leadership candidate’s short stint as Brexit secretary last year maintains that his version of events is simply untrue.In an interview with Katy Balls in this week’s Spectator, Raab claimed that he had been on the brink of a breakthrough on the backstop after a dinner in London with Simon Coveney but the deal was blocked by Theresa May’s de facto deputy, David Lidington. “It wasn’t ruled out by Coveney, it was ruled out by Varadkar. The only thing that happened in between is that he met David Lidington. It’s clear what happened,” he said.Michel Barnier’s team had already rejected Raab’s proposal to allow Britain to trigger a review mechanism for the backstop within a few months of it coming into effect. But in Brussels, his gambit was perceived as part of a broader pattern of negotiating in bad faith, with an eye on his future political prospects.UnreliableEU negotiators initially welcomed Raab as a smarter and more focused interlocutor than his predecessor David Davis. Nobody in Brussels doubted the former lawyer’s intelligence but they soon concluded that he was short-tempered, insecure and unreliable.“He would say one thing inside the room and say something else outside two minutes later. Nobody trusted him,” one senior EU official said.What Tennessee Williams called “a powerful and obnoxious odour of mendacity” also surrounds Boris Johnson, Raab’s chief rival for the Brexiteer vote in the leadership contest. So Raab’s dodgy account of his negotiations with the EU may not prove fatal to his chances in a contest where everyone appears willing to suspend their disbelief.When it comes to the backstop, for instance, most of the other dozen or so leadership candidates sound just as confident as Raab about their chances of renegotiating it. Foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt promises to go to Brussels with a new negotiating team including representatives of the DUP and the European Research Group (ERG) of hardline Brexiteers.Johnson wants to renegotiate the backstop to introduce a time limit or a unilateral exit mechanism. And housing minister Kit Malthouse is one of a number of candidates who want it to be replaced by “alternative arrangements” to keep the Border open.In an interview with the New York Review of Books this week, Michel Barnier restated the EU’s commitment to explore alternative arrangements after Britain ratifies the withdrawal agreement. But he warned that such arrangements could not be put in place immediately and insisted that the backstop must remain in place as an insurance policy.“They must be fully operational. I was the French minister of agriculture – how do you control a single cow or a truck load of pork? You need technology. You need technical infrastructure to do that. And this takes time,” he said.Alternative arrangementsIn an invaluable new paper Sam Lowe looks in detail at the kind of alternative arrangements that would be needed to keep the Border free of physical infrastructure and associated checks after Brexit.He points out that, even if efficient systems of online predeclaration of goods, trusted trader schemes and tracking technology are developed, some checks will still be necessary away from the Border. And any system would require an intensification in anti-smuggling measures near the Border, either through intelligence-led policing or electronic surveillance.Any such system would require the consent of the people most directly affected, the businesses and communities close to the Border. But as Lowe observes, the people of Northern Ireland are effectively excluded from a discussion about the Border that is conducted almost entirely within Westminster.‘Unintrusive’“Whereas the backstop, or a close, highly integrated economic relationship between the EU and UK, removes the need for physical infrastructure or associated checks by ensuring no new regulatory or customs border is created, technical solutions are premised on the acceptance of a new border, combined with efforts to ensure it is as unintrusive as possible,” he says.\u0026nbsp“Any solution that assumes that a border community that is predominantly Irish nationalist, and against leaving the EU, will readily accept the existence of a new customs and regulatory ide faces an uphill struggle.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

File Photograph courtesy BBCThe Conservative leadership contest risks descending into chaos unless it is streamlined, former leader Iain Duncan Smith has warned.With 11 candidates already declared and more expected to join the race within days, Mr Duncan Smith said the backbench 1922 Committee should change the party’s election rules to reduce the field.“This election has become beyond anything we have experience before and because we are looking at electing a prime minister, not just a leader . . . it needs to be done pretty sharply,” he told the BBC.MPs need just two nominations to enter the contest, which means MPs whittle down the candidates in successive rounds of voting until just two are chosen to go before the entire Conservative membership. The MPs will vote on Tuesdays and Thursdays, with one candidate eliminated after each round.Mr Duncan Smith said the 1922 Committee should raise the threshold for nomination so that candidates would need the backing of 10 MPs. And he said the early rounds of voting could be accelerated if the lowest two or three candidates were eliminated.\u0026nbsp“It may not be popular but I think given the nature of the fact we need to present a face of a party that actually can get jobs done we don’t want to have this meandering around looking like chaos,”\u0026nbsphe said.Chancellor of the exchequer Philip Hammond said he could not support any candidate who pursued no-deal Brexit as a policy choice. And he suggested that a second referendum would be preferable to a general election if parliament failed to resolve the Brexit impasse.“If we do get to the point where parliament has to admit that it cannot resolve this issue then clearly it will have to be remitted back to the people,” he said.“I am not sure that a general election can resolve the question for the simple reason that both the main political parties are ided on the issue.”No deal Brexit optionFormer Brexit secretary Dominic Raab said he would “use every lever of the executive” to prevent MPs from blocking a no-deal Brexit and that he would order all cabinet ministers to commit to a policy of leaving the EU without a deal.Former work and pensions secretary Esther McVey, who has described a no-deal Brexit as “the only viable and acceptable” remaining option, faced criticism on Thursday after she said that parents should be able to take their children out of classes on LGBT relationships.“I believe parents know best for their children.\u0026nbspWhile they’re still children – and we’re talking primary school age – then really the parents need to have the final say on what they want their children to know,” she said.Former Conservative education secretary Justine Greening told Ms McVey she could not pick and choose on human rights and equality.“Children should understand a modern and erse Britain they’re growing up in.\u0026nbspMatters for social mobility too – you can’t be your best if you can’t be yourself,” said Ms Greening.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

And for the record, I’ve been reassured that it is all very possible.” Ms Longfield says it is right, as proposed under a new “game-changing” statutory code, that social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram should be required to block under-13s or face punitive fines.Duty of Care | Time for the government to actUnder the age-appropriate code, which is due to become law this year, the companies will have to introduce effective age checks, or treat all their users like children.Those that fail to do so risk fines of up to 4 per cent of global turnover, equivalent to £1.5 billion for Facebook. “For too long, the balance of power between children and the platforms they use has been firmly fixed in favour of the latter.This code could be the first step in redressing the balance,” said Ms Longfield. “Of course, it would be surprising if there was not a flurry of pushback from the tech companies, as so often happens when industry is asked to change its ways. “We will be told it would take a very long time, that it will negate the experience of the activity or that it simply can’t be done.”Duty of care puffShe said one company had told her that current age verification technology was appropriate for them because they needed users to get online “seamlessly”. “But why should it be? If it’s a choice between children having to wait a small amount of time to get on to a site, and continuing to allow them on sites they shouldn’t be on, then to me the answer is obvious,” she added.Ms Longfield backed The Daily ’s campaign for a statutory duty of care, which is to be introduced by the Government.She said the companies should start introducing the changes now, rather than waiting for the Government’s planned legislation.She is incredulous at their claims that they don’t have the technology to do it and that they are obfuscating by claiming they want people to be able to go seamlessly online without checks.“Instead of trying to hold up the inevitable, it would be wise to get ahead of the curve,” she said.  Duty of Care CampaignPlease review our commenting policyNorth Korea\u0026#39s Kim Jong-un \u0026#39executes envoy for Hanoi summit with Trump amid purge of officials\u0026#39Virgin Trains to launch split ticketing app to save passengers money on trips2018 saw highest ever number of GP practice closures, with small local surgeries worst affectedSlash corporation tax to 12.5 per cent, say Tory leadership hopefulsTory donations fall by almost £4 million from the end of last year -

those with 5,000 or fewer patients - are operate with a single partner GP before closing.Today\u0027s figures contrast with those for 2013, when there were just 18 practice closures of any size.Dr Jackie Applebee, who runs the Tower Hamlets Local Medical Committee, said smaller surgeries have better outcomes and are preferred by patients.Dr Vautrey added: These figures clearly show the increased pressure that practices have been under over the last decade, as workload mounts, more doctors leave and surgeries struggle to recruit new staff.While there are a number of reasons why practices may close or merge – including when private providers hand back short-term contracts or realise that practices may not be financially viable – ongoing pressures will likely to have played a significant role.NHS England said that its 2017-18 financial year data for England shows a higher proportion of closures - 62 per cent - were due to mergers than that suggested by the Pulse data, which covered the whole UK from January to December 2018.A spokesman said: “In England there were fewer practice closures and patient dispersals in 2017-18 compared with 2016-17 and we continue to support all general practices to help them thrive.“Thousands of practices continue to be helped through the GP resilience programme, where investment has been increased from a planned £8 million in 2019-20 to £13 million.”North Korea\u0026#39s Kim Jong-un \u0026#39executes envoy for Hanoi summit with Trump amid purge of officials\u0026#39Virgin Trains to launch split ticketing app to save passengers money on tripsSlash corporation tax to 12.5 per cent, say Tory leadership hopefulsTory donations fall by almost £4 million from the end of last year -

Leeds is the only place in the UK where obesity levels are falling. It is targeted interventions at the people who really need support, rather than taking the same approach to everybody,” he said.Mr Hancock - who was last week teased for his own habits when caught on camera eating a waffle  - added: There is some who say we need blanket measures across everybody, but everybody enjoys the odd caramel waffle from time to time. All things in moderation, but we do need targeted support for people who particularly need our help.The review by Prof Dame Sally Davies will examine which measures could help to meet targets to halve rates of childhood obesity by 2030.Research involving ­Oxford University found that the eight-week programme  In Leeds showing parents how to take charge has been linked to a significant drop in obesity levels.The scheme, which costs councils £50 per family, is aimed particularly at ­deprived areas.Ministers have said efforts to prevent obesity in ­toddlers will form a central part of a Green Paper this summer. The Government\u0027s ­former obesity tsar said the results were astonishing.Severe obesity among 10-11 year olds is at a record highObesity rates among five-year-olds in England remained unchanged ­between 2013-14 and 2016-17, at around 9.4 per cent.However, rates in Leeds dropped from 9.4 per cent to 8.8 per cent over the same period, according to the study presented at the European Congress on Obesity in Glasgow.Overweight parents are more likely to have overweight childrenKim Roberts, chief executive of the Health Exercise Nutrition for the Really Young scheme adopted in Leeds, told how parents are encouraged to be in charge of their families. She said: We want ­parents to be able to hold boundaries, so they are able to say \u0027no\u0027 to pester power around snacks.Leeds was compared with 15 other cities in England - none of which recorded such a turnaround.This kind of reduction is unprecedented, Mrs Roberts said.So far 6,000 families in Leeds have been given the lessons, with 625 children a year saved from obesity.Please review our commenting policyNorth Korea\u0026#39s Kim Jong-un \u0026#39executes envoy for Hanoi summit with Trump amid purge of officials\u0026#39Virgin Trains to launch split ticketing app to save passengers money on trips2018 saw highest ever number of GP practice closures, with small local surgeries worst affectedSlash corporation tax to 12.5 per cent, say Tory leadership hopefulsTory donations fall by almost £4 million from the end of last year - but they still raised more than LabourBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent 2019, live semi-final 4, recap: Sulky Simon steals the show as weird factor goes through the roofR Kelly charged with 11 new sexual assault charges against underage girlDonald Trump indicates Boris Johnson is preferred Tory leader with pair expected to meet in London next weekComment: As Boris well knows, the law has developed a worrying influence on politicsMark Harper enters leadership race saying he is untainted by Theresa May\u0026#39s government unlike his rivalsNetflix and Disney under pressure to take US abortion boycott to Northern IrelandHow a new British prime minister can still avoid a head-on collision with Europe over BrexitComment: Why I, as Michael Gove\u0026#39s chief inquisitor, am backing him as PMPrisoners must not be released early to save money, says former Met CommissionerMurderers who refuse to reveal location of victims\u0026#39 bodies should be held in jail indefinitely, say families\u0026#39 campaignersFrench police to face charges over yellow vest injuriesScottish Government faces \u0026#39devastating\u0026#39£1 billion funding gap over the next three yearsRory Stewart risks being barred from the US after admitting smoking opiumMother of girl who died on rollercoaster said \u0026#39lessons have not been learnt\u0026#39 after six-year-old falls from same rideMacron condemned for snubbing Juno Beach D-Day anniversary ceremonyWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 30 may 2019","story":"Four geese fly in an remarkably close formation, creating the illusion that they are a giant 8 winged creature.

It praises them for focusing on important issues like privacy rights and cyber security.WhatsApp ads are coming to app next year, Facebook revealsBut it goes on to attack one specific suggestion inside that the article: the adding of a special user that would allow law enforcement to read conversations inside a group chat or phone call.Despite this, the GCHQ piece outlines a proposal for \u0027silently adding a law enforcement participant to a group chat or call\u0027\u0026nbspThis proposal to add a \u0027ghost\u0027\u0026nbspuser would violate important human rights principles, as well as several of the principles outlined in the GCHQ piece. Although the GCHQ officials claim that \u0027you don’t even have to touch the encryption\u0027\u0026nbspto implement their plan, the \u0027ghost\u0027\u0026nbspproposal would pose serious threats to cybersecurity and thereby also threaten fundamental human rights, including privacy and free expression.It goes on to explain that proponents of the ghost user suggestion argue that it would be possible to allow law enforcement to secretly be added into conversations, allowing them in effect to be a participant in every conversation that happens. That would allow the chats to be protected by encryption, they argue, since the chats would remain protected but spies would be a normal participant in them.But the letter says that such a proposal is misguided, since it would still end up undermining the security of conversations and allow for vulnerabilities to be opened up. The current system works by tying keys to inidual users, and only allowing users with those keys to be able to read conversations\u0026nbsp– that system would be undermined by one that gave the keys to somebody else at a general level.They also note that even if the security commitments did hold true, there is nothing to guarantee that spy agencies would not abuse the access that such technology would give them. It argues that the access could enable stalking and abuse, and claims that the protections that decide how UK and US spying agencies can use the data they are given are not strict enough.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Shares in the company plunged as much as 28 per cent on Thursday after it warned profits will fall in the year ahead.The company currently produces the burgundy-coloured passports which have attracted the ire of some Leave supporters, but its contract runs out in 2020.Created with Sketch.The front pages on what would have been Brexit Day Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.March 29 2019 - The original date for Britain\u0027s departure from the EU, what do the newspapers have to say about it?The  focuses on the fact that today was the original day for Britain\u0027s departure from the EUThe Daily Mail warns MPs that they have one last chance to back the Prime Minister\u0027s Brexit dealThe Independent Daily Edition reports that the Prime Minister is gambling as she holds a vote today on the withdrawal agreementThe Sun reports that the Prime Minister last night sought to convince DUP leader Arlene Foster to back her deal reports that some ministers want the Prime Minister to step down now, while Michael Gove becomes the favourite at the bookies to replace herThe i reports that Boris Johnson is preparing his leadership bid for when the Prime Minister resignsThe Times reports that Brexit may be delayed for a further yearThe Daily  reports that the Prime Minister is making a desperate final plea to pass her Brexit deal through the house of commonsThe Financial Times reports on the Brexit Betrayal march that will reach London today after setting off from Sunderland with the intention of reaching London on Brexit dayThe Daily Mirror reports on the Prime Minister\u0027s difficulty passing her deal through the commonsThe Daily Star calls on its readers to shut up about BrexitMarch 29 2019 - The original date for Britain\u0027s departure from the EU, what do the newspapers have to say about it?The  focuses on the fact that today was the original day for Britain\u0027s departure from the EUThe Daily Mail warns MPs that they have one last chance to back the Prime Minister\u0027s Brexit dealThe Independent Daily Edition reports that the Prime Minister is gambling as she holds a vote today on the withdrawal agreementThe Sun reports that the Prime Minister last night sought to convince DUP leader Arlene Foster to back her deal reports that some ministers want the Prime Minister to step down now, while Michael Gove becomes the favourite at the bookies to replace herThe i reports that Boris Johnson is preparing his leadership bid for when the Prime Minister resignsThe Times reports that Brexit may be delayed for a further yearThe Daily  reports that the Prime Minister is making a desperate final plea to pass her Brexit deal through the house of commonsThe Financial Times reports on the Brexit Betrayal march that will reach London today after setting off from Sunderland with the intention of reaching London on Brexit dayThe Daily Mirror reports on the Prime Minister\u0027s difficulty passing her deal through the commonsThe Daily Star calls on its readers to shut up about Brexit“In addition, we will be proposing a reorganisation of our business over the next 12 months designed to enhance our strategic focus and generate greater efficiencies.”Last year, Mr Sutherland said he found it “disappointing and surprising” that this “icon of British identity is going to be manufactured in France”.Conservative MP\u0026nbspJacob Rees-Mogg said at the time that it was “odd to have a national symbol produced abroad”.De La Rue has also faced other pressures including “significant structural change in the industry and real strategic change within the business”, Mr Sutherland said.“With a clear strategic vision now in place and being executed, now feels like the right time for me to hand over to a new leader, to take things to the next phase. I wish the board and the company every success.”De La Rue also blamed “growing competitive pressure in the banknote print market” for a downturn in performance, as profits ed over the past year.Operating profits for the year to March 2019 plunged 74 per cent\u0026nbspto £31.5m, down from £123m the previous year.Revenue jumped 14 per cent\u0026nbspto £564.8m, significantly driven by growth in its currency ision.Currency sales increased by 20 per cent\u0026nbspto £447.1m, while it was weighed down by a decline in ID revenue, which fell by 4 per cent\u0026nbspto £78.4m.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Shares in the company plunged as much as 28 per cent on Thursday after it warned profits will fall in the year ahead.The company currently produces the burgundy-coloured passports which have attracted the ire of some Leave supporters, but its contract runs out in 2020.Created with Sketch.The front pages on what would have been Brexit Day Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.March 29 2019 - The original date for Britain\u0027s departure from the EU, what do the newspapers have to say about it?The  focuses on the fact that today was the original day for Britain\u0027s departure from the EUThe Daily Mail warns MPs that they have one last chance to back the Prime Minister\u0027s Brexit dealThe Independent Daily Edition reports that the Prime Minister is gambling as she holds a vote today on the withdrawal agreementThe Sun reports that the Prime Minister last night sought to convince DUP leader Arlene Foster to back her deal reports that some ministers want the Prime Minister to step down now, while Michael Gove becomes the favourite at the bookies to replace herThe i reports that Boris Johnson is preparing his leadership bid for when the Prime Minister resignsThe Times reports that Brexit may be delayed for a further yearThe Daily  reports that the Prime Minister is making a desperate final plea to pass her Brexit deal through the house of commonsThe Financial Times reports on the Brexit Betrayal march that will reach London today after setting off from Sunderland with the intention of reaching London on Brexit dayThe Daily Mirror reports on the Prime Minister\u0027s difficulty passing her deal through the commonsThe Daily Star calls on its readers to shut up about BrexitMarch 29 2019 - The original date for Britain\u0027s departure from the EU, what do the newspapers have to say about it?The  focuses on the fact that today was the original day for Britain\u0027s departure from the EUThe Daily Mail warns MPs that they have one last chance to back the Prime Minister\u0027s Brexit dealThe Independent Daily Edition reports that the Prime Minister is gambling as she holds a vote today on the withdrawal agreementThe Sun reports that the Prime Minister last night sought to convince DUP leader Arlene Foster to back her deal reports that some ministers want the Prime Minister to step down now, while Michael Gove becomes the favourite at the bookies to replace herThe i reports that Boris Johnson is preparing his leadership bid for when the Prime Minister resignsThe Times reports that Brexit may be delayed for a further yearThe Daily  reports that the Prime Minister is making a desperate final plea to pass her Brexit deal through the house of commonsThe Financial Times reports on the Brexit Betrayal march that will reach London today after setting off from Sunderland with the intention of reaching London on Brexit dayThe Daily Mirror reports on the Prime Minister\u0027s difficulty passing her deal through the commonsThe Daily Star calls on its readers to shut up about Brexit“In addition, we will be proposing a reorganisation of our business over the next 12 months designed to enhance our strategic focus and generate greater efficiencies.”Last year, Mr Sutherland said he found it “disappointing and surprising” that this “icon of British identity is going to be manufactured in France”.Conservative MP\u0026nbspJacob Rees-Mogg said at the time that it was “odd to have a national symbol produced abroad”.De La Rue has also faced other pressures including “significant structural change in the industry and real strategic change within the business”, Mr Sutherland said.“With a clear strategic vision now in place and being executed, now feels like the right time for me to hand over to a new leader, to take things to the next phase.

Administrative jobs, support services, and retail saw the largest fall in the numbers of workers on low pay.A record two\u0026nbspmillion workers - 7.3 per cent of the population - now receive the legal minimum wage.Despite warnings from business groups, a significant ramping up of the minimum wage level has taken place without any significant negative impacts on jobs, the Resolution Foundation said.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Red Arrows in the Apollo formation while performing a full display at Chalkoutsi, Greece.

Women and young people have been the main beneficiaries of a higher minimum wage, whose ratcheting up has not stopped employment rising to a record high.“It’s great that both main parties want to go even further on raising the minimum wage and eliminate low pay altogether. But such an ambitious move would transform the labour market, and must therefore be approached boldly but cautiously.“An ambitious but cautious approach that saw the National Living Wage continue to rise after 2020 – at a faster pace than the minimum wage has increased over its 20 year history ¬– would put Britain on course to eliminate low pay in the middle of the 2020s, while still giving the government room for manoeuvre if economic conditions change.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is a natural response to weaker market conditions and buyers are starting to negotiate harder on price.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And that ability could transform the way people use their phones, according to its evangelists, who argue that it will make it possible to download content in an instant and facilitate whole new ways of using networks.But all of that promise has been mere speculation before EE switched on the super-fast network from today. Now it has become the first to offer it, though other networks are expected to do so soon.Still, there are a whole host of limitations on whether you\u0027ll actually be able to use it. You\u0027ll have to buy a new phone, pay up for a new contract – and it still might not actually be available where you are.(Some carriers in the US have got around this by claiming they are offering 4.5G and showing 5G network indicators in the corner of phones\u0027 screens, despite the fact it is not really 5G. This isn\u0027t happening in the UK, at least yet, so if it is showing then it should also be working.)Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Apple has announced the new iPod Touch, the first new iPod in four years.

All of them – apart from the LG V50 Thinq – include 5G in their model name, so it will probably be obvious if you\u0027ve already got one.Only the OnePlus 7 Pro\u0026nbspactually came out at the same time as the 5G network was switched on. The rest can be pre-ordered now.Huawei also make a phone ready for 5G, but EE has decided that it won\u0027t be selling them because of the ongoing dispute between the company and US authorities.And Apple hasn\u0027t yet commented on its plans for 5G, though rumours suggest that an iPhone ready for it should be coming in the next couple of years.But there is a way around all this, if you don\u0027t have a brand new and 5G-capable device. EE is offering two devices that sit separate from your phone, and generate a WiFi connection so you can attach the two together.There is a home router version, and one that works more like a hot spot for using on the go. Neither of them are available yet, but you can register your interest on the website.For all of these, you will need to pay the extra cost for one of EE\u0027s 5G plans.EE has switched on the 5G network in six cities initially:\u0026nbspLondon, Cardiff, Belfast, Edinburgh, Birmingham and Manchester. That doesn\u0027t mean it will be available everywhere in those places, but it should be available in some.5G travels less easily than slower networks, so it might sometimes be difficult to connect even if you feel like you are somewhere that should have it.The company has committed to offering the network in 1,500 sites by the end of the year. That will include\u0026nbspthe busiest parts of Bristol, Coventry, Glasgow, Hull, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Nottingham and Sheffield, the network said.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Germans were told to destroy them to avoid them falling into allied hands – and, at the end of the war, those that remained were ordered to be destroyed by Winston Churchill.The machine now on sale is even more rare, since it is only lightly used and includes its original parts. While there are still some issues, such as a corroded battery and a broken leather strap, it is in far better condition than most other examples of the machines.Only about 250 of them are thought to have been\u0026nbsparound in the first place, let alone in such a state. And those that do exist rarely go on sale.That accounts for the very high price tag placed on the machines. Auctioneer\u0026nbspNate D Sanders\u0026nbspin Los Angeles has set a minimum bid of $200,000.It\u0026nbspnotes the unusual features, including\u0026nbspan “engraving of the Third Reich emblem –\u0026nbspa black eagle above the swastika”, that can be found in the machine.The enigma machines could take communications and scramble up inidual letters, making them entirely unreadable.But human error and the work of the well-documented teams at Bletchley Park would eventually find their way past the encryptions\u0026nbspthe machines created.The decoders\u0026nbspnoticed that the messages would often include similar phrases such as “Heil Hitler”, and that allowed them to work backwards to unscramble the messages and help read through communications.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is 20 per cent smaller than Neptune or about three times the size of the Earth.The planet is so close to its star that it takes only 1.3 days to get around it.It is the first time that any such planet has been found in this region, which was thought to be so empty that it was referred to as the Neptunian Desert.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An image from Nasa\u0027s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) shows a 200,000 mile long solar filament ripping through the Sun\u0027s corona in September 2013230 Nasa Celebrates 50 Years of SpacewalkingFor 50 years, NASA has been suiting up for spacewalking.

Because of the strong radiation coming from the star, planets are thought to lose any gaseous atmosphere, which evaporates off and leaves the smaller, rocky core behind.The moon is shrinking and shaking, Nasa saysBut the mysterious Forbidden Planet seems to have retained its gaserous atmosphere, in a finding that surprised the researchers.They believe that it could have found its way into that desert only relatively recently, in the last one million years. Or it might have begun very large and so is still evaporating.This planet must be tough –\u0026nbspit is right in the zone where we expected Neptune-sized planets could not survive, said\u0026nbspRichard West, from the Department of Physics at the University of Warwick.We are now scouring out data to see if we can see any more planets in the Neptune Desert –\u0026nbspperhaps the desert is greener than was once thought.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On 19 August, a temporary license granted to Huawei by the US government will expire.Users will also lose\u0026nbspthe ability to install future versions of the Android operating system.“Huawei will continue to provide security updates and after sales services to all existing Huawei and Honor smartphone and tablet products covering those have been sold or still in stock globally,” a Huawei spokesperson told\u0026nbspThe Independent.“We will continue to build a\u0026nbspsafe and sustainable software ecosystem, in order to provide the best experience for all users globally.”But this will not be the case for future versions of Huawei smartphones, which will lose access to popular Google apps like Maps and YouTube.The suspension will also mean owners of new Huawei phones will not be able to download any apps using the Google Play store.Huawei\u0026nbspsays it has been preparing for this eventuality by building its own technology that is not reliant on US tech giants.Chief executive Richard Yu said in an interview last year that it has a backup plan should it ever be cut off from the likes of Google and Microsoft.Google issues message to Huawei phone owners“We have prepared our own operating system,” he told German publication\u0026nbspDie Welt. “Should it ever happen that we can no longer use these systems, we would be prepared.That’s our plan B but of course we prefer to work with the ecosystems of Google and Microsoft.”After the Trump administration placed Huawei on its “entity list” last week, Huawei executive Ren\u0026nbspZhengfei\u0026nbspreiterated this in comments to Japanese media.“We have already been preparing for this,” he said.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

For example, I prefer cultures that do not tolerate female genital mutilation. Will this will be considered racist by all those who hover, eagerly hoping that someone will offend them – on someone else’s behalf, naturallyCleese’s initial comments attracted ire from many people, including London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who said the actor was sounding like his character Basil Fawlty from Fawlty Towers.Comedian Dom Joly also criticised Cleese, writing on Twitter: “He’s clearly a really smart funny man but it is basically a very racist tweet. Secondly, its a racist tweet by a man who lives on a Caribbean island – the irony of that is insane.“Author Caitlin Moran added: “John Cleese is in the process of moving to Nevis, in the Caribbean.

Administrative jobs, support services, and retail saw the largest fall in the numbers of workers on low pay.A record two\u0026nbspmillion workers - 7.3 per cent of the population - now receive the legal minimum wage.Despite warnings from business groups, a significant ramping up of the minimum wage level has taken place without any significant negative impacts on jobs, the Resolution Foundation said.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Red Arrows in the Apollo formation while performing a full display at Chalkoutsi, Greece.

Women and young people have been the main beneficiaries of a higher minimum wage, whose ratcheting up has not stopped employment rising to a record high.“It’s great that both main parties want to go even further on raising the minimum wage and eliminate low pay altogether. But such an ambitious move would transform the labour market, and must therefore be approached boldly but cautiously.“An ambitious but cautious approach that saw the National Living Wage continue to rise after 2020 – at a faster pace than the minimum wage has increased over its 20 year history ¬– would put Britain on course to eliminate low pay in the middle of the 2020s, while still giving the government room for manoeuvre if economic conditions change.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion.

Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.The Basic\u0026nbspmembership will stay the same price, at £5.99. But that plan has very limited features: only allowing for standard definition screening, and on one device.The rises will go into immediate effect for new subscribers. It will roll out to existing ones over the coming weeks, Netflix said.“We change our prices from time to time to reflect the significant investments we’ve made in new TV shows and films, as well as \u0026nbspimprovements to our product,”\u0026nbspa Netflix spokesperson said.“We have more than 50 productions planned in the UK this year, including new seasons of Black Mirror, Sex Education and After Life.

Some had seen even steeper price rises than those actually announced, but Netflix said the specific increases might never actually be rolled out.Netflix said at the time that the changes were part of a test.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They carried\u0026nbspmakeshift torches and wooden sticks to guide them through the darkness\u0026nbsp– \u0026nbspand may even have brought their dog in too.Researchers analysed the ancient tracks left in a layer of clay inside a deep cave of Bàsura in the Toirano cave complex in northern Italy.It is the first time crawling has been documented in ancient humans, according to researchers from the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa.\u0026nbspAround 180 prints were made by these curious prehistoric explorers who crawled through the low cave using their hands, knees and the balls of their feet. The youngest child was probably only two years old, and would have been following two older siblings aged around six and 11. \u0026nbspThe family walked close to the side of the cave and have left charcoal-smudged handprints on the wall. The children picked up mud from the floor and splattered it on the wall with their fingers, according to the study published in eLife.\u0026nbsp“Most likely they were pushed into the cave by simple curiosity and a sense of wonder for unexplored places,” first author Marco Romano, Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa told Ars Technica.\u0026nbspBàsura (Marco Avanzini)Shortly after the family left the cave\u0026nbspexperts belive a stalactite fell, which blocked the inner chamber and meant the traces of their little trip was preserved.In the 1950s it was opened up using dynamite.\u0026nbspIt was then that the human traces were found.\u0026nbspScientists used modern dating methods and software to analyse the structure of the tracks. “Together, these approaches allowed us to construct a narrative of how the humans entered and exited the cave, and their activities once they were inside,” said Dr Romano.Created with Sketch.The breathtaking photos of Icelandic ice caves  Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.114 Icelandic ice caves in Vatnajökull 214 Icelandic ice caves in Vatnajökull 314 Icelandic ice caves in Vatnajökull 414 Icelandic ice caves in Vatnajökull 514 Icelandic ice caves in Vatnajökull 614 Icelandic ice caves in Vatnajökull 714 Icelandic ice caves in Vatnajökull 814 Icelandic ice caves in Vatnajökull 914 Icelandic ice caves in Vatnajökull 1014 Icelandic ice caves in Vatnajökull 1114 Icelandic ice caves in Vatnajökull 1214 Icelandic ice caves in Vatnajökull 1314 Icelandic ice caves in Vatnajökull 1414 Icelandic ice caves in Vatnajökull 114 Icelandic ice caves in Vatnajökull 214 Icelandic ice caves in Vatnajökull 314 Icelandic ice caves in Vatnajökull 414 Icelandic ice caves in Vatnajökull 514 Icelandic ice caves in Vatnajökull 614 Icelandic ice caves in Vatnajökull 714 Icelandic ice caves in Vatnajökull 814 Icelandic ice caves in Vatnajökull 914 Icelandic ice caves in Vatnajökull 1014 Icelandic ice caves in Vatnajökull 1114 Icelandic ice caves in Vatnajökull 1214 Icelandic ice caves in Vatnajökull 1314 Icelandic ice caves in Vatnajökull 1414 Icelandic ice caves in Vatnajökull “In our study, we wanted to see how ancient humans explored this fascinating cave system. Specifically, we set out to discover how many people entered the cave, whether they explored as iniduals or as a group, their age, gender and what kind of route they took once inside the cave,” he said.\u0026nbspThe findings suggest that young children were active group members during the Stone Age, even when carrying out dangerous activities.\u0026nbspAncient plague may have wiped out Stone Age farmers in EuropeWhy we should stop using ‘Stone Age’ to describe early humansStone Age treasures offer insight into evolution of human intelligenceSuch excursions were made for work and pleasure. “Hunter-gatherers may therefore have been driven by fun activities during exploration, as well as simply the need to find food,” said Dr Romano.\u0026nbspBased on 3D models of knee prints, scientists believe the family were in good shape and probably did a lot of exercise as hunter gatherers.\u0026nbspThey followed the cave for more than 150 metres.

It is not known exactly how this process occurred, but a research team from Kyoto University in Japan has revealed the first ever evidence of wild chimps habitually catching and consuming freshwater crabs.The findings may provide scientists with new insight into the behaviours which drove our own progress, the scientists suggest.Writing in the Journal of Human Evolution, the team describes year-round, freshwater crab-fishing behaviour – primarily among female and infant chimpanzees – living in the rainforest of the Nimba Mountains in Guinea, west Africa.“The aquatic fauna our ancestors consumed likely provided essential long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, required for optimal brain growth and function,” said lead author Kathelijne Koops from the University of Zurich and Kyoto University’s leading graduate programme in primatology and wildlife science.Created with Sketch.

For two years, they documented the demographics and behaviour of the group of chimps, while also analysing and comparing the nutritional value of the crabs to other foods in the chimpanzees’ diet.Crabbing, they learned, not only took place year-round – without regard to season or fruit availability – but intriguingly was negatively correlated with the chimps’ consumption of ants, another diet staple. Mature males were the least likely to consume aquatic fauna.“Energy and sodium levels in large crabs are comparative with ants,” Dr Koops said, “leading us to hypothesise that crabs may be an important year-round source of protein and salts for females – especially when pregnant or nursing – and for growing juveniles.”The study sheds light on our own evolution by illustrating that fishing behaviours may not be restricted by habitat as could be assumed.Chimpanzees filmed eating tortoises after smashing their shells openMystery ‘ghost species’ of chimpanzee discovered in bonobo DNAChimpanzees have much cleaner beds than humans do, scientists findChimpanzees learn to play rock, paper, scissors “This isn’t the first case of non-human primates eating crabs,” said senior co-author Tetsuro Matsuzawa, “but it is the first evidence of apes other than humans doing so.”He said notable previous observations of primates eating crabs came from “monkey species in locations consistent with aquatic faunivory – lakes, rivers, or coastlines – and not in closed rainforest.”He added: “It’s exciting to see a behaviour like this that allows us to improve our understanding of what drove our ancestors to ersify their diet.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Cars, on the other hand, run on money and make you fat.But for many of those not already converted to the two-wheels-good, four-wheels-bad brigade, the well-publicised benefits of cycling\u0026nbsp– for your health and your bank balance, as well as the planet – are outweighed by the inherent risks of taking to two wheels in the UK’s traffic-clogged towns and cities.The Dutch learnt how to build proper cycling infrastructure in the 1970s after a spate of road deaths, but the UK is still struggling to prove it takes the issue of safe cycling seriously.\u0026nbspSurvey after survey shows feeling unsafe on the roads is a major deterrent for new cyclists. One recent poll found almost half of respondents would be encouraged to use their bicycle if they weren’t forced to share the road quite so intimately with cars and lorries.A visit to the continent shows how quickly and easily other countries seem to have found building properly segregated bike lanes – surely screwing rubber “armadillo” humps or plastic bollards into the road is much cheaper and quicker than the full blown road redesigns Transport for London and other local authorities seem to favour.Better transport planning would allow more kids to cycle to schoolNow, a study suggests the benefits of high-quality bike infrastructure actually go far further than just protecting the cyclist. Fatalities among all road users fall dramatically when high-quality infrastructure is built, slowing traffic and forcing everyone on the roads to take greater care.Even motoring association the AA backs the research with its conclusion\u0026nbspthat more bike lanes are needed. There is certainly an argument to be made that cyclists must also\u0026nbspplay a role in ensuring our shared public spaces are both safe and pleasant to use.The high-profile death of a pedestrian hit by a cyclist with no brakes in east London, coupled with anecdotal evidence of red-light runners and pavement cyclists, can contribute to a sense that those on two wheels don’t abide the rules. And while that group are in the minority, their behaviour plays into the hands of those who would sooner see bike lanes returned to their former use than have more genuinely safe infrastructure for everyone to use.But the progress (albeit limited) that has been made – particularly in the capital, but in other large cities such as Manchester\u0026nbsp– is under threat. Powerful lobbyists are putting pressure on decision-makers to rip up London’s flagship east-west cycle lane. Opponents of the hugely popular route, which provides space for a safe commute for thousands each day, have included the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association and Tory mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey.Campaigns on social media juxtapose\u0026nbspimages of an empty bike lane hugging the Thames with lines of motor traffic disappearing into the distance as evidence that we need more, not fewer, lanes for cars and vans. So far, thankfully, those in charge of transport planning have not budged.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That happened. That is gone. \u0026nbsp“What I do say is that if parliament comes to an agreement, then it’s reasonable – if parliament wishes it – there should be a public vote on it but that is some way off.”\u0026nbspMr Corbyn made clear he backs a general election or second referendum if a new Conservative prime minister seeks to take the UK out of the EU without a deal.\u0026nbsp“Faced with the threat of no deal and a prime minister with no mandate, the only way out of the Brexit crisis ripping our country apart is now to go back to the people,” he said. \u0026nbsp“Let the people decide the country’s future, either in a general election or through a public vote on any deal agreed by parliament.”\u0026nbspRachael\u0026nbspMaskell, a Labour MP\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspa supporter of the Best for Britain campaign for a second referendum,\u0026nbspsaid:\u0026nbsp“My party must unambiguously and proudly state that we believe the best way forward for our country is to go back to the people and give them the Final Say on Brexit, in all circumstances.\u0026nbsp“Last week’s elections showed the country has changed its mind on this issue, so it’s only right we give the people their say.”After the meeting, Mr Varadkar told an Irish parliamentary committee: “I very much imparted that message as politely that I could that the chances of a further extension are pretty slim and the Withdrawal Agreement, including the Irish protocol and the backstop, is closed from our point of view.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Former British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who is running to succeed Theresa May as Prime Minister, leaves his home in LondonThe Red Arrows in the Apollo formation while performing a full display at Chalkoutsi, Greece.

Dunstanburgh Castle is a 14th-century fortification on the coast of Northumberland in northern England, between the villages of Craster and Embleton. The castle was built by Earl Thomas of Lancaster between 1313 and 1322He said there was “a hardening view across the European Union” that there could be no further rolling extensions of the Article 50 Brexit process, though he said one might be possible to allow time for an election or a second referendum.“I don’t think it’s viable to believe that there would be sufficient support or unanimous support ... for a further extension while the UK continues to figure it out or for another set of indicative votes,” he said.\u0026nbspThe taoiseach said the “only way” that the Withdrawal Agreement could change would be if there was a “fundamental change in red lines from the next UK prime minister or the next UK government” such as a decision to stay in the customs union or the single market.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Nearly 60,000 residents were without power after the storm.

Utilities are expecting restoration to take several days.National Weather Service issues highest tornado warnings in two yearsFor now, Dayton city officials have asked residents to conserve water, as power was lost in the city’s water plants and pump stations.Montgomery County, where Dayton is\u0026nbsplocated, Miami County, and Greene County were the most affected by the tornadoes, which authorities described as large and dangerous.\u0026nbspThe National Guard has been deployed in the aftermath.Tornadoes also touched down in nearby Trotwood, where the mayor told residents that power lines and trees were down. Ohio’s tornado spree marks the latest in a particularly harsh year for tornadoes in the US, which have caused major damage and several deaths in Alabama, Missouri, Oklahoma, and several other states.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But one of the most important is the rivalry between France and Germany.How is the European Commission president chosen?Under EU treaties, the 28 member states (which collectively make up the European Council) propose a candidate for president. They are supposed to take into account the results of the EU elections, though the treaties do not elaborate on what this means in practice.To arrive at their candidate, member states vote with a “qualified majority”\u0026nbsp– that means 55 per cent\u0026nbspof EU countries must vote in favour (16 out of 28) representing 65 per cent\u0026nbspof the EU’s population. This is to stop tiny Malta, Cyprus\u0026nbspand Luxembourg from having the same power as larger states such as the UK, Germany\u0026nbspand France.Created with Sketch. Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Once the candidate is proposed by the council, the elected European parliament then has the option of confirming or rejecting them with a simple majority vote. If it\u0026nbsprejects the candidate, the council has to find another candidate.What’s all this about the spitzenkandidaten?\u0026nbspThe spitzenkandidat, or “lead candidate” system, was used in 2014 to select the commission president. Each political group in the European parliament – the centre-left socialists, the centre-right European People’s Party (EPP), the liberals, greens\u0026nbspetc, propose a lead candidate. In theory, the candidate from the group that comes top becomes the president.But this system isn’t written into the treaties, and has only been used once in 2014 – it’s not clear whether it will survive. Member states don’t like it because it takes power away from them and gives it to the parliament, and they’re under no legal obligation to follow it.What does this have to do with France and Germany?The winning spitzenkandidat was Manfred Weber, a German social conservative from Angela Merkel’s centre-right political alliance. Merkel said on Tuesday that she wants him to become commission president.\u0026nbspThe problem is, a lot of other people – including Emmanuel Macron – don’t want him.Why does Macron object to Manfred Weber?This is a complicated question. Publicly, Macron has suggested that he has concerns about Manfred Weber’s suitability for the job: on Tuesday he suggested that other candidates had the “skills” to be president, notably omitting Weber.\u0026nbspUnlike most previous commission presidents, Weber has never held a national government position before – his most recent job was leading the centre-right EPP group in the European parliament, before being nominated as its candidate.There’s also the question of national interest. Though neither leader would admit this publicly, the fact that Weber is German and from Merkel’s CDUCSU party means he would inevitably be seen as close to the German government – which is always being accused of dominating the EU anyway.Macron has ambitions to reform the EU, and while the German government pays lip service to reform in the name of cooperation, in practice it tends to drag its feet. Macron would much prefer to have his own person – or at least not Germany’s person – as president.What does the European parliament think?There are also differences of political tribe. Macron is aligned with the liberal Alde group in the European parliament, while Weber and Merkel are from the centre-right EPP. The EPP lost a lot of seats, while the liberals made quite substantial gains, so Alde feels it can assert itself.Though the EPP is still the biggest group, it does not command a majority in the European parliament, and so relies on the support of other groups. The maths mean that the liberals are in a powerful position and could potentially block the wrong candidate, even if the EPP gains the support of the second largest group, the centre-left socialists.While the European parliament’s leadership – which is also controlled by the EPP – put out a statement saying “the majority” of its political groups support keeping the spitzenkandidat system in place, one that didn’t support the move was the liberals – Macron’s group.\u0026nbspThis is where Labour went wrong in the European ElectionsAfter the European elections, listen to the people one more timeWhat Harry Leslie Smith would have told us about the EU electionsCorbyn is right – only a general election can unite Leave and RemainWhy has Nigel Farage refused to stand in the Peterborough by-election?In the end, the position agreed by the parliament was that the commission president had to be someone “who made hisher programme and personality known prior to the elections, and engaged in a European-wide campaign”. This opens the door to a lot of other candidates who were not officially spitzenkandidaten.What other candidates are in contention?Apart from Weber, Macron mentioned Michel Barnier – the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, who happens to be French. Barnier is from the same centre-right group as Merkel and Weber, so his unique combination of nationality and political affiliation could be a compromise. Though he did not declare as a candidate, that hasn’t stopped him basically campaigning anyway during the lull in Brexit talks.The other two candidates mentioned by Macron are Frans Timmermans, the centre-left Dutch politician who was the spitzenkandidat for the socialist group. Also in the frame is Margrethe Vestager, a Danish liberal who was not a spitzenkandidat but was put forward as a slate of personalities by Alde. More candidates could emerge if this isn’t resolved soon.How’s this going to be resolved?By negotiation and political horse-trading, the same way everything in Brussels is resolved. Leaders met for a summit on Tuesday evening and did not agree a huge amount, other than that the spitzenkandidat system would not automatically make someone president, but that someone being a spitzenkandidat was not a “disqualification” to becoming president (which nobody was arguing anyway).They also agreed that all the top jobs in the EU should be balanced according to gender, geography, the size of countries\u0026nbspand political affiliation. It’s probably going to be a difficult negotiation.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But will it work? Are these the final days of the seemingly undefeatable leader?There is no doubt that this debacle has damaged Netanyahu, whose adoring supporters have taken to shouting\u0026nbsp“King Bibi” and “magician” at him in rallies.As\u0026nbspYohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute, points out, fresh elections in September will mean that Israel has been governed by a transitional government for nearly a year, with limited authority and\u0026nbspat huge\u0026nbspeconomic and political cost.The political impasse has also delayed, and may further delay, Donald Trump’s long-awaited peace plan for the region which was expected to be rolled out next month. “The image of the political wizard who is omnipotent has been\u0026nbspfractured as a result of the fact that he couldn’t translate such a decisive victory into a government,” Plesner told The Independent.\u0026nbspNetanyahu has got control over the party hierarchy – they are all petrified of himGiven Netanyahu was unable to form a government this time around, and is facing likely indictment at the end of the year, an outsider would be forgiven for thinking the Likud would put forward a fresh face to save itself.The country as a whole is still right-wing and will in all probability give the Likud another win in the upcoming polls.Within the party, the most likely figure would be Gideon Sa’ar, a former minister and rising star. He already staged a small internal rebellion over Netanyahu’s immunity bills two weeks ago.But people close to Sa’ar\u0026nbspsay he has privately admitted he has the support of only a handful of Likud’s Members of the Knesset. The majority remain fiercely loyal to Netanyahu.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAnshel Pfeffer, an expert on the prime minister and author of a biography on the leader, said that the Likud, in its decades-long history, has never deposed one of its leaders.“Since it is has been founded, it has only five leaders,” he said. “Netanyahu has got control over the party hierarchy – they are all petrified of him”.Even outside the party the leader has support, Plesner addedNetanyahu’s wife gets plea bargain in meals fraud caseNetanyahu prepares for second election as coalition hopes fadeNetanyahu rejects plea from ex-officials not to annex West BankNetanyahu pushes through law to give him immunity from prosecutionNetanyahu says Israel will name Golan Heights community after Trump“Netanyahu is still by far the most experienced, formidable campaigner, the most motivated and energetic,” he said.\u0026nbspOn his side too is Donald Trump, who took the unusual step of intervening in Israel’s internal political crisis two days ago by writing on Twitter that he hoped Netanyahu would be able to form a coalition, so they could continue to work together.But politics aside, nothing can halt the legal time bomb that\u0026nbspis fast catching up with (and could unseat) Netanyahu.\u0026nbspThe new election is\u0026nbspon 17 September. If Bibi wins, he will need a month to form a coalition government. Should he want to ram through legislation granting him immunity, he will only have a few weeks to do that before the attorney general’s decision on his indictment\u0026nbspis made public.The law, as it stands, does not prohibit a leader from ruling while standing trial – but that could be changed by the supreme\u0026nbspcourt.\u0026nbspThis may be why Lieberman took such a bizarrely principled stand at the very end, refusing to budge on his demand of the conscription law, despite it triggering unprecedented elections.If Lieberman believes that Netanyahu’s days are numbered, there will be a big gap in the right-wing leadership that will need to be filled.But for now,\u0026nbspno one truly knows.“We are\u0026nbspin uncharted territory,” Pfeffer\u0026nbspsaid, in conclusion.\u0026nbsp“There are too many unprecedented things to\u0026nbspsay.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Tory MEPs were almost wiped out.It was expected, but that cannot hide the seriousness of the Conservatives’ crisis. Not only did most voters abandon them — even the majority of their own members voted for the Brexit Party.Many others, including me, refused to take part in a ballot that should never have taken place, for an organisation that we should not be part of.No party can last for long with its vote in freefall and its activists staying home or supporting a rival.The Tories must find a way to regain trust, inspire their troops and win back millions of lost voters.That means being completely honest and clear about why this happened. It is human nature to look for comforting excuses to explain away shocking news. But that would be no use.This crisis is entirely self-inflicted. The Conservatives gave the people a referendum and promised, before, during and after, to do as voters decided.Theresa May pledged scores of times that we would leave the EU, deal or no deal, in March.She broke that promise and her Cabinet colleagues let her do it. As Daniel Hannan, one of the Party’s surviving MEPs, put it: “People voted to leave three years ago and we haven’t left, it’s as simple as that.”Many voters were already deeply unhappy about the way the PM kept watering down and abandoning her negotiating red lines. Ditching the Brexit deadline was the last straw and pushed them over the edge. Step one of recovery is clear: Brexit must happen.If there’s a glimmer of hope it’s that May has agreed to resign. Imagineshe was still barricaded in Downing Street — more time would be wasted on the struggle to prise her out of the building.Instead, the race to succeed her has begun. No more politely pretending that “there’s no vacancy”. Instead, the MPs who hope to be the next Prime Minister can openly set out their stalls.There is no time to waste. This has got to be a proper contest, to produce a leader whose abilities and ideas have been thoroughly tested. The stakes are as high.Tory members, disillusioned, frustrated and bruised, want totheir party to winning ways. Democrats want the Leave vote to be honoured.And everyone wants to hear the proposals put forward by those who want to govern.The only option is to get this right and keep that essential promise. The future of the Conservative Party rests on it, but far more importantly so does the future of our country. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The same pattern was repeated where.In Germany, a surge for the Greens brought the long dominant Christian Democrats their worst result in decades.In France, Marine Le Pen’s right-wing National Rally topped the poll, and the two traditional centrist parties – the Republicans and the Socialists – almost disappeared.Even more dramatic gains for the Eurosceptics could be found in Italy. The nationalist League was far in front, with  per cent of the vote, while the maverick, rebellious Five Star movement won  per cent, putting the Italian anti-EU forces in an absolute majority.Populists also triumphed in Hungary, where Viktor Orban Civic Alliance gained no less than  per cent of the vote, and in Poland, where the right-wing Law and Justice party was victorious with  per cent.Indeed, throughout Europe there were advances for anti-establishment politicians - whether it be the Greens in Ireland or the nationalists in Sweden.As triumphant Greens edge out centre-left and centre-right parties, the EU will become even more polarised and ided, which will make it harder for parliament to .All this change is driven by widespread outrage at the disaster that the EU has inflicted on the countries of Europe.Without any mandate, the unaccountable, power-mad cabal in Brussels has weakened the fabric of the continent.National democracy has been pulverised by the quest for EU unication.National identities have been undermined by mass immigration on an unprecedented scale, particularly after the German Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the floodgates in .National economic interests have been sacriced on the altar of the European single currency.The EU fanatics like to paint populism as a form of extremism but, on the contrary, it is the natural response to the removal of democratic rights and freedoms.Across Europe, people want their countries back. They have had enough of betrayal.They prefer to govern themselves rather than be ruled by unelected officials.They are tired of being labelled bigots simply for feeling a sense of patriotism, that noble ideal which is really an extension of love of family.The real extremists are those EU zealots who show contempt for the ideas of national pride and sovereignty.Yet, there is no sign that the Brussels regime, cocooned by its ideology, has woken up to the scale of the upheaval.Just the opposite is true.Since yesterday, the EU ruling elite and its cheerleaders have indulged in a gigantic propaganda exercise, pretending that the results are not that signicant, that the populist insurgency has been exaggerated, that the barbarians have been held at the gates.In this climate of delusion, it is asnothing has happened.An attitude of business as usual prevails, as shown by today’s Brussels summit, where European leaders discussed the preparations for choosing a new EU President and Commission, given that the term of Jean Claude Juncker will soon end.In the time-honoured fashion of the EU’s institutions, another establishment stitch-up is probably on the way.Beyond mouthing a few empty words about reform, Brussels bosses seem to have learned no lesson from the anti-establishment fury.That is because they are so obsessed with the grand European project of political unity.Since its foundation in the s, the entire purpose of European Community has been the creation of a federal superstate.Every policy, every treaty is focused on the mission of ever closer union towards the ultimate goal of a United States of Europe.Nothing is allowed to stand in the way of this crusade. Even democracy and nationhood must be sacriced for the sake of the integrationist dogma.At the entrance to the Visitors Centre in the European Parliament, there is a plaque with the words, “National sovereignty is the root cause of the most crying evils of our time”, for which the “final remedy is the federal union of the people.”That was written by the British diplomat Lord Lothian, a committed appeaser right up to . His spirit still permeates the corridors of power in Brussels.Federalism explains why the EU is so addicted to the abolition of borders through free movement, because the obliteration of national identities will promote the new concept of European citizenship.Similarly, the creation of the single currency in  was not primarily an economic initiative but a political vehicle to enforce integration by undermining national independence.Through its arrogance, the EU is sowing the seeds for its own destruction.Without change, Brussels will become ever more crisis-ridden, ever more in-debted, ever more unpopular.The betrayal of the public is unsustainable in the long-term. In fact, collapse could arrive swtly in the coming decade, either through another financial crisis or through another major country, like Italy or France, deciding to leave.If the Brussels bosses had any sense, they would abandon their ideological project and instead make the union just a trading bloc of free, independent nations.That is what Britain was meant to have joined in  when we signed up for the Common Market, only to find we were sucked into the federalist quagmire.The British people eventually woke up to this reality.We had the courage to vote for independence - and Brexit is the spark that has helped to fuel the flames of rebellion across the continent.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

All the potential ­leadership contenders privately understand it, as do growing numbers of MPs.The question is whether they are brave enough to place such an unpopular truth before party members.When I predicted six weeks ago that the Conservative Party was headed for a single-figures vote in the European election unless it ditched Theresa May, there was much scoffing.Yes, I was told, things would be bad, but not that bad. Well, on Thursday, we secured . per cent.If we break that vote down by constituency, every single Tory MP loses.The first-past-the-post system is capricious. It protects you until, all of a sudden, it eliminates you.Just ask Scottish Labour.As long as our political debate revolves around Brexit, people are likely to vote for the most hardline pro and anti-Brexit parties.Indeed, the longer this wretched argument goes on, the more radicalised both sides become. Voters identy as Remain or Leave rather than according to their old party alignments.Three years ago, at the time of the referendum campaign, it was still a civil conversation rather than a civil war.The polarisation has come since the result, and it has become worse with every passing week.Most Leavers now want No Deal. Most Remainers want another referendum.The moment when both sides might have accepted a compromise — ideally a Swiss-type solution that would have taken us out of the EU’s political structures while retaining close economic links — has probably passed.So whose fault is it that we are in this situation  Hardliners on both sides must take their share of the blame.Those Remainers who promised to respect the result but then worked to frustrate it have done terrible damage to our politics.Those Leavers who, forgetting everything they said during the campaign, now insist that anything short of No Deal is a betrayal, have likewise destroyed trust in the system.But the chief responsibility lies with Theresa May.It was she who dug in on the wrong issues while conceding on the wrong issues, who mulishly insisted that it was all about immigration, who managed to convince both sides that she was secretly working for the other, who so aggravated EU leaders that, by the end, they were predisposed to reject anything she asked for because it was she who was doing the asking.Worst of all, she called and then lost the  election. From that moment, it was clear that our Parliament was prepared to frustrate Brexit.The EU got the message and started making deliberately absurd and vindictive demands, culminating in the Irish backstop which, incredibly, Theresa May accepted.We now face withdrawal terms so disadvantageous that they are worse than either staying or quitting — exactly as Michel Barnier intended.Which brings us back to the Catch-.Parliament does not intend to allow any government to leave the EU with No Deal, and the Commons Speaker has made clear that he is prepared to bend the rules in any way necessary to secure that end.In normal times, a Conservative leader would go to the country saying: “Give me the mandate I need. If Brussels knows we are ready for No Deal, we will get a good deal. We just need the numbers in Parliament.“Do you want me in charge, or a Marxist nostalgic who refuses to have a position on Brexit ”In normal times, such a leader would win comfortably. But these are not normal times.A large chunk of the electorate is now disposed to blame the Conservatives for the impasse rather than the parties that have actually been voting against Brexit.Nigel Farage has confirmed that he plans to contest every seat at the next election. The idea that he might stand aside in certain constituencies in order to stop Corbyn is based on a misunderstanding of how he operates.He is back at the head of a populist insurgent party.The last thing he wants is to have that party’s grievance addressed and so put himself out of business.Is there any solution  Possibly.It may be that Parliament cannot in fact block a No Deal Brexit. It may be that,forced to choose, MPs will baulk at voting to revoke Article .It may be that France, or another EU state, vetoes any extension beyond October  — though that is unlikely.Or it may be that the Tories could, in fact, win a general election.Perhaps I am wrong about Farage’s motivations, and he will agree to an electoral pact, fighting Labour in the North while standing aside in the South.Or maybe there’s another way out of the jam, one I can’t think of.But what cannot be denied is that the dilemma exists.There is no point in saying, “Just leave!” or “I’ll get us a better deal!” unless you are clear about how you intend to do it.The trouble is that, in the current mood, those are precisely the slogans that many Tory activists want to hear.The candidate who levels with them, who sets out the dilemma honestly and outlines a proposed route out of it, may become unelectable.

The rates burden could be reduced or stamp duty cut.There may even be some room for expenditure in pressing areas such as social care for the elderly or helping the hard-pressed police.£billion is a serious amount of money which could have a signicant domestic effect rather than being little more than overseas aid for rich ­countries.Then we could trade with the EU on the basis of the World Trade Organisation . This provides a framework for treating countries fairly. The UK, in spite of allowing the EU to represent our interests in recent years, has always been a founder member, and as soon as we have left we may resume our rightful place.The WTO allows nations to set tarfs that will then be applied to all other members in the absence of specic free trade deals.The concept of “most favoured nation” means that it is unlawful to discriminate against one country.The effect of this is that the EU could not charge higher tarfs against us than it does on goods from the United States.As the US has seen its trade with the EU grow faster since the introduction of the Single Market than the UK’s has, it is clearly no barrier to successful ­business.Likewise, the UK would have to levy the same payments on EU goods as we do on others — and here we would have a choice.Would we want to lower tarfs generally, cutting the cost of goods for ­consumers, or keep the protectionist ­barriers that make Europe so expensive It seems obvious that we ought to cut tarfs to improve living standards, ­especially for the least well-off in society, allowing them to have more money to save or spend.Historically, nations that have cut the cost of imports have become more prosperous and there are non-tarf barriers that the EU imposes purely to protect inefficient continental industries that could also be removed.Against this opportunity there are many myths that have grown up, fed and watered by those who never wanted to leave the EU.First, they say that the WTO has other agreements tacked on — over  with the US alone — and without them trade would stall.This is a misunderstanding.These add-ons include treaties such as the Paris Climate Accord which are not trade-related.Only about  have any trade relevance of which only one is important and it has already been rolled over.As they are purely technical, rolling them over is not dficult as has already been shown.Other doomsters say that just-in-time delivery cannot work under WTO — which is odd, as it already does.What matters for these processes is certainty of delivery times.The six ­seconds that it takes goods to clear customs in Southampton on average is insignicant compared to potential delays on the M which businesses already have to contend with.The UK already trades extensively and successfully on a WTO basis so ­extending it to the EU would not be problematic.The paranoid and the scaredy-cats also moan that more checks would have to be made, but again that is incorrect.Jon Thompson, the chief executive of Customs and Excise, confirmed that delays would be no worse than they ­currently are for imports.There is no WTO rule to create inefficiencies. The purpose of the organisation is the reverse. The system of cross-border trade is not that which people imagine from watching s spy films.In addition, both Calais and Dover, the only real pinch points, are both prepared and ready for No Deal.As for Ireland, the simple question remains: Who is going to build the wall There will be no hard border because no one wants one and that has always been the simple answer to a much over-complicated question.In truth the fears are like the supposed Millennium Bug, a fantasy of fevered minds.After all, with £billion, free-flowing trade and cheaper imports, as former Trade and Industry Secretary Peter ­Lilley has said: “It is not crashing out, it is cashing in.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I realised I’d made a big mistake.“For one, it was very hot in the car, and the windows rolled up nearly to the top.“The guy had a white shirt and he was very good looking.“Then I realised this guy had the worst BO I have ever smelt.“Then I looked over at the door to crank down the window and saw there was no door handle, no crank.“I cast my eyes around and saw that the car had been gutted. There was nothing in there.“The hairs on the back of my neck stood up, so I stuck my arm out through the crack in the window and managed to open the door from the outside.“I was so lucky.”In interviews, Harry claims that when the man saw her trying to open the car door he “tried to turn the corner really fast, and I spun out of the car and landed in the middle of the street.”In the band’s book, she then realised that the man could have been Bundy when she read a magazine article about him following his execution in Florida in .She wrote: “At the time I didn’t know anything about Ted Bundy.“I just thought, ‘Thank God I got away from that a*****e,’ and I just carried on - and years later, after he was executed, I got on a flight and picked up a Newsweek, and I’m reading this story, and it says Modus Operandi, and it describes how he looked, the inside of his cars, and the hair on the back of my neck once again went out, and I said, ‘Oh my God, that was Ted Bundy’.”However, it appears unlikely that the man in Harry’s story was Bundy.The notorious serial killer lived most of his le in the Pacic Northwest and committed murders in Washington State, Oregon, Utah, Colorado, and Idaho.His only known crimes on the east coast were in Florida in early  following his escape from prison in Colorado in late-.However, Bundy did live nearby New York in  while studying and living with his grandparents in Philadelphia – the state he was born in.While his first confirmed kill was in , it is widely accepted that the depraved predator and necrophile could have murdered more women during the ‘s and early ‘s.In fact, Bundy told both a psychologist and then an attorney that he killed two women in Ocean City, New Jersey in .Both New Jersey and Philadelphia are short car journeys into New York City and it is highly likely that the killer would have visited Manhattan during his time on the east coast.There are still questions marks surrounding his movements in the early s as Bundy was known to fall ‘off the grid’ while hunting women.It is entirely possible he could have visited his grandparents in Philadelphia – which is only a two hour journey into New York - in the early ‘s.Bundy was also known to travel great distances and cross state lines to kill women, dispose of their bodies and then to revisit their decaying corpses to have sex with them.But Harry’s description of Bundy’s car has also been called into question by website Snopes.While the killer was known to remove the passenger seat of his infamous light-brown Volkswagen Beatle – which enabled him to lay bodies down flat - he is never known to have stripped most of the interior of his car out.Harry has confirmed in subsequent interviews that the car she escaped from was not a VW Beatle.The Blondie singers book Face It will be released on October .Bundy confessed to more than  murders across several states in the s but experts estimate the real number could exceed .Here are some of the victims we know about...Washington, OregonFebruary : Lynda Ann Healy March : Donna Gail Manson April : Susan Elaine Rancourt May : Roberta Kathleen Parks June : Brenda Carol Ball June : Georgann Hawkins July : Janice Ann Ott July : Denise Marie Naslund Utah, Colorado, IdahoOctober : Nancy Wilcox October : Melissa Anne Smith October : Laura Ann Aime November : Debra Jean Kent January : Caryn Eileen Campbell March : Julie Cunningham April : Denise Lynn Oliverson May : Lynette Dawn Culver June : Susan Curtis FloridaJanuary : Margaret Elizabeth Bowman January : Lisa Levy February : Kimberly Diane Leach Survivors include...January , : Karen Sparks November , : Carol DaRonch January , : Karen Chandler January , : Kathy Kleiner January , : Cheryl Thomas "},{"url":null,"title":"lightwater valley twister theme park accident news","story":"Stunned eyewitnesses reported seeing the boy fall from the Twister ride at Lightwater Valley theme park near Ripon, North Yorks.One witness said the youngster slid out and over the top of the carriage before falling ft to the ground.According to a dad at the scene, the boys mum was screaming hysterically as he was hanging backwards out of the carriage.It comes  years after Durham University student Gemma Savage, , died when two carriages collided on the same Twister ride.Simon Moran, a dad who was visiting the park today, tweeted: Just saw a kid fall off the Twister rollercoaster at Lightwater Valley.He mustnt have been strapped in right, or too small for the ride.As it went down the fast bit towards the souvenir camera, he slid out and over the top of the carriage.Fell face down about  ft to the ground.Cops and the ambulance service rushed to the scene and the ride was shut down following the shocking incident during half term.The young boy was transported to Leeds General Infirmary and is being treated for non-le threatening injuries.Passengers are strapped into the ride by a lap bar and one witness said he saw the boy was outside of the restraints.A police officer who went on the ride yesterday claimed he and his son were given the option to wear an extra safety belt.Mark Charnley, , was at the park with his we and two daughters when he saw the boy hanging backwards from the carriage as his mum screamed hysterically.He told Sky News: I was in the queue for a ride called Twister with my -year-old daughter.We looked up and saw a young lad he was hanging backwards outside of the actual carriage.Hed obviously got himself out of his restraint somehow and seconds after that he actually fell out of the actual carriage to the floor.I actually lost sight of him and I couldnt see him after that because there was mechanical electrical equipment in the way, I lost him after that.DO YOU KNOW THE FAMILY INVOLVED  Call  or email tips-sm@newsEverybody in the queue started shouting to the operator of the ride to shut it down because he hadnt actually noticed what had gone on.Maybe ,  seconds after that he actually realised what had happened to close the machine down.People in the queue where I was actually started ing over, two guys actually ed over the barriers to get to the lad who was on the floor.He added: He was in the carriage with his mum, who was screaming hysterically.In , Durham University student Gemma Savage, , died after a collision on the same Twister ride.Two years ago, the park was fined £, after a five-year-old girl suffered horric injuries when her leg became trapped on its Ladybird ride.The girl’s leg became trapped between the  edge and the carriage in June .She had been visiting her family in North Yorkshire after travelling from her home in New Zealand.The girl suffered ligament, cartilage and nerve damage.In , a deer was killed after being hit by the park’s Ultimate ride – the longest in Europe.According to official figures, the park attracted , visitors in .Lightwater Valley -

Now he has saidParliament is still deadlocked once a new Tory leader gets into  Downing Street, the decision will have to go back to the public. By that he meant either an election or a second referendum. But Mr Hammond also said a general election may not be able to resolve the question because the main parties are so ided. That would only leave a second referendum. On the subject of a second referendum he said: I’m not going to commit myself today to that. But he added: If Parliament can’t resolve it then Parliament will have to decide how we remit it back to the people, whether it is in the form of a general election or a referendum.    And he told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: It will be a stain on parliament’s reputationin the end we have to admit that we’ve been unable to agree how to discharge that mandate from the people. If we do get to the point that parliament has to admit it cannot resolve this issue then clearly it will have to be remitted back to the people. I’m not sure that a general election can resolve the question, for the simple reason that both the main political parties are ided on the issue. This is a ision that runs not between the parties but within the parties. Mr Hammond is expected to be sacked as Chancellora hard Brexiteer PM comes to power. If he came out in favour of a second referendum he would be the most high-profile Tory to do so.

The Labour leader appeared to be inching closer to a so-called Peopleaposs Vote last night, when he said the only way out of the Brexit crisis ripping our country apart is now to go back to the people.In the comments released overnight, he added: Let the people decide the country’s future, either in a general election or through a public vote on any deal agreed by parliament. For Labour any outcome has to work for our whole country, not just one side of this deliberately inflamed ide. The pro-referendum TSSA union and Peopleaposs Vote campaign claimed Mr Corbynaposs intervention was a step towards a ballot on Brexit. But it prompted other union allies, including Dave Ward of the CWU and Len McCluskey of Unite, to warn Mr Corbyn against a second referendum.    And interviewed at lunchtime today, Mr Corbyn stressed a a public vote is still some way off - adding he doesnapost back a re-run of the  referendum. Mr Corbyn said: “If Parliament comes to an agreement then it’s reasonable,Parliament wishes it, there should be a public vote on it. “But that is some way off. The important thing now is to prevent this government, which doesn’t have a majority, which is incapable of legislating, from leading us into crashing out of the EU at the end of October. He added: The referendum would be on a negotiated deal or alternatives to that. Itaposs not a rerun of . Mr Corbyn met Irish premier Leo Varadkar today in Dublin, where they shared their serious concerns about the dangers of no-deal Brexit.    A spokesman for Mr Varadkar said the pair held detailed discussions on Northern Ireland, Brexit and the current political situation in Westminster. Labouraposs leader also met President Michael D Higgins at Aras an Uachtarain. Mr Corbyn was shielded from the media on his way into Government Buildings. The Labour leader has been under intense pressure to explicitly back a referendum on Brexit after the EU elections saw his party suffer heavy losses. Divisions were inflamed by the decision to expel Blairite Alastair Campbell for voting for the Lib Dems - helping them clinch second place. TSSA General Secretary Manuel Cortes said Mr Corbynaposs commitment to go back to the people was a “massive step forward”. He added: “We really welcome Jeremyaposs unequivocal commitment to a public vote on any Brexit deal in the absence of a general election and doing whatever it takes to stop a no-deal Brexit.  “This is a massive step forward for our Party which will delight our members and voters alike.  “However, in the interest of straight-talking politics, we also need to clearly spell out that Labour will campaign in favour of Remain in any public vote. And, should we get into government before that time, we will remain committed to giving the people of our country the final say on Brexit.” Labour MP Bridget Phillipson of the People’s Vote campaign said her leader was at last beginning to listen to what our voters and members are saying. She added: There is no immediate prospect of a General Election. That is why it is now vital Labour follows through on its clearly stated conference policy by campaigning for the only available fair and democratic solution to the Brexit crisis – a People’s Vote that gives the public the final say.” Last night Labouraposs deputy leader Tom Watson claimed % of members and supporters he surveyed wanted an all-member ballot to decide Labouraposs policy. As deputy leader Iaposll support them to make this happen, he added. But Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said Labour was not signed up to a second referendum at all.  He told ITV: In fact my message to the Labour Party is, don’t be spooked by these Euro elections. This is a time to be calm, yes we need to reflect on where we are but all the Euro election results told us was that we have a ided nation. We knew that anyway. In many respects this is the second referendum that people have been looking for.” And CWU general secretary said that while Labour needs to “jump off the fence”, I don’t think we should be backing a second referendum. Instead he called for “soft Brexit, telling Sky News: My concern is I’ve become increasingly concerned with the attitudes of some people who are trying to turn this into some sort of culture war. I think this is very very dangerous, it’s playing into the hands of the Brexit Party, the likes of Tommy Robinson. It’s abandoning working class people and not listening to their concerns. That is the biggest threat to getting Labour elected.

The former work and pensions secretary was asked about the ongoing dispute in Birmingham where parents are protesting the introduction of new relationship education. Ms McVey said she believed parents should be able to take their children out of such lessons. She said: Iaposm being very clear: the final say is with the parents andparents want to take their young children - thataposs primary school children - out of  certain forms of sex education, relationship education, then that is down to them.  But she said it was wrong for parents to be protesting outside primary schools. The Tory hopeful was asked about the issue after mediation at one of the schools at the heart of the row broke down. Talks between parents and staff at Anderton Park Primary School in Sparkhill, Birmingham have stalled according to Nazir Afzal, a former chief prosecutor for North West England, who has been recruited to ensure dialogue remains open between mums, dads and teachers.    Anderton Park Primary School staff are breaking down in tears because of hostility at the school gates, he claimed. Relationships education is due to become statutory in all schools in England from September .  Ms McVey told Sky: I believe parents know best for their children and whilst theyaposre still children, and youaposre talking there in primary schools, then really the parents need to have the final say in what they want their children to know. But she said she opposed protests being organised outside schools. She added: People shouldnapost be protesting outside primary schools - thataposs young children going into school there. Everybody has to be a little bit more adult, a little bit more grown up in what they do there. Tory MP Justine Greening hit back at her colleague saying: You can’t pick  choose on human rights  equality. The first openly gay female MP in cabinet said on Twitter: Children should understand a modern  erse Britain they’re growing up in. Matters for social mobility too - you can’t be your bestyou can’t be yourself. Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd retweeted Justine Greening with the comment: Quite right. A modern Tory Party should not just be proud of our LGBT achievements, but champion them.New curriculum guidelines on sex education will introduce dedicated lessons about sex and relationships, and explain how pupils can stay safe online and look after their own mental health. Children will learn the link between physical and mental health, with lessons focused on the importance of getting enough sleep, the dangers of sexting, and spotting anxiety among their friends. Secondary school pupils will also be taught about female genital mutilation, grooming, forced marriage and domestic abuse, as part of a strengthened curriculum, the Department for Education said.  Education Secretary Damian Hinds said three new subjects will form part of the syllabus in England from  - relationships education from primary, relationships and sex education at secondary schools, and health education lessons will be given to all children. It will be left up to schools to decide exactly how to teach the new content.    Primary - Primary school children will be taught relationships education but it will focus on the characteristics of positive relationships with particular emphasis on friendships, family relationships, and relationships with other children and with adults.

This may well be what some of those round Corbyn want, apparatchiks who weren’t Labour when they joined his kitchen cabinet, and don’t behave like they are now. A hasty “review” of the rule that demands so-called auto-expulsion for supporting another party is under way. Good. A useful fig leaf behind which to retreat.

The far right is on the march in Britain and around the world. We shouldn’t roll out the red carpet for a man who deliberately spreads hatred and ision. What’s more, a dodgy trade deal with Trump’s America poses a threat to our public services. American big pharma corporations can’t wait to get their greedy hands on our NHS. They’d love a deal to weaken our cost control and drug approval systems. That way, they can flood the health service with more expensive, less tested medicines. Because, in the eyes of big pharma, managing the price of medicine isn’t a sensible way to ensure that even the poorest can live long and healthy lives. It’s an unfair government attack on big businesses’ freedom to make bumper profits. We’ve all seen how this plays out on the other side of the Atlantic. More than  million people are not protected by health insurance at all and working families pay huge premiums just to get basic care.    Ordinary people are literally being cheated out of healthcare so that super-rich executives can rake in the billions. This kind of healthcare system is inhumane. And it has no place in Britain. So it’s never been more important to stand up for our NHS and demand that any future trade deals include cast iron guarantees for public services. Trump will back the corporate giants all the way. And with right- wing Tory candidates queuing up to become our next prime minister, the British side of the table might not even put up much of a fight. No matter how you voted in the Brexit referendum, no one voted for the dismantling of our NHS, or for other services to be sold off to corporate vultures. For too long, the Brexiteers have been living in fantasy land. They’ve sold  promises, claiming that the UK can easily negotiate dozens of trade deals without making any concessions to much more powerful economies. In reality, we face a clear choice. On one side, there’s a trade deal with Trump- land, served with sides of chlorinated chicken and hormone-fed beef. On the other, there’s sticking with the rules of the single market. It’s not perfect but it would protect jobs, rights at work and consumer standards. And, whatever happens next week we need to send a clear message to Trump – and to any UK politician who might want to cosy up to him – that our NHS is not for sale.

Ron Stevenson, , was diagnosed with motor neurone disease  years ago and relies on moderate weekly care payments to supplement his care. But last month, Ron received a letter from the Department of Work and Pensionscalling for him to reapply for his benefits because he is up for reassessment. He says the letter told himhe did not reply his payments would stop on July . Former special needs teacher Ron is almost completely paralysed, leaving him reliant on carers and his we Gill. Those in his position can claim up to £ a week in Personal Independence Payments to ease suffering and care. Grandfather Ron, of Staplefield, West Sussex, but originally from Lancashire, called the call for reassessment devastating. Do you have a benefits story  Email webnews@mirror    He said: The letter saidyou do not reply then on July  your payments will stop. Obviously Iaposm aware that this is something that can happen, but it was still a shock. People with motor neurone disease never get better - there is only one outcome and that is death. Anyone with a grain of sense wouldaposve realised anyone paralysed and le limited as I am cannot be anything other than eligible.    After weeks of worry, Ron and Gill, , contacted the DWP by phone to set the record straight. He said: The following day I got news back saying that the DWP is looking at the case and I would receive a letter. I rang my GP for my DS form - which is the form that states the patients will die within six months. Ron was contacted by the office of MP Nicholas Soames and reassured that after speaking with the DWP, his payment would continue.  He said: This inidual case does not cover all the others with the condition - not everyone has the support that I do. Some will look at the letter and think aposoh my Godapos, they have lost their benefits, imagine the disconsolation. The DWP contacted Ron by letter on Wednesday, more than a month after his call, to confirm he will be getting his benefits for three more years -he lives long enough. When asked about this further reassessment, a DWP spokeswoman said: This will be a letter saying has his condition changed. She was then reminded that Ronaposs condition is terminal, to which she said these are the rules we have to follow.  According to the Motor Neurone Association, there are , people suffering with the degenerative condition in the UK. The report also estimated the cost to a family of having to live with MND as £, each year. Father-of-two Ron said the crazy situation of reassessment for motor neurone sufferers must be addressed. He said: We were promised by the government that the reassessment for benefits would stop in  - this has been broken. Iaposm working to raise awareness, we wonapost stop fighting, despite the fact the disability is fatiguing. I have lost the use of my limbs, but I shall use my voice, while my friends can no longer.  Most motor neurone disease sufferers die within two to five years of diagnosis, and it is the condition that claimed the le of renowned physicist Stephen Hawking. A DWP spokesperson added: Our thoughts are with Mr Stevenson at this dficult time and we are sorryour notication letter caused him distress. We fast track reviews to confirm support for people in his situation, which can be done by the medical professional on their behalf, and we continue to pay Mr Stevenson the higher rate of PIP without a break.

The disgraced former cop was jailed in , for four-and-a-half years, after admitting sharing horric images of child abuse online, with then-girlfriend Sharon Campbell. The perverted couple, who described themselves as no limits pedo couple, especially love newborn baby plotted to conceive a baby together so they could abuse it, a court heard. McCracken said he wanted to breed a baby boy to abuse as soon as born, and would deffo rape a little baby girl.    He admitted three charges of possessing and distributing indecent images of children at Ayr Sherf Court, and was released in December . But a source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, questioned why McCracken was allowed to live so close to a school after being released. Shadow Justice Secretary Liam Kerr said it was aposshocking...the fact someone guilty of such a horric crime is free to walk the streets at allapos. A source said: I donapost understand why he was able to get flat by a school. Heaposs still denying what heaposs done. His family are still choosing to believe him.

Both McCracken and Campbell were each given ten-year Sexual Offences Prevention Orders, and both were put on the sex offenders register indefinitely. McCracken and Campbell each have one child from previous relationships who they were banned from seeing at the time of sentencing, when they were also banned from using any device which would give them access to the internet. Scottish Conservative shadow justice secretary Liam Kerr said: Obviously iniduals like this have to be housed somewhere.

I could see the whole left side of my face begin to sort of fall away or melt away - it was lopsided by the time I was a teenager.    My left leg was not growing as quickly as my right. It was affecting the amount of muscle and tissue I had on that side of my body - that side is still thinner. My family told me not to care about what people thought, or how I looked. That didnapost stop me from covering the left side of my face with my hair because I was sad. School kids would sometimes laugh or stare but I would try and avoid situations by walking around them or crossing the road. Now I can hold a conversation with someone again. I can walk down the street and not care what anyone who looks at me thinks. I can look someone in the eye again. In my view,you can find someone to help, you should do it.    Though it can lie dormant for years, Parry-Romberg syndrome can be triggered by a trauma, and Karla said hers came on just after having MMR booster vaccine. Parry-Romberg syndrome is incredibly rare and there is no evidence to suggest it is caused by vaccinations. She was was an ordinary girl with no apparent health issues before she was rushed to Old Church Hospital, Romford, for treatment for a convulsion. I donapost remember much about it anymore, but I can remember walking around the hospital on a drip for a while, she said. Karla underwent a painful transition as the disease started to attack one side of her body and slowly began to spread to the other.  When I was five, I couldnapost wear certain shoes because it was so painful, she said. Shoes were and still are the only clothing I struggle with. After years of testing, Karla was eventually diagnosed with Parry-Romberg syndrome, and was prescribed a strong chemotherapy agent to stop it spreading. The disease had caused her spine to curve sideways as her right side grew more quickly than her left. At one point, she was told she could be in a wheelchair before she turned . When she was , the doctors drilled through Karlaaposs right knee to stop the growth on her right side and to correct her twisted spine.  And two years later, she had reconstructive facial surgery which went wrong, leaving Karla with damaged facial nerves and deep scars. The operation failed - it killed all the nerves in my face and I have no feeling in my face, she said. It sounds extreme, but I had to learn to eat and to drink again. Apart from the scars, you couldnapost tell that Iaposd had anything done. Karla became depressed, hiding her face and shying away from the camera and mirrors to cope with what had happened. Though her family supported her, she felt alone. It was harder when I was younger, though, because they would want me to be happy, she said.  They rooted for me - but they also willed for me to be something I wasnapost. Karla had jaw surgery aged  and a surgical fat transfer - known as grafting - to fill out her face aged . Karlaaposs confidence was at an all-time high, and she showed off her personality and her face by having her hair cut shorter. She started dating, and is smitten with boyfriend Luke, a project manager from Woodham. But what Karla really hopes is that she can inspire other Parry-Romberg sufferers to pick themselves up and take pride in their appearance. There must be other people suffering like I did - but Iaposve not met anyone with it yet. Iaposve always wanted to do well in le, Iaposve always wanted to prove people wrong.

She shared a short clip of five very organised shelves in her pantry, all filled with perfectly lined up rows of drinks and snacks. People were very concerned about how unhealthy it all was, with one even describing it as a heart attack in a pantry. One wrote: How tempting that all must be to make the adult feel organised but in fact that whole cupboard is full of really bad food and would be terrible for children to eat that and nothing , reports Mail Online .    Others were concerned that everything in the cupboard was processed and in long le packaging. Another parent said: Heart attack in a pantry. But some didnapost seem bothered by the content at all and just focused on the organised set-up. One wrote: I do not even own a pantry this would be bliss. Normally parents on social media are hugely impressed by organised photos, and one mum was widely praised for her incredible meal prep earlier this year. She put us all to shame by chopping a YEARaposS worth of vegetables for her family to save herself time every evening. Her freezer is now stuffed full of zip-lock bags containing an incredible kg worth of veg.  Her stash includes, kg of potatoes, kg of carrots, kg of sweet potatoes and kg of tomatoes as well as courgettes and pumpkins. The former chef splashed out £ on the vegetables at a wholesale market and says she will use it all in the months to come, reports the Sun . Posting on Facebook , she writes: Veg prep for what feels like the next year. Carrots: sliced, roast chucks and chopped. Potatoes: chunks, sliced and diced for mash. Onions: sliced, chunks and onion rings.  I do it so I donapost have to waste time every night chopping up veg for dinner, as we all work and I have university and the two kids have after school sports.

The remains of two more elephants were found nearby, blood still pouring from where they had been blasted. And the majestic animals were killed in Zambia’s South Luangwa National Park – where they should be free to roam safely. A wildle investigator on a routine patrol stumbled across the harrowing sight, which is sadly all too familiar to him. “On a daily basis, we are losing prestigious God-given wildle to poachers,” says the officer who took the upsetting images. “The park loses wildle species nearly every day because of poaching. They want the ivory, leaving the body to waste away.    “Whenever I look at these images, I feel so sad. I love and value wildle. I’ve been doing conservation work for  years.” He remains anonymous to protect himself and his family, like many wildle wardens and investigators. Figures this week show elephant poaching is down to % from % – but experts warn their numbers are falling. Many wardens risk their lives by going undercover to snare poachers but there is often not enough evidence to nail them. So teams from the UK are now training investigators in wildle forensics to help boost convictions.    We joined TRACE Wildle Forensics Network, Traffic and their partners at the Netherlands Forensic Institute to see how they are helping. “Tackling the illegal wildle trade is an immediate need. We’re losing bioersity on a timescale shorter than climate change,” says Dr Rob Ogden, programme director at TRACE Wildle Forensics Network and head of conservation genetics at Edinburgh University. He is leading the course on the park’s outskirts and adds: “Wildle forensics is delivering the evidence to prosecute criminals but it must be available more widely and used more effectively.”  In two weeks,  senior investigators from the Departments of National Parks and Wildle in Zambia and Malawi, plus lab staff from the Victoria Falls Wildle Trust in Zimbabwe, learn how to take and preserve evidence. Dr Ogden, , says: “The forensics we do is dferent to traditional human forensics. Usually, with human crime, we know crime has been committed because somebody’s reported it, or somebody’s dead. We try to reconstruct what happened.  “In wildle forensics, you often know who’s involved as you’ll intercept somebody carrying something or someone selling something they shouldn’t be. But you need to prove whether a crime has been committed. So we use the analysis of wildle evidence. “We use scientic analysis because we can’t always identy things visually. To prove a crime has been committed, we need evidence to suggest whether it was a protected species or not.” During the course, funded by People’s Postcode Lottery, the European Commission and USAID, Dr Ogden and his team mock up crime scenes. The investigators are taught how DNA can be obtained from almost any biological sample and it is hoped the training will help them link evidence found at poaching scenes and that collected when suspects are caught or trophies are discovered.  Dr Ogden says: “The sample types with the most DNA, blood and tissue, also degrade quickest, so they are not always useful. Samples such as ivory or bone are harder to analyse but store DNA for years. Samples are sent to the lab for genetic analysis, starting with DNA extraction.” As they examine the fake crime scenes, one investigator tells me what he is up against. He says: “One night we heard a gunshot. It was total darkness and we couldn’t arrest them. They ran. At around am we found an elephant had died. “Those guys had tried to take the tusks off, they didn’t manage to. But the elephant was dead. There was nothing we could have done. What was the point  The elephant died for nothing.”  Poachers kill around , African elephants a year and there was a surge of ,% in rhino poaching in South Africa between  and . The global illegal wildle trade is worth an ­estimated £billion annually. This month, the presidents of Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia and Namibia called for an end to a -year ban on ivory sales imposed by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. And this week Botswana – home to the world’s largest elephant population, at , – said it would lt its ban on elephant hunting. Charles Mabethi, , was a wildle ranger for  years and is now a special prosecutor on game-related cases in Malawi. He once stepped in a gin trap during a patrol – a serrated metal animal trap hidden in long grass.  He says: “Poachers use gin traps. It’s a slow death. You can’t detect they’re there. The pain was indescribable. But this is a special job.” Mr Mabethi says despite stricter penalties on wildle crime since , prosecutors still struggle to get convictions. He says: “Poachers have caught on and because they are scared of the tough penalties, they lie and it becomes dficult to prove they committed a crime. “If we catch someone with bush meat, say an antelope, they will just say it is goat. “We have no way of proving they are lying. We don’t have the facilities, we have to send it to South Africa and that delays the case. By this point, they give bail and the poachers run away. It’s very frustrating. That is why this course is so vital. We hope it can be implemented in Malawi soon.” Mr Mabethi says another problem is in many cases, communities will support the poacher rather than the wildle rangers. He says: “They’ll come to the rangers with guns, axes, pistols. We are trying to change attitudes. It’s an ongoing process.” "},{"url":null,"title":"princess diana paris square named","story":"NewsPrincess Diana to have Paris square named after her above fatal crash sceneThe square is directly above the underpass where the crash that killed Princess Diana, her boyfriend Dodi al-Fayed and their driver happenedShareCommentsByRussell MyersPeter Allen:,  MAY NewsDiana was beloved the world over and dubbed the Peoples Princess \"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrincess Diana is to have a Paris square named after her above the scene of the accident which claimed her le  years ago. The tribute has already been agreed by officials in the French capital, and is now set to be ratied at a municipal council meeting on June . ‘It’s a testament to how much Paris loved Lady Di,’ said a Paris council source, using the affectionate name that the French still use for the late royal. Her official title when she died was Diana, Princess of Wales, and this will be reflected in the new ‘Place Diana Princess of Wales’. The square is directly above the underpass where Diana, her then boyfriend Dodi al-Fayed, and their driver Henri Paul all sustained fatal injuries on August , .    Just a month before, Paris council had passed a by-law calling the square by the Seine River ‘Place Marie Callas’, after the late opera singer who had died two decades earlier. It had also become famous for a gold Flame of Liberty statue depicting a detail of the Statue of Liberty in New York. Kensington Palace could not be reached for comment. The statue is meant to represent friendship between France and America, but after the Diana crash it soon became an unofficial memorial to her. It is still full of tourists and well wishers to this day, many of whom leave flowers and pictures commemorating Diana’s le.    At present there is no street sign indicating the name of Marie Callas, but this is likely to change for Princess Diana. The source said: ‘The Maria Callas square never really got going, because the square became associated with Diana so quickly. ‘There are other monuments to Maria Callas in Paris, but this will be the first official one to the Princess.’ Ingrid Seward, Editor in Chief of Majesty magazine said: “There are very few memorials to the late Diana Princess of Wales. “Even her sons have not been quite able to agree on exactly how her statue in Kensington Gardens is to be portrayed and the project has been delayed once again. “But in Paris there are steps afoot to rename a small plaza after her near to the Alma Tunnel in Paris where she was killed in a car crash in .    The plaza, currently named after the opera singer Maria Callas will change its namethe city council agree. They say it would be to honour the Princess and her humanitarian work. I don’t see anything wrong with this and I don’t think it is in bad taste as the plaza itself will become a tiny part of history. “If they so wish, people will be able to go there to remember Diana and there are too few places in the world to do that, even after over twenty years.” Diana was a regular visitor to Paris, and to the South of France, and was viewed by the French as a classic English rose. Despite this, subsequent mayors have struggled to get projects commemorating her off the ground.  A plan to build a £million garden to Princess Diana in the Marais district of Paris was abandoned in , and now it has now simply reverted to its original name – the Clos des Blancs-Manteaux. Limousine driver Henri Paul was found to have been drink-driving after the Diana crash, and pursuing paparazzi photographers were also partially blamed for the deaths. Despite British and French enquires ruling out foul play because of a complete lack of evidence, conspiracy theories about a murder plot persist to this day. A Paris City Hall spokesman confirmed that ratication of the decision to name the new square after Diana would be taken at a full council meeting being held between June  and .

He came in for harsh criticism after the - defeat and admitted he feared for his international future.However, Clarke revealed the Derby County-bound -year-old – who played through the pain of an ankle injury in the last two games of the Reds’ season – expressed his love for pulling on the dark blue of Scotland. The gaffer said: “Graeme’s had a great season for Aberdeen and got himself a great move to Derby County.“He’ll be disappointed he’s not going to be with a Premier League team, but it’s still a big move for Graeme.“He’s one of the few I’ve had a conversation with and he’s raring to go.“He said ‘I just love playing for my country’.”Scotland, who are fth in Group I, continue their qualying campaign against Cyprus at Hampden on June , before travelling to Brussels to face group favourites Belgium on June .Shinnie, who has been capped six times for Scotland, is leaving Pittodrie for Derby after agreeing a three-year deal with the Rams.The Pride Park outfit narrowly missed promotion to the English top-flight in Monday’s Premier League play-off final against Aston Villa .Meanwhile, McKenna’s inclusion in Clarke’s maiden squad came as no surprise.The -year-old has become a stalwart for both Aberdeen and his country, and captained the side against Peru last summer.Devlin was a more surprising call-up. The ex-Hamilton Accies skipper was set to make his international debut under McLeish, but was injured in training in November.As a result, the -year-old only made five starts since early November.All in, Clarke has included five uncapped players in his squad.The others are Livingston goalkeeper Liam Kelly and his former Rugby Park charges Stuart Findlay, Greg Taylor and Eamonn Brophy.Clarke said the time of year he is trying to shape his squad meant some of those he wanted to call up were unavailable, with others missing out due to injury.He said: “This squad of players all want to be here and that’s the main thing for me.“It’s dficult for the ones I called last week and tried to convince to cancel weddings that they’ve had organised for the last two years or whatever.“It’s really dficult to do that with people.“We have to be understanding that this is the squad that’s available and I think it’s a good squad.“Hopefully in the games you’ll see that.”Clarke said there are “conversations to be had on every single one of” the players missing from the contingent this time.Among the injured are Kieran Tierney and Ryan Christie , Callum Paterson , David Bates , Ryan Jackand Liam Cooper .Steven Fletcher has asked to be rested, while his Sheffield Wednesday team-mate Barry Bannan wasn’t considered for selection and John Fleckis set to get married on June . Players like Newcastle’s Matt Ritchie remain in international exile.Nevertheless, Clarke thinks he can get two results in his first two matches as Scotland manager, adding: “There’s enough talent in that squad to get results in both games, I’m convinced of that.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/05/2.43172331-1-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/05/2.43172331-1-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/05/2.43172331-1-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/05/2.43172331-1-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"wingers future to be hashed out","story":"Aberdeen have not given up hope of persuading Gary Mackay-Steven to sign a new deal at Pittodrie.Dons boss Derek McInnes has planned to hold talks with the -year-old this week in a final bid to convince him to stay.The Scotland international winger’s contract is set to expire on June .Mackay-Steven is wanted by MLS side New York City and has yet to make a decision on his future.The winger confirmed he was to discuss his future with his agent and family, but staying at Aberdeen remained a possibility.Now McInnes will hold talks in a final bid to try to convince Mackay-Steven to stay – or get closure on the matter one way or another.Mackay-Steven recently confirmed that whatever his decision, he will inform McInnes first out of respect for the Aberdeen manager.Although McInnes hopes Mackay-Steven will opt to remain, he has already been looking at other options should he leave.Losing Mackay-Steven would be another blow as winger Niall McGinn is set to miss the opening Europa League ties as he recovers from surgery on ankle ligament damage.However, winger Frank Ross is scheduled toafter a long-term absence due to a back complaint when the Donsfor pre-season in late June.Aberdeen will jet out to Cork in the Republic of Ireland where they will face Connah’s Quay Nomads of Wales in a friendly on Saturday June .Ross, who signed a new one-year contract with the option of a further  months on Tuesday, has not featured for the Dons since starting in the - draw at Hibs on August .McInnes said: “The likelihood is Frank will be back for pre-season.“Frank has had a really frustrating, dficult time with his injury and trying to get to the bottom of it.“It is his back. Sometimes with a lot of younger players they go through these growth stages and mature at dferent stages.“Hopefully with pre-season work he will be back and fully al.”McInnes faces a hectic summer transfer window that has been given more urgency with the looming Europa League fixtures.The Dons kick-off their Euro bid at the first qualying round stage on Thursday July .While Mackay-Steven’s future remains murky, the Dons have definitely lost captain Graeme Shinnie who has joined Championship Derby County on a three-year deal.Loan players Dom Ball , James Wilson , Max Loweand Greg Stewarthave also left.Defender Greg Halford has exited Pittodrie following the end of his short-term deal.McInnes has already opened up talks with Ball on the possibility of securing the versatile defender-midfielder on a permanent deal.Ball’s contract is set to expire with Rotherham, who have confirmed he will not be offered an extended stay.Striker Wilson will also be a free agent as his contract with Manchester United is set to expire on June .The Old Trafford club have opted not to initiate a one-year extension clause for Wilson.McInnes is keen to secure the striker on a permanent deal, but can only offer a fraction of the wages – reportedly £, per week – he has been on at Old Trafford. He would have to accept a massive wage drop to sign on at Pittodrie.However, it is understood Wilson is open to ato the Granite City.McInnes also wants to secure the loanof left-back Lowe from Derby County.Rangers have also made an approach to Derby with a view to securing the -year-old next season.Lowe has indicated thathe is to be sent out on loan he would prefer an Aberdeen .Meanwhile, McInnes had been keen on securing Stewart, who is also set to go out of contract at Birmingham.However, the attacker looks set to choose a permanent deal at Rangers.McInnes has also beaten Hearts to the capture of Motherwell striker Curtis Main.The -year-old’s contract is up at Well and a deal is close to being finalised for a move to Pittodrie.Aberdeen gaffer McInnes has also targeted afor former Aberdeen centre-back Ash Taylor.The defender is a free agent having had the final year of his contract at League Two Northampton Town recently terminated by mutual consent.Taylor, who spent three seasons at Pittodrie before leaving in , was recently in Aberdeen for talks."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 06","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsIn some ways it is like Groundhog Day, but yet again we are looking at severe cuts in health and social care services.At last week#s Kilmory meeting of the board in charge of these services # see page  # there was frustration at the pace at which these proposed cuts are being brought to the table.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

The weather was a challenge in itself due to the bitter cold, but the young people rose to the challenge and coped admirably.The climax of the weekend was the presentation of six Gold Chief Scout Awards to group members who have been working hard for four years to gain the highest achievement possible for a Scout. All six Scouts who gained the award have now started their careers in the Explorer section of the group.In late March members of the Scout and Explorer section joined with the Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation to undertake an Earth Hour Camp. During the camp the group discussed how the unit could reduce its impact on the environment and how these changes could be implemented. Plans are now afoot for a further event in May to create an installation that looks at the impact of plastic on the countryside.Most recently three of the leaders, David Smart, Anne Smart and John McCartan took the chance to abseil  feet off the Falkirk Wheel. This event had been organised by Scout Scotland and gave a chance to meet up with other participants from all over Scotland.Looking to the future the group has exciting plans for the summer.

Traditionally the Lordship was held by the MacDonald family.However, following disputes in the fteenth century the Scottish kings sought to curtail the MacDonalds’ influence, and in the s James IV sent a military expedition to sack Finlaggan. Many of the buildings at Finlaggan were destroyed at this time, and over the centuries that followed the site sank into relative obscurity.The reconstruction shows what Finlaggan may have looked like in its glory days when it was the seat of the Council of the Lords of the Isles, and the scene of inauguration ceremonies for the Lords.It depicts the twin islands of Eilean Morand Eilean na Comhairle , and their surroundings on Loch Finlaggan. Interestingly, by the late Middle Ages, the Lords of the Isles’ residence at Finlaggan had little in the way of defensive structures – possibly indicating how secure the MacDonalds felt in the heart of their powerbase on Islay.The reconstruction will be available as an interactive virtual reality experience at the Finlaggan Trust’s visitor centre on Islay. There is also a virtual reality app and an online video.Dr Bess Rhodes said: #Finlaggan was an amazing place to recreate digitally. Even today the islands of Eilean Mor and Eilean na Comhairle are beautul places, and in the Middle Ages they were the site of a remarkable complex of buildings which blended local traditions with wider European trends.#The work by Dr David Caldwell and the Finlaggan Archaeological Project has transformed our understanding of this site – giving us a glimpse of the relative comfort in which the Lords of the Isles and their followers lived, pampering their dogs with decorative collars, and enjoying music, imported wine and board games.#Dr Ray Lafferty, Secretary of the Finlaggan Trust, said: #Despite its impact on the shaping of Scottish culture, Finlaggan and the Lordship remains little known to many.#With this virtual reality reconstruction, we hope to give some sense of the site at the zenith of its power, when MacDonald rule stretched from the Glens of Antrim in Ireland to Buchan in the northeast of Scotland.#PICS:The Great Hall interior. no_aFinlagganReconstructionA general view of the islands. no_aFinlagganReconstructionA peaceful Finlaggan today # but it was not always so quiet. aFinlagganMedieval grave slabs among the ruins of Finlaggan. aFinlaggan"},{"url":null,"title":"three amigos clean up in lochgilphead","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFed up with the amount of rubbish left in the area, Flora Currie, Campbell Ferguson and Iain MacDougall # with support from staff at Lochgilphead Resource Centre # recently carried out a litter pick around the path known as Tesco lane near the resource centre.The collected all sorts of items, from polystyrene takeaway food boxes to bicycle frames.The message from the intrepid trio was: #We care about our environment.#"},{"url":null,"title":"dry spell restricts boats on crinan canal","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowDue to the continued exceptionally dry period of weather, and the impact on water resource on the Crinan reservoirs, Scottish Canals have issued the following notice to boat owners restricting passage.Vessels with Deep Draught: From close of business on Friday May  until further notice, Scottish Canals will be unable to offer passage to vessels with a FRESH WATER draught over .m.In addition to this, Scottish Canals would ask that those on passage conserve water by sharing locks with others.A spokesperson continued: #In particular we would ask that you maintain groups on the flights between locks five and  so that we may minimise the water drawn from the summit reach.#We may be required to hold single vessels for a short period to make effective use of the lock.

That was the purpose of a meeting of farmers, teachers and others interested in the countryside on May .Organised for the Edinburgh-based charity by the local branch of NFU Scotland, -plus people came along to the Inveraray Inn on a bright, chilly May evening.Making the journey west to spread the word were RHET chairman George Lawrie and executive officer Katrina Barclay, who outlined the structure and potential benefits of RHET.With its headquarters at Ingliston, RHET acts as an umbrella body, co-ordinating the existing dozen Countryside Initiatives around Scotland . Each CI is set up as a charity in its own right, with help and support from Ingliston.The point of each regional CI is to bring children closer to farming, forestry, aquaculture and other rural industries.Working with partners, the charity would deliver learning opportunities for young people aged three to  around the Scottish agricultural environment and the countryside.Examples of the activities undertaken by RHET include farm visits for schools classroom speaker talks by volunteer farmers providing free educational resource materials for schools outdoor education events across Scotland competitions and projects for schools and training farmers and teachers in the delivery of information relating to food and farming.Regional CIs are supported by co-ordinators, who will liaise with schools and nurseries, organise visits, carry out health and safety checks and make sure everything is in place for events like farm visits.Present at the meeting was Argyll and Bute Council#s Head of Education Anne Paterson.#I am really encouraged to hear about the work of RHET,# said Mrs Paterson.Emphasising the the importance placed on outdoor education by the local authority, she added: #We have a good history of farm visits in Argyll and Bute, but on a more informal basis. As an education service we encourage schools to be outdoors.Mrs Paterson concluded: #We are really keen to make it happen and to work in partnership with RHET.#George Lawrie, who has been involved with RHET for around  years, said: #What I find most rewarding in working with the young people is just seeing the smiles on their faces.#If you want to find out more, whether as a farmer crofter, education provider or are involved in any other land use or rural industry, contact Lucy Sumsion by email at lucy.sumsion@nfus.org.uk to express an interest.PIC:From left: NFUS Argyll and the Islands region chairnman John Dickson with George Lawrie and Katrina Barclay of Royal Highland Education Trust. _aRHETmeetingKatrina Barclay addresses the sizeable audience in the Inveraray Inn as George Lawrie looks on. _aRHETmeeting"},{"url":null,"title":"fynefest celebrates turning 10 with a beer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFyneFest s for , celebrating hitting double figures with as much flair as ever.Beer, food and music: what more could anyone ask for  And there#s going to be plenty of each at this unique event, held over four days from Friday May .As usual, the field will be filled with trucks serving everything from pizza to curry and cupcakes.

Customers in Vulnerable Circumstances recommends.The report, launched last year by industry body Energy UK and independently chaired by Lord Whitty, said the quality and availability of support ied widely across the sector, and even sometimes within the same company.The commission has recommended an independently monitored code of conduct for suppliers to drive up standards of support for customers in vulnerable circumstances.Other recommendations include systematic training for all frontline staff to help them identy and offer support to vulnerable households, and the industry working together to improve the effectiveness of the Priority Service Register.Firms should also make sure customers can contact them by phone, for free, and by letter.Lord Whitty said it was clear there were ldquohuge iations in the way energy suppliers, the Big Six and challenger companies, deal with vulnerable customers, ranging from ldquoreally good practice to examples of seriously insensitive treatment that fall far short of acceptable.He said: ldquoNobody likes to think of themselves as lsquovulnerablersquo but any one of us could become vulnerable in a heartbeat.ldquoA safe, reliable and affordable energy supply is such a fundamental need that it warrants particular focus, especially given the stress and anxiety it can cause when there are problems.ldquoWe also cannot ignore how changes in society are leaving increasing numbers of households in dficulty, often isolated and struggling to afford the essentials.ldquoBut our focus has been on what the energy industry can do itself, and in commissioning this report the industry has recognised the importance and challenge of improving standards in this area.ldquoWe now hope that they, together with government, the regulator and consumer bodies, will take the further step of putting our recommendations into practice and committing to making the support of all those in need a top priority.Energy UKrsquos chief executive, Lawrence Slade, said:ldquoOur sector is genuinely committed to going further to improve services for all customers, particularly those in the most vulnerable circumstances, which is why we established this independently-chaired commission and we have already committed to bringing forward a new vulnerability charter, that wersquoll be drawing up in coming months, to build on this report

Awaiting more information at this time regarding CCTV to identy those involved.ldquoSaturday: a young woman and father involved in an altercation with staff and police, with the woman being detained for safety reasons [and] a domestic altercation between a couple from the committee in one of the main bars, with security from site required to attend to defuse the situation.The statement continued: ldquoThe committee will take into consideration all actions on the next steps that the club will be required to make.ldquoI will be contacting Flamingo Land separately to raise our concerns on the handling of the matter to punish -plus people based on the actions of a few and the treatment.\"My sincere apologies for the distress caused to everyone.One committee member offered their resignation, posting on Facebook: ldquoI would like to apologise to everyone that was at Flamingo Land on behalf of myself and the other member of the committee that was involved in the Saturday night antics ndash this should never have happened and we canrsquot apologise enough.ldquoThis will be something that we will always regret and feel very disappointed about and, out of respect to all the kids, we will be looking to stand down from the committee.ldquoWe have been with the club for years and can honestly say that it is a great club please donrsquot let the mistakes of a few ruin the hard work that goes into running the club.One angry parent said that the adults involved in allegedly alcohol-fuelled incidents ldquoought to be ashamed of themselves, calling the behaviour ldquodisgusting.They added: ldquoNot for a minute did I think that the people that were in charge of a group of youngsters would have set such a shocking example.ldquoItrsquos embarrassing. Yoursquore meant to be the adults here.\"We parents sent our boys down for an experience and a good time, with great expense might I add, for it to get cut short in shocking and disgusting circumstances.And one online comment accused the chairman of ldquoblaming the kids.It said: ldquoPlease elaborate more on behaviour of some of [the] coaches etc instead of trying to blame the kids. Flamingo Land told me they have never thrown anybody out of the site as a group.ldquoA blocked toilet, while admittedly not great behaviour, would not get  kids thrown out of the resort. You all know the truth. Please be big enough to accept responsibility.ldquoTrying to blame -year-old boys is shameful. To be thrown off a resort is not the result of a few teenagers and you guys are well aware of it.However, there were also comments of support, with one person saying: ldquoI donrsquot think they are putting all on the blame on the kids. Theyrsquove apologised, thatrsquos all they can do.\"My son came home and all he could talk about was what a brilliant time he had, and I thank the coaches for allowing him to have that experience.Ferhan Ashiq, member of Prestonpans Community Council and current sponsor of the  team, said: ldquoPreston Athletic Youth FC are a fantastic team who work really hard every week to be the best they can be.ldquoI am saddened to hear that the adults who had accompanied the children acted irresponsibly and tarnished the good name of the club. They should have been setting an example for the children and not engaging in altercations.Chairman Alan Morgan told the Courier: ldquoThis is a club internal matter and will be managed by the club committee.ldquoThere are ongoing discussions with all parties involved."},{"url":null,"title":"new-name-for-merged-prestonpans-school-is-revealed","story":"The school is a merger of the current Prestonpans Primary and Prestonpans Infant Schools, and the new name was chosen by children, parents and staff.An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: ldquoPreston Tower is a familiar landmark in the town and a historical piece of architecture, with parts dating back to the th century.ldquoRespondents felt the tower and its situation within the town, halfway between the two school buildings, linked lsquothe old with the newrsquo and was a fitting representation of the schoolrsquos development.Suggestions for the new name were collected over a four-week consultation period from February to March.A transition group has been formed to consult with the wider school community on a logo and unorm arrangements.

He goes to bed with his T rex, plays with dinosaurs constantly and knows even the complicated names of lesser-known dinosaurs.However, we have tried very consciously to allow our kids to be who they are and resist the gender stereotyping that defines what a girl should be and what a boy should be.But here was my youngest daughter, at the age of five, clearly articulating the ision between girlsrsquo and boysrsquo toys.Her list was in line with the way toys are still marketed. Often there are two versions of the same thing, one for girls and one for boys.Even some story books are defined in this way, with images and colours which are used to reinforce the gender identity of the object evengender is not specically mentioned.Donrsquot get me wrong, I have no problem that my son loves dinosaurs.But I do have a problem with marketing directed at my children to force them into a narrow definition of what toys they should like based on a patriarchal version of gender.In truth, itrsquos not so much the toys themselves but the emotions and ways of being that are deliberately connected to them.Itrsquos the idea that boysrsquo stuff promotes bravery, toughness, being fierce and adventurous, while girlsrsquo stuff promotes cuteness, romance, beauty and love.It is changing and itrsquos much better than it used to be because there is so much more awareness and debate about this issue. Gender neutral marketing is more common now, mainly as a result of public pressure.But as the conversation with my daughter shows, we still have a way to go.But does it really matter  Is it just a politically correct obsession that is making a mountain from a molehill ldquoBoys will be boys, after all, and ldquogirls are all sugar and spice, and all things nice.It really matters, of course, and I think it matters just as much for my son as my daughters, perhaps even more so.That may be controversial, but I believe that as gender stereotyping is being challenged, it is often more dficult for boys to free themselves from the traditional definition of male identity than it is for a girl.I say this as a father of four girlsand one boy.Perhaps part of the reason for this is the fact that being male is still in many ways the privileged gender, and so there is an understandable focus on removing the restrictive definition of female roles which limit opportunities for women.But the struggle for gender equality has to be a two-way processit is to be ultimately successful.We must also unshackle our boys from the narrow definition of what it is to be male, a definition which still remains powerfully entrenched in our mindsets and the way society works.I personally suffered from this when at school. I was ldquosoft, sensitive, a daydreamer. I was often made to feel I was not a proper boy. There was no space for me to realise that the lsquoladdishrsquo way of being male was not the only way.Irsquom not advocating taking the dinosaurs away from my son and forcing him to play with a unicorn or Barbie doll. Even I loved dinosaurs when I was young. But it does mean allowing him, and yes encouraging him, to explore sides to his nature that society would still label as feminine: nurture, co-operation, make-up, dresses, dancing, looking after dolls and toys, and feeling vulnerable and being allowed to express it.The best way to encourage boys to express this part of who they are is through role modelling by other men, especially in the early years of childhood when a childrsquos brain is forming, and the childrsquos view of how the world works is being created.This includes how to treat others on a personal level.So nurture and care by male family members can be a crucial part of this. But one gender inequality we rarely hear about is the fact that men make up only two per cent of early years childcare workers. And this is an inequality not just for adults, but for our children.It conveys the message to young children that caring and nurture is not a manrsquos job or a male quality. So we grow up believing this is lsquonaturalrsquo.And this idea is so entrenched that there have even been examples of parents complaining that a man is working in a nursery!Looking after children is as much a manrsquos job as it is a womanrsquos. Or it should be, and seen to be. But itrsquos not just about work, or even childcare or parenthood. Itrsquos about ways of being and understanding that there are hundreds of ways to be a man or woman and we all have the right to make our own path.Thatrsquos why itrsquos important from the beginning to show that therersquos no such thing as boysrsquo toys or girlsrsquo toys: there are childrenrsquos toys.Or perhaps more accurately, to show the emotions and qualities traditionally associated with them are not gender specic.As always, children teach us. When we got home, Lewis put his T rex to bed. ldquoHersquos tired, he said, ldquoand hersquos a nice T rex.This was my lesson from my son: a T rex can be nice.He summed up the issue as only a child can."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-25-years-since-east-lothians-independence","story":"Twenty-five years ago this week, the Courier proclaimed the news with the headline: ldquoItrsquos independence for East Lothian.This week, East Lothian Council chief executive Angela Leitch said: ldquoThe Local GovernmentAct of  saw the abolishment of the two-tier Region and District Councils to be replaced with  unitary authorities across Scotland.\"I believe this has greatly benefited East Lothian communities, as responsibility for major services including education and social work were decentralised from Edinburgh and instead became the focus of political decisions at a more localised level.\"Over the years, our politicians have ensured ongoing investment in all of our towns and villages, providing facilities for local people, developing our infrastructure and continually working to improve the services we deliver. This has been recognised in a iety of inspection reports that have confirmed that East Lothian Council is a high performing council and has an ethos which recognises the importance of working closely with its residents and communities.\"Our elected members all live within the county, understand local issues and can ably represent the views of communities.\"Previously, some political decisions about our county were approved by people who had no real knowledge of East Lothian.\"Local government reorganisation has improved both local democracy and the ability of local people to hold the council accountable for the decisions it takes.Here, we take a look back at how we reported the news that the county had secured its place as a stand-alone local authority in the upcoming local government reorganisation:East Lothian has won the battle for independence.In a dramatic about face, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang has given in to the majority wishes of the population and decided it can stand on its own two feet.From , the district will once again become master of its own house as an all-purpose local authority.It means East Lothian councillors will be responsible for running a full range of services ndash from education and social work to rubbish collection and recreation.The Local Government Bill which will end the -year lespan of Scotlandrsquos network of region, district and island authorities is currently going through its final stages in Parliament.And earlier this week, Mr Lang ndash supported by local Labour MP John Home Robertson ndash tabled an amendment to give East Lothian the go-it-alone status it wanted.It was the high point in a hard-fought campaign by angry locals which began last year when the Government announced its original intention to lump East Lothian in with Berwickshire.But their success in fighting off that idea was not the end of the battle ndash they still had to persuade Mr Lang and his local government minister Allan Stewart that East Lothian was NOT too small to become an authority in its own right.They had also to force them to give up alternative plans to create an East Lothian-Midlothian-West Lothian authority ndash and more recently a proposal to merge East and Midlothian.As councillors and senior staff celebrated the announcement with champagne, [district] council chairman George Wanless smiled and said: ldquoWe are absolutely delighted with the outcome.He said it was dficult to say what eventually changed the minds of ministers.ldquoBut I have no doubt that the campaign the district council fought had a lot to do with it.He added: ldquoIf I was being charitable, I would say it was a case where the Scottish Office actually listened to the people for a change...It was, however, a ldquogreat decision for the people of East Lothian, who had supported the campaign from the start.ldquoI would like to thank all those who came out on the streets and took part in demonstrations in the early days of the campaign ndash and all those who wrote to Ian Lang in support of the idea that East Lothian should be an all purpose authority.Councillor Wanless totally rejected the previously-held Government view that East Lothian was too small to stand on its own.ldquoWe currently have a population of something like , and growing.ldquoBy the year  we could have at least , and my colleagues and I along with our officials are confident we can handle all the services that the new council will be responsible for.And he insisted: ldquoWe will do so in the same economic and efficient way the electorate have been accustomed to over the years.MP John Home Robertson said the White Paper to reform local government could have been the ldquodeath knell for East Lothian.ldquoBut people all over East Lothian fought back in a massive local campaign and we have won a magnicent victory.He paid tribute to Councillor Wanless and others who took part in the campaign, saying: ldquoWe have shown that public pressure can move even this Government.ldquoHowever, we are not out of the woods yet.ldquoLocal government is all about providing important services to local communities and we must continue to fight to ensure that East Lothian is properly provided with the funds it requires through revenue support grants.The councilrsquos Conservative group leader, the Rev Dr David Whiteford, said: ldquoI am very pleased that the Scottish Office ministers have listened to the electorate.ldquoThe view of the electors all along has been consistent ndash that East Lothian could and should be an all-purpose authority.ldquoI believe East Lothian has the capacity and potential to become an authority on its own and its staff are well capable of serving very well the needs of all the people.He added: ldquoI am very pleased that that message has now been accepted by the Scottish Ministers and that they have departed almost entirely from their original plan.ldquoLarge is not always beautul and I think we can do better on our own.He believed the transition to a stand-alone East Lothian council would be fairly simple.ldquoThe staff structures are already on the ground and all you really need to do is build on that.ldquoI do not anticipate a great deal of dficulty.ldquoIt is a challenge.ldquoIt is something that we should think through.ldquoWe have a new council coming into being and we should try to run it in a new style way.ldquoI hope councillors will concentrate on the needs of East Lothian people and will try and make that their main concern.Said SNP councillor George Thomson: ldquoEast

Gullane hosted the Scottish Open last year and it is coming back to East Lothian this year, to The Renaissance Club.ldquoThe US Kids Golf European Championship is another high-quality event and people love it, and love to come to it.Royal Musselburgh is hosting the biggest field of players, followed by Musselburgh, which is ready to welcome more than  young golfers for the second year running.With experience of hosting the event for the first time last year, Musselburgh GC is delighted to build on its success after positive feedback from the young golfers and their parents.Firm favourites nachos and burgers, among other dishes, are on the menu as the clubhouse team gears up to cater for hungry participants, their families and volunteers from the club who help with the organisation of the tournament.Ian Lockhart, Musselburgh Golf Clubrsquos US Kids Golf organiser, once again formed a working group to put an action plan in place ahead of the competition.He said: ldquoWe have got the same groups of players ndash boys aged nine, girls  and girls -.ldquoWe enjoyed hosting the groups last year. There were players from  dferent countries. You hope that they remember the course with fond memories and come back and play it as adults, and bring some friends to get the course better known throughout Europe.ldquoWhen you do it once, you hope to get asked again and we got fantastic feedback. The whole week went really well. Hopefully this is the start of a long relationship from our perspective.ldquoItrsquos not just about the tournament, itrsquos about trying to show children in Musselburgh that therersquos things going on and get them involved in golf, and keep them involved. It would be good to see some Musselburgh children playing in it at some stage.He said the golf club was delighted that the winner of the girlsrsquo competition last year, Pia Babnik, from Slovenia, triumphed in the Helen Holm Scottish Womenrsquos Championship at Royal Troon with a seven-shot victory.The honour of staging the US Kids Golf European Championship also adds to the clubrsquos past prestige as a venue for the Scottish regional qualier for The Open from  to  and final qualier in .Course manager Tommy Shepherd and his greenkeeping staff have been busy ensuring the course in is tip-top condition.He, along with head professional Norman Huguet, developed a new six-hole course last year, with financial support from Musselburgh Common Good Fund, on a former Musselburgh Rugby Club pitch at Shire Haugh at the end of the main golf course.Lockhart said this has been further developed to provide proper greens, adding: ldquoIt is definitely starting to take shape. The children are loving the small course which is much less intimidating."},{"url":null,"title":"european-election-snp-come-out-top-in-east-lothian","story":"With the results of the count in East Lothian announced last night, the SNP were way ahead with , votes, more than double the votes of the next closest party, the Liberal Democrats, who polled ,.In third place were the Conservatives with ,, narrowly ahead of the Brexit Party with ,.Just like across Scotland as a whole, Labours vote collapsed to see them finish fth.

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship.

As he saw it, they were to celebrate Scotlandrsquos strengths in arts, comedy, science and ldquothought. To reflect the countryrsquos ersity. To allow audiences ldquoto interrogate the things that matter to them and, along the way, to ldquoreinvent public service broadcasting. BBC Scotland, he stressed, would offer space for discussion and debate alongside opportunities to ldquokick back and have fun. It would be about the country speaking to itself but also to the world. It would be local, national and global.In other words it would be a lot of things to a lot of people. Or it would try to be. So, three months after its glitzy birth and with the numbers soon to roll over to Day  of its existence, how is BBC Scotland bedding in  What do audiences think of it  And how well is it measuring up to Hallrsquos lofty claims Steve Carson, BBC Scotlandrsquos Head of Multi-Platform Commissioning, is predictably bullish about its prospects and its track record. To his mind the station is about trying to take risks, giving a  to ldquoa strong range of voices and communities and doing ldquonew things and dferent things. So far the strike rate is good, he thinks. Among the successes he points to are Getting Hitched Asian Style, a documentary series following a wedding planning company in Glasgow, the opening night screening of Nae Pasaran , and Last Breath, a drama documentary about a North Sea er stranded on the sea-bed.Identying a stand-out is ldquolike naming your favourite child, he says. ldquoBut I think Asian Weddings is something I was pleased to see hellip It was quite straightforward but it got into communities you donrsquot often see and certainly donrsquot often see in that sort of context.For an example of risk-taking that paid off he points to Sink Or Skim, which took a fond look at the World Stone Skimming Championship held annually on the isle of Easdale in the Firth of Lorn.ldquoThatrsquos not a subject many channels would have commissioned, but it was a beautully made piece and it was funny watching it go out and looking at social media because people were going lsquoI canrsquot believe theyrsquore doing something about stone skimming. Is this part of their sport portfolio rsquo. But by the end of it the same people were going lsquoThat was really goodrsquo.Sink Or Skim was a one-off but The Peoplersquos News is a weekly discussion of topical events in which ordinary Scots go in front of the camera and have their tuppence-worth on topical events. Those featured might not have the political contacts of a Laura Kuenssberg, say, but they have something just as important: context. They represent the social and political views of people in a spread of communities distant from London and far removed from the Central Belt. Itrsquos another example of the channelrsquos guiding principle that BBC Scotland should be a  for discussion and debate and again itrsquos a programme that wouldnrsquot have aired anywhere .ldquoWe could have done a dferent version of this channel which would have been a lot less risky and done a lot more of what other channels do, says Carson. ldquoA Scottish version of BBC Four, for example, would have been a less risky proposition. But we already have that, so we felt it was important to try new things, go for harder to reach audiences and deliberately take risks knowing that not all of them ndash in fact many of them ndash wonrsquot pay off. Thats what wersquore about.So which risks havenrsquot paid off ldquoThatrsquos like naming your least favourite child, he says. ldquoI think the programmes that we have originated between pm and pm have had a tough time, but again our medium term strategy was not to originate as much there. The Nine has had ratings which have gone up and down, but wersquove always said thatrsquos a competitive slot. But on a digital channel ndash and wersquore already the biggest non-terrestrial channel in Scotland with a three per cent share, which is well ahead of projections ndash audiences will go up and down across the night and the week.:  years of rock and roll - and all that jazzIf therersquos a lightning rod for criticism, The Nine is it. An hour in , staffed by a team of presenters and journalists that numbers  ndash at least in the publicity shots ndash and fronted by Rebecca Curran and award-winning former ITN journalist Martin Geissler, itrsquos the stationrsquos flagship news programme.A lot rides on its wellbeing and it seems a little peaky. It was reported that on one day in late April viewing figures dropped to just . They picked up the following day, to , but even on April , the first day of the inquiry into the Clutha disaster, they couldnrsquot quite hit . From a first night high of ,, thatrsquos a signicant drop.ldquoThe Ninersquos average is signicantly higher than that figure and its reach, which is really important in news, is reaching a quarter of a million a week, Carson counters. ldquoItrsquos offering something dferent. If you wanted to point at a show which is something we wouldnrsquot have otherwise done, The Nine is it ndash an hour long news and analysis programme which looks at Scotland, the UK and the world through Scottish eyes.So is it simply the right show but in the wrong time slot ldquoWersquoll see. Nine orsquoclock is a competitive slot but there is a demand there and people are turning to it. The appreciation for The Nine is very strong and wersquore finding that across the board. You might get some programmes that donrsquot have huge average audiences but the appreciation is strong.In a front page story earlier this month, London-based broadsheet the Sunday Times quoted a BBC source who called The Nine ldquoa turkey. The same source added: ldquoYou canrsquot have a channel that nobody watches. Journalists like their output to be watched and it wonrsquot be long until some of the channelrsquos main talent head for the door. Another source spoke of a ldquopoisonous atmosphere in the newsroom causing behind-the-scenes tensions which could cause key staff to walk. True or   ldquoThat is not the case, Carson says bluntly.Among the keenest watchers of how BBC Scotland has fared over these first three months is Dr Lisa Kelly, a lecturer in television at Glasgow University.ldquoIrsquove been pleasantly surprised, she says. ldquoI think I probably wasnrsquot holding out much hope at the beginning, primarily due to the budget ndash pound million for programming isnrsquot much to play with in the television landscape.To put the budget in context, the BBC is spending nearly three times that amount on the new EastEnders set. But funding aside, Kelly is excited by the apparent focus on nurturing and showcasing new talent. Shersquos also impressed by the choice of programmes and pleasantly surprised at the internationalism of its outlook. One innovation she particularly welcomes is the Next Big Thing strand, which screens short films such as as Meet Me By The Water by Scots-Asian writer-director Raisah Ahmed.ldquoI think therersquos been quite a range of programming. It seems like they are trying to be erse in terms of their representation. So obviously you have Getting Hitched Asian Style and The Nine, which is trying to tackle current debates around issues of representation. So I think it has been quite successful so far.And does it matterratings are low for some programmes ldquoI donrsquot know that it does this early on. I think itrsquos important that we have access to original Scottish programming at a local and national level.There are other challenges, she thinks, besides ratings. One is establishing the channelrsquos identity. ldquoIrsquom not quite sure what its brand is yet in terms of how itrsquos selling itself. I noticed that before the launch it was targeting young people with this notion of fresh and original ideas, but I donrsquot know whether theyrsquoll be able to sustain that.Another is proving that the bold talk ndash of nurturing young talent, giving voice to dferent groups and communities, taking risks and tackling ersity ndash will be backed by bold actions.Wherersquos the Scottish Phoebe Waller-Bridge, for example  And how embedded is the commitment to ersity and inclusion, to actually hearing new voices and seeing dferent stories rather than it just being rhetoric with no change Theyrsquore questions for which Steve Carson has a ready answer. Sothe Scottish Phoebe Waller-Bridge was out there with a project she was aching to make, is he convinced he would find her and commission it ldquoI hope so. And I think we are finding quite extraordinary talent at all levels and also stretching people who might already have done one thing but are now doing something .

Produced by the Scottish ision of London-based Firecracker Films itrsquos a good example of the channelrsquos stated commitment to programmes which reflect Scotlandrsquos ersity.

Refreshingly free of Old Firm bias itrsquos fast becoming a Friday night staple for those fans of the Beautul Game who think subjects such as the on- and off-field shenanigans of Partick Thistle legend Chic Charnley or how Eriskay has one of the best pitches in the world are as worthy of discussion as whorsquoll be the next manager of Real Madrid.

Letrsquos not take it too far, though: Wonderball is not, as right-leaning tabloid the Daily Mail has suggested, the worst show of its type ever aired, eventhat paper might like it to be. But you canrsquot say that those who have pointed out its flaws ndash the somewhat complicated rules, say, or the unintentional snigger value of two young men being instructed to play with the blue balls ndash donrsquot have a case. It hasnrsquot been a ratings hit either, with viewership dropping as low as  for one episode. Verdict: not utterly pointless, but not likely to become the next Pointless.The NineA team of talented and accomplished presenters, a  minute running time and a news agenda that blends hard-hitting investigations with quirky or thought-provoking items hasnrsquot stopped BBC Scotlandrsquos flagship news programme taking considerable flak from some quarters. Earlier this month one newspaper talked of a ldquotalent exodus from the channel and quoted a BBC insider who called The Nine ldquoa turkey. Damage has undoubtedly been done as a result: negative news stories about behind-the-scenes tensions and potential resignations may not be true, but they contribute to a narrative of failure which becomes hard to shake over time. What is true is that ratings for The Nine have been disappointing on occasions, though in mitigation its time slot doesnrsquot help.

These geriatric king-makers intend to install a leader in Nigel Faragersquos image, preferably Boris Johnson. He or she will then propel the UK into the self-inflicted turmoil of a No Deal Brexit.This is madness. Yet Scottish voters will be left watching this doomsday clock tick away inexorably till their economic welfare is sacriced on the altar of Brexit on Halloween. The prospect of No Deal may inspire a wartime spirit among Brexit voters, but the vast majority of Scottish voters see this as an act of wilful self-harm by a political elite who have lost the plot.The Scottish Governmentrsquos chief economic adviser says that No Deal could cost Scotland pound billion in less than a year. This on top of possible food and medicine shortages, and transport disruption as the UK severs its settled relations with its biggest trading partner. The longer-term impact of tarfs and lost markets could, according to the Scottish Government, cost , jobs in Scotland.Project fear  Perhaps. But not even the most starry-eyed Brexiter believes that No Deal would be cost-free. The question is: what can the Scottish government, and Holyrood, do to prevent this  Nicola Sturgeon says she wants an independence referendum in late , but by then, the damage will already have been done.I have argued against an advisory referendum on independence for the obvious reasons: Unionists would boycott it and Westminster would ignore it. But the way things are going, there may not be time to wait around for a Section  Order that never arrives. The situation is becoming critical.The Scottish Parliament needs to think carefully today about how it intends to respond to the reckless behaviour of the governing party in the UK.Gone are the visions of a smooth and orderly transition to Brexit, negotiated in goodwill with Brussels. Theresa Mayrsquos likely successors ndash Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab, Esther McVey ndash are behaving like intoxicated football fans before an away match. ldquoCome on you Brussels they slur, ldquo you think yoursquore hard enough.Even those who would prefer negotiation, like the Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, are being swept way by No Deal fever. No sooner had he said that leaving without a deal would be ldquopolitical suicide than his rivals were vying with each other to don the suicide vest. They yearn for a breakdown in relations with Europe, the better to express their pugnacious nationalism.Theresa Mayrsquos EU Withdrawal Deal, which took two years to negotiate, is dead and another cannot be renegotiated before the end of the current Brextension on October . In fact, one of the conditions of the extension, we now learn, was that the Withdrawal Agreement would not be reopened. There is, as Britainrsquos first female prime minister put it, no alternative.Anyway, there wonrsquot be a Brussels to negotiate with because both the President of the Council and the President of the European Commission are standing down and their successors wonrsquot be in place until November when Britain will already have left.This means Britain is heading like an express train for a clf-edge Brexit in five short months. And, as things stand, Scotland will be dragged over the precipice along with the rest of the UK. The game plan in the Brexit Bunker is for Prime Minister Boris, or whoever, to ignore Parliament, sit tight, and allow Britain to crash out by the remorseless legal logic of Article .Read more: Nicola Sturgeon plans for indyref next yearMany hope that Westminster will get its act together and block this ndash I certainly do. But there is no guarantee that our shell-shocked and confused MPs will be able to organise a successful no confidence motion to bring down the next prime minister and seize control. Nor is there a majority in Parliament for a repeat referendum, evenLabour were to persuade its dithering leader, Jeremy Corbyn, that it should support one. He says hersquoll think about it in September.Sothe House of Commons is now being held hostage by the Brexit revolutionaries, what can Holyrood do to save the day  Today, Nicola Sturgeon will unveil her bill for a repeat referendum, not on Europe, but on Scottish independence. However, todayrsquos bill does not actually legislate for Indyref . It merely provides the technical framework for a referendumand when Westminster agrees to make it legally binding by passing a Section  order. And the chances of that happening are precisely zero.For a start there is no prime minister to receive a Section  request. Theresa May has been reduced to the status of a piece of constitutional furniture for Donald Trumprsquos state visit. Her successor will be even less likely to contemplate breaking up the UK before the UK has departed from the EU. In fact, the prospect of any UK prime minister, Labour or Tory, agreeing to a Scottish referendum until well into the next decade seems remote.Yet, the case for a repeat referendum on Scottish independence is surely stronger than the case for the repeat Brexit referendum now advocated by Labour and the rejuvenated Liberal Democrats. Scots were told in  that only by remaining in the UK could they be sure of remaining in the EU. Now they are faced, not just with leaving Europe against their will, but crashing out of it in the worst possible terms. Material changes in circumstances donrsquot come much more material than this.Enough already. It may be necessary to advance the independence timetable and seek a test of Scottish opinion this autumn. At the very least, an advisory referendum would place on record that Scotland does not go willingly into the Brexit night."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  Do not rush to judge Theresa May or any other leader","story":"The answer, of course, might be a bit of all three, and a lot more besides. Right now, the only thing that can be said with confidence is that itrsquos far too early to deliver a verdict on her tenure as prime minister. Only after a considerable passage of time, when emotions have cooled, and events moved on, will it be possible ndash and fair ndash to assess her role with honesty. Historical evaluation requires distance and dispassion. And, while that sometimes allows appreciation of hitherto under-rated and admirable aspects of a personality, it often also results in a more damning perspective.That said, future researchers seem unlikely to unearth anything exceptionally salacious about Mrs May in the archives. On that front she can sleep easy. Recent revelations about Martin Luther King, on the other hand, by his Pulitzer prize-winning biographer David Garrow, threaten to damage his reputation beyond repair. Almost overnight he has been transformed from charismatic political and spiritual leader to disgraceful sexual predator.The about-turn in his popular image follows the release of tape recordings by the FBI which, on Edgar J Hooverrsquos orders, bugged the civil rights campaignerrsquos hotel rooms. In so doing, they captured King in the act of watching and offering advice while a woman was raped by a fellow preacher. On other occasions they record his involvement in profoundly abusive acts on female parishioners and others, including a prostitute who described ldquogetting scared during a threesome with King and a second woman.These tapes establish Kingrsquos extramarital relationships as numbering around -. Infidelity on this scale among the once-revered is not particularly new, merely confirming that, as with so many supposedly ldquogreat men, in matters of his marriage vows King was a hypocrite of the first order. The real scandal is learning the extent of his depravity and acts of sexual coercion. Garrow admits the material on these tapes is shocking, and ldquoposes so fundamental a challenge to his historical stature as to require the most complete and extensive historical review possible.Cataclysmic new information such as this is what every biographer, who thought they had nailed their subject, dreads. Yet opinion on public figures is always shting, even without a dramatic turn of events. Already attitudes towards those such as Margaret Thatcher and Richard Nixon are turning,not precisely in their favour then with diminished harshness. Several decades on, they are emerging as fully rounded people rather than stock characters playing their black or white, mythologised part in the nationrsquos story.Read more: Is Creative Scotland more dictator than facilitator When it comes to writing political biography that will endure, therersquos no-one to beat Robert Caro, arguably the worldrsquos finest practitioner. Caro, a former journalist, began his literary career with The Power Broker, a groundbreaking biography of New York legend Robert Moses. Moses was the charismatic, brilliant and venal urban planner who had politicians and building contractors eating out of his palm, while the cityrsquos poor were royally shafted. Carorsquos fascination was as much with the nature of power as with the man who wielded it so cunningly.It is Carorsquos magisterial biography of President Lyndon Johnson, however, for which he is best known. With the fth and final volume now in progress, each book has taken years of research. In biographical terms, therersquos probably never been anything to equal this venture. The result is not, as you might fear, a bureaucratic wallowing in the detail of every memo and phone call Johnson made, but a rich account of the presidentrsquos times. Out of this painstaking but imaginative reconstruction the man emerges, illuminated from every side. The facts Caro unearths never excuse Johnsonrsquos ignoble actions, but they do help explain why he was not just a cheat and a bully but also far-sighted, courageous and revolutionary.In his recent book, Working, a sliver of professional memoir, Caro outlines some of his thinking when embarking on biography. Anyone interested in piecing together the jigsaw puzzle that is Theresa May ndash or any other political heavyweight for that matter ndash should start here. His intellectual curiosity and tireless spadework irradiate the lives of those about whom he writes. The result is not a simple conclusion on whether somebody is essentially decent, well-motivated or corrupt, but a living, breathing portrait of their era, as well as them. Nobody in power, after all, got there by themselves. Just as each of us is composed of countless atoms, so iniduals are a sum of almost infinite parts. Mrs May might take some comfort in knowing the ultimate verdict on her career should take all these elements into consideration."},{"url":null,"title":"where-stands-scotland-on-the-chance-of-a-scot-in-number-10","story":"The sickening whf of entitlement and elitism.

While the race for the Tory leadership could give the starting crowds at the London Marathon a run for their money, a notable addition to the fray this week was one Michael Gove.If you had to create a character least likely to be found as a Tory PM it would surely be the current Environment Secretary. Even Dickens might have thought the Gove story a trle over the top. Abandoned as a baby and adopted at four months old by an Aberdeen fishmonger, he was educated at a state school before winning a scholarship, going private, and from there heading to Oxford. He took up a proper trade,you count journalism as such, which we do in these parts, and became very successful at it.Moving on to politics, he has held major offices, education, justice, the environment, and in each pursued relatively radical policies that take on established interests.If all that is not enough, he wants to wipe out puppy farms. In dog-loving Britain that is catnip indeed. Oh, and he has a spouse who has endless access to the pages of a national newspaper. That sort of thing can come in very handy when a chap has a leadership campaign on the go.Gove: I have conviction to be PMHow much it benefits him remains to be seen. Yesterday, three days after his announcement, Sarah Vine finally confirmed her other half was running for PM. In summing him up, she was her usual chatty self. ldquoLike all husbands, Michael has his flaws: a fondness for corduroy, an inability to go anywherewithout a book, a passion for Wagnerian opera, an obsession with Strictly, an entirely irrational dislike of houseplants and, of course, the usual pathological male inability to operate a dishwasher. The Wagner aside, he seems a pretty straight sort of guy, does he not Then again, so did Tony Blair, who coined the ldquopretty straight sort of guy phrase in  when his government was up to its neck in accusations it had exempted Formula One from a tobacco ad ban infor a donation.The jaunty tone of Ms Vinersquos column yesterday was in contrast to an email she wrote to her husband, and accidentally sent to a stranger, during the  Tory leadership fight. Ahead of a meeting between Mr Johnson and Mr Gove, she urged her spouse to extract a specic guarantee about a top job infor his support, telling him: ldquoThe details can be worked out later on, but without that you have no leverage. From My Weekly to Lady Macbeth, just like that.We know how the  tale turned out, with Mr Gove kning Johnson in the front and deciding to stand himself. That Mr Gove recovered from that very public assassination of a colleague is testament to his skill as a politician and his resilience. He will need plenty of the latterhe does become PM.Bid confirmedHis candidacy in  was a surprise because whenever he he had been asked about the job previously he waved away the notion with a smile. All politicians do. In an interview with the FT in , when he was a Minister in David Cameronrsquos cabinet, he went further. ldquoI donrsquot have what it takes, he said candidly. ldquoI have seen David close up on a iety of occasions ndash he just has an equanimity and a stamina, a sense of calm, good judgment.The piece portrays him, highly accurately as it turned out, as a man in a fearful rush to fulfil his ambitions before a new generation came up behind and pushed him aside.We all present dferent faces to the world, our public selves and our private selves. Most people, one hopes, regard themselves as pretty straight sorts who can be trusted to do the right thing. But the point about running for elected office is that it is a way of testing a personrsquos character and fitness to govern. Yet that is not going to happen here.As matters stand, a future Prime Minister of the UK only has to pass muster with Tory MPs and , party members, plus take part in a few televised debates. In short, only an Emily Maitlis eye roll could stand between the chances of Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, or anyone  becoming PM. President Xi Jinping of China must be looking on with envy. Yes, it really is that easy to become a Prime Minister in  Britain.The right thing to do would be to hold a General Election, but no candidate for the Tory leadership would back such a move given the hammering the party suffered in the European elections. So we must endure another contest between the half-good, wholly bad and the outright ugly of the Conservative party. At the very least, the final two contenders should take part in televised debates with the other party leaders, with the FM representing Scotland.Choosing a PM this way would still be an outrage to democracy that no amount of waffling about unwritten constitutions and parliamentary convention could disguise, but at least it would be a test of the candidatesrsquo mettle. The last contender to duck such a test was Theresa May.

It is not clear whether the case on Friday will focus on more than the technical detail that the re-routing was ordered by officials rather than councillors.Speaking last week, Glasgow City Council said the expected scale of the protest would pose a threat of disruption to the community and impact on police resources, ordering the parades to be re-routed.Police had raised fears over the impact the marches and subsequent protests will have on the community saying that they had fresh concerns following protests outside the church at a march last weekend.The priest at St Alphonsus, Canon Thomas White, was spat on during an Orange March last year. This galvanised opposition to parades near churches. A group, Call It Out, was formed and has been organising counter protests.There are concerns over the potential for confrontation. Earlier this month there were  officers at a parade, including specialist riot police.

It comes as the collapse of the high street and the demise of other big businesses has cost taxpayers more than pound billion over the last five years.The huge sum has been paid out by the UK Government to cover redundancy payments and unpaid wages after several large firms were plunged into insolvency.Major retail companies such as BHS, Comet, Toys R Us and Maplin have all gone under, prompting the spike in workers forced to claw back money from the Insolvency Service.

of the runway on its final approach until a preceding aircraft, departing from the same runway, is airborne.The report said there had been a \"loss of separation between the aircraft at a critical

their approach, they interpreted this to mean that ATC were fully in control and they followed the instruction accordingly while continuing to monitor the situation.The report said the trainee

in the negative.The trainee controller transmitted \"negative\"and \"continue approach\"to the Norwegian flight crew.The AAIB said the training instructor became aware of the situation a few seconds

some of the UKs most vulnerable people.He particularly highlighted the impact of policies on disabled people. Checks on peoples entitlement for benefits were often superficial, dismissive and contradicted the evidence of their own doctors, he said. \"Disabled people are some of the hardest hit by austerity measures.Although the UK Government reacted with surprise and disbelief, we know much of this already.Notoriously the reforms of incapacity benefit were designed to exclude enough existing claimants to save  per cent of theee budget. Even more notoriously the introduction of Personal Independence Paymentsfailed in this, with the new benefit increasing costs to the taxpayer by - per cent, according tothe Office for Budget Responsibility.Meanwhile the impact on claimants has been little short of horrying, and we didnt need Philip Alston to tell us. A  study showed the proportion of disability benefit claimants attempting to take their own lives had doubled in the eight years since work capability assessments were brought in. Terminally ill claimants were told they were fit for work. People with mental health issues and other fluctuating conditions such as multiple sclerosis who turned up on a good day were arbitrarily denied benefits by assessors who overlooked any evidence that bad days meant work was impossible.Sanctions against people on Employment and Support Allowance - the benefit for those who cannot work because of illness or disability - were not as high for those on Jobseekers Allowance, but still left tens of thousands of vulnerable people without an income.Now the Scottish Government has the chance to put it all right, with the devolution of powers over support for disabled people.There has been a big take up for the Scottish Governments consultation, which closed on Tuesday about the new benefits it is putting in place.There areThe Scottish Government is making sure disabled people themselves are involved in the creation of the new system. This is already considerably better than the situation in England where a new independent commission was set up this week to look into failings in the system of support.Extraordinarily, the names of the disabled people taking part are being withheld on the grounds thatthey are not, the Department for Work and Pensions might rule them fit for work as a result of their involvement.This is not an idle fear. Campaigners against fracking in Blackpool were shocked to discover last December that wheelchair users taking part in a demonstration had been reported to the DWP by Police who suspected they might be fit for work.It ought to go without saying that having a disability does not and should not disqualy you from having a say in society around you, or protesting against decisions and policies you disagree with.It is all very well - and all very welcome - that the Scottish Governments system promises to treat people with dignity and respect.The Scottish Governments disability assistance scheme is unlikely to be much worse than the benefits it replaces.

Other recommendations include systematic training for all frontline staff to help them identy and offer support to vulnerable households, and the industry working together to improve the effectiveness of the Priority Service Register.Firms should also make sure customers can contact them by phone, for free, and by letter.Lord Whitty said it was clear there were ldquohuge iations in the way energy suppliers, the Big Six and challenger companies, deal with vulnerable customers, ranging from ldquoreally good practice to examples of seriously insensitive treatment that fall far short of acceptable.He said: ldquoNobody likes to think of themselves as lsquovulnerablersquo but any one of us could become vulnerable in a heartbeat.ldquoA safe, reliable and affordable energy supply is such a fundamental need that it warrants particular focus, especially given the stress and anxiety it can cause when there are problems.ldquoWe also cannot ignore how changes in society are leaving increasing numbers of households in dficulty, often isolated and struggling to afford the essentials.ldquoBut our focus has been on what the energy industry can do itself, and in commissioning this report the industry has recognised the importance and challenge of improving standards in this area.ldquoWe now hope that they, together with government, the regulator and consumer bodies, will take the further step of putting our recommendations into practice and committing to making the support of all those in need a top priority.Energy UKrsquos chief executive, Lawrence Slade, said:ldquoOur sector is genuinely committed to going further to improve services for all customers, particularly those in the most vulnerable circumstances, which is why we established this independently-chaired commission and we have already committed to bringing forward a new vulnerability charter, that wersquoll be drawing up in coming months, to build on this report and existing voluntary initiatives.Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy said: ldquoItrsquos critical that energy customers in vulnerable circumstances get the right support at the right time, and this report rightly highlights a lack of consistency across the sector.James Taylor, head of policy and public affairs at disability equality charity Scope, said: ldquoWe back this call to drive up standards, and encourage all energy companies to get better at serving their disabled customers.ldquoMany disabled people have no choice but to consume more energy because of their condition, often resulting in sky-high energy bills.ldquoItrsquos time that the Government, regulators and energy suppliers recognise the needs of disabled people and work together to improve the energy market.A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokeswoman said: ldquoThis Government strongly believes that everyone has the right to a reliable and reasonably-priced energy supply, and wants to protect consumers from rip-off deals.ldquoThis is why we are making sure two million low-income households get money off their winter energy bills, as well as protecting  million households with our energy price cap.ldquoWe are also giving extra money to pensioners through the winter and are committing pound billion to upgrading the energy efficiency of the homes of the most vulnerable.Matthew Vickers, chief executive at the Energy Ombudsman, said: ldquoDespite the inconsistencies highlighted in this report, the energy sector as a whole is making good progress on vulnerability and there is every reason to think this can be accelerated.copy -.

They were among the first pioneers in planting English and Scots settlers in Ireland. But by , Smiths settlement failed and the lands reverted to the crown.On  May , King James I granted the Ballymena Estate to another native Irish nobleman, Ruairiacute Oacuteg MacQuillan. The estate passed through several owners, eventually passing into the possession of William Adair, a Scottish laird from Kinhilt in southwestern Scotland.The estate was temporarily renamed Kinhiltstown after Adairs lands in Scotland. The original castle of Ballymena was built in the early th century, situated to take advantage of an ancient ford at the River Braid.In  Charles I confirmed the grant of the Ballymena Estate to William Adair, giving him the right to hold a market at Ballymena on every Saturday. He hired local Irish as workers on the estate they served as tenant farmers for much of the next two centuries and more.And from those early days, Ballymena became a commercial hub for central Co. Antrim, steadily growing in prosperity through the years of the linen boom in the th century.Until recent years, the traditional market had been held at the area known as the Fair Hill on lands bordered by upper Broughshane Street, William Street and Thomas Street.When the area was sold for the development of what is now the Fair Hill Shopping Centre, the Saturday market was moved to its current venue near the Seven Towers Leisure Centre.And that is pretty much where the whole tradition kicked off nearly  years ago as the site is pretty much right in the front garden of what used to be the Adair familys residence in Ballymena!Mid and East Antrim Borough Council is urging you to come enjoy, explore and love your local market this May as part of UK wide campaign to support our local traders. ‘Love Your Local Market’ runs from - May.

Farm attacks in South Africa are reported almost on a daily basis to the rest of the world and must be condemned. There is no denying they happen, the tragic results are plain to see. But what can be done about it  How does this affect how other farmers get on with le and their daily work I’ve been fortunate enough to visit and report from South Africa on five separate occasions now over the past  years and come away each time with a sense of dismissal but also hope.South Africa is a beautul country, physically, and produces some of the best food and wine demanded by consumers around the world.Politically, it’s a dferent place. A place where the state is not in charge. A state that cannot even control its basic power supply, without some form of corruption.But where does that leave agriculture and the farmers  No matter what political persuasion anyone holds, everyone must eat. Over the years of visiting farms in South Africa I noticed farmers becoming despondent, feeling let down, feeling a sense of ‘what’s the point of it all ’I’ve talked to farmers who were attacked, who lost loved ones, and who gave up.However, during my latest visit in early March this year I witnessed a positivity among farmers that really I never experienced before.Yes, nothing politically has changed, except for the worst, but farmers are more defiant, more ambitious and are investing to make their farms more efficient in order to give them a future.During the big livestock equipment show EuroTier in Germany last November I talked to a few South African farmers interested to see how technology could make their farms more efficient. It was really comforting to visit a number of farmers on this trip who are putting new technology to play in order to improve their businesses. Visiting Greenway Farms Ltd with headquarters at Tarlton to see how business partners Vito Rugani and Vincent Sequeira handle over , tonnes of carrots per year grown on , hectares was really inspiring.The passion and ambition shown by these leading vegetable farmers has resulted in a range of Rugani juices that are now being exported across the world. They have invested heavily in new state of the art equipment to extract juice from vegetables. The science is baffling, the set-up is extremely professional and as for the juice, well…..I have to admit this was the first time I ever tried carrot juice and it was absolutely delicious. The knowledge I gained from Vito and his team will stay with me for a long time. I just hope he finds a way to export the range to the UK!Next visit was to Corne Nel’s Doornfontein Melkery in Randfontein where they milk  cows. Dairy unit manager Pieter Barnard gave me a very informative tour around the farm.Having been brought up on a dairy farm myself in Northern Ireland this visit was particularly interesting and I was also impressed to see more investment in equipment to make le easier. A new rotary parlour installed two years ago certainly speeds milking time up and perhaps investment into robotic milkers will help too with the dferent milking groups in the future. The sun can be a challenge where livestock are concerned and it was good to hear plans to build new housing in the corals to keep the cows cooler. With excellent production figures and a sound understanding of the cows, this farm is certainly gearing up for an exciting future.Before travelling across the border to visit farms in Botswana I went to see Sarel Haasbroek’s grain farm in the Carletonville area of Gauteng. Again this is another progressive farmer positive about the future and was excelling in importing the Horsch machinery brand into South Africa. Up in Francistown, eastern Botswana, I was warmly hosted by the Munger family at Wayside Brahman Stud Ltd for four nights. During my stay there I was given a comprehensive run down of the breeding herd, commercial herd, game farm, and the egg laying enterprise. What a farm! Rowland and his son Rowly are certainly well respected in the area and for the cattle they produce. Wayside was started by Rowland’s father Keith who was also present during my visit. And then it was off to see another beef farmer, this time with Bonsmara cattle, Calla Visser, for a very early start checking his cattle. Every night Calla has to go and round up over  cattle on his farm and herd them into outdoor corals for the night to protect them against theft and predators such as hyenas or leopards!And, every next morning Calla and his staff start very early going around the five dferent corals on his , hectare farm counting all the cows, calves and bulls hoping they all made it through the night alive.This, of course, is a new line of management for me but was nonetheless interesting to learn. A visit to Bobbsies Chickens Ltd based in the east at Tshesebe guided by general manager Gerhard van der Merwe was another super visit. Botswana, too, impressed me, as did the farmers there. I received detailed insight into the beef and poultry industries there and look forward to the next time I can visit.Some of the Botswanans though need to learn how to drive!

Walter’s son Blake added: “I know how much my dad would have loved to have been involved in a game like this, playing alongside his idols, as well as Ryan and I.”The family’s thanks go to DVFC for the use of its ground on match day and for continued support over the years also to local councils for help on launch day and for support provided.

They get to meet the young ones and they’ve prepared lunch for the kids so they’ll get to sit down and have a meal together where the young ones can learn about the service provided here.”She added: “The garden is looking impressive with all the dferent colours. The young ones are putting their mark on the garden, which is great.”Michael McAllister from Leonard Cheshire Disability commented: “It’s good to get the guys involved in this project.“This is the third day we’ve been here and we’re getting ready for the barbecue next week. It’s been good fun, but it’s a good opportunity for the young people to get involved with Rosemount House.“It’s a good education for them. It’s also about creating more awareness in Belfast about homelessness. This is a real positive project for the young people to be involved in.”Michael Bradley, who lectures at Belfast Met, said: “Partnering up with Leonard Cheshire gives young people the chance to give back to the community. They’re also developing teamwork skills and communication skills. They’re able to help the community, but it’s also part of their qualication too.”He added: “One of the residents came in one day and spoke to the young ones about the choices that he made that led him here. It had quite a big impact on the students, because they could relate to it in some ways. It’s really striking a note with them.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"alliance party secure best ever result in european elections","story":"A historic all female line-up will take their seats in the European Parliament after the count of last Thursday’s vote.The Alliance Party collected , votes, , more than the party received in the  European election.The quota of , votes was not reached by any candidate.

Once the recommendations are adopted, they will be dficultnot impossible to change for at least the next election, which may affect how inidual constituents are represented for several years. Recourse to the courts at this point was our client’s only option to address the assertion that the Commission had acted unlawfully in reaching its proposals.“Moreover, this challenge is not a challenge to the merits of the proposals in substance but merely the decision-making process, and faithfulness to the statutory scheme, adopted by the Commission. Given the very signicant effects of any legal error on the part of the Commission – and the essentially irreparable nature of those errors, the Court quite correctly exercised an intense level of scrutiny and arrived at the correct conclusion that the Boundary Commission had fallen into legal error and acted in a procedurally unfair way in this instance.”A further hearing on the th June  will decide on the final remedies and order in the case."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"largest tv in ireland on sale in west belfast electronic store","story":"CUSTOMERS in Noel Grimley Electrics did a double take on Wednesday afternoon as the latest in TV technology was unveiled.The ” Samsung QLED, the first in the north, was unveiled – just in time for Saturday’s Champions League final between Liverpool and Spurs.“It’s great to see the TV displayed in the store,” said owner Eamon Grimley, “we are a big Samsung dealer and were the first in the north to sell the K TV. That’s what we are here for, to showcase the latest in technology. People in West Belfast want the latest, most up-to-date technology available,” he said. “The QLED is the screen quality, it’s giving you the best in picture quality. With us being in the area we want to showcase the latest in technology for our customers and make it as accessible to everybody.”With a £. price tag, Gerard Bonner explained how the TV has a wealth of top of the range additions.“The TV is a quantum dot display, so it’s QLED, it has a layer of quantum dots, like wee fine crystals on it so it enhances the colour and the brightness. It’s basically two and a half times brighter than a standard LED TV and there are over a billion colours that come through on the screen.“The two main things with the TV is that it has Apple TV. Previously you couldn’t mirror your iPhone to your TV but you can with this and you can access BT Sport so long as you have the app. If it’s being mounted on the wall and it’s not being used you can upload your own photos, have your own picture collage, a clock, the weather, news headlines coming up, you can change the colour of the background to blend in with your wall.“Grimleys are the first to have it and we expect a lot of interest over the coming days.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"timely staging of a streetcar named desire at the lyric","story":"THEY told me to take a streetcar named Desire,” says self-designated southern belle Blanche DuBois, who stands neat as a pin in her vivid green suit, heels and ‘merry widow’ head dress as the Lyric audience is transported to the stling heat ofthe s New OrleansLatin Quarter.Blanche, who “taught school”, is someone who has ideas about herself and is meticulous about her appearance down to the most minute of detail, yet has come to find herself moving in with her sister in rather straitened circumstances.Blanche is shoehorned into the claustrophobic two-room apartment of, when we first meet her, a barefoot and pregnant Stellaand her alpha-male husband Stanley . The couple has moved there after the loss of the family home, Belle Reve, to creditors. Stanley’s suppressed rage at his lot in le finds an outlet when Blanche turns up.Through “nips of whiskey”, “sips of Bourbon” and card games, Blanche’s dreamy posturing and posingcollides head-on with Stanley’s rage and the anger boils over as the play reaches its brutal, violent climax.The production is spot on in its timing, debuting as the fall-out from the#MeToo campaign around the abuse of women continues to gather pace. Key contemporary issues of PTSD, mental health and gender equality are brought into sharp and devastating focus and we are forced to confront the question of how much –anything – has changed in  years.Emma Jordan’s sure-footed direction, Ciaran Bagnall’s atmospheric set and lighting design, Enda Kenny’s exquisite costume design and Carl Kennedy’s sound design interweave to bring us an utterly convincing sense of place and mood and combine with an absolutely outstanding cast to make this production the best I have ever seen at the Lyric.The audience were on their feet at the end to gave a well-deserved standing ovation to all involved in a play that will stay with you for a long time to come.A must-see.

Mr Hunt, one of  MPs vying to be the next prime minister, said a failure to solve Brexit could ruin the Conservatives and warned the \"biggest risk\" to delivering on the referendum was a general election. His comments came as Housing Minister Kit Malthouse became the latest person to enter the race to succeed Theresa May, saying there was a \"hunger for someone new\". Mrs May, attending a summit in Brussels, said the European election results in which the Tories took just % of the vote were \"deeply disappointing\". \"I think what it shows is the importance of actually delivering on Brexit. I think the best way to do that is with a deal,\" she said. \"But it will be for my successor and for Parliament to find a way forward and get a consensus.\" The comments are aimed at Brexiteers in the race to replace her who have said they are prepared to back a no-deal departure from the EU, something which could lead to a clash with Parliament. Mr Hunt warned rivals that calling a general election - potentially to win a mandate for a no-deal Brexit - could be a disaster for the Tories.He told BBC Radio s Today programme: \"We must not go back to the electorate asking for their mandate until weve delivered what we promised we would do last time, which is to deliver Brexit, it would be absolutely catastrophic for us as a party.\" Mr Hunt, who campaigned for Remain in the  referendum but has adopted an increasingly Eurosceptic tone, said he had \"always believed we should keep no deal on the table\" as it is the \"best way of getting a good deal\". He said it was important to \"find a dferent way to get a deal\", adding \"we have to have a go at this\" as he proposed forming a new wider negotiating team to change the Withdrawal Agreement. Leadership rival Dominic Raab also said he was focused on \"getting a fairer deal from the EU as we leave\". But outgoing European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker stressed \"there will be no renegotiation\". The agreement between the EU and Mrs May to delay Brexit until October  included a commitment not to seek a renegotiation of the deal. Meanwhile, Mr Malthouse, who brought together Tory Leavers, the DUP and Remainers behind a compromise Brexit plan earlier this year, said he had a \"good number\" of MPs backing his bid. \"Weve got to find a way to unite the Conservative Party to deliver a Brexit plan so we can move onto a really compelling, attractive domestic agenda that might command victory at a general election,\" he said. \"One of the reasons that Im running is that Im the only person who has actually done that.\"Other candidates for the top job also started to offer a flavour of their policies should they win a ballot of Conservative Party members later this year. Michael Gove is prepared to offer free UK citizenship to three million nationals who resided in the UK at the time of the June  referendum. Matt Hancock wrote in the Daily Mail about \"driving up the living wage and cutting taxes\". In response to Mr Hunts warning that a no-deal Brexit election would be \"political suicide\", leadership rival Esther McVey responded: \"Political suicide actually lies in not having a clean break from the EU and not leaving on October .\" Others vying for the top job include Cabinet colleagues Sajid Javid, Andrea Leadsom and Rory Stewart, and current bookies favourite Boris Johnson. Meanwhile, Downing Street indicated the Withdrawal Agreement Bill may never be published."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38163421.ece/9197d/AUTOCROP/w620h342/plaza.jpg","title":"belfast benefit centre staff spat out of windows and hurled objects onto the street below","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is all that our legal constraints allow.”Askeda hard border would lead to renewal of the conflict in Northern Ireland, he replied: “Yes, it creates a very dficult situation for people.“I remember a meeting after the Brexit vote with a group of  women working on both sides. “Several of the women were crying, worried about their livelihoods they said, ‘Help us!’“We have found an agreement. “We said that after the withdrawal agreement is accepted, we can immediately start work on a long-term solution for the Irish border.“It was a British proposal to build the backstop into a UK-wide solution—to make the whole of the UKpart of a single customs territory until we find a solution. “The backstop is insurance, in case we do not find this solution.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts royal avenue closed for watermain repair","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was followed by St Kevins College in Enniskillen in st place with .%, and, both in joint nd place, St Catherines College in Armagh and St Michaels College in Enniskillen with .%.Dalriada School headmaster Tom Skelton said he was \"absolutely delighted\" with the results.\"Its a fantastic achievement for the staff and pupils involved,\" he said. \"To take every child over the line with % five A*-C represents a lot of hard work and the support of parents as well.\"Two years ago we were % as well, so were delighted to get up there again. I think it reflects well on the school, the pupils and the standards set by staff.\"Mr Skelton said the league table \"shows the success of the grammar school system\" and he added: \"Pastoral care is a massive part of it. We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort. Its about hard work and dedication,\" he said of its joint ninth place.Principal of Castlederg High School Elaine McKelvey said she was \"delighted\" it was the highest-ranking non-grammar school in the league table.\"These results are testimony to the excellent provision for learning made at Castlederg High School by a highly dedicated staff, working in partnership with very supportive parents to ensure the best possible outcome for each young person,\" she said.Mrs McKelvey paid tribute to the hard work and dedication of staff during \"a most challenging period for educational delivery within all schools in Northern Ireland, given the shortfall in capital funding and inequitable remuneration for teaching staff\".\"Most of all though, we are tremendously proud of our pupils and their achievements, noting the breadth of opportunity for the future that such excellent exam results have created for them,\" she added.The Department of Education said the information contained in the league table relating to GCSE results \"does not provide a valid basis for comparing performance between schools, since it takes no account of intakes of the schools or of any other factors that may affect pupil performance\".It added: \"No single measurement can constitute a fair or accurate evaluation of a school, and the figures should be considered in the context of other information about schools and their pupils.\""},{"url":null,"title":"united ireland acceptable to eileen paisley if there is freedom of religion","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The parties are currently engaged in talks attempting to restore devolved government with civil servants responsible for running the country.Asked about her message to the local politicians, Baroness Paisley said they needed to \"lay aside their baggage and face facts\".\"So many petty things, they dont see the big picture,\" she said.\"So many people are crying out for help and they are failing them by not taking responsibility.\"It is going to get worse and that leaves us open to all sorts of trouble.\"She added: \"I would say to them cut out the petty things and dwell on things that matter - think of the people.She said she was \"aggrieved\" the  MLAs were still taking a salary and it was not fair on civil servants to be doing the job of elected representatives.\"It is abominable for people to take money for nothing,\" she added, \"they are not doing the job they were elected to do.\"Baroness Paisley also said the parties needed to be more open with the public, adding: \"There is nothing in the open, what goes on is hidden.\"We are all sinners no matter who we are or what we are.She was asked about the DUP fielding its first openly gay candidate, Alison Benningtion and the subsequent resignations from the party after her successful election, including her late husbands brother in law and how some have said the late Ian Paisley would be \"turning in his grave\".\"We are all sinners no matter who we are or what we are.. that girl may not know Christ died for her,\" she said.\"I do not hate Ms Bennington, I dont know the girl. I dont hate anybody no matter who they are or what they have done against me.\"But we have to love Christ first and what He says we have to obey his word. These things are written for our benefit.\"Baroness Paisley said she hoped the party was not making a move away from the ethos her husband established the party under.\"It was a decision taken at the time and I think it was taken as a defiance to see what would happen.\"And I think it should be put to the whole party and a proper decision made on what should be done.\"Turning to Brexit and Arlene Fosters comments on leaving the countrya united Ireland came about, Eileen Paisley said it would take an \"awful lot\" for her to move saying so long as their was freedom of religion she would remain.\"I would not like a dictatorship or someone whatever their religion was to be persecuted because of that.\"It is a big question. If we go right back to the beginning, the iding of Ireland. The people or Ireland, north, south, east and west, I think are a great people.\"No matter what part of Ireland a person is from.. they are a fellow country man or woman.\"I just wonder why it had to be ided at that time and I think that was the wrong ision. It is too big an issue for me to ponticate on.\" I dont want my mind and soul to be poisoned with an unforgiving spirit.Baroness Paisley said she missed her late husband more, and more every day and she was told many times by others across the political ide and the communities his leadership was missed.She recalled how her husband wanted to be a farmer when he was a young boy and it was when sowing corn he heard the call from God that it was not he seed He wanted Ian to sow.She said in his first sermon in Sixmilecross in Co Tyrone he spoke for only  minutes before running out of material and immediately vowed to never speak again.\"And the man that was taking him told him youll speak all right, and so his words were fulfilled,\" she said.In his final years the Free Presbyterian Church ostracised its founder. Baroness Bannside said it was \"very callous\" but pointed to Jesus and how despite all he had done for his people, was crucied.Baroness Bannside said she no longer worships at the Free Presbyterian Church as it would \"leave her open\" instead going to her granddaughters husbands baptist church.\"I just put it away, I dont bother... I live my own live with my own family and I am content to do that,\" she added.\"It was dficult to forgive them but I have to get on.

Notwithstanding their success at the polls, the Brexit Party and fellow travellers only managed to equal the number of votes gained by remainers. And in Northern Ireland the election merely underlined that a majority of people here want to remain in the EU.Read MoreMEPs to earn £, plus expenses for four months’ work...Brexit happens in OctoberEilis OHanlon: Why we should celebrate Northern Ireland having three female MEPsAlban Maginness: Old political certainties well and truly swept away by historic Euro electionEU election results: Diane Dodds, Naomi Long and Martina Anderson are Northern Irelands MEPs amid Alliance vote surgeThat is not to dismiss either Brexit or Alliance who performed magnicently, chiefly by giving voters a clear message on where they stood. For Alliance it showed there is a middle ground between the DUP and Sinn Fein and that it is best placed at this moment to occupy it.Now the action switches to Westminster and the backstabbing free-for-all that will pass as a Tory party leadership campaign. Up to  candidates could take part but it seems inevitable that any winner will have to be a committed Brexiteer.That will be music to the ears of the DUP who will continue to hold the balance of power in Parliament and one Tory leadership candidate, Jeremy Hunt, has already promised to include them in his negotiating team, although why they had not insisted in being on Theresa Mays team in the first instance is a puzzle.The problem for any potential new Prime Minister is that none of the candidates has come up with a feasible alternative to the border backstop which has always been the stumbling block in finding an acceptable exit agreement. Brexit is like Northern Irelands devolution impasse. Everyone knows what the problems are but no one is prepared to compromise to break the logjam. The worry in parochial terms is that the current Stormont talks will run into the ground through lack of interest from Westminster, the DUPs pivotal position in Parliament which will demand a lot of the partys energies, and Sinn Feins soul searching after poor election performances in the Republic and a less than glowing effort on this side of the border.Meanwhile, the UK has to leave the EU by Halloween at the latest, a ghoulish prospect given that many of the Tory leadership candidates are avowed leave at any cost purists."},{"url":null,"title":"eilis ohanlon why we should celebrate northern ireland having three female meps","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

When it comes to grasping at straws, that surely takes some beating.Its hard to argue that Alliance has bagged top boasting rights. Naomi Long more than doubled the Alliance vote, attracting , extra first preferences than Anna Lo did when she stood for the party back in , and the party has become the first to describe itself neither as unionist nor nationalist to take a European Parliament seat for the constituency.Some people will deny that last part. There are always conspiracy theorists on the farther edges of either political tradition who claim to know what Alliance \"really\" stands for.It also remains to be seen whether the results represent a permanent sht away from sectarian politics or just a recalibration of the centre. Another low turn out suggests voters here dont give EU elections that high a priority, even after three years of scare stories about the effect of a no-deal Brexit. The Remain vote only went up fractionally on the  referendum.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetWhats definitely historic is that the three MEPs sent to represent Northern Ireland in Brussels are all women, a detail which, to be honest, I hadnt even noticed until it was pointed out to me. That makes two things worth celebrating. The first is the increasing prominence of female representatives in a society which has been male-dominated for too long. The second is that their presence has become so familiar that its becoming possible to not even pay close attention to their gender.Some might wonder whether the female politicians in Northern Ireland are that much of an improvement on the men. The current impasse at Stormont has been presided over by the DUPs Arlene Foster, Sinn Feins Michelle ONeill and a female Secretary of State after all.That is to miss the point - and those who champion the entry of more women into politics often miss it most spectacularly.Alexandra De La Torre is coordinator of the womens peace project the Next Chapter. Last month she said that the real question to ask about the growing number of female politicians in Northern Ireland is: \"Are they representing all women  Or are they representing the male-oriented politics of their political parties \"With respect, that isnt the \"real\" question at all. Its not womens job to clean up the political sphere, any more than its their job to clean the house. It doesnt matterwomen make anything better. Women have every right to be as useless at politics as the men who came before them.What matters is that theyre there at all, which is why every woman who wins an election represents another small victory, not least in Northern Ireland, where, those totemic leadership roles aside, theyre still in a minority politically.There is something to be said for the argument that having female leaders masks the fact that women still dont have a strong enough voice, but part of the problem is the belief that women have \"a voice\" when the truth is they have lots of voices. Too often women in public le are told that they must say and believe certain things in order to earn respect, especially from other women who call themselves feminists, but whose feminism mainly seems to consist of telling other women what to think and haranguing them when they refuse. Feminists who still think the \"wrong\" sort of women are winning elections are just as guilty of doing down women as the misogynists who think the corridors of power are no place for a woman.Whats refreshing is that the three women who now speak for Northern Ireland at EU level are standing there on their own merits and on the s of their respective parties, rather than playing the \"female card\". They each see their role, rightly, as to represent everyone in Northern Ireland.That theyre all so dferent, in character and background and attitude, is noteworthy too. Diane Dodds was a teacher Naomi Long, an engineer Martina Anderson... well, lets just say she was out of the job market for a long time.When it comes to Brexit and the Union and other issues, their views span the whole spectrum of opinion. To give one example, Diane Dodds is opposed to any attempt to dilute the law on abortion Naomi Long believes that terminations should be decriminalised and made available in cases of rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormality, but does not support extending the  Abortion Act fully to Northern Ireland Sinn Fein wants abortion liberalised immediately along the lines of the Republic. That seems broadly representative of views across Northern Ireland.There are other dferences too. Diane Dodds is from a rural background the other two grew up in the city, one in Belfast, one in Derry. Anderson is also the only one of the three to have blown up a furniture store in her teenage years, whilst Naomi Long found minor fame as a schoolgirl by appearing on the quiz show Blockbusters. Readers must decide for themselves which was the more admirable adolescent pastime.The important thing is that they are all distinct politically in ways that have little to do with their gender.As it happens, theyre unlikely to get a chance to take up their seats in the European Parliament anyway.

On the left, the Labour Party characterises business as the real enemy. On the right, the argument for radical tax cuts, deregulation and smaller government is gaining ground, just as our population demographics are making them harder to do.“And as we look to rebuild the case for centre ground politics we should take a bold step in writing the next chapter in the story of statutory minimum wages in the UK. “A story which began under the Labour government of  – but which took a giant step forward under the Conservative government in  – so that we demonstrate once again that the well-regulated market delivers for all our people.”He said a gap had opened up in Britain and other developed countries between the “theory of how a market economy and free trade creates and distributes wealth and the reality experienced by many ordinary people”.“We ignore that gap at our peril becausewe do not address it, it will be filled with the reckless promises of the populists,” he warned. “But that doesn’t mean we should abandon our economic model.“So, for those like me who believe passionately that harnessing the power of market economics is the only way to deliver progress… it is imperative that we take decisive action to show that the regulated market model can deliver higher wages and higher living standards.”Mr Hammond earlier hinted that he would support a second referendumParliament cannot resolve Brexit. He told BBC Radio ’s Today programme: “If we do get to the point where Parliament does admit that it cannot resolve the situation, then it will have to be remitted back to the people.“I am not sure that a general election can resolve the question for the simple reason that both the main political parties are ided on the issues. This is a ision that runs not between the parties, but through the parties.“We need a period of calm now before contemplating the possibility of a general election.“My strong preference is for Parliament to resolve this butParliament can’t resolve it, then Parliament will have to decide how we remit it back to the people, whether it is in the form of a general election, or a referendum.”"},{"url":null,"title":"what the papers say may","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is definitely an iconic part of the lough.In the late s, maritime archaeologist Thomas McErlean and a team from Ulster University stumbled upon the worldrsquos earliest known tide mill during an excavation at Strangford Lough.Discovered close to the remains of Nendrum Monastery on Mahee Island, Thomas recalls the signicance of unearthing this medieval tide mill.Thomas says: ldquoThis was a site we got so excited about, we knew we were changing the course of Irish archaeology and indeedhellip industrial archaeology. We were breaking new ground and it was absolutely wonderful.In recent times, Strangford Lough has become an important site for tidal energy research and in  the worldrsquos first commercial tidal turbine was built near Portaferry.The turbine is now being decommissioned and local marine expert Simon Rogers, who is working on the removal, reveals the impact the tide has on operations.

Based on a five acre site at Kennedyrsquos Lake, the retreat has been visited by disabled groups who abide by the ethos of lsquofishing for funrsquo.No lead weights or barbs are allowed. Once a fish is caught and photographed it is released back into the lake.Robert explains that with the help of his close aide and fellow veteran, Nigel Cree, who is a director of Letrsquos Do Veterans Support, the net has been widened and that an invitation is being extended to anyone within the local community who wants to try out fishing.While battling to overcome his disability, Robert discovered there was little or no help for disabled veterans available in his community.Facing an interminable series of bad news on his journey to recovery he viewed the opportunity to be given a role in the British Limbless Ex-Servicemenrsquos Association as his saving grace.Robert said: ldquoWhen I got involved I saw people much worse off than myself. Some veterans had catastrophic injuries. I began to gain qualications in helping other people in the same situation as me. This helped me with my own recovery and give me a focus.ldquoMy house is down by the lake. One evening I was sitting observing how peaceful it was and it got me thinking about how I could put the lake to good use. In hindsight, the idea saved me from myself.ldquoI got a small team involved and before we knew it we had been successful in attracting funding to construct a car park, create fishing stands and a foot bridge, stock the lake with indigenous course fish and install an eco-toilet with disabled access.ldquoThere was no stopping half way through and the gamble has paid off with a successful opening and an encouraging demand for bookings growing each day.Robert describes himself as ldquonot being a lsquotea and biscuits man and doesnrsquot like to stand on ceremony.He continued: ldquoI have been helped by a devoted team of helpers and I would like to pay tribute to each of them and I dedicate this achievement to them and the three other veterans I started with who gave me great encouragement.ldquoIrsquod also like to thank Alpha Concrete, Hamilton Brothers and Cunningham Stone who were exceptional in their work with memorial plaques which have been erected.Robert said he hopes to provide fishing workshops in the near future and to get more people using the retreat.He added: ldquoA lot of time and money has been invested and when strangers visit we would ask them to adhere to the rules. They can contact me to book a session and pay a minimum day fee.For more information on Clough fishing retreat and for other initiatives which Letrsquos Do Veterans Support carry out, visit www.letsdoevents.info or contact Robert on  ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Event marking Men’s Health Week  ","story":"THE St Patrick Centre in Downpatrick is hosting a special event next month to mark Menrsquos Health Week.Between June  and June , the centre dedicated to Irelandrsquos patron saint will feature an exhibition of art, craft and woodwork by members of the townrsquos Menrsquos Shed.The shedders are busily preparing for the exhibition with visitors welcome to view the work on display and learn about the work of the organisation in the community.The Menrsquos Shed aims to promote positive mental health and wellbeing to men over the age of  with the organisation offering a sizeable, well-equipped workshop at its Ballydugan Road industrial estate.There, shedders make wooden items to order such as garden seats and planters and they also produce items for community and conservation projects, like bird, bat and owl boxes for the National Trust.The Menrsquos Shed also offers opportunities for people to learn new practical skills including art, wood carving, clay, copper and leather work. The shedders also sing, cook and enjoy copious amounts of tea, biscuits and craic.And when not busy making things, the men love to get out and about visiting other Menrsquos Sheds which is a great way to network and exchange ideas.They also take part in day trips and have been involved in a new community engagement programme at Hillsborough Castle.

He instigated the tournament and hopes his successors will continue with it.He continued: ldquoDuring my year we had the opportunity to salute Dermot Curran, one of our long standing councillors mdash in fact the longest serving in Northern Ireland mdash with whom we enjoyed a fantastic night.ldquoIt was also a pleasure to lead our St Patrickrsquos Day parade in my home area which was really special for me.

As a district, this is something that we need to take seriously, and not necessarily just rising sea levels.Mr Murnin believes that increased rainfall is going to make a dramatic dference to the way buildings and roads are designed, also highlighting the need to look at alternative energy forms.He added: ldquoBuilding for the future and how a modern city should look like will also be important. One thing that struck me looking out from the observation tower at the One World Center in New York was that the city is surprisingly green as so many of the buildings have roof top gardens and trees.

Those that are successful are provided with financial support for one year only.It is a system that the chairwoman of the Bishopscourtrsquos playgroup is keen to see changed.Mrs Patricia Curran, who revealed that Tiny Toons recently missed out on Pathway funding by a narrow margin, said playgroups did a ldquomagnicent job, particularly in rural area where working parents rely heavily upon them.She said playgroups look after children at the most critical time in their development and need to be provided with financial certainty.A number of playgroups across the district revealed recently that they were organising additional fundraising activities to generate income and were appealing for donations of everyday essentials including toilet paper, wipes, photocopying paper and even bin bags.Mrs Curran revealed that Tiny Toons only found out about the strategic support fund by chance and while pleased the cash will pay staff wages over the summer, fresh funding applications will have to be made at the start of next year to cover costs.ldquoWhile we narrowly missed out on Pathway funding, we have secured other support from a fund which we knew nothing about, she continued.ldquoThe money we have secured will keep us ticking over. We are not saying everything is hunky dory as a result of this particular finance. We have money to pay for  childrenrsquos places from next September which is good. The money secured under the strategic support fund will pay our staff over July and August.Mrs Curran said that had the playgroup not been made aware of the strategic fund it would have been a ldquovery dferent story.ldquoWhile securing funding comes as a relief, it does not provide us with any degree of certainty. We will have to make a fresh application for Pathway funding at the start of next year and go through this process all over again, as we and others do every year, she continued.Mrs Curran said Tiny Toons and other playgroups across the district were operating in a ldquochallenging financial climate.ldquoThe provision of ring-fenced funding is vital for us, she declared. ldquoWhile things are fine for now, we know that come the New Year we will have to start filling in funding application forms again.ldquoRing-fenced funding for a two or three-year period would provide certainty and help playgroups operate in a climate where there would not be a cloud hanging over them.ldquoThe funding issue affects all those in the education sector and I read recently that one headmaster warned that his school could be forced to only open four days a week as it did not have enough money.Mrs Curran said that while strategic support funding has provided Tiny Toons with short term relief, guaranteed ring-fenced financial support would provide certainly and allow future planning.She added: ldquoGiven the current funding model, there is always uncertainty hanging over us. We are voluntary workers and we should not have this pressure on our heads. That said,we did not do this work, who  is going to do it ldquoNot many people want to do voluntary work any more because of the pressure involved. We in Bishopscourt were worried about paying our staff and have been provided with some relief.

They set off, quickly deciding to start the race on the green paddock below the lodge .The decision to start there had far-reaching consequences for just adjacent to the chosen start location, come Thursday at pm, a camping couple decided to cook dinner on a makesht stove - they must have been planning a quiet romantic evening with stunning views and just as they had sat down, Frank Morgan, the perennial starterwith his flags and tape followed soon after by hundreds of runners and spectators gathering beside them - no need for them to put on the TV, they had all the live entertainment they needed.Back to Monday evening and the lsquocourse recce crewrsquo followed the Trassey river, crossing it before the hard climb up Slievenaglough, then following the green shoot up to the first check point at its summit.Then it was the technical descent down and up to the summit of lesser-known Lukersquos Mountain and from there making their way home.Mountain leader and rescue stalwart, Ian McCracken fell not once, but twice going over on his ankle badly mdash thankfully, no need for the mountain rescue as the lsquoProphetrsquo was there to guide him home safely mdash poor Ian, after all the winter preparation there would be no Thursday evening race for him.As the runners milled around , Pete Grant, who was surprisingly wearing his club vest for a change, must have had a category win on his mind, as he moaned and groaned about the long, sharp start, delaying the time before he could get his shoes properly mucky.Later on, however, that would be the least of his worries as for some reason he decided to leave his car keys somewhere out on the open mountain at a grid reference that to the present time only God knows.As Frankrsquos whistle was blown at ::the  runners charged off up the track and onto the open mountain.The route, mostly on sheep paths, took them directly onto the craggy summit of Slievenaglough that is part of the Mourne Wall route - a mountain that meant something on Thursday evening rather than just being an anonymous part of the route from the Harersquos Gap to Commedagh.Positively, pretty much everyone successfully reached the cut-off point of  minutes for the first mile that included around  feet of climbing.Newcastle ACrsquos Seamy Lynch had established a comfortable lead early in the race, clear of his club mate Mark Stephens with Newry ACrsquos Esther Dickson also comfortable in the womanrsquos race, ahead of Karen Wilton from Lisburn and Mourne runner Sarah Graham.It should have been plain sailing for everyone, but as often happens, the low cloud rolled in onto the ridge between Slievenaglough and Lukersquos and the summit of Lukersquos disappeared from view. We are still not sure that everyone made it there, but what is certain is that everyone made it back.Legal counsel Higgins lives le in the fast lane, balancing defending the indefensible in one court room or another with le on the farm and a Viking love nest in Tullybrannigan.If therersquos controversy in a sport not known for its controversy, Higgins perhaps will not be too far away - gamekeeper turned poacher  On the way home he chose his own line and clearly there had been some pillow talk, for she did too - slightly dferent, but both probably crossed the moral line, but probably not far enough to be eligible for a criminal conviction.His talk of bringing his finely honed orienteering skills to the table was not convincing the lsquoBroken Wing Commanderrsquo, but despite his protests supported strongly by the lsquoHenrsquo, the directors have no appetite for years in court ending in the European Court of Justice, no doubt, so the results stand.A fine run from Ballydrain junior Jared Martin to come home in third - a big star for the future  Many of the runners remarked this was the best HD course in years and it was great to freshen the series up with a new route - food for thought for the organisers for  Many thanks to all at Meelmore Lodge for the use of their facilities in this beautul location, the marshals, time keepers and people behind the scenes who keep the series running smoothly each week.Thanks also to the Avoca Hotel  Spa on their excellent food and beverages, by order of Jack OrsquoHare.Tomorrow night sees theto Millstone with full body cover required.

Philip Bradfield and the JPI Investigations Team reportA young Belfast family panicked for a month thinking they were going to lose all their benefits after switching to Universal Credit. Universal Credit crisis logoStan Morrison, a public sector finance administrator in his early s, is married to Anneand they have three children under five. Anne has no wage since she took a career break while Stan works  hours per week for £, per year. They were getting child benefit and tax credit to supplement his wage, totalling just under £ per week.Stan was always “proactive” and when he saw Universal Credit being rolled out, he decided to switch over.So after that, a period of two weeks of a bit of panic and not knowing where we stood... We have a young family and everything is budgeted. And when something comes along that disrupts that it can be stressful. For a month I thought I had lost us a couple of hundred pounds a month.Stan Morrison, working father-of-threeTheir problems began when he went for an appointment to finish his application.“We normally received our tax credit and child benefit on a weekly basis. But at the end of the appointment they said, ‘Right, we can’t give you too much information on this but your claim of Universal Credit will be active from now. You will stop receiving tax credit from now’.“I was a bit taken aback by that, and I said: ‘Look, you will appreciate that to us this is our second income.

It said their entitlement to Universal Credit was zero.John McClean, Chief Executive of Radius Housing Association, says the social housing sector is facing a tsunami of arrears caused by Universal Credit.He was “taken aback” and told them that he would not have switched overhe had known the problems he would face. But he was simply told that there was no going back.He contacted the office of UUP MLA Andy Allen, which claried that their UC account had not been updated.“So after that, a period of two weeks of a bit of panic and not knowing where we stood, it was resolved. However, it took about four weeks until the new money kicked in.”Burst water main causes shortages in Belfast city centreNI drugs-death trio ‘were customers of gang who sent pills through mail’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The MLA secured an interest-free loan of £ from the Jobs Office to see him through the gap, which now has to be repaid over six months.DUP MP Emma Little Pengelly is pressing for the extension of a mitigation package to soften the blow of welfare reform on Northern Ireland.But the £ was nowhere near the £ they would have received for the month, putting them under pressure.“I work for my money. I don’t like hand outs. Everybody that gets tax credits is in a job and working, you pay your tax and national insurance.“We have a young family and everything is budgeted. And when something comes along that disrupts that it can be stressful. For a month I thought I had lost us a couple of hundred pounds a month.”The mounting rental arrears caused by the new Universal Credit benefit could become “a tsunami of a problem” for Northern Ireland, it is predicted.The warning came from John McClean, chief executive of social housing provider the Radius Housing Association, which has some , tenants across NI.Some , people have moved to Universal Creditin NI so far. However, JPI Freedom Of Information research has found that % of UC claimants who are tenants with the NI Housing Executiveare in arrears, compared to only % of tenants on housing benefit. Their average arrears is £ compared to £ respectively. As a result, UC claimants have incurred £.m rental arrears with NIHE.Then first minister Arlene Foster and deputy first minister Martin McGuinness receiving the proposals from Professor Eileen Evason in  on the #m mitigation package which protects NI from the full brunt of UK-wide welfare reforms until March . Photo: Press Eye, Kelvin Boyes.“Many people don’t know these [NIHE] figures and that is why I am really pleased that you have requested the information, it is now out there in the public domain, we have struggled for a long time to actually have good anecdotal evidence,” said Mr McClean.The average rental arrears for Radius tenants on UC is probably about . times that of someone on housing benefit, similar to the NIHE figures, he said.“It is an area very close to our hearts at the moment. Welfare reform and UC in particular, although our fear is that the situation is going to get worse with bedroom tax when mitigation measures put in place by Stormont ends next year. The impact on iniduals and associations as businesses is massive. It will become a really big issue unless we unless we try to affect somehow the flawed policy as it stands.”Only % of Radius’ , tenants have moved across to UC so far.“Many families do incredible budget management when it comes to things like school unorms and Christmas. They are just about keeping it together and then along comes a period of transition from housing benefit to UC and for five or six weeks while your assessment is under review you are living with no money.“As a result such families may end up borrowing from doorstep lenders, depending on food banks and borrowingfrom family and friends.”Under-pressure Radius tenants try to cope by cutting back on heating, which can lead to damp. Radius is seeking out vulnerable tenants to help them avoid eviction.“Inevitably I am sure there will be some tension which will come that way.”Housing associations borrow money to build new houses, but the growing debt will impact on their ability to do this, he said. Stormont’s mitigation payments to cover the new bedroom tax end in March , which could cost Radius £.m per year.The projected rental arrears from UC could bring the figure up to £m per year.Last year Radius spent £m maintaining its housing stock, but this will be affected “and this is not me scaremongering”.He added: “It would be very misleading to think this will no impact on the middle classes.”Unless the planned reforms are amended, there is no reason to think “that there will not be an increase, ultimately in homelessness ... This ultimately will affect the quality of le for everybody”.With Brexit likely to reduce the workforce, he said, the welfare system is not set to encourage unemployed people into jobs to compensate, but rather to leave them “in a desperate state”.This could potentially be linked to more crime and “massive pressure” on the health service to cope with rising mental health problems.It would be very helpfulthe £m welfare reform mitigation package agreed by Stormont in  could be extended past its March  end date, he said.Bedroom tax was supposed to encourage people to move to smaller accommodation but it did not take into account the shortage of single unit accommodation in NI, he added. So the tax could have a major impact both on tenants and their landlords.“Universal Credit has only come in and I can definitely envisage a situation where right across the Housing Executive and the social housing sector, when we have wholesale movement across to Universal Credit, this really could be a tsunami of a problem.” The Department of Communities has told the News Letter that it is implementing Universal Credit and Welfare Reform as per policy decided upon by the Stormont Executive.It also noted the Executive had secured a special mitigation package for NI.In , the Executive established a social security ‘mitigation’ package, a pot of £m designed to alleviate the impact of UK-wide welfare reforms like the bedroom tax and the benefit cap. However, the package is due to end in March  and there is no NI Executive in place to decide on any extension. As a result, MPs on the NI Affairs Committee and the Work and Pensions Committee at Westminster have launched a joint inquiry to examine the impact of welfare policy in NI. They will examine the impact of Universal Credit and the new policy which disallows child benefit for more than two children,born after April . NI has the highest proportion of families who would be affected in the UK.DUP MP Emma Little Pengelly said her party is calling for the government to move swtly to confirm that the mitigation scheme will continue after . “There is already anxiety growing across those impacted communities, fearful that the mitigation package will end and they will be left struggling,” she said.Sinn Fein welfare spokesperson Alex Maskey said almost , tenants here do not pay ‘bedroom tax’ as a result of the mitigations and have been protected from the benefit cap and other supplementary payments. He said the best “bulwark” against the cuts is “a reformed power-sharing government at Stormont” and is also pressing for an extension.People Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll said that not even % of the mitigation package has been spent. Blaming the situation on the DUP and Sinn Fein, he said that “abolishing welfare reform” should be a “red line before anyto Stormont is considered”.Meanwhile, an academic as warned that Northern Ireland will be hit particularly hard by Universal Creditbecause it has the largest families in the UK.Ulster University social policy lecturer Goretti Horgan said that the  report from Sheffield Hallam University found that welfare reform will take £m a year out of NI. “This is equivalent to £ a year for every adult of working age,” she said. Under welfare reform, child benefit will only be paid for a maximum of two children per family.“Northern Ireland loses so much through welfare reform because families with children are hardest hit by Universal Credit and we have more families with children – and more children in those families – than in England, Wales or Scotland. Families here are particularly badly hit by the benefit cap and, while that is currently being covered by mitigation payments unique to Northern Ireland, this works only for those who haven’t been moved to Universal Credit.”Under UC the government plans to reduce numbers receiving the severe disability premium of £ per week by %, she said.For couples or households with children, the new benefits cap is £. per week, she added. Pastor Tony Meehan from the West Belfast Food Bank also notes that poverty indicators have risen signicantly.“From April  to April  we fed  families, % directly affected by Universal Credit,” he said. “The year before it was only  families.”In   food bank usage for Co Antrim increased by % and by % in Fermanagh, he said.“It is crazy. They expect people to have savings for up to six weeks without any benefits during processing.“For the first time, claimants must do their own application – and online. But what about those who are illiterate or dyslexic or alcoholic  There is no safety net or safeguards,” he added.There will be “widespread chaos” when a further , people in NI move across to UC by , he said.:: Universal Credit: the ex-gas fitter struggling to keep his home and children:: How to apply for Universal Credit, where to receive free help with your application and how to complain about

If these columns hadnrsquot been removed public safety could have been compromised due to the seriousness of the corrosion damage on many of the column heads.Councillor Lis Burnett, who represents Penarth, told the outgoing leader ldquothere has been widespread concern in the town over the removal of these lamp posts and asked for a review of the ldquowisdom and cost effectiveness of replacing the lamp poststo be published. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief.

Other recommendations include systematic training for all frontline staff to help them identy and offer support to vulnerable households, and the industry working together to improve the effectiveness of the Priority Service Register.Firms should also make sure customers can contact them by phone, for free, and by letter.Lord Whitty said it was clear there were ldquohuge iations in the way energy suppliers, the Big Six and challenger companies, deal with vulnerable customers, ranging from ldquoreally good practice to examples of seriously insensitive treatment that fall far short of acceptable.He said: ldquoNobody likes to think of themselves as lsquovulnerablersquo but any one of us could become vulnerable in a heartbeat.ldquoA safe, reliable and affordable energy supply is such a fundamental need that it warrants particular focus, especially given the stress and anxiety it can cause when there are problems.ldquoWe also cannot ignore how changes in society are leaving increasing numbers of households in dficulty, often isolated and struggling to afford the essentials.ldquoBut our focus has been on what the energy industry can do itself, and in commissioning this report the industry has recognised the importance and challenge of improving standards in this area.ldquoWe now hope that they, together with government, the regulator and consumer bodies, will take the further step of putting our recommendations into practice and committing to making the support of all those in need a top priority.Energy UKrsquos chief executive, Lawrence Slade, said:ldquoOur sector is genuinely committed to going further to improve services for all customers, particularly those in the most vulnerable circumstances, which is why we established this independently-chaired commission and we have already committed to bringing forward a new vulnerability charter, that wersquoll be drawing up in coming months, to build on this report and existing voluntary initiatives.Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy said: ldquoItrsquos critical that energy customers in vulnerable circumstances get the right support at the right time, and this report rightly highlights a lack of consistency across the sector.James Taylor, head of policy and public affairs at disability equality charity Scope, said: ldquoWe back this call to drive up standards, and encourage all energy companies to get better at serving their disabled customers.ldquoMany disabled people have no choice but to consume more energy because of their condition, often resulting in sky-high energy bills.ldquoItrsquos time that the Government, regulators and energy suppliers recognise the needs of disabled people and work together to improve the energy market.A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokeswoman said: ldquoThis Government strongly believes that everyone has the right to a reliable and reasonably-priced energy supply, and wants to protect consumers from rip-off deals.ldquoThis is why we are making sure two million low-income households get money off their winter energy bills, as well as protecting  million households with our energy price cap.ldquoWe are also giving extra money to pensioners through the winter and are committing pound billion to upgrading the energy efficiency of the homes of the most vulnerable.Matthew Vickers, chief executive at the Energy Ombudsman, said: ldquoDespite the inconsistencies highlighted in this report, the energy sector as a whole is making good progress on vulnerability and there is every reason to think this can be accelerated..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Urgent action needed to support vulnerable energy customers, says report article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sto1.jpg","title":"ni business rates to undergo full review","story":"Posted on Thursday May  by John Mulgrew There will be a full review of Northern Ireland’s business rates system, a top civil servant has revealed. Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary of the Department of Finance, announced the full review into the taxation system for companies here, during a Local Government conference, with Retail NI and law firm DWF, at Titanic Belfast. The reform and re-examination of business rates has been one of the core concerns among the retail and hospitality sectors for the last few years. It’s one of several key business issues which had been kicked down the road due to the ongoing impasse at Stormont. The news has been welcomed by Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster. In a joint statement, the groups said: “Both our organisations are delighted that the Department of Finance have announced this review into non-domestic rates. We have consistently lobbied for this over a number of years and are pleased that our joint call has been heard” “While this is not an end in itself, it is a means to an end. This review provides us with a roadmap for radical change to an antiquated and not fit for purpose system of business rates which is a major burden for our members “In this review we will be outlining signicant changes to rates, including our proposals for a targeted approach to small business rates relief, a revamp of the rates hardship fund, green rates rebate for business who invest in carbon neutral technology and greater relief for new start businesses. “At the last UK Budget, the Chancellor gave independent retailers and hospitality businesses a third off their rate bills in England. We want nothing less than this for our members in Northern Ireland.\" Ms Gray says that \"in recent years signicant changes have taken place in our high streets and town centres. It is critical from a business perspective, as well as a government funding perspective, that our rating system is capable of responding to this wider process of change. That’s why today I am announcing a full and comprehensive review of business rates. “We must create a rating system which generates the funding our public services need while supporting businesses in all sector and enabling economic growth right across Northern Ireland. “In an environment where we are working without ministers, there are limitations to what we can do by way of policy change. But we need to be ready with updated advice for incoming ministers for theirto office. This fundamental review is therefore a critical part of this process.” And Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said: “We wholeheartedly welcome the announcement of this review and it is a credit  the Permanent Secretary’s drive to make positive change. “The fact that retail is % of the economy and pays a quarter of all business rates is simply not sustainable especially give the seismic structural changes going on in the industry. “We have some of the highest business rates in Europe and they are a disincentive to investing in Northern Ireland. We are already playing catch up to the rest of the UK on business rates reform where our businesses pay p in the pound more than the UK average. “This review must look at all aspects of the system. There must be equity in any new system that allows for a widening of the tax base and an audit of the plethora of exemptions some of which have been in place since the s. “If we don’t get business rates right, we risk further shop closures which will  not only cost jobs  but leave a gaping hole in NI finances.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"could a new dawn boost ni business development","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business While Brexit is still upon us, John Simpson says the business sectors finances have proved stronger than predicted and lending could be boosted on the outside as the veil of uncertainty lts The darkest hour comes just before the dawn: an apt reference to the prospects when Brexit is finally taken out of the daily diet of news, concern about business disruption, and foreboding about dficult trading prospects. Brexit is proving to be a slow departure. This year the economy has proved more resilient than many feared. Employment has remained at high levels, jobs for skilled employees are available, and with less certainty personal incomes have been maintained.Political uncertainty and efficient business management are an uneasy mix. In the recent winter and springbusinesses have had to live with an intense series of destabilising influences. For over  years, businesses in Ireland and the UK have grown accustomed to near frictionless EU market conditions. customs duties had disappeared on all internal EU trading. For businesses on this island, the memory of cross-border customs duties had all been but forgotten.   Looking at the lending performances of some of our own banks, the numbers seem to be adding up. In its full year accounts for , Danske Bank posted pre-tax profit of £.m, while new lending rose % and overall business lending increased by %.Across Donegall Square, Ulster Bank saw its income rising from £m to £m during , while profit after impairments stood at £m. There was a % rise in new corporate lending, while small business rose by %.Meanwhile, across the UK as a whole, Barclays has announced a £bn lending fund as part of a series of initiatives to help small and medium-sized businessesto succeed and flourish through Brexit and beyond.Only older colleaguescan remember the perils of railway journeys interrupted by a one hour stop at Goraghwood station, close to Newry, while all passengers were asked by customs officersthey had ‘anything to declare’. More affluent older travellers would more likely recall the cross-border queuing requirement for the predecessor of the ‘green card’ for cars. Today, the challenge is of how to deliver the political agreement that the border on this island should be either frictionless or non-existent as the UK plans to leave the EU. In the new era there will be redefined relations between NI and the Republic, within the framework of UK-EU relations. The important part lies in negotiations on working arrangements that have not yet officially started.For the remaining part of  and going into , the business scene might be described as getting ‘ready for le after Brexit’.In the last three years the business community which forms the core of the private sector in Northern Ireland has been trading successfully.  The evidence from local reviews of the larger profit making businesses has been encouraging. Year-on-year turnover has been increasing faster than inflation and, even more critically, profitability has been maintained and often improved.Work to identy how well locally owned and controlled businesses have performed has been reassuring. To be included in the review of the Top  more profitable Northern Ireland business, which will be published in more detail, the cut-off point has risen to just on £m annual pre-tax profits. In a further reassuring feature and in contrast to the preceding year, during the year  the number of business casualties fell to a very small number.While the overall performance of businesses in the private sector has been better than is sometimes appreciated, there is a mixture of features in the complex matrix of business performance. The evidence is often from personal subjective sources but the elements do point to a consistent pattern. Businesses have been trading, in general, with improved profits but with turnover rather less buoyant. Employment has been increasing, now more slowly, but pay rateshave not fully recovered from the fall in real earnings in the past decade. Interestingly at a regional and national level, changes in wage rates have not shown the boost of an inflationary increase that might have been expected when unemployment levels have fallen to near record lows.Bargaining in the labour market has been restrained, probably influenced by the siren voices of emerging problems as the Brexit withdrawal agreement has dominated the political and economic policy agenda. This points to the emergence of a contrast between the trend in overall business profitability, which has improved, alongside the trend for inidual personal incomes to lag behind the real levels of the past decade. To a modest degree, business profitability may have improved relative to changes in the costs of the payroll.While the scale of the dference should be treated with caution, as business evolves during the rest of , business finance may be better placed to activate improving investment plans.The post-Brexit business scene should be pointing to reduced uncertainty, even with some predictable new business obstacles, and a helpful change in government economic policy to incentivise faster economic expansion. That prospect, alongside a business sector that has a stronger capacity to invest and grow, makes the months ahead more encouraging than many experts expect.In summary, the business sector is understandably anxious to see aof greater business stability and, for a mixture of reasons, may now be more likely to implement more ambitious investment programmes. Add to this combination the possibility that official Government economic policy will be more flexibleand there is a hope that, out of the recent grey clouds of possible recession, there will be incentives leading to a more buoyant economy here.Just one moment of caution: the brightness of a new dawn in  may be dimmedthe political processes constrain the application of improved economic policies through a refreshed local administration. Business has been performing well, despite the huge levels of uncertainty. However, the political environment could drown out an improving economy. That challenge has not changed.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/graham_11.jpg","title":"word from the wise graham lapsley","story":"Posted on Wednesday  May  by Ulster Business Name: Graham Lapsley, head of private banking, Danske Bank How did you start out in business   Banking has always been in my blood as my father joined Belfast Banking Co Ltdin . As a boy I remember being in Northern Bank branches ‘helping out’ when my father was completing regular evenings doing overtime. This was an environment that I was familiar with, although I didn’t ever think I would make banking a career. In  I found myself in Limavady branch and thoroughly enjoyed branch banking at a time when there were no computers, no autobanks and lots of staff. I’ve benefited from lots of dferent roles at the Bank in my career, each bringing its own challenges. I left my role as head of personal credit last year to take up my current position as head of private banking. What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far On a personal level changing job roles always brought new challenges. Change is a constant which I accept and while I’ve worked in Danske Bank for  years I have had senior roles in branch banking, wealth management, business banking, risk management and now private banking.   As an area manager in branch banking, I found the leadership of the transition from Australian ownership to Danish ownership in  a huge challenge. This change was as exciting as it was challenging as we benefited from huge investment and the Dane’s leading edge technology. I didn’t go directly from school to university, but I’ve been lucky enough to have had employer support to complete a business studies degree and a masters’ degree in executive leadership. I’ve also attended business schools in Boston, Lausanne and London, with each giving me new tools to add into my skill set.  How would you describe your management style  I am energetic and enthusiastic. I love working with our relationship managers and customers to build a financial solution. I am very results oriented and prefer a direct style. I am very self-awareand have a positive outlook.  What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I’m not sure that I would change anything. I’ve learnt from my mistakes and that made me a better banker in the long term. Perhaps my ambition in my early career took me into roles that didn’t match my skill sets, but I did take away vital learnings from these experiences  Have you done it all on your own  Absolutely not. My we Sonya and family have always been a great support and this enabled me to have a good work le balance. I have a strong network personally and professionally, which is mutually supportive. I’ve also been lucky enough to have worked with many leaders who have greatly inspired me.  What’s more important, your product or your people  In Private Banking, without a doubt our people. We are a people business and our strength in Private Banking rests with the professionalism of the private banking team. We offer premium relationship management to our private banking customers, supported by leading edge digital solutions. Our customers value our expertise and the ability to meet up in person to discuss financial plans.  What makes your business stand out from the competition  There are numerous competitors in the marketplace, but we are the biggest private banking relationship management team in Northern Ireland. Danske is also the leading corporate and business bank in Northern Ireland, and many of these customers have their personal needs looked after by my private banking team.  What piece of advice would you give to a  year old you  You’ll never be judged on what happens to you, but you will be judged on how you react to it. And you won’t get the experience you need, until the day after you needed it.

I’ve heard employers bemoan the fact that this generation can’t communicate face-to-face or they place more emphasis on their passions outside of work than their own career development.While some of this is no doubt grounded in their experience, employers perhaps need to adjust how they engage with the new generation beyond just offering them quirky perks and trendy working environments. Hays recently sponsored The GoodIdea, the biggest ever AI hackathon in NI organised by AINIand Hackily – a two-day event hosted by QUB School of Computing and Ulster University Magee campus for around  hackers in Belfast and  in Derry.The hackathon provided a welcoming and collaborative environment for hackers to build out brilliant, innovative, and impactful ideas using AI under a theme of ‘AI for good’, where hackers were challenged to utilise open data sources to create an innovative solution to a real-world problem.It was an opportunity for students – who made up % of the attendees – and experienced professionals to meet fellow hackers, learn new technologies, and work alongside seasoned mentors.Far from being underwhelmed by Generation Z, we were inspired by the talent pools from dferent backgrounds such as computer science, physics and maths, coming together to collaborate with each other, learn about bleeding edge technologies and also to put their skills to use in creating something that was a benefit to society. For example, one of the teams invented an algorithm for a computer to read British sign language using a webcam.These were ambitious, driven, competitive young people who worked brilliantly in their teams and certainly didn’t struggle to communicate, eventhey arrived alone and joined a team. A team from Glasgow made the journey across to take part and the hackathon ran right through Saturday night – so we couldn’t fault their work ethic.There were prizes, mentorship and funding available to the winners of the hackathon, as well as recruitment advice and workshops provided to students and professionals by Hays’ own experts across software development, data engineering and cyber security.But the main attraction was undoubtedly in the opportunity to co-create new ideas about how to apply technology to the world they will run in future. That is hugely positive and our challenge as employers must be to make sure the students who will be the candidates of the future in NI’s thriving tech community are encouraged to put that passion into their careers.The undergraduate community is an under-served community of future leaders in terms of recruitment and our desire is to equip undergraduates with the right understanding of what employers in the tech sector want and how they can build their personal brand for the future.Employers need to get past the myths about Generation Z and focus on helping younger employees find meaning in their workthey are to unlock their potential.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/5g1.jpg","title":"belfast to get superfast g mobile broadband this month","story":"Posted on Wednesday  May  by John Mulgrew Suzanne Wylie, Belfast City Council with Karen Dundas, EE Victoria Square store manager Belfast is to become one of six UK cities to get superfast G mobile broadband later this month, it has emerged.

G is key to making our ambitions a reality. It will drive our economy forward and enable Belfast to thrive in the fourth industrial revolution. Being one of the first G enabled cities in the UK is an exciting prospect for us, and will bring our businesses and citizens the best mobile connectivity in Europe. “G connectivity will ensure our city remains competitive, indigenous businesses grow and big global brands continue to build their businesses in Belfast and support our ongoing digital advancement.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
