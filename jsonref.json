In his resignation tweet he said he hoped the “media learn to stop selective quoting”. However, when put in its proper context, Sabisky’s track record is far more damning than the out-of-context quotes for which he has been criticised, leaving Cummings and Downing Street with serious questions to answer.The press rightly seized on his comments about race “science” and IQ, enforced contraception and support for eugenics (the concept of improving the genetic health of humans by excluding “inferior” genetic groups and promoting “superior” ones). But it’s just as important that we pay attention to where he made those comments – in the online world of alt-right subcultures that fellow Hope Not Hate researchers and I have been exploring in our latest book The International Alt-Right: Fascism for the 21st Century?. Even though Sabisky himself is gone, the milieu in which his views developed has not.Many of the most prominent iniduals pushing modern race science have come from within the international alt-right. One of the niche pseudoscientific theories popular in such circles is “human bioersity” (HBD), which argues that there are differences in intelligence between races, based on genes – despite this theory being repeatedly debunked. A key figure within the so-called “HBD-o-sphere” is a blogger called “HBD Chick”. And it was on her website that Sabisky wrote, in 2014, that “there are excellent reasons to think the very real racial differences in intelligence are significantly – even mostly – genetic in origin, though the degree is of course a very serious subject of scholarly debate”.Equally revealing is the title of the blog under which Sabisky made his comment: “in the dark about the dark enlightenment”. The Dark Enlightenment is a name given to a far-right movement that promotes a little-known ideology called neo-reaction or NRx. This is a largely online, far-right political subculture that emerged over the past two decades from the broader “reactosphere”, taking shape as bloggers realised that their views on gender, race, religion, governance and much more all shared a rejection of the liberal democratic attitudes that had grown in the west following the Enlightenment. Sabisky wrote that “the Dark Enlightenment is a silly and hyperbolic term for what should be fairly uncontroversial at this point”, yet most people would be disturbed by its core NRx ideas.Neo-reaction is a very strange, marginal and extreme far-right ideology. It foresees a shift from globalised, multicultural liberal democracies with Enlightenment principles to competing states, run by dictatorships or monarchies, where ethnic groups live apart to ensure they are “preserved” and humans are transformed using sophisticated technology. Taking inspiration from NRx “thinkers” such as Nick Land and Curtis Yarvin, the NRx movement see this as not just unavoidable but also desirable.Though best thought of as a disparate blogosphere rather than a cohesive movement, it has acted as both a tributary into the alt-right and as a key constituent part. While it does not share the public profile of the broader alt-right – the NRx community is essentially limited to small, obscure forums and blogs – it has found adherents and supporters in big tech and Silicon Valley.There is evidence to suggest that Sabisky is even more broadly sympathetic to the NRx movement. In a 2017 blog for the International Business Times, he lamented Twitter’s clampdown on the infamous meme Pepe the Frog, which has long been used as a mascot for alt-right and far-right groups to spread racist, Islamophobic and antisemitic content online. In the article, he praised Land, the philosopher and amphetamine enthusiast considered the founding father of the NRx movement. Previously an academic at Warwick University in the 1990s, he went on to become a core NRx figure after publishing an online manifesto entitled The Dark Enlightenment in 2012. He acquired something of a cult following while becoming increasingly racist and propagating very far-right ideas. Yet Sabisky writes, “The present writer has followed Land for the last few years, and never once has his conduct been anything other than entirely praiseworthy.”It’s clear, too, that Sabisky has spent some years reading and commenting on alt-right websites. In 2014, he commented on an article on the Unz Review, a website popular with alt-right racists and antisemites that has run Holocaust denial and pseudo-race science and hosts a blog by Steve Sailer, the alt-right’s go-to person on race science, who is often credited with coining the term “human bioersity”.Looking at the evidence, it starts to appear that Sabisky may not just hold unacceptable and abhorrent views in isolation but that he may actually be a neo-reactionary or alt-right believer. The idea that someone from these movements managed to become an adviser to Downing Street, if only briefly, is genuinely shocking and further evidence of how once marginal alt-right ideas have crept towards the mainstream.• Joe Mulhall is head of research at Hope Not Hate"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab055e8df068cfa49e9b42f27809ad3bf6768fb2/120_0_3531_2121/master/3531.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56e955f0102fed664f732cb21d89cca5","title":"instagram caroline flack celebrity grief","story":"As the line between celebrity and reality continues to blur, the grief we feel is changing tooCaroline Flack has become a familiar figure in the lives of fans of Love Island, like me, over the past five years. She was in our living rooms every summer and, for those of us who use social media, on our phones almost every day.Through Instagram stories, we watched her on nights out, playing with her dog, singing at a piano and celebrating her 40th birthday. I had private thoughts about her boyfriends, her taste, and her presenting style. My friends and I occasionally discussed her as if she were an acquaintance on the periphery of our social circle. Her posts were similar to those we would share ourselves.Like many others I’ve spoken to, I’ve been surprised by how hard the news of her death has hit. Of course, it doesn’t come close to the pain of those who actually knew her. But the grief feels somehow different from previous sadness over the death of a celebrity. For fans of Amy Winehouse, her music soundtracked their lives but they didn’t know what the inside of her flat was like. We may have watched all of Robin Williams’s films, but we never knew the man behind the comedy.Through social media, Flack chose to make herself accessible to us in ways earlier celebrities could not. Her flaws, vulnerabilities and romantic struggles were laid bare. In the online arena where relatability is king, her candidness succeeded in keeping us engaged: the less perfect she was, the more there was to connect with or, in less generous moments, to talk about.But in truth we knew very little. Our impression of her – as someone with loving friends, and a rich and interesting life – seems so at odds with a person who would take their own life, the loneliest act possible. Suddenly the shallowness of our understanding became sickeningly clear.All we have left in her absence are the things written about her: freshly published tributes  and a backlog of negative articles (one posted the day before she died was hurriedly deleted). Just as her celebrity and social media presence allowed us to feel a connection to her, it led parts of the press to act as if they owned her. She opened her life and they raked over her every move for more and more stories.We’re left to contemplate our place in this ecosystem: were we passive observers or culpable consumers of this content? We didn’t write anything mean. We loved her show, chucked her some likes on Instagram. But we were invested in her life, and that meant we sometimes consumed the bad press as well as the good.The tabloids couldn’t have done less to disguise their glee at her fall from grace. The upcoming trial would have provided intimate details to be reported, twisted and ridiculed. And the truth is, I would probably have read some of it. So would many of the other millions who followed her on social media. If you’re happy to watch someone blowing out their birthday candles, why wouldn’t you be interested in that same person being charged with a serious crime?There are, obviously, no easy answers. It’s too late to reverse the way we’ve opened up our lives, and in turn inserted ourselves into those of others. It’s unrealistic to ask celebrities to shut out the fans who have got them to where they are and it is unfair to blame people for enjoying the intimacy they believe they share. We’re as trapped in the web of TV, tabloids and social media as those we follow. But no matter how enticing the gossip may be, we need to stop incentivising the tabloid press to treat anyone in the public eye as fair game, just because they try to let us into their lives.Even if we try to consume celebrity culture more ethically, the fact remains that we have entered new territory in our relationship to stars. Flack’s death comes as less and less of our lives are treated as off limits. As the line between celebrity and reality continues to blur, so do our feelings. We should be ready for more of this new, complex, grief.• In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

While they would happily accept that thumbing their noses at the public for rejecting Labour was counterproductive, they never applied the same logic to their own party’s membership, too often regarding them as a delusional, ideologically crazed cult.In this leadership election, the three remaining candidates understand that this is a self-defeating strategy. They recognise that Labour’s membership has two priorities: to preserve the core policies of the Jeremy Corbyn era, and to defeat the Tories to secure power. Members see no contradiction between these two aims, and indeed polls support that view.After Starmer was interviewed in his living room – which boasted a set of drapes familiar to the shadow chancellor – John McDonnell quipped it was “Continuity McDonnell. I am pleased that the leadership candidates are largely following my policies but replicating my curtains as well demonstrates total hegemony.” The commitments provoked pushback, both publicly from centrist commentators and privately from some of Starmer’s backers. The attitude towards Starmer from the right of the parliamentary Labour party ranges from goodwill – partly relief at the Corbyn project facing internal defeat – to deep cynicism, which has only been heightened by the pledges.Starmer’s team are emphatic that the pledges are both an attempt to reassure members and an authentic expression of his politics. But while they emphasise a breadth of support – ranging from the Old Labour right to two-time Corbyn voters – that could forge some desperately needed unity, it does raise questions about whether this is an unwieldy coalition. Someone will surely have to be disappointed: the question is, who, and how quickly? Starmer’s opponents argue that while his support is broad, it is also soft and lacking enthusiasm. There is also exasperation from the rival camps that while the two women in the race are being criticised for their unabashed support for trans rights, the sole man isn’t facing detailed scrutiny on the issue.While Starmer’s team believe there is a general consensus on policy within the party, the Labour right may not be so easily disregarded. Much depends on who Starmer appoints to his shadow cabinet, which remains entirely unclear. While his campaign emphasises that he would appoint a shadow chancellor in accordance with his own views – pointing to the departure of Sajid Javid as evidence of what happens when the top two posts are not working as one – the left fear the appointment of someone like Yvette Cooper. That would instantly signal a return to technocratic Brownism and a strong departure from existing policies. If Starmer triumphs, as is likely, the left will undoubtedly treat the 10 pledges as sacred red lines the leadership cannot cross. If a rightward shift takes place, it would be self-defeating, leaving the new leader looking weak, unprincipled and cynical.Nandy started her campaign with a strong set of media performances and is the only candidate who held out against a second referendum. The message her campaign has been keen to promote is of not tacking left or right, of avoiding a tokenistic shopping lists of policies, and of encouraging a sort of grassroots participation that her campaign believes Corbyn did not pull off effectively. But she raised considerable hackles on Newsnight’s hustings when she claimed Labour had failed to promote investment in buses – it was in fact a key manifesto commitment – and spoke of the party promising “to nationalise everything”, then later raising her hand to support public ownership. Her rival teams viewed this as an attempt to fill the space vacated by Jess Phillips and to peel off Starmer supporters disillusioned by his commitment to core Corbyn policies. Nandy’s allies rebut this – protesting that she is firmly of the left, just wishing to make radical policies workable. None of that makes it clear what her manifesto would look like.Long-Bailey’s team are acutely aware that it’s the middle third of the Labour membership they need to persuade: those who backed Corbyn, who are traumatised by defeat and have been persuaded by Starmer’s camp that he is more electable. Their task is threefold: to present Long-Bailey as the most trustworthy custodian of Labour’s policies, pointing to her work on the green new deal to rebut claims she lacks charisma, sharing clips of her being relatable and jokey in interview clips and rallies and to present her as well placed to win back Labour’s “red wall” seats because she was someone who wasn’t an architect of the party’s second referendum policy.The latter is a particular challenge: most Labour members remain convinced the party was correct to shift on Brexit. With a hung parliament no longer an issue, Long-Bailey’s campaign believes the focus must be on building a strong movement in the country, particularly in communities that voted leave. Despite unfair claims that she simply represents “continuity Corbynism”, Long-Bailey has developed a clear critique of what went wrong in the election, not least the lack of a clear vision or narrative. Her challenge remains persuading Corbyn voters who have defected to Starmer that her leadership would sufficiently break with the mistakes of the past so far, she has not succeeded in doing so.It may well be that the legacy of Corbynism is a lasting shift towards economic radicalism in the Labour party. But the durability of those policies is not guaranteed, and if the Labour left is on the eve of losing power, its new role will be to organise to defend them. Long-Bailey’s campaign director, Jon Lansman, founded Momentum in the knowledge that it would be needed when the left no longer occupied the Labour leader’s office. That idea may soon be tested."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd5df91bfe87b79d963388d6436f8709d530b008/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27b1d8706c27012bda50df79dce6972a","title":"free schools shut want permanent home greenwich","story":"Greenwich academy is latest to close – and angry parents say it should never have been allowed to openLouise Grace’s two children, aged 13 and 11, spent more than a week off school last term suffering from anxiety. Their school, the International Academy of Greenwich (IAG), is earmarked for closure and the worry of watching it happen – friends taking up places elsewhere, teachers leaving – is affecting both children badly, their mother says.“My daughter is so upset by it all: she is losing her friends and she is worried about going to a new school, with her GCSEs about to start. She is despondent about the whole process,” says Grace.“My son seemed to be holding it in,” she adds. “But before Christmas, he said: ‘We were told by the school that it wouldn’t close, and you told me there would be a school for me. You let me down,’ and then he just shut himself in his room.”Now Grace, a single parent, has given up her job, concerned she would otherwise be unable to support her worried children, and fearful about the logistics of trying to find them new school places.Since November, when the IAG became the latest free school to announce its closure, parents of more than 200 pupils have been scrambling for places at other secondaries.One mother says her son sobbed after being told he had to leave, while for another family, the closure has been a key factor in their decision to move from the UK.Many parents now say free schools should never have been allowed to open without planning permission for permanent buildings. The IAG families believe they are at the sharp end of the free school policy, which has been the government’s main vehicle for opening new schools in England since 2011. There have been success stories, such as the Michaela free school in north London, but the failures – of which there have been plenty – are traumatic for those affected.Overall, 27 free schools have had to close or change management. Sometimes children have been left with little or no education for weeks following a school closure while their parents search for a place elsewhere.Since 2016, some 92 schools have opened in temporary accommodation and of these, just 27 have moved into a permanent home. Last year alone, 25 schools opened on a temporary site.Some of the locations have been eyebrow-raising. One free school opened next to an airport runway another in a building about which officials had expressed multiple safety concerns.Abacus Belsize school, in London, has spent six years in temporary premises while a planning dispute rages over its proposed move into a former police station, bought for £14m and approved by Boris Johnson as mayor of London.A primary free school in Croydon was recently graded “inadequate” by Ofsted, with children being taught in portable buildings since 2014. And Southwark free school, again backed by Johnson, closed in 2017 after five years as it, too, had never managed to find a permanent home.The IAG’s story is the latest example of how the free schools policy can be undermined by poor planning. It was allowed to open in September 2016 in an office building owned by a church while waiting for its new building on playing fields – a location, on protected metropolitan open land prone to flooding, that was highly controversial.Meanwhile, the DfE ploughed money into the school’s temporary premises, paying the church £395,000 in rent each year – £1,500 per pupil. Parents, many of whom were attracted to IAG because it offered the international baccalaureate curriculum, were told not to worry. Yet emails released under freedom of information show that by last April, Greenwich planning officials were telling the DfE that they did not think there was a case to open the school. While in 2018 Greenwich had stated that there was a shortage of school places, now it was now saying there was not.Sure enough, in July last year council planners refused permission for the playing fields site, provoking uproar among the IAG’s parents and pupils. With ministers saying the school could not continue long term in its temporary premises, its closure was announced.The IAG, which as of last term had 267 year 7-10 pupils, will close for years 7-9 this summer, with year 10 pupils, who have started their GCSEs, finishing them at the school next year. Pupils have been given no guarantees of places elsewhere, and some parents have moved their children into private education. Kate Simpson is emigrating with her family to Toronto, where she grew up, although she had hoped to stay in London until her son, Cameron, 11, had completed high school. “We are devastated that the school is closing. Our decision to leave it is no reflection on its incredible teachers. It’s the system that’s the problem.”Another parent, Michaela Barnes (not her real name), has managed to find her son a place elsewhere, but only after he had started at the IAG and she had bought his uniform. On the evening of his first and last day at IAG he was “curled up on the floor, in the foetal position, sobbing”, she says.Peter Godden, who has moved his son, aged 14, to a private school, says: “The government let these schools open in temporary buildings, then let them fall by the wayside when planning permission was not given. It’s scandalous.”Comments from the DfE and Greenwich council indicate they were at loggerheads. Greenwich says: “This regrettable situation has arisen due to the Department for Education granting permission for a school with no permanent accommodation to open ... the Royal Borough of Greenwich is working closely with Lewisham council to ensure that the pupils, families and staff affected … receive co-ordinated and comprehensive support.”This will ring hollow for the IAG families. Grace, who has found her children a place at an under-subscribed secondary for September, says: “This has destroyed my faith in the education system. Those in charge genuinely don’t seem to care about the impact on children of schools closing: it is just a political game to them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5df5c67b60187b1dc4182eadbc5d29c249a87dd/0_238_7134_4280/master/7134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afd412f41a9e381fef722c3bd9dd790f","title":"renewables barely feature building programme schools solar panels","story":"Solar panels, heat pumps and sustainable designs bypassed – but now one Somerset school is taking a standIt is a modernist version of a log cabin nestling in a busy south London suburb – and it is about to make history. The new building for Hackbridge primary, in Sutton, opens next week as England’s first zero-carbon school, able to produce and conserve as much energy as it uses, and even put unused electricity generated back into the grid.With its wood frame and cladding, solar panels, pumps to collect heat from the ground, and insulation made from recycled newspaper, it is the first school in England to meet the ambitious Passivhaus Plus low-energy design standard.“The school will have no net demand on an annual basis, for electricity and no gas connection,” Architype, the architects, say.Sadly, however, only a handful of the 500-plus schools being rebuilt or refurbished across the county through the government’s £4.3bn priority school building programme are installing renewable energy technology – and the Department for Education’s (DfE’s) recommended designs do not include renewables. Hackbridge’s new building was subsidised by Sutton council as part of its broader environmental strategy.High Weald academy, in Cranbrook, Kent, is one school whose new buildings, officially opened last month, do not have the technology to harness green energy. And in Birmingham, work is being completed on new buildings for Colmers school and sixth form college to offer “modern facilities” with an emphasis on “quality and innovation throughout the building programme”. Again, there are no solar panels or heat pumps, two of the most cost-effective ways of harnessing green energy.In Watford, Hertfordshire, Westfield academy’s light and airy building, opened three years ago, was hailed by its headteacher, Tim Body, as “a remarkable new building for the 21st century”. It has a fully equipped design and technology rooms, ICT suites, a professional theatre, dance studio and a modern beauty salon. It, too, is not equipped to harness green energy.In fact, of the 260 schools rebuilt or replaced across England between 2015-19 in the first phase of the programme, very few use renewable energy – nor do most of the further 277 schools being refurbished in the second building phase to 2021.But one secondary, in Somerset, is taking a stand, rejecting the plans for its rebuild, unveiled last month, on the grounds that the design does not meet the aspirations of parents, pupils and staff to protect the planet. They say new premises for Kingsmead, the 880-pupil secondary school in Wiveliscombe, Taunton, provide an opportunity to make carbon savings and reduce energy bills.Liz Pow, the school’s director of finance and operations, says: “Unfortunately, as the project is managed by the Department for Education, we don’t have any input into the energy efficiency of the build. The topic of renewable energy was raised several times during the consultation process as students, staff, parents and the wider community feel it should be an important feature of any new school.”Mark Blaker, an independent district councillor, has written to Rebecca Pow, the local Conservative MP and a junior environment minister, asking her to intervene. “This will be the biggest building for a 10-mile radius. It will be a statement of our community aspirations and our hopes for generations of young people to come. Ignoring the economic and environmental benefits of renewable energy in the much-needed new building feels like a betrayal of those aspirations,” he says.Colin Diamond, professor of education at Birmingham University and a former Kingsmead parent and governor, says: “It’s astonishing to learn that the DfE is not leading by example here. It continues to procure new school buildings with no apparent awareness of sustainability and regenerative economics. This is a golden opportunity to create a carbon-neutral learning environment where students can find out about energy efficiency first hand in their own community school.”Caroline Buckingham, a member of the ethics and sustainable group of the Royal Institute of British Architects, explains that contractors and designers on the DfE’s priority programme work to generic briefs. “The frameworks go out to contractors who have usually built lots of schools and have got meeting the DfE’s standards down to a fine art. There are no bells and whistles, no wriggle room for innovation because these buildings were approved during times of austerity, based on pound per square metre,” she says.“Sometimes you get a really good local authority that is pushing sustainable building and includes renewable technologies, but it is usually for smaller primary or special schools.” James Eades, operations director of the energy consultancy firm Energymyway, says school roofs are usually perfect for solar panels – but the people paying for the build may not be interested in reducing ongoing running costs.Changes in government policy, such as the reduction in 2016 in the price paid for solar energy exported to the grid, have hit the industry hard in England – since then, the number of registered installers has gone down from 5,000 to 1,600, he says.“However, since the Extinction Rebellion demonstrations we have been getting more inquiries for solar panels from people who want it for environmental reasons, not purely on investment grounds,” he says. “Often when schools fit panels to existing buildings, it is the parent teacher associations that fund them.” As school buildings are occupied during daylight hours, electricity can be used as it is generated. On present prices, the costs of panel installation, between £38,000 and £50,000, would be recouped within five to seven years respectively, he says.The DfE, however, says its priority build programme does address environmental performance. “Reduction in energy use in new buildings is a key priority and DfE-delivered schools are designed to be straightforward buildings, easy to use with simple built forms which adopt a ‘fabric first’ approach limiting the amount of energy required in their operation,” said a spokeswoman. The DfE is working with Innovate UK, the quasi-government innovation agency, to develop a model of sustainable future schools, she adds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f69d6df5393019d437c692181ac8b3414f8ca83/0_36_960_576/master/960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed70165f9679e3d916ecb12e9b54afef","title":"what four years at sea taught me about our relationship to the ocean","story":"Oceans are central to the story of civilisation – so why do so many of us feel disconnected from them?It was on day 11, I think, that I stopped getting out of bed at all. I had already let my hygiene standards slip to the point that a large knot was starting to form in my hair. Later my mother would have to cut it out with scissors. She didn’t mind. We were all in the same boat.I was nine years old, and nearly two weeks into sailing across the Atlantic with my family. My father had sailed all his life, and introduced my mother to it and they spent years preparing to sail around the world. Including my little sister, that made four of us aboard a 52ft yacht – our home for four years from 2000, in which time we got from Dorset to New Zealand.The longest period we spent entirely at sea was 21 days, and we did so twice: from La Gomera in the Canary Islands to Barbados, and then from the Galápagos Islands to Nuku Hiva, in French Polynesia. The first trip I remember spending mostly in bed, below deck in the dark, listening to Wings on cassette, forging a new relationship to time.I grew used to observing the ebb and flow of my thoughts with a languor that today would probably be praised as meditative. The days slid by, mostly unbroken except for meals – you came to really anticipate meals – and milestones: quarter-way, halfway, crossing the equator, which we marked with little parties.Not long after the sun had gone down, you’d go to sleep – partly because artificial light drained the boat’s battery, and partly because the sooner you went to sleep, the sooner another day would pass, and the sooner you would arrive. (I was lucky – being nine, I was spared night watch. My parents slept in alternating shifts of two hours for the whole journey.)When we finally reached Bridgetown in Barbados, and set foot on land for the first time in three weeks, my knees wobbled, bracing for the next wave that didn’t come.That transatlantic crossing is a well-trodden path, from 15th-century navigators from Italy and Spain to Greta Thunberg’s voyage to New York last year. All of history, in fact, can be charted from the world’s oceans, as David Abulafia attempts in The Boundless Sea: A Human History of the Oceans, a 1,000-page doorstopper that he nonetheless makes no pretence is either “complete or comprehensive”.Connections made by sea “have brought together peoples, religions and civilisations” through conquest and colonisation, migration and trade, writes Abulafia, an emeritus professor of Mediterranean history at Cambridge – and in the process changed the world. Much of it has been driven simply by curiosity, and the desire to accumulate knowledge, he says.“Even if you go back to the time before Christopher Columbus, when the open Atlantic was very little known, the myths and assumptions that developed about it – the ‘sea of darkness’ and then, on the other hand, ‘the isles of the blessed’ – the fascination with what lies beyond the horizon was certainly an important part.”I see elements of that in my father, whose 50-year passion for sailing goes well beyond what you might call a hobby. “He’s only happy at sea,” says Mum, who is happy at sea, but also in her garden, or at a concert hall, or with her children.My parents remain “liveaboards”, sailing international waters from New Zealand. For them, it is a lifestyle that they have opted into, a way to see the world from a relatively unique vantage point.Yet for most of history there has also been “a mercenary dimension” to ocean exploration, says Abulafia, “the wish to exploit”: “You know you’re taking risks, but these are risks that can bring you the most fantastic returns.” Maritime trade has been more productive and enduring than the Silk Road in the 16th century, shipping spices from India proved so lucrative for Portugal that the Portuguese king made disclosing the route punishable by death.At many levels, the story of civilisation is a story of the seas – but it is easy to overlook that from land. Most people, even those who live by the coast, have no more personal connection to the sea than the limited or conditional view afforded by a passion for water sports, say, or the odd trip to the seaside. A more intimate relationship can be incompatible with conventional ways of life and maybe – the knot in my hair might attest – its quality.At the same time it changes you, in what can feel like a very profound way. It was only relatively recently, I’m embarrassed to say, that I realised that my experience was not universally shared – that not everyone had known the open ocean, with no land in sight in any direction for many miles. No other boats, either – just endless sea, sometimes even indistinguishable from sky an expanse of grey or blue, entirely uninterrupted, except by you.It is hard to convey what that feels like, the effect that it can have. You feel dwarfed and insignificant, of course – but the mind cannot hold on to reverence for long. I remember it more often playing tricks on me, registering patterns and shapes in the movements of the wave – my brain determinedly generating interest, overlaying meaning, as though it could not make sense of there being only water everywhere.Even as a child, though, there was something about being at sea that made me feel well: more vital, clear-headed. In fact the benefits of “blue space”, for body and mind, have been established by decades of research, from environmental factors such as more vitamin D and less polluted air and the increased activity that tends to go with being in nature.More significant is the psychologically restorative effect, where the movement of water – its literal immersiveness – can force attention outwards, beyond the self. But these effects on mood tend to be most acute at coastal margins, where the sea meets the land. “The optimal environment has both,” says Dr Mathew White, an environmental psychologist with BlueHealth. “If you’ve ever been on a cruise, or crossed to France, it’s pretty boring out there when you can’t see the coast.”As a crew member on the inaugural voyage from New York to Macau in 1784 grumbled of their smooth passage: “It has been one dreary waste of sky \u0026amp water, without a pleasing sight to cheer us.” Abulafia paraphrased: “One went to sea for excitement, and all that happened was that the captain fell against a railing and bruised his head and arm.” He suspects that some ships’ diarists exaggerated the risk of storms and shipwreck so as to enliven accounts “of a flat sea and neutral sky for days and days”.Yet, in imagining a life at sea, most people seem less inclined to think of tedium than terror. Many have told me that the thought of being stranded in the open ocean is one of their greatest fears I’m not sure that they would single out being lost in a forest, for example, or on a snowy mountain in the same way, though all three landscapes are alien and potentially dangerous.In fact the first question I am most often asked about my childhood is “Were there any storms?” or, more to the point: “Were you scared?” The answers are yes, only one, a freak occurrence overnight and no – I slept through it. My parents were highly risk-averse, setting out for sea only when the weather forecast was favourable and they had supplies – food, medical, electrical – to account for every possible eventuality.The exhaustive (and expensive) logistics tend to be glossed over in the other image people have of being at sea – the romantic one, of chucking it all in and sailing off into the sunset. Whether or not this idea appeals to you was found by data scientists at the dating app OkCupid to be one of the strongest predictors of romantic compatibility I know enough to answer no.Both scenarios, the worst-case and the rose-tinted, are telling of the disconnect most people feel from the ocean. A sense of trepidation has figured in seafaring through history, except among those whose knowledge and mastery of the ocean was evolved over several millennia to seem almost innate – the early Polynesian navigators of the Pacific, the ancestors of the New Zealand Māori and Hawaiians.Even if my parents have wanderlust in their DNA, I’m not sure it was handed down to me. Though I spent the first half of my life sailing, I acquired none of the skills – I couldn’t even manage a bowline knot. I have blamed it on my being a child, but the truth is I have never had any interest in boats beyond as a means of accessing the open ocean.I still feel a strong connection to the sea – but it has been challenging to maintain in my adult life, from the tower block in south London where I now live. When I am struggling to get to sleep I play ocean sounds through my phone, a crude attempt to simulate the limitlessness, even transcendence, I remember feeling out in open water.The ocean presents a potential passage through history, like handling an ancient piece of pottery only more so, because it “is alive, like a person”, to paraphrase an Indigenous Australian saying. You can be claimed by the sea without drowning. I feel its absence on a bodily level like a mineral deficiency, and make regular visits to the coast to “top up”, as the geographer Catherine Kelly evocatively put it. Now, although long-distance passenger travel by sea has become almost unheard of, Thunberg’s voyage across the Atlantic, and the growing “no-fly” movement to cut down on carbon emissions, could suggest turning tides.The oceans face considerable challenges themselves, from plastic pollution and deep-sea oil drilling, to unsustainable shipping and fishing. The rising acidity of the Pacific Ocean is causing crabs’ shells to dissolve. Warming temperatures have already opened up new trade routes over the top of Russia and Canada. We face the beginning of a new chapter in the history of oceans – for us along with them.Abulafia notes that rising sea levels have been suggested as a precipitating factor in past migration, forcing people to go in search of new land. A study last year predicted that warming temperatures will raise sea levels by 30cm by the end of the century, on top of the contribution from melting ice and glaciers.These are uncharted waters that humanity is navigating – but not, there is some comfort in acknowledging, for the first time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5f753ca5ff97d41d7e51546055fec3608a53350/0_1432_3750_2248/master/3750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a40bf2d0093ba9f60d1a1e0b348ce13","title":"bibas barbara hulanicki when youre designing you have to blank yourself out","story":"The designer and founder on starting out in London in 1964 and being inspired by Marlene Dietrich and Audrey HepburnThis look was very Biba: satin was our big thing.

Parasite is a fable about economic equality, which means there are many lessons that we as a society should take from it.And when I say “we”, I obviously mean “rich people”. Extremely wealthy people like you and me have plenty to learn from Parasite. In fact, Parasite pretty much doubles as a blueprint of everything you shouldn’t do if, like us, you enjoy a life of preposterous material privilege. I can’t speak for the rest of you millionaires, but here’s what I took from the film.Obviously, this article is going to feature a ton of spoilers. It should only be read by those who have seen Parasite and are also richer than their wildest dreams.This is by far the most important point. Insulated by their wealth and connections, the Park family accept member after member of the Kim family into their home based on nothing more solid than a badly photoshopped college degree. This, clearly, was a grave error. When you find yourself in a position of hiring private staff, always remember to follow up on references. Make the phone calls. Check the universities. Sniff the certificate. Does it carry the traditional cigarette and body odour smell of a downtown PC Bang? Speaking of which …Park Dong-ik came so close to discovering the scam at the heart of Parasite, by understanding that poor people ultimately smell much worse than rich people. The problem he had was that he didn’t ever follow up on it. Time and time again, his suspicions were raised by the stench of his impoverished driver, but time and time again he failed to act on it. Should you ever encounter a person who smells as if they don’t cross an arbitrary earnings threshold, do the right thing and jettison them from your life.You know when Parasite could have been over? When Park Chung-sook calls home after her family holiday ends in disaster. Her call, you’ll remember, was made to instruct her staff to make her a bowl of instant noodles. But had she not done that – had she possessed the vigour of mind to boil her own water and cook her own noodles – then she would have caught the Kims lolling around in her house and banished them for good. The lesson here is to always remain humble enough to boil your own water. But nothing more complicated than that, because that’s why you have staff.The Park’s living room table is so gigantic that an entire family of interlopers could comfortably hide beneath it for an entire night, right under their noses. If you, like them, splash your cash on impractically large furnishings that could provide cover for intruders, then, frankly, you’re asking for trouble. You can buy Perspex coffee tables now. Why not just do that instead, you idiot?Ultimately, would Parasite have happened if that had been any other house? No, of course not. Namgoong Hyeonja’s home might have been a masterpiece of architecture, but it also had an underground bunker where an entire family could secretly live. Always, always, when buying a house, check the floor plan to see if there’s any way a poor family could hide inside the cavities. Or, better yet, just buy an apartment. Or a bungalow. Or live in a hut. Or a tent. Bingo, you’ve just saved yourself a murder."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12f1e4d6e90a9792735076cad79ba52bc8199334/0_0_5162_3098/master/5162.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f5ec5d961ed61fb02dbacf4aabb438f","title":"how to make cooking for one fun","story":"Solo cooking is liberating: you only have to please yourself, and it’s an opportunity to experiment – and spoil yourself• Do you have a culinary dilemma? Email feast@theCooking for one can often feel a bit sad. How do I make it more fun? Dave, BrightonWriters lead pretty solitary lives – working alone more or less comes with the turf – and those who write about their, and our, tea are no exception. According to Diana Henry, a leading light of the modern genre, perhaps the single most important aspect of cooking for one is to view it as an opportunity: “You don’t have to please anyone but yourself,” she says, “and that’s a real bonus. And plan your meals for the week, so you have things to look forward to.” In that respect, at least, solo cooking isn’t that much different from any other kind. “Some food writers, notably Nigel Slater, are very good at dishes for one or two,” Henry adds, “so go through your cookbooks marking up dishes you love the look of but have never made. This is your chance to try them.”Henry, who now has all of 12 recipe books under her belt – the latest is the current bestseller From The Oven to the Table – says Dave also has to accept that there’s no overnight cure. “It’ll take a while to shift from the baked potato or ready-meal mindset. I’ve cooked just for myself for periods of time, when the kids have been away, and grew to love it. Eventually.” Her eureka moment came when she started buying ingredients she’d never have considered had she been cooking for a crowd. “I’d only ever looked on them as luxurious or expensive,” she says, “but supper suddenly looks a lot more enticing when you know you’re having wild mushrooms or scallops. Once you see cooking for yourself as a chance to have a treat, you start both to cook better and to look forward to it.”Valentine Warner, whose new book, The Consolation of Food, is an intriguing collection of culinary reflections and recipes, says the key is to look on it much as you might solo dining out. “Many people, myself included, can think of nothing better than eating alone in a restaurant with only a book for company, and similar principles apply at home.” Take cheese on toast, he says: even an apparently minor upgrade such as going to the effort of making a proper rarebit instead can lift the spirits hugely. “In fact, toast is a generally underrated vehicle for all manner of delicious passengers. I’m so obsessed with putting good things on toast that it’s now an all-consuming passion in my kitchen.”On a practical level, of course, some dishes should be left well alone. “Any kind of braise or a big roast is way too much for one person to work through,” Henry says, “but pasta, risotto, fillets of fish, or even a small whole fish – red mullet, bream, mackerel – are perfect.” And if you really can’t do without poultry, she says, cook chicken thighs or a small whole bird. “You do need a plan for the leftovers, though.” Duck breasts, pork escalopes and lamb fillets are other good options, she says. “And if you’re having eggs, don’t stick just to scrambled – bake them with a little cream, say, or make an omelette and fill it with smoked haddock, leeks and cheddar.”It may be stating the bleeding obvious, Warner says, but as with any meal, it’s not all about the food, either the atmosphere in which you eat it is almost as significant. “Solo cooking is an ideal opportunity to roll out the red carpet every now and then.” Once or twice a week, he says, make sure you lay the table properly, uncork a good bottle of wine, light a candle, fold a proper napkin. “And for heaven’s sake don’t eat in the middle of whatever mess you’ve got piled up on the kitchen table,” Henry adds. “That’s just bloody sad, and will only dampen the mood.”Failing all that, Warner says, there is one guaranteed way to bring a buzz to the solo meal. “Cook naked!” he says. “If nothing else, it adds a certain frisson to otherwise mundane tasks such as peeling spuds or grating cheese.” Just be extra-careful, though: the potential repercussions don’t bear thinking about.• Do you have a culinary dilemma?

Klopp has claimed Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain are bigger favourites for this season’s competition than his runaway Premier League leaders, who will become the first English team in history to reach three consecutive European CupChampions League finals should they reach this season’s showpiece at the home of their 2005 triumph. But he admits there is no better place or opponents for Liverpool to reaffirm their European credentials than away at Diego Simeone’s Atlético.“We don’t feel like the winners of last year’s tournament, we feel like contenders for this year’s, and we want to show that,” the Liverpool manager said. “We want to be there in Istanbul if possible, and for that we know we have to work our socks off, historically and for us in general. That is exactly what we will do tomorrow and in the return leg.”Liverpool have never lost a knockout tie in Europe under Klopp – 10 fixtures in total – or a knockout tie in the Champions League since losing against Chelsea in the 2008-09 quarter-finals. “It’s impressive to be honest, that record,” said Klopp, who believes the fragile nature of the knockout stages adds an extra competitive edge to Liverpool’s game.“It looks like it,” he said. “And some of the best games we played were away. Bayern was one of the best games I have ever witnessed, and so was Barcelona, even though we lost 3-0. If we can get a result, we know Anfield is a proper threat and a help. That’s the story so far. It doesn’t mean it will be the same this time. If there is a team where you have to be at your absolute best at all times, it’s Atlético because they give no presents. Absolutely no presents. If you work as hard as possible, then you have a chance. If you don’t do that, then you don’t even have a chance.“They defend in a specific way but on the other hand I don’t think they played against a team like us and we should not forget that. We combine a few things we are not badly organised we play football we have respect for different aspects of the game our readiness to fight is exceptional.”Klopp discounted Atlético’s struggles this season as the inevitable consequence of a transition season having lost several of the big-name talents that helped them to the 2014 and 2016 finals. And he retains firm admiration for Simeone, whose demonstrative touchline behaviour overshadows even that of the Liverpool manager.“People say I am emotional on the sideline,” said Klopp. “If I am level four I would say he is level 12. I am really like the kindergarten cop against him. He has been here eight years. That is really long, and still having this emotional level, wow. That is really impressive. His teams are always world-class organised. That makes him one of the best. We have exchanged messages after big games. We meet in a competitive game for the first time. It will be interesting, really interesting.”Trent Alexander-Arnold, who Cafu claimed at the weekend could win the Ballon d’Or, admits Liverpool know that one mistake against Atlético could signal the end of their dreams of a hat-trick of Champions League finals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9324b2b589d3a5facd74fe9d409c527601be9c80/46_70_1341_804/master/1341.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7eda8e29d588ecd76f4cb7047d78f818","title":"chelsea fans patience with frank lampard not infinite dissent manchester united","story":"There was a murmur of dissent at the defeat by Manchester United and the excuses for a mediocre team will soon run outJust briefly, for no more than a couple of seconds, there was a murmur of dissent directed at Frank Lampard by the home crowd. It came midway through the second half as Olivier Giroud was brought on for Michy Batshuayi. Up went the ironic roar: why had the French World Cup winner not been brought on sooner? But then by that stage Chelsea fans were greeting most things, particularly decisions by the referee Anthony Taylor that went their way, with ironic cheers. If a VAR call had favoured them, or Batshuayi had scored a goal, the roof would have come off.Still, the moment seemed telling, in part because the question is so obvious – Giroud may be 33, and he may have a history of missing big chances in the biggest games, but why has he been limited to just 304 minutes of football this season when those favoured by Lampard have been so erratic in front of goal of late? – and in part because it suggested Chelsea’s patience with Lampard may not be infinite.The defeat by Manchester United on Monday night was, in fairness, not a time to blame Lampard. This was a game of which the outcome felt fanciful in the extreme: dramatically speaking, it simply did not convince. It began with Chelsea, Batshuayi in particular, missing chances, which is reasonable enough. The Belgian has had 15 shots this season and scored with one of them, the distillation of a wider problem with finishing at Chelsea in terms of goals scored, only Watford are underperforming their expected goals by a wider margin.There then followed a trio of refereeingVAR decisions that seemed almost designed to disprove the assumption that it would be a cold, all-seeing eye that dealt only in facts, weighing players in the balance and passing godlike justice. As it turns out, all gods are essentially human in conception and VAR is no different: this deity has a cruel and capricious sense of humour.Even before any of VAR’s interventions, there was a non‑intervention as Willian was booked for ing on the edge of the box. It seemed he had been fouled but because the incident took place a fraction outside the box, VAR was powerless to intervene. Six inches closer to goal and the booking would have been overturned and a penalty awarded. As it was, VAR simply took water and washed its hands before the multitude, saying: “I am innocent of the card to this just person, see you to it.”Two goals then disallowed, one for a tight but understandable offside, the other for a push by César Azpilicueta that itself seemed the domino effect of a push by Fred – do pushes in the box, like handballs, now matter to a differing degree according to whether they are perpetrated by an attacking or defending player? – were not even the end of it. That Harry Maguire should have scored the decisive second having not been sent off for thrusting his boot into the groin of Batshuayi about three feet in front of Lampard – this was within VAR’s jurisdiction, it just chose on this occasion to spare the England defender, reasoning perhaps that by that stage there were several thousand people in the ground who would willingly have clouted the profligate forward amidships – was a devastating coup de grace.So there were plenty of mitigating factors. But if a manager is going to lose three times in a season to Ole Gunnar Solskjær, there had better be.In the league Chelsea have lost five times at home this season and won only four of their past 14 games. That they remain fourth when extrapolating their points per game suggests they are on course for just 60 points this season – a total that would usually lead to a side finishing seventh or eighth – says everything about the splodge of mediocrity at the heart of the Premier League this season. It may be that this ends up being the strongest bottom five in the league’s history, but it will almost certainly be the worst team ever to finish fourth.For now Lampard’s status as a much-loved former player, allied to a recognition of the difficulties of operating within a transfer ban in the summer when the club’s best player of the last decade was sold, continue to insulate him. But however unfortunate they were on Monday, there must also be an acknowledgement that Chelsea to an extent made themselves vulnerable.The problems defending set plays have dogged Chelsea all season. Like the problems defending counterattacks, that ultimately is an issue of organisation. Aaron Wan-Bissaka had previously registered one assist all season: the opening goal came from only his ninth accurate cross of 2019-20, and yet he drifted easily past Willian and was given time to measure his delivery. That, and the poor finishing, suggest a lack of that indefinable quality that so often sets the best above the rest: an edge, a confidence, a ruthlessness, a capacity just to get the job done.At some point the absence of that is going to end up being blamed on the management. There were plenty of mitigating factors on Monday, but soon the excuses are going to run out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/082c6c905423a11c8d59607dc415bd48a1af2f82/0_0_5250_3150/master/5250.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4120c6b49722de607304a4aac91c9f1","title":"have you had to live with an ex","story":"Tell us if you have had to continue living in the same property with your ex, we’d like to hear about it.

Tears are, they say, feminine, self-indulgent and melodramatic. It is not hard to notice, in those beliefs, the patriarchal assumptions about what should be valued and what should be mocked. Writing teachers will instruct students not to show their characters’ sadness through crying, calling it cheap. On the other hand, there are those who proclaim the necessity of “a good cry”, who indignantly defend weeping of all varieties and who see tearfulness almost as an identity. “I’m a crier,” they declare, praising its soul-cleansing effects. “Get over it,” their opponents instruct, demanding the shift toward progress and action that they believe crying prevents.But rather than looking at tears with a predetermined belief in their value, or away from them in embarrassment or disgust, it can be clarifying to look through, into or around tears, to trace the small and large patterns that they create and reveal.Not all tears are alike. The human body produces three kinds: basal, which form an oily layer over the eyeball to keep it from drying out reflex, which appear when an eye is bothered by cutting onions or a speck of dust and needs to flush the irritant away and psychogenic, which are shed for emotional reasons. Notably, emotional tears have a higher protein level than basal and reflex tears, which makes them thicker and causes them to fall more slowly.This thickness intrigues me. The longer it takes for these tears to travel down a cheek, the greater the chance that they will be noticed by another person and their message perceived. Tears are a social signal.Some people disagree, arguing that humans also cry alone. But even without a witness, tears streak outwards, seeking care. That message can be socially directed toward the self sometimes a solitary crier will wrap their arms around themselves, creating their own soothing embrace. One might, in those moments, think of the poet Arthur Rimbaud’s declaration: “I is an other.” Sometimes, a person is the sender and the recipient of the crying signal.What the social signal of tears makes happen varies from culture to culture and depends on the identities, access to power and beliefs of the crier and their witnesses. Think of the “school resource officer” who was called to the classroom of a crying seven-year-old African American boy and put the child in handcuffs. Think of the white police officer who cried in court when she spoke of killing an African American man in his home, and the hug she later received from the African American judge.Tears often serve as a lubricant in the wheels of white supremacy. Many people (including Brittney Cooper and Ruby Hamad) have written about the harm of white women’s tears – how they have contributed to a long history of violence towards black people, indigenous people and people of colour.Doctors have their own precise frames in which to interpret people’s tears. They can hang little paper tabs from a patient’s eyes to measure tear production, the slim rectangles slowly changing colour as the body does its work. When a psychiatrist is working to diagnose depression, she will ask a patient to describe his or her crying, offering a range of possibilities from: “I do not cry any more than I used to,” to: “I cry over every little thing,” before ending in numb dryness: “I feel like crying, but I can’t.” I am reminded of hypothermia, the growing, shivering pain that transforms just before death into a surprising warmth.My depression has yet to reach that dry state. Instead, when an episode is at its worst, I can find myself shaking with cries for an hour after something as simple as dropping a knife to the floor. I am learning to say these things with what I hope is neither pride nor shame. But tears have a habit of magnifying and distorting. Their very nature – their emotional origins – makes it difficult to express these feelings plainly.That is why I try, as much as possible, to say what tears do. Tears can form an intimate bond between people. They can also create a disgusted separation. Their effect depends largely on the degree to which people share common stories about who they are and how the world works.I once read the claim that people sometimes cry from aesthetic experience, “such as the birth of a child or the unveiling of the latest Lamborghini”. Both examples bewilder me. I have gone through birth twice (once as child, once as mother) and I can’t figure out how it falls under the category of “aesthetic experience”. I should admit I have never seen a Lamborghini – newly unveiled or otherwise – but when I imagine one, I feel no inclination to cry. It is hard for me to imagine any possibility of connection with someone whose ideas of aesthetic tears differ so hugely from mine. Honestly, it is hard for me to imagine his tears at all. I have a feeling they are actually tiny Lamborghinis running down his face.The tears that seem most full of potential are those that surprise by breaking out of expected and systemic patterns, revealing the small and strange undercurrents in which people daily resist larger tides. This kind of crying neither confirms what I already find emotionally compelling nor leaves me rolling my eyes. Instead, it points toward new possibilities for understanding, new combinations of ideas. When my child was a toddler, she cried one day because the lemon she wanted to eat would not remain whole. Why did this move me so? I think because, looking through the lens of her tears, the lemon became more real to me than it had been since my own toddlerhood. It was not a commodity, not a metaphor from which to extract a lesson about sweetness. It was utterly itself, brightly containing its wholeness and its destruction. An impossible lemon – of course she was crying.Perhaps you have noticed that it is almost impossible to sing and cry at the same time. The throat muscles cannot simultaneously obey the command to shape notes and the command to hold themselves open to maximise oxygen intake (a command that crying provokes unconsciously). This leads me to believe that the opposite of crying is not laughter (those two, I would argue, are sisters), but song. As a poet and as a human living on a planet careering ever more deeply and unevenly into capitalism-induced horrors, I want to attend to both: the moments of singing the moments when a voice breaks.I have been thinking about breaking points a lot lately, in part because of a conversation with the Iranian-American poet Kaveh Akbar about the limits of the English language and all the violence that has occurred in its tongue. Recently, he sent me a lecture he had just given on this subject, delivered as the US again threatened Iran with war. He wrote that English is “a technology that has been used to promote and protect genocides, chattel slavery, ecological decimation, the building and deployment of nuclear weapons and more. That’s our paint.”Crying occurs when people have reached the limit of what can be said in words and what they are capable of managing on their own. This does not mean that their words up to that moment are necessarily good or true or to be trusted, but it does signify that a breaking point has been reached. It means that it is time to pay attention to the systems the tears point towards.The subject rewards that attention. Years into my research, I still found myself learning surprising new ways of understanding crying, physically and metaphorically. For instance, it turns out that the lump in your throat when tears are imminent is not a lump at all. Obeying the imperative to keep breathing through distress, the muscles of the throat work to stay open. When you try to swallow, the muscles resist, creating the sensation of an obstruction. Some people find relief in this fact – that their throat won’t close up, that their body is taking care of them and bringing them much-needed air. What if we could look at crying in the same way – not as a stopping point, but a passageway? What if we could look through crying to understand the abundance of patterns – of joy, oppression, grief, beauty, violence and transformative potential – that tears have the power to reveal?The Crying Book by Heather Christle is published by Corsair.

They include making the premium bonds prize fund rate less generous.“This is another kick in the teeth for savers,” said Baroness Altmann, the former pensions minister.The Times quoted her as saying: “Many people, especially older generations, have used NS\u0026ampI all their lives and know it is safe, so they want to keep their money in those accounts … It seems the government is sanctioning rate cuts in NS\u0026ampI that will allow banks to continue to offer very poor rates without driving more savers away.”The odds of any £1 bond number winning any prize will decrease from 24,5001 to 26,0001 from the May 2020 draw onwards. Around 173,718 fewer premium bond prizes will be handed out in May, compared with February.It means, for example, that there will be five £100,000 prizes up for grabs in the May draw, down from six in February. And there will be around 13,448 £100 prizes on offer in May, down from 27,221 in February, NS\u0026ampI said.Various bond rates are also being chopped, including guaranteed growth bonds and guaranteed income bonds.NS\u0026ampI said customers holding guaranteed growth bonds, guaranteed income bonds and fixed interest savings certificates, and whose investments mature on or before 1 June 2020 and who automatically renew into a new issue of the same term, will receive the previous, higher interest rate.But customers renewing into a new issue but a term of a different length will receive the reduced interest rate effective from 1 May.NS\u0026ampI said the changes will ensure it is positioned appropriately against its competitors and help maintain the stability of the broader financial services sector. NS\u0026ampI chief executive Ian Ackerley said: “Reducing interest rates is always a difficult decision.“We need to ensure our interest rates are set at an appropriate position against those of our competitors.

That’s primarily down to 1991’s indie-dance ur text Screamadelica and, by proxy, Andrew Weatherall. Yes, you’ve surely heard Loaded a million times by now. If compos mentis (not necessarily a given), you can probably anticipate every part’s arrival: the bongos, the lightning-bolt riffs, the girl-group harmonies, each hiccup of the loping bassline, a defiant Peter Fonda igniting a conga line that’s snaked nonstop for 30 years. While Alan McGee was doling out ecstasy pills and Inner City to a proselytising Bobby Gillespie, a still green Weatherall was behind the desk, making it all gel. Even if Andy had hung up his headphones after Screamadelica, his legend would have been enshrined.Weatherall was a master of tension and release, whose latter-day sets would stretch for hour after hour, then often continue semi-announced in a nearby pub the next day. Even so, resting on little more than a rumbling bassline and some muffled speech for half the runtime of this languorous Saint Etienne remix was a bold move. The track is cleaved in two by a brief speech about spliffs (typical) before kicking into action, but you find yourself pining to run the bloodshot buildup from the edge. That chest-rattling bass is the star never was Weatherall closer to King Tubby, one of his all-time favourites, than here.Though Weatherall turned in just the third ever BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix back in 1993, his 1996 entry is usually held up as not only his own best, but one of the finest in the series’s history, a masterclass in depth and poise. There are four cuts in the tracklist from Two Lone Swordsmen – his then recently formed group with Keith Tenniswood, which proved the most durable and creatively rewarding of all Weatherall’s many alliances – including an introductory airing to the classic Glide By Shooting. With a subaquatic melody, an undercurrent of wibbling noise and a haunted air about it, it is pretty strange for a deep house song. It also slaps, and sounds even more robust as it hurtles past early on in the mix – a testament to Weatherall’s ability to constantly improve on source material even when it was his own.For all the grand mythologising around Boy’s Own and its role in inducing a Balearic culture shock to the British Isles, the reason Weatherall, Pete Heller and Terry Farley worked so well as a production unit can be broken down fairly simply: Heller and Farley brought the soul, Weatherall brought the edge. Released under the copyright-winking Bocca Juniors with Hugo Nicolson also at the desk, Raise shows off a somewhat messy synergy that stands up surprisingly well. It has a similar attitude to Weatherall and Paul Oakenfold’s Club Mix of Happy Mondays’ Hallelujah, but balances the cocksure strut with Anna Haigh’s commandeering vocals and a hip-housey rap interlude (hey, it was 1990). That nagging piano line was another of Weatherall’s canny nabs, pinched from Thrashing Doves’ Je$u$ on the Payroll, though banged out on a grand piano that FFRR records had paid £1,000 to rent for the day. When it comes to capturing the punch-the-sky euphoria of a glorious summer day, this is the one.A Two Lone Swordsmen tune in all but name, Explode arrived on a 12-inch for lowkey label Firewire, as part of a split-release series that also included British electro veteran Carl Finlow, and Percy X, who Weatherall remixed in the mid-90s under the alias of Blood Sugar, a duo with longtime Jah Wobble collaborator David Harrow. Adding extra grit to the taut, claustrophobic, occasionally circuit-fried machine funk that the Swordsmen nailed on their 2000 standout LP Tiny Reminders, this twitchy cut demonstrates that the duo could make nicotine-stained basement bangers with the best of them. It’s been a favourite of Detroit’s Drexciya survivor DJ Stingray for ages – expect to hear it caned by jocks of all stripes this year in Weatherall’s honour.There’s no real consensus as to the best entry point for Weatherall’s catalogue, but I’d wager that the Sabres of Paradise, his short-lived trio with Gary Burns and Jagz Kooner, is a natural starting point. Sabresonic (1993) and Sabresonic II (1995) function like a map of club music, encompassing bleep and bass, depth-charge dub techno, progressive house epics, trance via Goa and Frankfurt, and even downtempo detours into the chillout room. Inter-Lergen-Ten-Ko II manages to get everything under a nine-minute roof with an almost symphonic approach, a breaksy soundsystem punisher that features live percussion and oddball effects to send you west. Though a committed psychonaut in the mid-90s, Weatherall still had an acute sense of when something was a little too much. The dramatic rave vocal treads a fine line of naffness, but is ultimately anchored by the reinforced steel of the production undergirding it. A hair-raiser, then and now.Over time, Weatherall evolved into a global ringleader of a slo-mo dance music we might call the Chug: daring, but a dark art if you can master it. You can hear his influence all over Ivan Smagghe, Manfredas, the tag team of Lena Willikens and Vladimir Ivkovic, and other midtempo specialists. To offset the risk of playing at lower speeds to crowds who were, as Weatherall would often laugh, on loads of drugs, he would go for records with unassailable presence. This edit of Hardway Brothers – a group including Sean Johnston, his partner in club night A Love from Outer Space – was particularly lysergic, wielding a gurgling 303 that could induce cold sweats from 10 paces. At just 103bpm, it would be compliant with ALFOS’ imposed ceiling of 122bpm tops, while carrying enough character to blast away songs twice as fast.Part of Weatherall’s enduring appeal was just how far out he stood. The incongruity of this salt’n’pepper-bearded, chain-smoking, vaguely vaudevillian figure, and an audience of saucer-eyed young ravers conditioned to expect something different as their DJ hero of the weekend, was part of the fun. This disjunct could be a lot of fun in his output, too. Ricardo Villalobos’s Dexter is a minimal techno classic, with a sour central refrain known to instantly melt fields of addled ravers into floods of tears. It’s the kind of tune it’s usually forbidden to touch, let alone retool. So you imagine Villalobos, himself no stranger to a wayward remix, would have raised a smile when he received the test pressing from Two Lone Swordsmen and found his scene-defining hit had been reborn as a cousin of the Cure’s A Forest.My Bloody Valentine’s strength lay not just in their noise – fearsome, but ultimately replicable – but their ability to procure beauty out of it. No one except Weatherall could have heard this slab of gliding shoegaze and thought, “Hey there’s a funky jam in there,” much less made good on it. Lifting heavily from Alarm Clock, a hit for Berlin’s proto-techno star WestBam, Weatherall lets Kevin Shields’ strangled riff spurt and fizz and jig atop a legitimately groovy backbeat. Taming the world’s loudest and most unerringly perfectionist band into a song this effortless earned him awe and unwanted attention from hapless indie outfits over the next three decades, as they queued up hoping that a sprinkle of Weatherall magic could transform their haircuts and shoes into something substantive.The quintessential Weatherall record might not be one most think of immediately. Fuck Buttons, whose marriage of techno grandeur, DIY scuzz, coruscating textures and beatific melodies burned bright and briefly at the end of the 00s, had all the trappings of a perfect Weatherall storm. His production on their second album, Tarot Sport, unlocked their potential. That the LP’s shimmering highlight, Olympians, actually wound up as part of the 2012 London Olympics’ opening ceremony, airing to a billion people, was a wonderfully Weatherallian insurrection on the mainstream. But most of all, it sounds like the kind of adventure Weatherall always seemed to be steering, and encouraging others to embark on. Olympians is a euphoric voyage on an ocean of beautiful noise, a fitting anthem for the man whose arms were inscribed with his ever-guiding motto: “Fail We May, Sail We Must.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97531905b8d0fb26c40ad8e403eabbde159b07c5/0_74_2873_1723/master/2873.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6a08cf110bdea0eb0bf3efffe699e55","title":"can the fashion industry ever be sustainable","story":"Environmental journalist Lucy Siegle has been writing about the fashion industry for 15 years.

Revoking my EU citizenship as a result of Brexit is an unfair curtailment of my rights. John Catron, 65, education consultant, YorkI am all for it. Losing freedom of movement is one of the most gutting things about Brexit. I’ve been trying desperately to find a sliver of Irish ancestry to get an Irish passport in order keep my freedom of movement. I’ve not had much luck unfortunately. Added to that, my boyfriend is Irish so if we do decide to move to Europe, it’s highly likely that will hold us back. Also, it’s a shame that UK students could be studying alongside European students and not have the same post-degree work opportunities. Everything about Brexit is incredibly depressing, this is the chink of light I’ve been looking for. Henrietta Rowlatt, 40, radio producer, ManchesterI would be ecstatic to have it as I will be devastated to lose it when the transition period ends. I think it is essential to continue European integration and mix cultures to end racial ision and promote unity, as well as offering chances to live study and travel across Europe. I think it’s important to create a solitary European entity, abandoning tiny borders and worn out traditions from the past and bringing everyone under one common modern item – being European. Jake Cocksedge, 20, student, Wimbotsham, NorfolkI’m all in favour. I’ve lived and worked in Spain since 1991 and was fortunately able to vote in June 2016, due to having worked a couple of months in the UK in 2008. Many of my friends here were denied a vote by the 15-year rule. How is it fair or democratic that they should be denied freedom of movement because of an election they couldn’t even participate in? My Spanish partner and I enjoy travelling a lot and it is going to be just ridiculous for us to have to pass through different passport controls. The fact that she can continue to live anywhere she wants in the EU, while I can’t due to something I bitterly oppose is stupid. Paul Giblin, 55, working in MadridAs someone who voted to join Europe all those years ago and also voted to remain in the recent, extremely ill-advised referendum, I’m all for maintaining whatever links we can with Europe whilst we continue to to try and extricate ourselves from the current, populist, political mess for which we are solely responsible. I seem to remember thinking at the time that, however shameful the debate leading up to the referendum was, the fact that so many of the Brits livingworking in Europe and all of the Europeans living working in the UK were excluded from voting was even more shameful – so any small actions we can take to redress the balance would be welcome. Iain Buchanan, 70+, retired, EdinburghThis would perhaps go some way towards appeasing people who voted remain. I will never understand nor condone leaving the EU, but if I could have the option to apply for associate citizenship and maintain at least some of the benefits of EU membership then I would feel less as if something had been stolen from me. It would be optional, so people in favour of a hard Brexit will not be ‘forced’ to be part of the EU, but equally I won’t be ‘forced’ to be entirely disassociated from something I wish we could stay a part of. I want my children to have the same access that I enjoyed growing up. Bethany Woodcock, 31, stay at home mum, KentIt is a wonderful idea! We British in Europe now find ourselves exiled and effectively without statehood thanks to Brexit. We always had conviction that the people of Europe would be kinder to us than our country of birth. The Europeans have been universally kind to us over the past three years, expressing fear and sympathy for us in our situation. Hilary Kirkby, 74, retired, FranceI think it’s a great idea. Forty eight per cent voted to remain in the EU and keep their freedom of movement rights. If the EU offered associated citizenship it would allow those who wish to keep the rights to do so. People like me were born EU citizens and it feels unfair to just lose our rights overnight. Edward Thomas, 24, unemployed, CreweI always valued our links with other European countries and am devastated that Britain is no longer a contributing member of this economic and cultural union. I would love to be able to retain my European citizenship. I desperately hope that some arrangement can be made to achieve this. So many of us did not vote to rip ourselves out of the EU and think that the UK government is making a very damaging mistake. Maintaining close links with Europe is an essential bond to so many of us. We feel no one is listening to us in this country, so thank you Sadiq Khan and Guy Verhofstadt.

Such a status would also protect rights in healthcare, welfare and workplace conditions and likely the right to vote in European parliament elections.Khan told reporters that he believed the idea had merit. “There’s an opportunity for us to move forward with this and I’ve been pleased with the response and it gives hope to London, as well as across our country”, he said, following meetings with EU officials.The chances of such an initiative making headway in the negotiations are extremely limited as it would be unlawful under EU legislation.There is unlikely to be appetite for any rewriting of treaties among the 27 member states, given the UK government’s hostile attitude to the free movement of EU nationals who wish to live and work in Britain.After 47 years and 30 days it is all over. As the clock strikes 11pm on Friday, the UK is officially orced from the EU and will begin trying to carve out a new global role as a sovereign nation. It was a union that got off to a tricky start and continued to be marked by the UK’s sometimes conflicted relationship with its neighbours. Here’s a run-through the beginning, the middle and the end.The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain’s entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a “deep-seated hostility” towards the European project.Sir Edward Heath\u0026nbspsigns the accession treaty giving entry to the EEC in an official ceremony that was accompanied by a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home.Lisa O\u0027CarrollMargaret Thatcher negotiated what became known as the UK rebate with other EU members after the iron lady marched into the former French royal palace at Fontainebleau to demand “our own money back” claiming for every £2 contributed we get only £1 back” despite being one of the “three poorer” members of the community.It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party.\u0026nbspCollapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU.Divisions between the UK and the EU deepened with Thatcher telling the Commons in an infamous speech it was ‘no, no, no’ to what she saw as Delors’ continued power grab. Rupert Murdoch’s Sun newspaper ratchets up its opposition to Europe with a two-fingered “Up yours Delors” front page.A collapse in the pound forced prime minister John Major and the then chancellor Norman Lamont to pull the UK out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism.On 1 January, customs checks and duties were removed across the bloc. Thatcher hailed the vision of “a single market without barriers – visible or invisible – giving you direct and unhindered access to the purchasing power of over 300 million of the world’s wealthiest and most prosperous people.Tory rebels vote against the treaty that paved the way for the creation of the European Union. John Major won the vote the following day in a pyrrhic victory.\u0026nbspTony Blair patches up the relationship. Signs up to social charter and workers\u0027 rights.Nigel Farage elected an MEP and immediately goes on the offensive in Brussels. “Our interests are best served by not being a member of this club,” he said in his maiden speech. “The level playing field is about as level as the decks of the Titanic after it hit an iceberg.”Chancellor Gordon Brown decides the UK will not join the euro.EU enlarges to to include eight countries of the former eastern bloc including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.EU expands again, allowing Romania and Bulgaria into the club.Anti-immigration hysteria seems to take hold with references to “cockroches” by Katie Hopkins in the Sun and tabloid headlines such as “How many more can we take?” and “Calais crisis: send in the dogs”.\u0026nbspDavid Cameron returns with reform package.Speaking at a joint press conference with Khan, Verhofstadt conceded that the biggest battle would be in persuading the member states to engage with the issue.Verhofstadt said that the UK would need to reciprocate. “My idea would be a proposal from the European side that is hopefully well received by by the UK side”, he said. “But first of all, let’s be very frank about it, we need to do a lot of work here in Europe to convince member states about that… Also from the UK side they should offer them the same possibilities and the same rights to EU citizens.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04f5b7acbd9fb5e633a5fccca3a6b8b1c948476f/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb7b536feb8ad8eea35572d2f6ff42cb","title":"uk brexit negotiator britain eu different planets","story":"Verhofstadt says it would be a ‘hell of a job’ to achieve success using David Frost’s approachBoris Johnson’s chief Brexit negotiator has been accused of treating the EU and the UK as if they are “living on two different planets” after vowing to break all regulatory ties with Brussels.Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister who has led the European parliament’s approach to Brexit, said it would be a “hell of a job” to secure a successful outcome from the negotiation using the British approach.“It’s not a good thing that we continue to discuss the future relationship as if the UK and Europe are living on two different planets because the UK market and the market are so close to each other – physically, geographically,” Verhofstadt told reporters during a joint press conference with Sadiq Khan. “And so, these things are so intense that we have to look at it in a little bit of a different way than to simply say, this is a pure free trade deal.”In a speech in the Belgian capital on Monday night, David Frost, Johnson’s chief Brexit negotiator, insisted the UK would not sign up to alignment with EU rules or any supervisory role for the European court of justice, adding that the two sides were “genuinely sovereign equals”.The EU’s draft negotiating mandate published earlier this month had sought non-regression from the UK on environmental, social and workers standards and “dynamic alignment” with Brussels’s state aid and competition rules.Frost said the government would only accept similar commitments to those contained in the trade agreement with Canada, under which there is an obligation to avoid trade distortions through reducing regulatory standards or allowing excessive industrial subsidies. He added that the UK was willing to trade on WTO terms, meaning significant tariffs on goods.Khan, who was on a visit to Brussels for meetings with senior officials, including the EU’s chief negotiator, voiced his own concerns about the UK government’s direction of travel while conceding that a campaign to rejoin the bloc was unrealistic in the “short to medium term”.“I accept we’ve now left the European Union. I suspect we will be ending the transition period at the end of December,” Khan said. “I think the key thing is in the short term, and medium term for us to make Brexit a success. You know I don’t want my country to suffer.”With the backing of Verhofstadt, the mayor of London, who is up for re-election this year, said the next best thing for Britons would be for the EU to offer “associate EU citizenship” for those who wanted it.The idea, first raised in 2016 by Verhofstadt, would involve continued freedom of movement and residence around the bloc for those who wished to retain such rights.

I wish it were so.”The home’s impeccably preserved frescoes contain images representing life and landscapes. Two other restored homes – House of the Europa Ship and House of the Orchard – have also been reopened.In addition, works to make the site more secure have been completed.“Pompeii is now completely safe and so the loss of further archaeological material can be avoided,” said Massimo Osanna, the park’s superintendent.Pompeii, which attracts almost 4 million visitors a year, has come a long way since 2013, when Unesco threatened to place it on its list of world heritage sites in peril unless Italian authorities improved its preservation.The threat followed several incidents over the previous years, including the collapse of the House of Gladiators and a several walls. Other shortcomings included a lack of qualified staff, structural damage and vandalism.The Great Pompeii Project also involved excavations at Regio V, a 21.8-hectare site to the north of the archaeological park. Work wrapped up towards the end of last year but over 18 months dozens of new discoveries were made, with one of the last major finds being a fresco depicting fighting gladiators. Human remains were also found, including the skeletons of two women and three children huddled together in a villa, as well as the remains of a harnessed horse and saddle.Meanwhile, the House of the Bicentenary, an ancient Roman domus at the archaeological site of Herculaneum, a town close to Pompeii that was also buried by Vesuvius, was reopened to the public in October after restoration works that lasted 35 years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73405e4b41da73e3631e401813c14ab9adb55f50/0_106_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6a15763f54e1e8bb8c623412ad302ce","title":"tell us have you been affected by the coronavirus","story":"If you have been affected or have any information or news tips for our journalists, we would like to hear from youA British couple on board the Diamond Princess, a cruise ship quarantined off the coast of Japan, have tested positive for the coronavirus.David Abel and his wife Sally have been publishing video diaries from the cruise ship since they were quarantined on 3 February.

Where does the truth lie? By  Sarah BoseleyGone With the Smoke is already no more than a distant whiff of bubblegum-flavoured vapour. The vape shop and lounge, one of many in San Francisco, has been forced to close. So have Vapor Den (“eclectic lounge \u0026amp hipster go-to”) and Happy Vape. From late January, it became illegal to sell e-cigarettes and e-liquids in San Francisco. Even online sales to addresses within the city limits have been stopped. Stores outside the city that dispatch e-cigarettes to an SF postcode will face prosecution.While vaping is banned, sales of legal marijuana and tobacco will continue as usual. San Francisco has often been considered more progressive than the rest of the US in its approach to drugs and unorthodox lifestyles: marijuana was legalised in California for medical use in 1996, after a campaign by Aids activists from the city, and for recreational use in 2016. Vaping, on the other hand, has crossed a line.“San Francisco has never been afraid to lead. That will always be the case when the health of our children is on the line,” announced the San Francisco city attorney Dennis Herrera in a statement after the ban was passed by the the city legislature last June. He was scathing about the FDA’s failure to control e-cigarette sales. “Now, youth vaping is an epidemic. If the federal government is not going to act to protect our kids, San Francisco will,” he said.A transatlantic schism has opened up over vaping and health. In the US, the war on vaping is being pursued by activists, politicians and scientists who believe that tobacco companies are cynically promoting e-cigarettes as a means to get people addicted to nicotine, which will – sooner or later – lead them to cigarettes. In the UK, anti-smoking campaigners and health experts counter that for many adult smokers, vaping offers the best hope of avoiding a premature death.Prof Ann McNeill of King’s College London, a tobacco and addiction expert who advises PHE, defends its position. “We are battling against misinformation on a massive scale,” she says. McNeill acknowledges there has been a rise in vaping among kids in the US and Canada, but does not see it as a reason for panic. “I don’t think it merits discussion of an ‘epidemic’. That word is overblown,” she said.There was fresh alarm in the US last year when 2,500 cases of lung disease and 55 deaths were associated with vaping. E-cigarettes work by heating liquid containing nicotine to produce vapour, which is then inhaled. There is no smoke or tar involved, but there are small amounts of chemical flavourings, including diacetyl, which has been linked to lung disease, and propylene glycol or vegetable glycerin. If the e-liquid overheats, formaldehyde can be formed. In fact, none of these chemicals were to blame in these cases – it turned out that the people who fell ill were using bootleg devices containing cannabis – but the reputational damage was done.In the wake of this alarming spate of hospitalisations and deaths, the New York state governor, Andrew Cuomo, took emergency action in September, attempting to ban flavoured e-cigarette products. President Trump entered the fray, telling the FDA to act and imposing a temporary ban on any flavours that might appeal to young people. In December, New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio, signed a law banning flavours. “Manufacturers of fruit and candy-flavoured e-cigarettes are intentionally and recklessly targeting young people,” said Cuomo, citing flavours including bubblegum, cotton candy and Captain Crunch. The state ban was overturned in January 2020 by Justice Catherine Cholakis, who said it was an overreach.In the UK, the NHS continues to edge as close as it can to approving the use of e-cigarettes to quit smoking. NHS hospitals in the West Midlands have sanctioned vape stores on the premises, while PHE launched, via YouTube, a video showing two white-coated experts with bell jars demonstrating how e-cigarettes are free of all the disgusting and damaging tar in a conventional cigarette.The science is furiously disputed. Academics on both sides are accused of cherry-picking data to suit their own prejudices. PHE is a global authority on health issues such as vaccination and obesity, but on vaping, it is looking increasingly isolated. Deborah Arnott, head of Action on Smoking and Health (Ash) in the UK, says that Britain is losing ground in the e-cigarette debate because of the virulent campaign in the US against vaping. “The noise is causing problems in how we are perceived,” Arnott said. “We’re being written off.”What should be settled by science has become a clash of faiths. In the US, the debate is dominated by those who believe people should “just say no” to drugs. In the UK, there is more support for the idea of “harm reduction”, in which addicts take controlled amounts of their drug, be it alcohol, heroin or in this case, nicotine, to keep them stable.PHE’s support for e-cigarettes as a tool to help people quit smoking is shared by other respected health bodies, such as the Royal College of Physicians and Cancer Research UK. They point out that the UK regulates smoking and vaping far more rigorously than the US. The UK has rules on age, and health warnings, and caps on the nicotine content. Marketing to young people is forbidden – e-cigarettes cannot be advertised on TV. There is less nicotine in Juul pods or e-cigarette cartridges sold in the UK: Juul in the US contains up to 59mg per ml, while nicotine levels in e-cigarettes across Europe are capped at 20mg per ml by an EU directive enshrined in British law. In the US, at this point, there is no middle ground between unrestricted sales and an outright ban.All sides agree that vaping nicotine is safer than getting it from cigarettes. Nicotine by itself is “relatively harmless”, according to the NHS, while the harm from cigarettes is in the smoke produced by burning tobacco and the residue of tar it leaves, which damages the airways, causing lung disease and cancer.“People smoke for nicotine but they die from the tar,” wrote Michael Russell, a professor in addiction at the Institute of Psychiatry in London and a pioneer of harm reduction, in 1976. His work laid the foundations for the introduction of nicotine replacement therapy – the nicotine patches and gum the NHS hands out today.Russell, who died in 2009, wanted to develop a low-tar cigarette that would be high in nicotine, to give smokers the hit they wanted without inhaling more deeply. His research on the low tar product was funded by the tobacco company RJ Reynolds, now owned by British American Tobacco (BAT). This relationship with a tobacco company, which Russell later claimed was normal practice at the time, is now seen as fatally compromising. It has since been used to undermine his research and attack his reputation.Ann McNeill, who worked with Russell as a young researcher, believes he was ahead of his time. “His pioneering research improved the quality of life of smokers and saved the lives of many more,” she said in a paper celebrating Russell, co-written with Debbie Robson of the UK Centre for Tobacco \u0026amp Alcohol Studies. “It is a sad indictment of our community that his work is still not recognised adequately by all those working in tobacco control, some of whom still fail to recognise the centrality of nicotine in tobacco use and the implications of this.”Anti-tobacco activists – whether they are for or against e-cigarettes – believe they are defending the gains they have made in the battle against smoking. Vaping’s defenders say the tobacco firms are ersifying into a product that won’t kill their customer base. Hardline opponents are convinced e-cigarette sales will keep the hated tobacco companies in business.Most scientists and health campaigners in the US will have no dealings with the tobacco industry, because of its history of devious marketing practices and underhand tactics. Under the terms of a World Health Organization (WHO) treaty in the early 00s, governments agree not to have any discussions with tobacco industry representatives (over trade terms, for example, taxation, regulation or investment). But anti-smoking campaigners now fear that, by promoting the benefit of their e-cigarettes as an alternative to smoking, tobacco companies are acquiring respectability. WHO shares that anxiety and has advised measures to control e-cigarettes. Many countries, including Brazil, Thailand, Singapore, the Seychelles and Uruguay, have banned e-cigarettes as a result, while others have imposed regulations limiting their use.A number of health professionals and academics have dedicated their careers to exposing lies about the safety of tobacco products and stopping the promotion of cigarettes around the world. Recent hard-won victories include smoking bans in public spaces and plain packaging with severe health warnings. Despite their efforts, there are still over 1 billion smokers in the world. The global cigarette market was worth $888bn (£682bn) in 2018 and forecast to rise to $1,124bn by 2024.Stanton Glantz, professor of medicine at the Center for Tobacco Control, Research and Education at the University of California San Francisco, is the loudest of the anti-tobacco lobbyists – in his choice of Hawaiian shirts as well as his pronouncements. Glantz claims he was agnostic when e-cigarettes first appeared. He isn’t now. In December, he tweeted: “Using e-cigs increases exposure to toxic chemicals for most users they would be better off just smoking.”This was a new extreme, even for Glantz. Alex Berezow, vice-president of scientific affairs at the American Council on Science and Health, described the tweet as “mind-boggling”. “Unfortunately, Dr Glantz has become something of an ideologue. His (justifiable) animosity toward the tobacco industry has been turned (unjustifiably) to other industries, such as vaping,” he wrote on his blog. The research paper that had prompted Glantz’s tweet, Berezow pointed out, actually shows that e-cigarette users get less exposure to toxic chemicals than tobacco smokers – not more.Glantz, who you have to interrupt if you want to ask a question, told me that in the tweet, he was talking about dual-users – people who are both smoking and vaping. “Maybe it was worded inarticulately,” he conceded. But he won’t back down. He claims the evidence suggests that most people are dual users (in the UK, about a third of vapers are still smoking as well, according to a survey by YouGov).“The Nutt paper had no evidence whatsoever. It was 12 guys who sat around and pulled that number out of the air,” said Glantz. “The most generous thing you can say about that paper is that it was much earlier in the process and there wasn’t a lot of evidence out there.” He believes the credibility of Nutt’s group has been undermined by revelations that they were part-funded by a consultancy called EuroSwiss Health, run by Delon Human, a South African doctor who has accepted funding from BAT for some of his ventures.Nutt, a professor in neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College London, says he is “saddened” by Glantz’s attacks. “He was a hero of mine. He was one of the pioneers in demolishing the myth that tobacco wasn’t addictive and opposing the fraud and misinformation and lies of the tobacco industry. But the problem is he is still basically playing the same tune and we’re now in a different era.” It’s proven impossible to stop people selling tobacco, Nutt said. “So the anti-tobacco people have got to attack something else, because that’s what they do – they attack and they ban. So basically they’ve fixed their wagons against vaping because it is one thing they can ban, and they’re very successful. It’s laughable that in India people go to prison for selling vaping when the government allows advertising of tobacco.”Glantz became an icon of the anti-tobacco movement after he received 4,000 leaked documents from Brown and Williamson, then the US’s third-biggest tobacco company, in 1994. They proved the industry knew that smoking caused cancer and had hidden it. Since then, Glantz has always objected vigorously to any compromise with the industry. In 1997, a deal was broached with the tobacco industry by Matt Myers of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. It would have brought in tight federal regulatory control of cigarettes, prohibiting the sort of advertising and marketing that is still ubiquitous in the US, as well as sales to children. But Glantz was opposed to any deal that would allow cigarette manufacturers to continue in business. His goal was to close them down altogether. Myers was stymied by his own allies, and the US still does not have the anti-tobacco regulations that are common in Europe.Myers is calm and quietly authoritative. He is not against harm reduction, he says. Nor are other public health bodies such as the American Cancer Society or the American Heart Association. “All of us have said that under appropriate circumstances, if e-cigarettes are shown to actually significantly help smokers quit or switch completely, and that there are rules in place to prevent them being marketed in a way that doesn’t unduly impact youth, we would be supportive,” he said.Up until now, on a national level, the US has had no regulatory control of e-cigarette sales, marketing, minimum age, or limits on nicotine content. “It’s the wild west,” said Myers. Tobacco-Free Kids has brought legal action against the FDA over its failure to regulate e-cigarette use and last year won a ruling from a federal judge that there was no excuse for further delay. The e-cigarette companies are irresponsible too, Myers added.In March 2018, Myers and Glantz, as well as representatives of PHE and almost every other influential anti-smoking scientist or campaigner, attended the World Conference on Tobacco or Health in Cape Town – just up the road from BAT’s South Africa HQ. At this meeting, held every two years, activists can discuss the perfidy of the industry, celebrate their successes and plan for the future.Nobody connected with the tobacco industry is allowed in the building. Clause 5.3 of the WHO’s Framework Convention for Tobacco Control, which came into force in 2005, lays down recommended anti-smoking measures for governments, from taxing cigarettes to marketing controls and smoking bans in enclosed public places. It has been signed by 168 countries (the US is a notable exception). Clause 5.3 says governments “need to be alert to any efforts by the tobacco industry to undermine or subvert tobacco control efforts” and must limit their contact to the absolute minimum. Activists now take this to mean there must be an impenetrable wall between themselves and anyone in any way connected with tobacco.The man who did as much as anyone to establish the Framework Convention while an executive director of WHO, Derek Yach – originally from Cape Town but now based in the US – finds himself on the wrong side of that wall. Yach was pointedly excluded from the conference in his home city – and yet much of the conversation was about him. Yach had done the unthinkable: accepting almost $1bn over 12 years from Philip Morris, makers of Marlboro and other leading brands, to set up his Foundation for a Smokefree World in New York in 2017 to fund research into alternatives to tobacco.Yach believes it’s in the tobacco companies’ interests to develop products that will leave conventional cigarettes behind. His erstwhile colleagues believe he is working for the devil. Why, they ask, does Philip Morris still sell cigarettes if it cares about the world’s health?As rumours circulated that Yach was in the building or lurking outside, Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York and funder of vast amounts of anti-tobacco science and programmes, was launching his own campaign. Striding down the hallway, flanked by purple banners emblazoned with the words Bloomberg Philanthropies, the financial backer of the conference and his entourage made their way to the TV cameras to discuss his Stop initiative. Bloomberg announced he has set aside $20m to counter the lies of the tobacco industry. Top of the watch list was Yach’s Foundation.Bloomberg helps pay for WHO’s work on tobacco. I was offered a five-minute audience – just long enough to ask if he thinks there’s a role for e-cigarettes in combating smoking. “It is like marijuana: one of the stupid things we’re doing is legalising it,” he said. “I think there’s no place for e-cigarettes. I think it’s a terrible idea.”Yach claims that “A-grade scientists and researchers around the world” are picking up grants from his foundation and doing useful work, but few believe he can succeed. He admits he was taken aback by the strength of feeling. “I wasn’t completely naive about it, but I didn’t actually appreciate how harsh it would be, particularly from a pretty small bunch of people who have incredible influence at WHO,” he says.Clive Bates, the former head of the UK’s Ash, who blogs and campaigns for e-cigarettes from his home in Nigeria – he is married to the British High Commissioner – said he was amazed by the anti-vaping anger in Cape Town. “It was like a cult, almost,” he said. “Particularly the attacks on the foundation. It’s quite an achievement for Derek to create an institution that has a worse reputation than Philip Morris.”In the UK, a small number of prominent public health academics vehemently oppose e-cigarettes. Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool, believe the tobacco companies are using e-cigarettes as a route back to respectability. Sally Davies, until recently the UK’s chief medical officer (the most senior government adviser on public health matters), backs a ban on flavours that might attract children. She’s worried that we don’t know the long-term health effects of vaping, which she described as a “ticking time bomb”.Ann McNeill says there is not much growth in vaping among kids in the UK. Her key concern would be a rise in vaping among young people who have never smoked, but there’s no sign of that. She thinks the key to reducing youth uptake is “getting adult smoking down”, because young people tend to imitate their elders’ behaviour. Of course, it did not satisfy the critics. When the researchers went back to the subjects after a year, most of the e-cigarette group were still vaping, whereas few of the ex-smokers in the other group were still chewing gum. So, they insisted, the study showed just how addictive e-cigarettes are.Juul, once the leading e-cigarette, is struggling against public outrage and bad press. Sales have dropped and hundreds of staff have been laid off. The company said to be worth $38bn in 2018 was written down to $24bn by Altria in October last year, and valued at just $19bn by one of its major investors, Tiger Global Management, in December.In the storm over child users, and anticipating an FDA ban, Juul stopped selling its fruit medley and mango flavours in the US in October and even dropped mint the following month. In January, the FDA acted, banning all flavours except tobacco and menthol from e-cigarettes that use a cartridge – as the Juul devices do. These are the devices kids use, said the FDA: flavours will not be banned from the refillable e-cigarettes that are more popular with adults. The FDA is also finally getting going on regulation, and has instructed manufacturers of e-cigarettes to apply for a right to trade by May.The WHO, taking its cue from the US and from Bloomberg, has advised countries to control vaping, warning about the unknown impact on health and stating that e-cigarettes are risky for teenage brains, as well as for the foetus. That may leave the UK isolated, a lone bastion where (highly regulated) vaping is actually encouraged in the hopes of cutting smoking rates. Many public health experts in the UK believe they are witnessing an unnecessary tragedy, and that failure to promote the most promising method of helping people quit smoking is endangering the lives of millions.McNeill insists public health experts in the UK do care about young people. But those whose lives are at risk are adults living in disadvantaged communities, who cannot kick their smoking habit. “I have lived with smokers and watched smokers die. You want them to do anything they can to prevent them from smoking.”• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49a085cdbc419d6f19657cc89cd82616f9a212a2/0_35_5136_3082/master/5136.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=227135b47f92cfd4713bee3c4937e8b2","title":"anya shrubsole world twenty20 t20 england cricket the spin","story":"After five heartbreaking exits, Shrubsole is determined to be playing in the MCG final on International Women’s DayIn 2009 a back injury forced the then-17-year-old Anya Shrubsole out of the World Twenty20. She had already been part of one World Cup-winning team – England having come back from Australia that March as champions in the 50-over format – but she was forced to watch from the sidelines as the team, as hosts, took a second title of the year. She has not missed a World Twenty20 since but England have not won again.Though in 2010 West Indies could claim joint responsibility, Australia have knocked England out of every World Twenty20 since the very first, beating them in three finals and a semi-final.Across the 37 T20 internationals the two countries have played over the past 15 years England have an 18-17 advantage, yet when it really matters results have been, from an English perspective, depressingly predictable. At the 2012 event the teams met twice: once in the group stage with both teams already qualified, and again in the final. No prizes for guessing which of those games stands as England’s only victory against Australia at the World Twenty20 since the 2009 semi-finals.All this history, and the added benefit of a psychology degree, should help Shrubsole to diagnose an inferiority complex if one exists, but she insists there is none. “They’re obviously a quality team and that’s shown by the number of titles that they’ve won, but I’ve always gone into those games thinking we’ve got the quality to win,” she says. “Between 2012 and 2014 we were having a lot of success against them in Ashes series, so there wasn’t a mental aspect or any kind of fear. We just came out second best on the day.” Days.On paper 2010 was the worst of Shrubsole’s five previous tournaments: “Hugely disappointing. We lost to an up-and-coming West Indies team and we lost to Australia on boundary countback and didn’t make it out of our group.”To briefly summarise the others, in 2012 England lost in the final: “That was probably the most disappointing of them all. I felt we were the best team throughout the tournament, had played really well and won all our games but we didn’t pull it together in the final.”Two years later came another final defeat, though Shrubsole had the consolation of being named player of the tournament: “We had our worst game of the tournament in the final, never got enough runs on the board and they chased it down easy, but with such a young, inexperienced side we did well to get that far.”Finally, in 2018, another final: “We ended up losing to Australia again but we also played one of the most enjoyable World Cup games, against West Indies in St Lucia. The crowd and the amount of noise they made was just unbelievable. It’s one of those games you look back on and are glad you were a part of, even if the result didn’t go our way.”Now the 2020 tournament awaits, with England’s first game against South Africa on Sunday, and Shrubsole says: “You obviously go in with hope. We believe we’ve got a team that can go all the way. We’ve got a number of new players who have no memories of past disappointments. But I think a lot changes in a couple of years, and I wouldn’t say you think much about tournaments past. We tend to go into tournaments thinking we can go all the way if we play our best, and this one’s no different.”Australia will inevitably start as favourites but England have the kinder group – three of the world’s top four sides according to the International Cricket Council rankings, including the hosts, are in Group A while the English, ranked No 2, are in the other half of the draw – and are optimistic. Their recently appointed Australian coach, Lisa Keightley, can teach it to them. Keightley’s only Twenty20 international as a player was the second ever staged, against England in 2005 (the day Katherine Brunt, now the senior player in the England squad, made her T20 debut), but she is hoping to make the team more aggressive, talking of bowling teams out and exerting pressure. “I’m planning to be in the final,” she says.Lots of people are planning to be at the final. It is scheduled to be played at the MCG on International Women’s Day, 8 March, has the added attraction (arguably) of a post-match Katy Perry concert and with a fair wind and yet more Australian success organisers hope, not completely outlandishly, to break the record for attendance at a women’s sporting event, the 1999 football World Cup final with a crowd of 90,185.Even without a record-busting conclusion there is a level of attention and anticipation around this tournament that hasn’t always been there – boosted by the unexpected qualification of Thailand, England’s opponents in Canberra on 26 February. “From what I can remember there wasn’t a huge amount of interest in 2009, and Lord’s wasn’t anything close to full for the final,” says Shrubsole.“It’s amazing to be in some of the places the World Cup is being played and see the amount of posters, banners, things on the side of trams advertising the tournament. I remember being elsewhere at tournaments gone by and unless you already knew there was a tournament on you wouldn’t have a clue. Even the possibility of it being a realistic expectation to fill the MCG is absolutely incredible. It’s such an iconic venue. To get someone of Katy Perry’s standing, for her to be there playing at the game is amazing. I really hope it’s full – and that England are involved.”• This is an extract from the ’s weekly cricket email. The Spin.

Clad in a sequined burgundy suit, he is taunted by drag queen Eaton Messe, who paces menacingly outside Christian’s pretend cell. This is Dragprov, a double act who improvise – in drag.The pair are performing their latest impromptu musical, titled Lord Help Me, I’m in a Dungeon! With a live pianist, Dragprov perform songs and sketches that are quick-witted, eloquent and made up on the spur of the moment.As with all Dragprov’s gigs, tonight’s performance is dictated by the crowd. As it’s Valentine’s Day, the duo also sing about one attendee’s declared love of masturbation, after serenading a couple about what they like and dislike about each other.Most of Dragprov’s songs have a spoof Broadway feel, complete with synchronised dancing, harmonising and a bit of hip-hop. Eaton, wearing a lacy red dress, has a knack for cutting jokes. Christian is a sensitive but charming soul – and an excellent singer. Dragprov are Francesca Forristal, 24, and Ed Scrivens, 28. We meet at the Horse \u0026amp Stables pub, where Forristal is performing her solo show Oddball as part of Vault. Together, they are chatty and charismatic, finishing each other’s sentences and frequently breaking into song.They met in 2015 through an improv troupe, the Oxford Imps, while studying at Oxford University. (Scrivens is currently studying for a PhD in Egyptology there.) “We always really enjoyed performing together when we did improvised musicals,” explains Forristal. “We’d always end up doubling up and being a duo.” She pauses, before adding with a grin: “And, then, we were also both very gay.” Scrivens jokingly chimes in: “Yes, that is true. That came as less of a surprise to me than the improvised comedy.”From there, says Forristal, it was a natural progression. Alongside improv, they both wanted to try drag. So, they started Dragprov a couple of years ago, recruiting pianists Tom Hodge and Jordan Clarke. They have developed distinct personae for their characters, citing queens such as Felix Le Freak and drag king collective Pecs as influences. Eaton, says Scrivens, is a “strange mix of haughtily disapproving, but also quite inherently silly.” Christian, explains Forristal, “likes everything that is glittery and has a lot of emotions and he wants to tell everyone all of them”.With the bulk of their shows based on audience participation, they’ve had plenty of memorable moments. At one show in Newcastle, they ended up basing an entire musical, called There’s Nothing Here, on the concept of space. “The black hole learnt to love,” says Forristal. “It got deep.” On another occasion, Scrivens played a spirit of the forest named Stick.Right now, the duo have a monthly show at the London Improv Theatre, alongside a residency at the Jericho Tavern in Oxford. Later this year, they will perform a family-friendly show at the Southbank’s Underbelly festival. Ultimately, though, they have no long-term plans. They’re simply two mates having a lot of fun. “It’s great that it’s doing so well, and we love that,” says Scrivens. “But we do it because we enjoy doing it.” Slipping into a funny voice, Forristal adds: “The second we get jaded, we’ll stop.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d68499aa4d516464bb6c15be3a3affd3a2cf5adf/1682_661_2091_1255/master/2091.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88164e39c642edc96d4813eb9dc8c436","title":"get thee to a shakespeare gym actors not knowing shakespeare is just the start","story":"The Royal Shakespeare Company has vowed to drill the Bard’s rhythms into its actors – but our alienation from his language runs deeper ‘Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue.” So says Hamlet to the players. But has his advice gone unheeded at a time when Shakespearean verse-speaking is widely held to be in decline? The RSC clearly thinks there is an issue as it has set up a Shakespeare “gym” in Stratford-upon-Avon to ensure, in the words of its artistic director Gregory Doran, “Everyone has the iambic pentameter in their bloodstream.” That’s a welcome trend, but I suspect the crisis goes deeper than that – and that classic texts are often regarded as alien, hostile territory.There was a time when actors, however experienced, were ready to learn. When Eileen Atkins joined the National Theatre in 1988 for a season of Shakespeare’s late plays, Peter Hall, its director, offered the company a voluntary class in verse-speaking. Atkins was the only one to enlist and had two hours of solo tuition from Hall that changed her approach. She acquired all there was to know about respecting the sanctity of the line, using a rhyme and not overdoing the caesura, or break. She cites an example from The Winter’s Tale where Paulina, rebuked for the boldness of her speech, says: “I am sorry for’t.” What Atkins learned from Hall was that there must be no break in the previous speaker’s rhythm before Paulina speaks her half-line.Hall was adept at conveying the musicality, as well as the sense, of a Shakespeare text. But while he proudly called himself an “iambic fundamentalist”, it strikes me that great actors instinctively flout the rules. One of Hall’s precepts was “to play lines rather than words”, yet Laurence Olivier was a master at isolating a crucial word or phrase.When Macbeth says he will never enjoy everything that should accompany old age – “As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends” – Olivier seized on the last three words and allowed his voice to soar in an agony of desolation. In our own time, Simon Russell Beale has a rare gift for ironising or reimagining a familiar speech. Prospero’s “Our revels now are ended” became, in his hands, less a philosophic vision of the universe than a father’s angry response to the realisation that his daughter was intemperately snogging the newly discovered Ferdinand.Like a jazz trumpeter, an actor has to know the rules in order to bend them. Have we now, however, reached a point where young actors are, literally, unversed in Shakespeare? Paul Miller, who has directed Shakespeare at Sheffield and Chichester and who runs the Orange Tree theatre in London, attaches no blame to the actors. “The real problem,” he says, “lies in the lack of practice. The training at drama school is as good as ever, but if a young actor goes into television or film, he or she doesn’t get the chance to stretch their vocal muscles.“Even in the reps, there is much less Shakespeare, largely for economic reasons, than there used to be. But I think we should be wary of this phrase ‘Shakespearean verse-speaking’. It is often used by audiences hankering for a mythical golden age of the voice beautiful and received pronunciation. The fact is, as the culture changes, there has been a tectonic shift in the approach to verse-speaking.”But has it been a shift for the better or the worse? One idea that should be quickly scotched is that ersity in casting has diluted the quality of verse-speaking. When Paapa Essiedu led a predominantly black ensemble in an RSC Hamlet in 2016, there was a springy alertness to the language that was ear-opening: I have not forgotten how Essiedu pointedly said to Gertrude: “I shall in all my best obey YOU, madam,” in implicit rebuke to the tyrannical Claudius.One of the best-spoken Shakespeares of recent times was last year’s Richard II at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse in London, with a cast entirely composed of women of colour. They made us listen so intently that when Doña Croll’s John of Gaunt declared “That England, that was wont to conquer others  Hath made a shameful conquest of itself” the audiences let out a roar in recognition of the lines’ relevance to the country’s Brexit-induced paralysis.Diversity is not the issue. The big question is whether there is a more general lack of relish for language and an unfamiliarity with classic texts. I suspect there is for a host of reasons. We live in a culture that prioritises the visual over the verbal.In purely theatrical terms, we have seen a narrowing of the repertoire and a decline of the company-based regional rep. I chanced the other day on a brochure for the Cambridge Theatre Company that, during the 1970s, produced plays not just by Shakespeare, Chekhov and Ibsen but by Jonson, Sheridan, Goldsmith, Shaw and Wilde as well as Pirandello, Brecht and Beckett. Where today would you find a company that offered actors, and audiences, such a rich range?I am all for modernity and new writing. But the much-debated crisis in Shakespearean verse-speaking conceals a wider malaise: that we are living with a theatre increasingly cut off from its past."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39c510d50227249488bfe3b804fd0c732d43c17d/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d9697bf85fcdc8d9a01396b869a633b","title":"the breadwinners of barishal how women in bangladesh are starting their own businesses","story":"Women in this flood-hit area are supporting their families through small businesses backed by the British Red Cross. From tailoring to tea making, the success of these enterprises is inspiring other young women to follow suitIn the sprawling urban slums of Barishal, where monsoons and flooding are inescapable, life for women is hard. They are more likely to miss out on getting an education, and without the proper knowledge and skill set, many struggle to make a living. As they are more likely to live in poverty, they are more affected by disasters. But despite these challenges, with the help of livelihood grants from the Red Cross, many women in Barishal are finding innovative ways to eke out a living.Rina, 37, from the nearby Palashpur, wakes up early every day to start preparing for work. From a side road of a small slum with heavy foot traffic, she has been running a successful tea stall for the last two years. Brightly coloured crisp packets hang like a banner across her shopfront, where Rina sells roughly 160 cups of tea a day at 5 taka (under 5p) a cup.She uses the money to pay for her children’s education and managed to save enough to buy a small TV, which kept her busy during the World Cup. “Everyone here loves football, so I thought it would be a good investment,” she says proudly. “Not everyone in the slums owns a TV, so when they stop to watch, they also buy tea.”Married at 12, Rina now has five children and is the sole breadwinner of her family. Her husband suffered a stroke seven years ago and is no longer able to work. “I had no money to feed my children. I’d already taken out loans and was worried about our financial situation.” But in 2018, she received a small grant, which enabled her to kickstart her own business.Rina’s customers are mostly men labourers who come to drink chai during their breaks and catch up with their friends. Though they don’t speak to Rina much, she has learned a lot from listening in on their conversations. “They discuss everything – sports, politics, economics and the weather – information I never had access to while sitting at home.”Knowledge about the weather is particularly important for Rina as flooding hampers her business. “When the water comes in, people aren’t interested in sitting around drinking tea.”As she buys her tea wholesale, grown in north-eastern districts such as Sylhet, it’s important for Rina to know of incoming natural disasters that might affect her supply, so that she can plan ahead.Mahmuda, 36, has just had a baby and is making plans on how to balance her tailoring business with motherhood. After receiving a small business loan, Mahmuda was able to establish her tailoring business, which has been going from strength to strength. Dressed in a traditional shalwar kameez she made herself, Mahmuda gently rocks baby Diya back and forth.After going into labour early and losing a lot of blood, the doctors thought both mother and baby wouldn’t make it. Mahmuda was able to use the money she generated from her business to pay for hospital fees and basic necessities for her premature baby.“My business is slowly expanding, and I am able to feed my children,” she says. Mahmuda buys materials and sews clothes for the women in her community. She recently bought a wardrobe to safely store her clothing and protect it from flooding and the smell of the draining system outside her home.Mahmuda lives with her baby and two young sons, sick husband and elderly mother – all of whom she supports financially. Her father left when she was small, so Mahmuda’s mother raised her on her own. She is happy to now be able to take care of her in return. “I am also able to maintain my sons’ educational expenses, which I couldn’t do before – it was a real struggle to pay their tuition fees every month.”Every morning, before the sun rises, Mukhal, 28, sets off on a small dinghy to the local fish market. Dressed in a black burka and face veil so as not to draw attention, Mukhal is one of the few women who can be found in a market mostly dominated by men. Over time she has been able to develop her negotiation skills, so she gets a better price for the catch. She then fills her basket and carries it back to her village, where she sells the fish to her neighbours.Mukhal has led a difficult life. Forced into marriage at the age of 12 when her father died, she became pregnant at 15, and was beaten then abandoned by her husband who took another wife. Her home is on the banks of the river and prone to flooding. “Everything I do is for my son. My only hope is to be the best mother that I can be. I don’t want my son to live this kind of life – I want him to be educated and to have a good job. He wants to be an engineer! I work hard to pay for his education, so he doesn’t have to struggle like me.”Also driven by a strong desire to help her family, Chompa, 15, currently works in an electronics factory. Her father was a rickshaw puller, but because of his old age and the flooding from heavy rain, such arduous work has become difficult. So Chompa is now the main breadwinner in her family, spending all day at a factory where she uses her small hands to put together electronic goods destined for faraway places worlds she catches brief glimpses of through the TV screens that she helps assemble.Chompa earns approximately 4,000 taka (£36.30) a month, which she puts towards rent, food and her parents’ medicines. But a few months ago, while building a fan, it suddenly switched on and the blades sliced off three of her fingers. “There was blood everywhere,” she says. “After a few seconds, I passed out.” Though the factory covered her hospital bill, and at this time she is still receiving her monthly salary, a future without able hands feels uncertain – she says she is likely to be downgraded or dismissed from her role.“What can I expect from this life?” she asks. “I have many dreams, but there are no opportunities.” She wishes she could attend school, but like many young girls from Barishal, this isn’t always an option. One day, when she is old enough, Chompa wants to own a business. She has seen the examples of other women in her community achieving success providing her with glimmers of hope that another reality is not only possible, it is within reach."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d84f24d1569edec53b7ec185ec4f1dd16cb23904/0_375_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db1bbedceab0527742ccbc8c4971420e","title":"fell running wales black mountains women only day course","story":"Leaving the tarmac behind, I tested my stamina and mettle on rocky terrain in the Black MountainsAt the top of a muddy slope that drops into a beautiful valley, I take a deep breath and prepare to put one foot in front of the other. Walking down this track, strewn with roots and ruts, wouldn’t normally be too challenging. But today I’m attempting to reach the bottom at a faster pace. The trouble is, I’m struggling with my fear of falling.Thankfully, help is at hand. I’m in the Black Mountains for a Beginning Fell Running for Women course, run by Welsh company Element Active, based at Llanbedr village near Crickhowell. The day is run by Ruth Pickvance, a former international runner and British fell champion, and Faye Johnson, who competes internationally for Wales. Ruth created the course to encourage women to try fell running, which means dashing over hills and dales in wide-open spaces, rather than the usual joggers’ grind of pounding the pavements.The growth of parkrun (which has seen more than four million participants since 2004), and programmes such as Couch to 5k, have led to a surge in the popularity of running. And now many runners, especially women, are looking to push their boundaries even further – and immerse themselves in nature – by embracing sports such as fell running.Excited, nervous chatter fills the air as our group of 16 women arrive at Llanbedr village hall, our base for the day. Our ages range from mid-30s to late-60s, with reasons for signing up that include gaining off-road confidence and beating anxiety. Two things we all have in common are a love of nature and the headspace that running affords. “I have to be in the mountains to keep myself sane,” says Pi Davidson, who has travelled from the Hebridean island of Jura. “Running gives me a child-like sense of freedom,” another woman, from London, adds.I’m pleased to learn the day won’t be all heads-down running. Instead, it’s broken into three indoor and three outdoor sessions. Inside, we learn about everything from essential kit to finding suitable races. Outside, the focus is on technique and practice, rather than distance. Participants only need to be able to run 5km to join the course, and there are bite-sized sessions to ensure that everyone can work to their own level.It wasn’t so long ago that fell running was considered the preserve of men. It grew out of events such as the Guide’s Race, which started in the late 19th century and saw male mountain guides race up and down fells in the Lake District. “Women were only allowed to compete in the British Fell Running Championships from 1979, many years behind their male counterparts,” says Ruth.For Ruth, the attraction is simple. “Fell running is about moving fast and unencumbered through beautiful landscapes,” she says. “It requires minimal kit: you leave technology behind and connect with nature. You’ve got the weather and the terrain to contend with, which requires self-reliance. It’s a real adventure, in a way that running on tarmac isn’t.”Moments later, we see just what she means as we run beneath the dappled canopy of woods in the Vale of Grwyney. We do a two-mile loop twice, negotiating a loose rocky section, crossing the fast-flowing Grwyne Fechan river and pushing up an incline. Unlike with pavement pounding, I have to concentrate on my foot placement, and enjoy the liberating feeling of choosing my own route.It’s tempting to chat, but Ruth asks us to refrain on the second loop, to see if we notice the difference. Immediately, there’s a shift. I hear the river burble and I smell the earth. I see shafts of sunlight that rake the trail and feel twigs cracking underfoot. We tune into the landscape, feeling the terrain, working with it, as we run.While reaching the top of a fell requires physical fitness, running downhill involves mental fortitude – and a hefty dose of confidence. For Ruth, this is often where women come unstuck. “Women tend to be perfectionists, with an internal monologue that says we aren’t good enough. Fear of falling is natural,” she reassures us. “But taking risks is a prerequisite for confidence. We aren’t asking you to lose control, but we want you to grow in confidence.”Having two instructors means we can break into smaller groups and pick up extra tips. Like Ruth, Faye strikes just the right balance between nurturing and encouraging. “Send your arms wide for balance,” she suggests as I lollop downhill. “Leaning slightly forwards will increase your speed. Switch your brain off and let your legs take over.”We begin on an open, gently sloping field before moving on to trickier – and steeper – terrain. I’m soon picking up the pace downhill, but our final challenge is yet to come: the ascent and descent of Table Mountain (its original name is Crug Hywel), a 451-metre hill looming above us.We hike up the steep, fern-lined incline – any idea of running having long been left behind. I copy Ruth’s technique of pushing off my thighs with my hands, leaning forwards and taking deep breaths.After around 15 minutes of climbing, I reach the summit. My sense of achievement is shared by the others as they arrive with infectious smiles. We spend a few moments basking in the sunshine, drinking in panoramic views of the Brecon Beacons behind us and Sugar Loaf in front.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

When I watched her present, I felt like she was one of my mates. She had a great way of turning the people’s lives in the villa, and the rather false world of Love Island, into something we should care about. Never ridiculing the sometimes ridiculous, she seemed to care about them all as friends. Beautiful people presenting on TV can often come across as false but Caroline did not. I didn’t think the death of a person I didn’t know could affect me the way Caroline’s has. It feels closer to home than another stranger’s passing – not because I watch telly a lot, but because I think it is devastating that a beautiful and clever woman has no future and she felt there was nothing to live for. I hope the campaign for kindness that has carried on since her death is her legacy and people can learn from this horrible situation. Kirsty, 39, rural development consultant, InvernessI remember one of the first ever internships I ever did was for a fashion shoot where Caroline was going to be on the cover of a magazine. She was incredible and so inspiring on the day. She never complained and made it look easy, even though she was going through multiple outfit and hair and make up changes. I was exhausted just watching her. The best bit? She came up to us interns (there were three of us) and spoke to us inidually about the shoot. She asked why we were interning and what we wanted to do. She didn’t have to do that, and yet she did anyway. You don’t often see that on a high-profile fashion shoot. She was kind and lovely and I don’t think I’ll ever forget it. I hope that’s how she is remembered. Daisy, 26, content manager, LondonI’d been watching Caroline on TV since she was on the children’s Saturday programme TMI, and I loved her on The Xtra Factor as well. She was always so vivacious, attractive, funny, confident, outgoing. And who can forget that charming smile and incredible laugh. She was the kind of woman that girls easily aspired to be like. I certainly wished I could be as outgoing and bubbly as her. So tragic that she’s no longer here, she had a beautiful soul and made many people smile. She will never be forgotten Naomi, 27, nursing trainee, GravesendI’ve followed Caroline Flack for years. As a woman who has also just turned 40, I felt some kind of affiliation with her. She was beautiful, successful and famous of course – but also vulnerable. She didn’t promote an Instagram-style picture-perfect lifestyle, she was real and this resonated with me and my friends. I connected with her so much more than others in the public eye because, despite her fame, I think she represented many of the issues my friends and I face. I feel extremely sad this has happened. She was hounded across traditional and social media, and I am sure this is because she was a woman and a vulnerable person (like so many before her). I work in the media and understand click-bait articles, but tabloid hacks and social platforms need to follow a better code of ethics. It’s only a matter of time before this happens again. Thea, 40, festival director, BrightonObviously I didn’t know Caroline but I think its hard to disagree that her bubbly and fun nature was infectious and she had a special talent for making people smile and laugh. I will deeply miss seeing Caroline on the telly and I really hope people can learn from this terrible incident.Karl, 31, educator, ManchesterI was so upset when I heard about Caroline’s death because I felt like she was my friend. I had never met her but spent summers watchingLove Island, grew up with The X Factor and would often turn on my TV and she’d be there. I would look at her Instagram and imagine how much of a fun and caring friend she would be if I was to ever meet her. She radiated life, and she seemed to be a fighter for love, for women, for the younger generation and for being friendly and kind to people. She had so many friends who clearly adored her. I will miss her on TV. Since her death I have deleted my daily go-to, the Daily Mail, unfollowed all the tabloids and signed the petition for “Caroline’s law”. Its hard not getting my daily showbiz fix but maybe if more people did the same we could save another life in the future. Claire, 23, fashion buyer, LondonCaroline Flack was relatable and likeable because not only could you see she was a lot of fun, you could also see she had some flaws, unlike many celebrities who appear distant and hard to reach. I follow her on Twitter and Instagram and, yes, I definitely think that because she was very open and would often share her vulnerability and emotions that made me feel closer to her and made her very relatable as a woman. I believe there is probably a bit of Caroline in many of us, including the parts that she kept hidden. I admired her – flaws and all. Love Island is my guilty pleasure but I had to turn off after the tribute to her. The juxtaposition between the the poignancy of the tribute and then going straight back into the shallow nature of the programme didn’t sit particularly well with me. I will find it hard to watch future series without her. I think perhaps the show has had its time. Kate , teaching assistant, IpswichCaroline Flack was an inspiration and a role model to me as a young woman growing up when she hit the spotlight. I remember her days presenting The X-Factor, she was so talented. She literally felt like someone you knew as she seemed so genuine, kind and funny. I followed her on Instagram and always loved her posts and stories. She was just infectious and I always wanted to know what she was up to. I remember being obsessed with watching her Strictly Come Dancing videos back on YouTube – she was amazing. Love Island would be nothing without her she genuinely cared about all of the contestants and wanted them to find love. She made the show what it is today. I feel so devastated that she’s gone and I didn’t even know her, and I’m probably not even as much of a fan as other people. She felt so relatable and so incredibly kind and lovely.

If you look at our jails, it’s predominantly minorities.”Bloomberg said some progress had been made but “nevertheless, there’s this enormous cohort of black and Latino males, age, let’s say, 16 to 25, that don’t have jobs, don’t have any prospects, don’t know how to find jobs, don’t know what their skillsets are, don’t know how to behave in the workplace where they have to work collaboratively and collectively.”The former mayor added that crime in New York City takes place in “minority neighborhoods”, with victims and perpetrators of crime “virtually all minorities”.Bloomberg has achieved solid polling numbers despite several previous interviews and comments coming to light that have been viewed as highly problematic.Bloomberg has previously apologized for the use of stop-and-frisk, saying it was “overused” in New York. His rivals for the Democratic nomination, in particular Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, have accused Bloomberg of being out of step with voters and guilty of attempting to buy the nomination via his vast wealth.Bloomberg will appear on stage in Wednesday’s debate in Las Vegas alongside former vice-president Joe Biden, Sanders, senators Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar and former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg. Fellow billionaire and philanthropist Tom Steyer is still hoping to qualify.The Democratic National Committee recently changed its rules for how a candidate qualifies for the debate, opening the door for Bloomberg to be on stage and drawing the ire of some candidates who dropped out of the race for failing to make prior stages.The candidates were previously required to receive a certain number of campaign contributions to qualify, but Bloomberg, who is worth an estimated $60bn, is not taking donations.The prime-time event will be a stark departure from Bloomberg’s highly choreographed campaign. He has poured more than $300m into television advertising, a way to define himself for voters without facing criticism.Bloomberg has barely crossed paths on the trail with his fellow Democrats. He decided to skip the first four voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina in favor of focusing on the 14 states that vote on 3 March and the contests that come afterward.He rarely mentions his rivals by name, though his campaign is centered on the idea that none of them can beat Donald Trump.Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b673f47fe1f6f4cfeb0c011af0100d64cdbbdc6/36_0_3450_2070/master/3450.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a374011ce19a4ac45bd75a927dbeb726","title":"ashraf ghani wins afghan presidential election","story":"Five months after Afghans went to the polls to choose a new president, election authorities have declared the incumbent, Ashraf Ghani, the winner, but key opposition figures have already warned they will not accept the result.The announcement comes at a critical time for Afghanistan, as the US closes in on a withdrawal agreement with the Taliban, which should pave the way for “intra-Afghan talks” with the government in Kabul.Without the leadership of the country resolved, that vital but complicated stage in possible peace negotiations to end a decades-old civil war would be even more difficult.“At a normal time, disputed election results would be traumatic for a country that craves stability and strong government, but this week, Afghans are also expecting a US-Taliban deal to be announced,” said Kate Clark, a co-director of the Afghanistan Analysts Network.“That deal should usher in the start of talks between the Taliban and other Afghans. Will the Afghan political class be able to agree on a team or a negotiating strategy if they are locked in battle as to who sits in the presidential palace?”September’s presidential poll was marred by violence and disillusionment with the political process, as well as fraud. Turnout was low fewer than 2 million votes were counted even though Afghanistan has 9.6 million registered voters, election authorities said.Although there were more than a dozen other candidates running in the 2019 election, Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah were the only two with a real chance of victory. Both claimed they had won soon after polls closed, and accused the other camp of fraud.Results that were originally set to be announced on 7 November were delayed for months amid arguments over corruption, accusations of misconduct and technical problems counting ballots.Since preliminary results in December put the incumbent in the lead, Abdullah’s allies have repeatedly warned they would consider a Ghani victory invalid because of fraud.Abdullah’s powerful coalition for the vote includes the warlord Gen Abdul Rashid Dostum who commands a huge and fiercely loyal following in the north of the country, and has threatened to set up a parallel government (subscription).Abdullah’s campaign chief immediately rejected the results Abdullah himself was expected to give a press conference later in the evening.“We are out of the election process,” Fazal Ahmad Manawi said on Twitter. “The reasons for this lack of legitimacy is clear to all as much as the sun is. Time will show justice to all of these injustices done.“Democracy, election and civil values is not functional in this country as whoever captures power tries to maintain it with any cunning possible. The only way for obtaining power is force.”The election was a virtual replay of the 2014 contest, when Ghani and Abdullah were the main contenders and also argued bitterly over the result, trading accusations of fraud.That impasse only ended when the then US secretary of state, John Kerry, stepped in to broker a power-sharing deal, paving the way for a largely dysfunctional “unity government” in which Ghani consolidated power while Abdullah struggled.It is unclear if the US has the appetite for another diplomatic intervention, although having the withdrawal agreement within reach might make Washington more inclined to push for some kind of resolution of Kabul power struggles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3209312926f004c7bc0df1c3f5c5fc0197a0029/0_151_5560_3336/master/5560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=138eb52447681c9dd4a6a8b2ffc07ab6","title":"germany senior cdu figure announces surprise leadership candidacy","story":"Norbert Röttgen throws hat in ring to replace Merkel after Kramp-Karrenbauer steps asideA senior German conservative politician, who was once seen as the brains behind Angela Merkel’s inner circle but was later sacked by the chancellor, has put himself forward as a surprise candidate to take over as leader of her Christian Democratic Union (CDU), further complicating the party’s chaotic succession planning.Norbert Röttgen announced his candidacy for the soon-to-be vacant seat at the top of the CDU in a press conference on Tuesday, saying he had decided to run because he believed the party should strategically position itself as the “party of the centre”.Last week, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, Merkel’s protege, threw the party into turmoil by saying she would not stand as chancellor in the next federal election, due by October 2021, and announcing she would give up the CDU chair.Röttgen’s unexpected move makes him the first official contender for the post of party leader. All the potential contenders so far are men hailing from the powerful state of North-Rhine Westphalia.The 63-year-old lawyer left politics for the financial industry about a decade ago, but stepped down from his role at asset manager Blackrock last week, saying he wanted to get more politically involved in the future.Having been ousted as parliamentary leader of the CDU by Merkel in 2002, many have said he has never forgiven the chancellor, though he has downplayed the idea of any lasting resentment towards her.\u0026nbspMerz has built up a personal fortune of millions, including two private jets, which has caused controversy, particularly after he claimed that he remained a member of the middle class.\u0026nbspHe promises to return the CDU to its former strong position. He says he can win back millions of voters who drifted to the AfD and has presented himself as more liberal than in the past on issues such as gay marriageStill aged only 39, the youngest member of Merkel’s fourth cabinet has in the past portrayed himself first and foremost as a critic of the chancellor’s refugee policy, calling it “the white elephant in the room”.\u0026nbspBut his stint at the health ministry has revealed a new side to the ambitious and energetic politician, who has fought to introduce policies that weren\u0027t a natural fit with his previous free-market conservative profile, such as compulsory measles vaccinations for children.He is married to his long-term partner Daniel Funke, the editor of society magazine Bunte.\u0026nbspA staunch defender of Merkel\u0027s migration policy and an uncompromising critic of the AfD, Laschet holds a natural position of authority in the CDU as premier of the large state of North-Rhine Westphalia.Laschet pulled off a coup by ousting the Social Democratic Party in this traditional centre-left stronghold in 2017.\u0026nbspKnown as a moderate in policy terms, Laschet is also still relatively unknown at federal level.The senior German conservative politician has put himself forward as a surprise candidate. He has something of a national profile due to his role as head of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee, but is not seen as a big hitter in the party. He also served as an environment minister under Merkel from 2009 to 2012.In the past, Röttgen has been seen as someone who could work with the Greens, currently the second-biggest party in the polls after the conservative bloc.A member of the Bundestag since 1994, Röttgen was one of a number of broadly liberal politicians with an interest in environmental policy who formed Merkel’s inner circle and helped write her 2005 election manifesto. In 2009, in Merkel’s second term in power, he was made Germany’s environment minister.But Röttgen fell out of favour with the chancellor in 2012, after choosing to run for the premiership in North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany’s most populous state, and achieving one of the worst results in his party’s history. He was sacked from cabinet days after the result.In recent years, Röttgen has managed to rebuild a national and international profile in his role as head of the German parliament’s foreign affairs committee, proving his reputation as an eloquent debater with stances on Brexit, the war in Syria and the trade stand-off with Donald Trump that were often more forthright than those of the chancellor.His power within the party is seen as limited by his missteps in the past, however, and the fact that Röttgen’s liberal profile is so similar to that of another potential continuity candidate, the current North-Rhine Westphalian premier, Armin Laschet, has raised eyebrows.In the past, Röttgen has been seen as someone who could work with the Greens, currently the second-biggest party in the polls after the conservative bloc.In a letter quoted by the regional newspaper Rheinische Post to Kramp-Karrenbauer, Röttgen said the situation was “so serious that it was about the future of the CDU and what that meant for the stability of Germany”.The other potential CDU leadership contenders are Friedrich Merz, an economic liberal and former arch-rival to Merkel, and the rightwing health minister, Jens Spahn.The CDU leader is likely to be the chancellor candidate for the conservative bloc, but the Christian Social Union – the Bavarian sister party to the CDU – could put forward a candidate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06082f6f68e015e339db679db0225fcd8e4f4b33/0_217_5760_3455/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ee80038dff68f179535157aa7662330","title":"gezi park verdict may be political ploy of isolated ankara turkey","story":"Acquittals are welcome but not necessarily a signal of change at heart of governmentOne defendant in the Gezi park trial grimly predicted the expected results of Tuesday’s hearing would be the “funeral of civil society in Turkey”. Instead, the surprise verdict led to applause and tears of joy as nine of the activists charged with terrorism offences for their roles in organising the 2013 protests walked free from the Istanbul courthouse.The unexpected acquittals of nine of the 16 defendants – lawyers say not guilty verdicts for the seven others being tried in absentia are also expected imminently – were a rare spot of good news in Turkey, where the judicial system has been hollowed out and weaponised against President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s opponents and critics.Gezi itself has become a potent symbol of the troubles of modern Turkey. The peaceful demonstrations against bulldozing the rare green space in central Istanbul to build a shopping centre in 2013, which spiralled into nationwide protests, were met with a brutal crackdown. In hindsight, it was the first indication of Erdoğan’s increasing appetite for authoritarian measures and the democratic backsliding to come.Even as they celebrated Tuesday’s verdicts, however, many of the president’s detractors wondered why the court had ruled against the government in such a high-profile case.The answer may lie not in Turkey, but in Syria. Turkey is increasingly bogged down in a military operation in Idlib, the last rebel-held province of its war-torn neighbour, where Ankara backs a handful of rebel groups.Russia, its major trade and defence partner, is so far failing to entertain Turkey’s efforts to reintroduce a ceasefire that would protect 3 million civilians who have nowhere left to go. Hundreds of thousands of Syrian families who have fled the regime and allied Russian bombing are camped out in freezing conditions, begging Turkish soldiers to open the closed border.In the face of indifference from Moscow, Ankara, now somewhat diplomatically isolated from its western allies, may be using the fate of the Gezi 16 to once again gain favour in Brussels and other western capitals.The Gezi trial has been closely watched by diplomats and human rights groups for years, and noises from pro-government thinktanks, media and even the minister of defence, asking the EU and Nato for support in Idlib, have been growing louder in recent days.Tuesday’s ruling is a significant step towards restoring faith in the rule of law in Turkey. The silence on the verdicts from pro-government media outlets, however, and hundreds of new arrests of suspects related to the failed 2016 coup, show how much more work there is to be done."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6cf8239bbf07460a7d30aaa1ae64683ba133675/0_0_1667_1000/master/1667.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3c48c010956c11deeae58c7a305b518","title":"librarian moria tales hope refugee camp","story":"The refugee camp is notorious for its overcrowding, fires and riots. But for the people who live there, life goes on – and every day brings new stories of resilience, bravery and compassionIt is not easy to find the library at Moria on the Greek island of Lesbos. Before reaching the refugee camp’s main entrance, you turn off the road where the police bus is always parked, then walk up the track that runs beside the perimeter fence. You walk past the military post and the hawkers selling fruit and veg, trainers, cooking utensils, cigarettes, electrical equipment – pretty much everything past huge stinking mountains of bagged-up rubbish – so much rubbish and past the worst toilets in the world, overflowing with excrement and plastic.Then, opposite the hole in the fence where people who don’t want to use the main gate come and go, you turn right, into what they call the Jungle, the olive groves into which the camp has exploded, because it was meant for 3,000 people and now has 20,000. Continue along the winding path, watching out for low-slung washing lines, past the burnt-out olive tree and the tiny tent with the family who always say hello, then turn left up the steep hill that becomes a muddy slide after rain. And there it is, on the right: Moria’s new library.From the outside, it looks like all the other structures in this part of the camp – a shack cobbled together from bits of wood and tarpaulins. But inside there are shelves and books. And, standing behind a counter, wearing a New York Yankees beanie, a librarian – Zekria, from Afghanistan.He runs a school, too – that is how the library started. Zekria, 40, his wife and their five children arrived on the island a year ago in the usual perilous way, in a small boat at night across the 12-mile strait from Turkey. He tried to register the kids at one of the NGO-run schools that provide some educational activities, but they were all full the waiting list could have been a month, two months, three months.So Zekria, who used to teach law at a university in Kabul, decided to start his own class. “I bought a whiteboard and some markers. It started in an open area under an olive tree last March, teaching English,” he says. “English is the most important, because, even though people get stuck here for a year, two years, more even, no one wants to live here for ever.” He speaks excellent English, softly.More and more people – mostly Afghans, but also Syrians, Iraqis and members of other nationalities – wanted classes. Zekria was invited to people’s tents and containers to teach soon he had more potential students than he could cope with. So he set up a team and they built a classroom. Registration opened one Friday morning. “When I came here at 7.30am, more than 600 people were in the line.”They scheduled lessons for everyone: no one gets turned away, even if it means 50 to a class. “We cannot say no,” says Zekria. As if to prove it, 14-year-old Somahya shows up to register for German lessons (her family is trying to get to Germany) and is told there will be a class available by next week.Now there are three classrooms and the teaching team numbers 30, with more than 1,000 students learning English, German, French and Greek, guitar and art. In the room next to the library, a class mostly of teenagers is painting designs on T-shirts on the floor. “It’s very important for people living in this stressful place,” says Zekria. “They come here, paint or listen to music, they learn something, they’re busy, they forget the other traumatic stuff they suffer in this camp. Psychology starts in action. Doctors will advise, but we are doing it in action.”The library is the latest project. Zekria hasn’t quite worked out the system yet. It doesn’t officially open until tomorrow. He thinks it is going to be one book borrowed at a time, maybe two if users travel a long distance within the camp. They will be able to keep items for a week, maybe 10 days. So far, books have mostly been donated by aid workers and NGOs, some possibly more pertinent (Catch-22) than others (the Lonely Planet guide to China). Zekria would like more books in Farsi and Arabic. I have only one book with me, a new one by the film-maker Chris Atkins about his time banged up in Wandsworth prison in London. That could be relevant, I guess. Anyway, it is there now, in the library at Moria.Zekria’s own sentence – and his family’s – is further uncertainty. Their asylum application has been rejected. He doesn’t know why, but suspects it may have something to do with this educational activity. The authorities don’t like it, he says.I have come to Moria on the hunt for hope. It began with a letter to the  from an aid worker there. He was concerned that the notorious camp’s portrayal in the media was relentlessly negative. But working there, he said, was an amazing experience every day, he witnessed acts of kindness by extraordinary people. It gave him faith in humanity. You will have heard about the desperate conditions, the overcrowding, the fires, the riots, the unaccompanied minors, the trauma, sexual exploitation, rape and murder. I am here to see if there is another, more positive side to Moria.Bloody hell, that looks unlikely. “Moria no good,” is the chorus to my time at the camp. The same issues come up again and again: the fear and the cold at night, freezing showers, the unreliable supply of water, no electricity, queueing for hours for food, for months, years or for ever for permission to leave the island. Then there are the fights that break out among the frustrated, angry, bored young men who make up a high proportion of those living here. Just before my arrival, a 20-year-old Yemeni man was fatally stabbed, the second death this year. No one came here for this.Moria is hell, a stain on 21st-century Europe, where bureaucracy, politics and simply not caring enough have left tens of thousands in limbo – people fleeing war and danger, looking for a future for themselves and their children and not finding it. Moria’s existence is a disgrace, a failure of morality.Yet, somehow, a sort of life goes on humanity survives in hell. I am here for three days – two alone, then another with the photographer Byron Smith – and experience so much goodwill and humour.I am offered warm flatbread fresh from one of Moria’s many ovens, sunflower seeds from kids, shisha from a bunch of Iraqi lads standing around a fire. Language is sometimes a problem, but it turns out it is possible to discuss the demise of Manchester United through sign language. There are more people here from Afghanistan than from any other country and I end up talking to more Afghans than anyone else, but I also meet people from Iraq, Syria, Somalia, Burkina Faso, Guinea-Bissau, South Sudan, Nigeria, Burundi, Zimbabwe and even Myanmar.There is no power to make coffee or tea in Wahid Amini’s store today, but he has cold drinks. A cameraman back in Kabul, Wahid, 20, is trying to join his family in France, but his application has been rejected. He is hopeful that, with legal help and more documentation, he might get there one day. The shop, next to a busy barber’s, is a new enterprise, to try to make a bit of money. He sells shampoo, rice, spaghetti, washing-up liquid, disposable razors, etc, which he buys outside the camp. He is open 24 hours.The Najafi family – Abdullah and Gulbdan, plus their sons Ali Reza (15), Mohammad (14) and Meraj (five) – invite us into their homemade tent. It is tiny for five people – six, actually their 16-year-old daughter, Faezh, has gone to queue for a cold shower. But it is spotless and tidy – blankets have been folded and piled up for the day – and we leave our muddy shoes at the entrance. The family’s belongings hang in rucksacks from the wall, next to the Afghan flag and a couple of soft toys, one of which looks like a Kevin the Carrot from Aldi. I really hope it is one of the Kevins I recently sneaked into the charity-shop bag at home.Gulbdan must know of a secret power source, as she conjures up an electric kettle and hot water to make tea, served in cracked cups with almonds and biscuits. Touching hospitality in any circumstance properly moving in Moria.Mohammad shows me footage on his dad’s phone of him taking part in a karate tournament in Iran. Abdullah and Gulbdan left Afghanistan 20 years ago the kids have been brought up in Iran until now. Mohammad, already a black belt, won his bout. There is no karate in Moria, just actual fighting. The Najafi family keep to their tent after dark.They show us pictures on Faezh’s camera of some of their journey. Playing on a beach in Turkey, rock pools, jellyfish. She didn’t take pictures of the crossing – it was too dark and too scary – but there is a little video of them on the beach where they landed in the north of Lesbos, looking tired but happy, in Europe at last. They never imagined they would end up like this.There is plenty of humanity on show from the aid workers. Kind Danish women distribute clothes a group of Dutch Christians hand out boxes of toys a middle-aged British man with a background in water engineering leads a team to maintain the camp’s showers, toilets and sewers. There are hundreds of mostly young volunteers, who consider Moria unacceptable and Europe’s shame. They are not indifferent: they want to make a difference. I meet many who came for a few weeks and ended up staying for a year, sometimes two.One Happy Family is, as you might expect from its name, good news. A community centre a few miles from the camp, run by various organisations along with many refugee volunteers, it has a medical centre, a playground, a gym, a women’s space, a cafe, board games, a phone-charging station and an electrical repair shop. There is also a garden, where refugee volunteers including Sima Mohammedi and Reza Rezaie show me the beetroot, spinach, turnips, chard, beans and herbs they are growing. Covering the compost heap is a big piece of black rubber, just recognisable as part of one of the dinghies that bring refugees from Turkey and then get abandoned. Recycling.The vegetables contribute to the OHF kitchen, where they cook lunch for up to 1,200 people every day. Today’s chefs are Fifie from Zimbabwe and Mohammed from Myanmar. They are cooking vegetables, lentils, chickpeas and flatbread. Once a week they do chicken – and the queues get really long.Back at Moria, it is hard not to meet Ali Shama Eddin. He must be the most famous and is certainly the tallest person here. Ali, 23, from Damascus in Syria, arrived in Moria in 2016. He was alone: his parents had already reached Germany – but that helps your case only if you are a minor. He started helping, volunteering with the Dutch organisation Movement on the Ground, and learned English from hanging out with the Europeans he worked with.It took Ali almost two years, but he got his travel documents eventually and went to Germany to join his family. “But my heart, my mind, my feelings were here, so I decided to come back,” he says. Now he works here, as the general manager for the same NGO, Movement on the Ground. He strides about the place in his bright yellow jacket, greeting everyone in several languages, trying to sort out people’s problems, finding room in a tent for a new arrival. “I understand – I’m a refugee as well,” he says.When there is a dispute between two men, one of whom says the other owes him money, Ali sits them down to try to sort it out. “I want to hear from both of you to understand how we can solve this problem,” he tells them. This one doesn’t end in a fight – for now.“There is love and communication between people from different countries – we can all be together, share a meal, discuss something. We can learn from each other, inspire each other, support each other. This is amazing,” says Ali, who is very much on board with the NGO’s ethos, which is all about treating people with dignity and respect and empowering them.Who is this European woman, who looks a bit like Johan Cruyff and smokes like him, too? Ah, Susila Cruyff, the daughter of the footballer. She is here with the Cruyff Foundation, which develops sports activities for children in need around the world. Nowhere are kids more in need than here. The foundation is going to build a football pitch – a Cruyff court – in the camp and Susila is here to look for a suitable site. At the moment, there is nowhere flat in camp to kick a ball. “My father used to think that sport is more than sport,” she says. “It’s good for your health, but also for your mental health,” she says.The foundation will build two pitches: one here, one somewhere else on the island for the locals – the hope being that it will encourage competitions and build bridges between refugees and residents. The relationship between the two has been far from easy.“They steal, they fight, they don’t respect us,” says Sofia, my taxi driver from the airport. Tourists no longer come Lesbos is now an “Islamic place”, she says.There is a one-day general strike on the island while I am here everything is shut down. Hundreds of protesters gather in the capital, Mytilini, waving Greek flags, demanding the closure of the camp and the removal of refugees from the island. “We want our islands back, we want our lives back,” is the main slogan of the protests, which are taking place on the islands of Samos and Chios at the same time.A few miles from Mytilini, in a tiny hamlet on the Gulf of Giera, a very different scene is playing out. In what used to be a restaurant, a cosy dining room with a woodburner, four Afghan teenagers are playing with a kitten. One of them puts on some music from home and they dance.They are unaccompanied minors from Moria, children lost in a world that isn’t fair, but brought here today for something a bit like a home. They are accompanied by Eleni Dimou, who works for the government, looking after boys at Moria. Some have psychological problems some self-harm, she says. It is hard enough being a teenager anywhere, but it is really hard at Moria.Some call her Mother, says Eleni, whose own children are grown up. “Because they need a mother, they need someone.”It is a really hard job, but not a thankless one. “I get a lot of love from them,” says Eleni, who is learning Farsi. “On Christmas Day, one boy gave me a pair of socks. I said: ‘Why did you do that? It costs money.’ He said: ‘Because I know in your country, on Christmas, you give presents to the people that you love.’”This place was set up by a lovely local couple, Nikos Katsouris and Katerina Koveou. They turn up later and tell me how it came about. In 2014, Nikos, then a fisherman, was driving around with a van of fish to sell when he came across a group of refugees from Syria who had just landed. They were wet, tired and hungry there was a pregnant woman and a boy of about 10, who was on his own. Shocked by what he saw, Nikos used the money he got from the fish to buy them food and gave the boy his jacket. When he got home and told Katerina, she got to work immediately, cooking for them. Then they set off to find them, with 40 homecooked meals and all the blankets and clothes they could lay their hands on.That first lot never got their dinner: they were detained by the police before Nikos and Katerina found them. But the couple found another boatload of arrivals to give it to. Ever since, they have been helping refugees, adapting to the changing needs of the situation. When Moria opened, they took sardines, bread, rice and vegetables to the camp and they fed hungry volunteers in their restaurant. Then they started to bring families from the camp to the restaurant. “We try to give back what others took from the people,” Nikos says. “They took their lives, their smiles, their humanity, their dignity. These things we have here.”It hasn’t gone down well with the authorities. They have broken petty rules, such as that you are not allowed to be a charity and a restaurant at the same time. Nikos and Katerina have been fined a total of €47,800 (£40,000). So they have given up the restaurant and are now solely an NGO, Home for All. They have refugees here every day, to eat, to learn to cook, to be at home, like the boys today. They cook and deliver food for the most vulnerable in the camp – minors and sick people.Katerina has had to accept that they can’t help everyone. “This was my problem in the beginning – I wanted to help them all. But then I realised: ‘If I do this, probably I am not going to help anyone.’ You help those you can, and if you can do more, you do.”Why do they do it? “Because we want to and because we can,” she says.I return to Moria one more time, turning off the road where the police bus sits, up the dirt track that runs parallel to the perimeter fence, right into the Jungle. I am not going to Zekria’s library this time, not yet, but to his school, to see one of his teachers.It has been more difficult for me to talk to women in the camp than to men, mostly because of culture and tradition. No problems with 19-year-old Azita Barekzai from Afghanistan, though. She is happy to chat. Her English is good she is ambitious and wise (I hope that doesn’t sound patronising). When I ask her something I have already asked, she tells me off: “I told you!” She doesn’t want her photo taken, because she has a cold, but in the end she relents. I am glad there is a picture of Azita like many of the people I meet in Moria, she is amazing.She got here seven months ago, with her parents and her three siblings. She is the oldest of the kids. The crossing was terrifying, “really dangerous. I never thought we were going to survive.”Then she was shocked by what they had come to in Moria. The usual issues – the cold, the rubbish, the fights, being too scared to leave the tent at night. It is especially horrible when it rains. “You cannot imagine how people tolerate it. Life is really difficult here.”She wants to go to Switzerland, because she heard it accepts refugees and is beautiful. She would like to be a doctor. She has her papers already she can travel, but the rest of her family hasn’t been approved. They are still waiting.In the meantime, she is teaching English to kids in Zekria’s school. “I enjoy it a lot because I can make some people smile. I just want to make them laugh. I know that if someone laughs it doesn’t mean they don’t have problems. We need hope. Everyone – especially children – needs hope. We are really hopeless sometimes because of this bad situation. Maybe learning English gives them some hope for the future. They can go somewhere else better.”It is time for the library’s opening ceremony next door. There is a small gathering someone has brought a basket of sweets and a red ribbon. Zekria says a few words, thanks the people who nailed the bits of wood together and attached the tarpaulins, and the book donors. Then, with a pair of scissors, he cuts the ribbon. Moria’s library is, he declares, officially open.A couple of weeks later, back in my nice, safe, warm office, I WhatsApp Zekria to check a couple of things. First, he tells me that the pictures I took of the opening (Byron wasn’t around at the time) were terrible. He is not wrong. Then he says his asylum application was rejected again. Fearing deportation, he and his family managed to get to mainland Greece, where they are staying in a squat. “It’s cold, there is no electricity, it is the life of refugees,” he says. “I hate the fucking politics of the world.”He has no money left and will try to find informal work, then perhaps try to cross a land border into Albania or Macedonia. The library and the school in Moria are fine, he says. The team is running them he is in touch regularly. “I have to go,” he says. “We will speak later, my friend.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51f525d375b9a73bde3fc444fec5143e7a3ac9ce/0_179_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa5774e355a6d469ee52d6bdc20b0785","title":"patricia oconnor trial draws to close in ireland","story":"Kieran Greene accused of killing his partner’s mother and dismembering body in 2017Prosecutors have made closing arguments in the trial of a man accused of bludgeoning to death his partner’s mother in a case that has transfixed Ireland, at times pushing the country’s general election campaign off the front pages. Kieran Greene, 35 is charged with killing Patricia O‘Connor at the house they shared in Mountainview Park, Rathfarnham, on 29 May 2017. He has pleaded not guilty, saying he acted in self-defence.The victim was dismembered into 15 parts that were found at nine locations in the Dublin and Wicklow mountains.Her husband, 75-year-old Augustine “Gus” O‘Connor, has pleaded guilty to reporting her as a missing person to the police when he knew she was dead. He is not on trial.Other family members are accused of impeding Greene’s apprehension and prosecution.His partner, 41-year-old Louise O‘Connor, allegedly acquiesced in her daughter, 22-year-old Stephanie O‘Connor, disguising herself as her grandmother to conceal the fact she was dead.Prosecutors allege Stephanie is the person seen on CCTV footage leaving the house wearing a dark green coat and carrying a black suitcase as a “ruse” to give the impression her grandmother had stormed out.Keith Johnston, Stephanie’s father and the ex-partner of Louise, is also accused of impeding Green’s prosecution. All three deny having done so.After legal argument the trial judge, Mr Justice Paul McDermott, withdrew a separate charge that Keith, a handyman, had allegedly refurbished a bathroom in the house to conceal evidence of a crime.Louise testified that living with her mother was like “walking on eggshells” and that that she could be violent and abusive. Greene told the court the victim had threatened the family and frightened the children.The jury heard that Greene walked into a police station on 12 June 2017, two weeks after the alleged murder, and said he had done “something terrible” and scattered body parts in the mountains.He described to gardaí chopping up his mother-in-law “to make her lighter” and packing the parts into black bags. The remains were found the same week.Greene said O‘Connor had attacked him in the bathroom and he had defended himself with a hurley stick, saying he panicked and did not intend to kill her. “I couldn’t overpower her if I wanted to kill her, why would I wait 10 years?”A pathologist testified that a solid implement struck O‘Connor’s head at least three times and that the cause of death was blunt force trauma.In December 2017, Greene amended his version and told police that O‘Connor’s husband, Gus, had killed her and that Keith Johnston, his partner’s ex, had dismembered the body. He claimed he was “set up” to take the blame.Prosecutors said Greene changed his story because he believed that while he was in custody his partner had resumed a relationship with her ex, and was jealous. They told the jury his first version was more coherent and credible.The trial is expected to conclude this week."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4175776.1581946108!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus irish passengers trapped on cruise ship in japan set to be evacuated","story":"The coronavirus has now spread to 25 countries, and experts here regard it as highly likely it will arrive in Ireland at some point. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t US citizens wave from a bus as they leave the Diamond Princess cruise ship  in Yokohama on Sunday night. Photograph:  Franck RobichonEPAIrish passengers trapped on a cruise ship off Yokohama in Japan for the past fortnight because of the coronavirus are expected to be evacuated after the Department of Foreign Affairs said it was examining proposals for them.The United States on Sunday began taking its citizens off the Diamond Princess. Canada, Italy, South Korea, Australia and Hong Kong were also making plans for their citizens among the 3,700 passengers and crew.In response to queries about the possible evacuation of at least two Irish passengers, a department spokeswoman said: “We are working with other like-minded countries.”She added the Irish passengers, believed to be a couple from Co Meath, were receiving consular assistance. They were expected to face another two-week quarantine period once off the ship.The Japanese authorities had said the results of tests for the virus performed on everyone on board would be available by Friday, when staggered disembarkations could begin. However, the US authorities had begun to take about 400 of its citizens off the ship on Sunday.Some 355 cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed among the ship’s passengers, including 70 on Sunday. All of the ill have been brought ashore to hospitals.About 420 cases of the virus have been officially recorded in Japan, including one fatality - making it host to the worst outbreak outside China. Japan’s government admits it is increasingly struggling to keep track of new infections. Five people, including a doctor and his wife, have come down with the virus at a hospital in Wakayama Prefecture, hundreds of kilometres from Yokohama. The government has revealed a cluster of eight new cases in Tokyo, most apparently infected by the same taxi driver.“Japan seems to have entered a new phase where the infection route of several new cases is unclear,” health minister Katsunobu Kato warned on Monday. The US was the first country to remove its citizens from the stricken liner. On Monday morning, about 340 Americans were flown by chartered flight to California and Texas, where they will be quarantined for two weeks at military bases. A total of 40 Americans have reportedly been infected on the ship. Some have been transferred to hospitals in Japan but 14 who have the virus but no symptoms were controversially allowed to fly home in what the US Department of State called a “specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft”.Matthew Smith, an American passenger who decided to stay on the Diamond Princess tweeted on Monday: “OMG: US Gov’t said they would not put anyone on planes who was symptomatic, and they ended up knowingly and intentionally putting on 14 people who actually have the virus. Decision not to be evacuated  best decision ever.”The remaining passengers, most of whom are aged 60 or older, are scheduled to be released from quarantine in stages from Wednesday.Experts fear the Covid-19 crisis could begin to overwhelm Japanese medical facilities if it spreads. One hospital in the western suburbs of metropolitan Tokyo was forced to stop treating outpatients on Monday after a nurse fell ill. The nurse had been treating an elderly woman who died last week. The Japanese government is taking increasingly severe measures to keep the disease at bay. On Monday it cancelled public celebrations for the birthday of Emperor Naruhito later this week. Tokyo’s Marathon, which is scheduled for March 1st and expected to draw 38,000 runners, has also been curtailed.

Six Irish citizens were on board.Mr Coveney said: “Two of these tested positive for COVID-19 and are currently being treated in hospital in Japan. These citizens share dual citizenship with another EU member state and are not normally resident in Ireland.“Our Embassy in Tokyo is in ongoing contact with them regarding their consular needs.“We are also in close contact with those who remain in quarantine on the ship. We are working with our EU Partners and other like-minded countries regarding options for their return.”Mr Coveney said nine Irish citizens were passengers on the Westerdam Cruise Ship, which is currently docked off Sihanoukville, Cambodia.“Seven are currently being screened, along with other passengers and crew. Our Embassy in Hanoi is in ongoing contact with the citizens regarding their consular needs. Only two of these seven are normally resident in Ireland.“Two further Irish citizens, who were also passengers on the Westerdam, returned to Ireland over the weekend. The Health Service was informed. No further comment will be made about an iniduals health or healthcare. To date, the Department of Health has confirmed there are no cases of COVID-19 in Ireland.”Earlier, The  learned that two Irish passengers aboard the MS Westerdam returned home and entered self-imposed isolation for potential coronavirus after the ship docked in Cambodia last week.Passengers were allowed to disembark from the ship but an American later tested positive for the Covid-19 virus.The development follows confirmation from Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney that Irish nationals were onboard the ship and that more were also onboard the Princess Diamond off Tokyo.The Department of Foreign Affairs is currently offering consular services to those affected and establishing whether anyone requires medical attention.“We are talking with our European partners about how, or if, they will get home,” Mr Coveney added.The total number of Irish passport-holders onboard the two ships is not yet clear but is understood to be below ten. The Department of Health will not comment on inidual cases.Ireland does not operate a system of enforced quarantine. In line with EU guidelines, it advises anyone who may have suspect symptoms to contact their GP and arrange to be tested.“You will remain in isolation until a test result is generated,” official Department of Health guidance advises.As yet there have been no confirmed cases of coronavirus, or Covid-19, in Ireland and the situation is being kept under ongoing review by health officials.Last week the Westerdam was refused access to several international ports before being allowed to dock in Cambodia where passengers were permitted to disembark.The New York Times reported that while hundreds had left the ship one American passenger later tested positive for the virus, sparking a frantic effort to determine the scale of any potential problem.There are also several Irish citizens on board the Diamond Princess off the Japanese coast, including a married couple from Co Meath and a couple with dual Irish-German nationality.“They’re exhausted and don’t want to communicate with anyone,” a source told The .Síle Nic Chormaic, an Irish scientist at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology said criticism of Japan’s handling of the crisis missed the mark.“Any government that puts about 100 medical staff into a ship like that is doing something right they wouldn’t do it in Ireland,” she said.“How are you going to release 3,700 people and not infect thousands more - and where are you going to put them?”As regards the spread of infection, Ms Nic Chormaic said it could happen through normal human interaction between crew and passengers.“You can’t touch your money or passport - maybe some people didn’t realise that,” she said.Reports from Japan said there were 88 more cases on board the Diamond Princess as of Tuesday, bringing total to 542.As for the Westerdam, its operators Holland America Line, which is owned by cruise giant Carnival Corp, said 255 guests and 747 crew were still aboard awaiting clearance. The ship docked at the port of Sihanoukville on Friday.“We anticipate this will take several days and greatly appreciate the thoroughness of all authorities involved in resolving this situation,” a statement from the cruise line said.Another 406 passengers who had been transferred to Phnom Penh have tested negative for the infection.“Cleared guests may travel home, and arrangements are being made for those guests,” the company statement said.Some 1,455 passengers and 802 crew boarded the cruise ship when it set sail on February 1st from Hong Kong. The vessel spent two weeks at sea after being turned away by Japan, Taiwan, Guam, the Philippines and Thailand even though the ship said there were no coronavirus cases aboard.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4177423.1582034755!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"alan kelly seeking to return labour to leadership of the left","story":"Tipperary TD Alan Kelly has announced that he is running to become the next leader of the Labour Party.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAlan Kelly TD (centre) pictured with other members of the Labour Party in Buswells Hotel Dublin where he announced his candidacy for leader of the Labour Party. Photograph: Aidan CrawleyThe Tipperary TD Alan Kelly has announced that he is running to become the next leader of the Labour Party. He was nominated to succeed Brendan Howlin by TDs Seán Sherlock and Duncan Smith. Announcing his candidacy in Buswells Hotel in Dublin on Tuesday, Mr Kelly said he wanted to restore Labour to the “leadership of the left”.“This party was founded to advance the interests of workers,” he said. “Now it is time to go back to basics.”Former TD Jan O’Sullivan will be his director of elections and another ex-TD, Willie Penrose, also endorsed Mr Kelly’s candidacy.Louth TD Ged Nash earlier ruled himself out of the leadership contest after what he said was a period of “considerable reflection”. Dublin Bay North TD Aodhán Ó Ríordáin is also thought to be interested in running for the position. Mr Kelly told the launch of his campaign, which was attended by former Labour TDs such as Joanna Tuffy and Robert Dowds, councillors and general election candidates, that he looked forward to a leadership contest. “I relish a contest. It would be good for the party,” he said. Doors closedThe former minister for the environment said Labour needs to move past apologising for policies implemented in the past. He said “too many doors were closed to us, too many minds were closed to us” in recent years and that this must change.“We probably need as a party to just move on. The days of apologising are over,” he added. When asked if he would lead Labour back into government, Mr Kelly said: “No, we are going to rebuild. We don’t have a mandate to be in government...We are though willing to support certain policies if they are being pursued.” Mr Kelly also said he would co-operate with the Social Democrats, who also have six seats, in the Dáil.“We’d be open to always co-operating with anyone. As regards ideology, I suppose they are the closest, they are like first cousins to us in fairness, so we certainly would be willing to work with them. “It is too early to talk about any form of merger or anything like that with the Social Democrats. They are their own party, I respect that. We’ll do our work and we’ll see where things go into the future.”Mr Nash, who won back his Dáil seat in the general election, said party members and supporters “across the country” had contacted him in recent days to encourage him to contest the election, but he had decided against doing so. He said his hometown of Drogheda was at present “faced with a particular set of complex challenges”. ‘Immediate focus’“There is a responsibility on my local Dáil colleagues and I to work night and day both locally and nationally to fix them. This is where my immediate focus must lie,” he said.“I look forward to playing a full and central role in the reorientation, renewal and revitalisation of our party under a new leader.”Mr Howlin announced last week that he would be stepping down from the position he was elected unopposed to in May 2016. Mr Kelly sought to run for the position at that time but none of his parliamentary colleagues were prepared to second his nomination.Labour won less than 4.4 per cent of the first preference vote in this month’s general election and returns to the Dáil with six TDs, one fewer than its total after the 2016 election. Candidates for the leadership will have until Friday to announce they are seeking nominations from Labour’s group of six TDs. An alternate route to nomination, involving constituency organisations, will be open until the following February 28th, although it is not anticipated this will be used.

Photograph: Tom HonanThe .Coalition formation talks should take weeks not months Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said, as his deputy Catherine Martin called on other parties to “woman up” and get on with the process.Mr Ryan also confirmed that he hoped his colleagues would nominate him for taoiseach and would not be nominating a candidate for the position of Ceann Comhairle when the 33rd Dáil sits on Thursday for the first time.The Dublin Bay South TD was speaking as his newly enlarged parliamentary party of 12 TDs, up from three when the Dáil was dissolved last month, and a Senator met at Leinster House.He said he and Ms Martin were there in 2016 when it took three months to form a coalition after an inconclusive election result.“I don’t think it should be months. I think it’s more a matter of weeks,” he said of the process this time around. “We shouldn’t rush it. To get it right may take time and we’re taking a lot of experience from our continental colleagues, who particularly have done this many times with multilateral talks.”Mr Ryan said a bilateral process of talks helps and informed all the parties of what they want to do.“It’s still several weeks if you were negotiating a programme for government to get the level of detail that you need. It’s several weeks, it’s not days but it shouldn’t be months because there is a job to do and we should get on with it.”UsefulMr Ryan said the Greens want to talk in detail with each party about policies and how to meet targets on reducing the impact of climate change. He said that process is useful “no matter where people end up whether in opposition or in government”.He confirmed the party’s red line issues included a 7 per cent annual reduction in carbon emissions as well as massive investment in public transport, public and cost-rental housing, retrofitting and change in “how we do energy”.The Green Party is in continuing contact with Sinn Féin about setting up a first meeting to discuss their priorities for being in government but Mr Ryan acknowledged that it would be difficult to get a stable left-wing government in place.“It will take three or four years to do anything not two or three months. But how such a government could last more than three months is hard to see.”Ms Martin said a lot of weeks were wasted after the election in 2016 and people were getting very frustrated with the political system.“We’re trying to get the other parties, I used the phrase at the weekend, to ‘woman up’ and sit down with each other,” Ms Martin said. “I’d love if we could stop another two weeks of this toying around with ‘will you or won’t you’.”DanceShe referenced comments by Independent TD Michael Healy-Rae, who said the process was like being in the dance hall, and said “no one will come into the middle and actually ask someone to dance”.Mr Ryan said he believed a confidence and supply arrangement, as was implemented after the 2016 general election, was unlikely to be revisited this time.He also said it was Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s prerogative to say that he wanted to lead his party into opposition.“I think we should be careful about this process,” he added. “The last week has been just going around in circles, where people are not really getting down to the detail.” Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

He quit on Monday, saying the “media hysteria” about his posts meant he had become a distraction for the government.Mr Sabisky’s comments and the way he was appointed have caused upset both outside and within Mr Johnson’s ruling Conservative Party, with junior business minister Kwasi Kwarteng saying they were “offensive and racist”.Mr Cummings, the former campaign director of the successful “Vote Leave” Brexit campaign in the 2016 referendum, is Mr Johnson’s most powerful adviser. He helped prompt the resignation of Sajid Javid as finance minister last week.He says many British institutions – including the state – need reform and are too often governed by lazy thinkers who lack prescience.Lower IQMr Sabisky’s case led to calls for better vetting of Downing Street appointees.He had posted comments on social media saying that data showed the US black population had lower IQ than white people, and, in a 2016 interview with digital publication Schools Week, discussed the benefits of genetic selection.Following his resignation, he claimed he was the victim of character assassination. He said he hoped Mr Johnson’s office hired more people with “good geopolitical forecasting track records” and that the “media learn to stop selective quoting”.Mr Kwarteng told Sky News that Mr Sabisky’s comments were “offensive and racist”.“He was someone who had reprehensible views,” Mr Kwarteng said. “Obviously we can’t have people with those kind of views operating at the heart of government.”The government would be looking at the vetting process more closely, he said.On Monday, the prime minister’s spokesman repeatedly refused to comment when asked about Mr Sabisky and whether Mr Johnson shared his views.Mr Johnson has himself faced criticism in the past for referring to African people as “piccaninnies” with “watermelon smiles”. – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons february 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Politics latest news: No 10 must look at hiring process after Andrew Sabisky \u0026#39racism\u0026#39 row, says minister Coronavirus latest news: Europe braces for coronavirus-induced drug shortagesComment: Labour\u0026#39s last leader hopefuls are all too cowardly to confront this one truthTuesday evening news briefing: Drug shortage fears as coronavirus slows Chinese factoriesComment: The EU is terrified by Britain\u0026#39s new strategy for Brexit talksRace to succeed Angela Merkel thrown into confusion by unexpected candidatePolice make arrest following Extinction Rebellion Trinity College protestHeavy fighting erupts in separatist-held eastern UkraineAssad says Syrian regime will see victory \u0026#39sooner or later\u0026#39 as hospitals and refugee camp targetedFather teaches young daughter to laugh at bombs to help cope with Syrian warPolice Taser knife-wielding man who boarded a train in south London after dramatic chaseItaly\u0026#39s famed Cinque Terre region launches campaign to save crumbling dry-stone walls Ashraf Ghani wins re-election as president of Afghanistan amid uncertainty over peace talksNew South Wales bushfire destruction means koalas could \u0026#39disappear from the state by 2050\u0026#39British cruise couple diagnosed with coronavirus as Government plans evacuation flight Comment: Boris Johnson\u0026#39s buccaneering new Brexit sherpa symbolises a new approach to BrusselsFormer Paralympian occupies HS2 drill for Extinction Rebellion protestWhen Caroline Flack shone brightest: the touching story behind her Strictly triumphNHS will refuse to treat patients who are sexist and racist, as new figures show rising levels of abuse   High-ranking Wuhan hospital director dies of coronavirus as Chinese officials begin stringent door-to-door checksUK weather: \u0026#39This is not normal flooding.

Writing for the  yesterday, Huw Merriman, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on the BBC, warned of “an unedifying vendetta against this much-loved organisation” by “senior government aides”. Mr Merriman and co are right about tone, I suspect, but wrong in the content of their argument. They are right that the Government should not trash the BBC. They are wrong to conclude that the corporation can carry on as before. It is essential to understand that technological and generational change has already destroyed the BBC’s century-old “wider still and wider” doctrine. It is simply not possible for it to dominate all fields any longer. The BBC must start to decolonise. It needs government help to do this in a dignified manner – more like British imperial decline than like the fall of the Soviet Union. Any declining organisation needs to develop its strengths and jettison its weaknesses. Here are some of the strengths: global reputation a service to all regions and nations within the kingdom Radio 3 Radio 4 depth of research. Here are some weaknesses: entertainment channels, including Radio 1 and Radio 2, which could be better done commercially a website which crushes competition a massive, talent-destroying bureaucracy and, yes, bias. This bias is not chiefly party political (though it is certainly anti-Tory). It is politicocultural – woke, pro-Remain, credulously green, anti-market, obsessed with issues connected with “ersity”, yet itself not truly erse at all. This means that the BBC excludes a vast range of people, views and activities which are important in the life of this country. If you had watched only the BBC in 2016, it would have come as an almost total shock to you when 17.4 million people voted Leave. The bias led to blindness. This means that it is not a good public service. I have studied the way this bias operates for a long time, and I am convinced that it will never reduce until the BBC’s monopoly disappears.The greatest single wrong on which the BBC rests is the licence fee. It is an offence to freedom and a poll tax for anyone with a television (and, nowadays, a computer or mobile phone). Non-payers, almost always poor, clog the magistrates’ courts. They are pursued by TV Licensing, a ruthless organisation which implies untruthfully that it can enter their homes. Technology nowadays means that evasion can easily succeed, so the courts catch only the weak. Means of payment involving choice have to be found. In the short term, a much lower licence fee would help. Should the BBC TV licence fee be scrapped? POLLPetroc Trelawny, the Radio 3 presenter, complains that Boris Johnson has “no more right than any licence-fee payer” to dictate the future of the BBC. His remark exposes BBC arrogance. The corporation exists under a charter provided by government, and is allowed to earn nearly £4 billion a year from the licence fee because of this. Any prime minister has not only a right, but a duty to make sure that this immense privilege is not abused. Inside the BBC’s enormous out-workings of imperial flummery lies some basic good – people who are interested in accuracy, moderation, balance, high culture, free speech, British traditions. “Out there” sit many viewers and listeners who care about these qualities too and want to rescue them. The politico-cultural task of this Government in the years before the charter runs out in 2027 is to see what can be salvaged from the wreckage caused by the BBC’s own imperial folly. Sedwill, in his shirtsleeves, sitting next to the Prime Minister at a Cabinet meeting last weekIn the recent photographs of Boris Johnson’s new Cabinet, only one man (so far as one could see) was in shirtsleeves. This was the Cabinet Secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill. All the rest were fully suited.  I wonder why Sir Mark affects this style. It has become old-fashioned – dating, I think, from the Tony Blair era, when shirtsleeves were seen as a rejection of Tory stuffiness. On one laughably staged occasion, Mr Blair even appeared thus dressed outside in Downing Street, clutching a mug of tea with pictures of his family on it. In those days, young Mark Sedwill was, among other things, private secretary to the foreign secretary. As an ambitious young official, he may have thought that dressing down would raise him up. Perhaps it did. In fact, informality is usually inappropriate for the public face of government. Cabinet ministers have serious business to transact on behalf of us all. They should dress as if they know that. Dressing down is supposed to convey accessibility, but actually – like men putting their feet on the desk (a fault I must myself confess to) – it looks as if you think you own the place.In 2017, when he was our new national security adviser, Sir Mark shared a platform in Washington DC with his US opposite number Lt-Gen HR McMaster. This was the first time such a joint public appearance between two NSC advisers had ever happened. Americans in the audience afterwards remarked unfavourably on the contrast between the formally attired general and the shirt-sleeved Brit. The former looked up to the task, the latter like a pipsqueak. Sir Mark is no pipsqueak, but he needs to look right. Even the notoriously scruffy Boris Johnson, who is next to Sir Mark in the Cabinet picture, has managed to get his suit on. No 10 must look at hiring process after Andrew Sabisky \u0026#39racism\u0026#39 row, says minister Coronavirus latest news: Europe braces for coronavirus-induced drug shortagesComment: Labour\u0026#39s last leader hopefuls are all too cowardly to confront this one truthTuesday evening news briefing: Drug shortage fears as coronavirus slows Chinese factoriesComment: The EU is terrified by Britain\u0026#39s new strategy for Brexit talksRace to succeed Angela Merkel thrown into confusion by unexpected candidatePolice make arrest following Extinction Rebellion Trinity College protestHeavy fighting erupts in separatist-held eastern UkraineAssad says Syrian regime will see victory \u0026#39sooner or later\u0026#39 as hospitals and refugee camp targetedFather teaches young daughter to laugh at bombs to help cope with Syrian warPolice Taser knife-wielding man who boarded a train in south London after dramatic chaseItaly\u0026#39s famed Cinque Terre region launches campaign to save crumbling dry-stone walls Ashraf Ghani wins re-election as president of Afghanistan amid uncertainty over peace talksNew South Wales bushfire destruction means koalas could \u0026#39disappear from the state by 2050\u0026#39British cruise couple diagnosed with coronavirus as Government plans evacuation flight Comment: Boris Johnson\u0026#39s buccaneering new Brexit sherpa symbolises a new approach to BrusselsFormer Paralympian occupies HS2 drill for Extinction Rebellion protestWhen Caroline Flack shone brightest: the touching story behind her Strictly triumphNHS will refuse to treat patients who are sexist and racist, as new figures show rising levels of abuse   High-ranking Wuhan hospital director dies of coronavirus as Chinese officials begin stringent door-to-door checksWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 18th february 2020","story":"A walker battles with his umbrella in the wind as water cascades down the dam wall of Wet Sleddale reservoir near Shap in Cumbria, UK,  this morning after days of heavy rain from Storm Dennis.Politics latest news: No 10 must look at hiring process after Andrew Sabisky \u0026#39racism\u0026#39 row, says minister Coronavirus latest news: Europe braces for coronavirus-induced drug shortagesComment: Labour\u0026#39s last leader hopefuls are all too cowardly to confront this one truthTuesday evening news briefing: Drug shortage fears as coronavirus slows Chinese factoriesComment: The EU is terrified by Britain\u0026#39s new strategy for Brexit talksRace to succeed Angela Merkel thrown into confusion by unexpected candidatePolice make arrest following Extinction Rebellion Trinity College protestHeavy fighting erupts in separatist-held eastern UkraineAssad says Syrian regime will see victory \u0026#39sooner or later\u0026#39 as hospitals and refugee camp targetedFather teaches young daughter to laugh at bombs to help cope with Syrian warPolice Taser knife-wielding man who boarded a train in south London after dramatic chaseItaly\u0026#39s famed Cinque Terre region launches campaign to save crumbling dry-stone walls Ashraf Ghani wins re-election as president of Afghanistan amid uncertainty over peace talksNew South Wales bushfire destruction means koalas could \u0026#39disappear from the state by 2050\u0026#39British cruise couple diagnosed with coronavirus as Government plans evacuation flight Comment: Boris Johnson\u0026#39s buccaneering new Brexit sherpa symbolises a new approach to BrusselsFormer Paralympian occupies HS2 drill for Extinction Rebellion protestWhen Caroline Flack shone brightest: the touching story behind her Strictly triumphNHS will refuse to treat patients who are sexist and racist, as new figures show rising levels of abuse   High-ranking Wuhan hospital director dies of coronavirus as Chinese officials begin stringent door-to-door checksUK weather: \u0026#39This is not normal flooding.

The ads missed out the fact that\u0026nbsp96 per cent of BP’s capital expenditure is on oil and gas.Thanks in part to the efforts of groups like environmental lawyers ClientEarth which launched a complaint against over the campaign, the company has been held to account.Two decades – and billions of barrels of oil – since BP had the chutzpah to relaunch itself as “beyond petroleum”, people have seen through the facade.“In future, any corporate advertising will be to push for progressive climate policy communicate our net zero ambition invite ideas or build collaboration,” BP said.This statement, unlike the target to go carbon neutral by 2050, can be scrutinised immediately and it will be. I will be closely watching BP’s public statements on climate change this year, as well as its advertising and involvement with groups like the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, to check that they measure up.We can all play a part in this too. Earlier this month Ryanair was banned from claiming that it was Europe’s “lowest CO2 emissions airline”. The Advertising Standards Authority ruled that the statement couldn’t be backed up.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

BP sets target to achieve net zero by 2050 to tackle climate emergencyThe climate crisis is real, but Boris Johnson still ‘doesn’t get it’Boris Johnson forces out UK president of climate change summitAnyone can make a complaint to the ASA about an issue like an misleading environmental claim, it just requires filling out a few boxes on an online form.If this action does not stop airlines and oil companies producing dodgy ads on climate change, sterner laws must be enforced. ClientEarth’s suggestion that fossil fuel adverts should be banned unless they have a tobacco-style health warning need to be\u0026nbspconsidered.A fossil fuel company portraying itself as good for the climate is no less ridiculous, or dangerous, than the tobacco companies that in the 1950s pushed cigarettes with recommendations from friendly-looking doctors.Companies that create misleading adverts about climate change need to face the prospect of fines, not just damage to their\u0026nbspreputation. Currently the ASA, is self-funded by advertisers themselves and can only ban particular promotions, often months after they’ve\u0026nbspgone out.While advertising is an important way that large greenhouse gas emitters can use their financial clout to shift the debate in their favour, a more significant front on the climate change\u0026nbspinformation war\u0026nbspis political lobbying.Here too, BP has laid down a marker by which it can be judged not in 10 years or 20 years, but almost immediately.\u0026nbspThe company laid out a less aggressive approach to lobbying, stating that it would “set new expectations” for its relationships with oil industry trade associations. Where those influential groups are pushing for policies that don’t align with BP’s new approach, it will leave.Created with Sketch.Youth Strike for Climate: London protest in photos Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Basically, this is an admission that BP’s net-zero ambition simply has no credibility if the company remains a member of powerful lobby groups like the American Petroleum Institute which has for decades funded climate change denial in a successful effort to cast doubt on the scientific consensus. BP either has to fundamentally change the API or leave it.The impact of a big oil industry player changing tack could be considerable but action needs to follow words. I’ll also be scrutinising other large oil industry firms about whether they will follow BP in “advocating for policies that support net zero, including carbon pricing”.Fossil fuel lobbyists have vast budgets that allow\u0026nbspthem\u0026nbspto shift public policy and discussion significantly towards the industry’s own interests over and above those of everyone else.In any case, oil companies\u0026nbsplike formerly state-owned BP have frequently been pushing on open doors in the corridors of power. Seen by\u0026nbsppoliticians\u0026nbspto be of strategic national importance, oil majors have provided\u0026nbspthe vital commodity that fuels economic growth and\u0026nbspdelivers votes.It’s fair to say the oil majors have frequently enjoyed a cosy relationship with governments sympathetic to their aims.\u0026nbspVast budgets to fund misinformation and dodgy science have been key to prolonging the life of fossil fuel industry decades after oil companies knew climate change was dangerous and man-made.\u0026nbspClimate campaigners, who have enjoyed less privileged access to political decision-makers, have therefore been fighting a hugely asymmetric battle but one which they may now finally be starting to win.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Words by Stacey Smith213 ‘Rachel Ama’s Vegan Eats: Tasty plant-based recipes for every day’ by Rachel Ama. Published by Ebury Press: £12.87, AmazonSince launching her vegan YouTube channel in 2017, Rachel has gained a heap of hungry followers who lap up her simple, delicious recipes (and the dance moves that go along with them). Dishes are often one-pot, can be prepped ahead, and most include a song recommendation so you can dance along as you cook. Within these pages, you’ll find plenty of meals inspired by Ama’s Caribbean and West African roots – from crispy jerk barbecue tacos or ackee “saltfish” with dumplings to peanut stew. Although this is really a celebration of all cultures – and with vegan takes on everything from Thai green curry to creamy cashew and vegetable no-pasta lasagne, we’re pretty confident you’ll find your favourite comfort dish has been given a plant-based makeover. With most ingredients easy to obtain and meals quick to put together, this is modern cooking, for the meat-shunning millennial. 313 ‘BOSH! Healthy Vegan’ by Henry Firth \u0026amp Ian Theasby. Published by HQ: £10.87, AmazonWorking with a registered dietician to ensure recipes follow trusted NHS guidelines, the BOSH! boys (aka, Henry and Ian) have bought us their healthiest cookbook to date. Recognising that just because a plate of food is vegan, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s healthy (vegan junk food certainly exists!), this is a collection of 80 new recipes showcasing their flavoursome vegan food with a healthier focus. Along with advice on sleep, movement and relaxing, there’s guidance on ensuring you get all the nutrients you need. And although the boys insist this isn’t a diet book, you’ll find recipes to help you reduce fat, build muscle and generally be a bit healthier. So whether you’re looking to up your protein intake (try the ultimate veg tacos), reduce your sugar intake with a summer-berry granola bowl or keep your calorie intake to under 500 per portion with puttanesca potato stew, you should be left feeling suitably inspired to kick start the new year.413 ‘Happy Vegan: Easy plant-based recipes to make the whole family happy’ by Fearne Cotton. Published by Seven Dials: £13.46, AmazonDespite Fearne Cotton not being a fully-fledged vegan herself (or perhaps because), this book got rave reviews from our panel, with both flexitarians, meat-eaters and vegans alike. Recipes are approachable, inexpensive and perfect for the whole family, so we can see ourselves working through them all in time. The broccoli katsu curry was a particular favourite and surprisingly easy to make and for tea time we’ll be trying our hand at her date and almond cake with caramel sauce which uses white miso paste and coconut cream to great effect.513 ‘Vegan One Pound Meals: Delicious budget-friendly plant-based recipes all for £1 per person’ by Miguel Barclay. Published by Headline Home: £10.75, AmazonIf ever there’s a time we feel the pinch, it’s January, with the festivities of Christmas long behind us but the credit card still to pay. Thankfully eating a plant-based diet could be the answer and in this book, you’ll find over 85 recipes all coming in at a frankly unbelievable £1 a portion. Our concerns that we’d be living off of beans on toast were quickly alleviated as we tucked into black bean meatballs and sticky aubergine bao. Full-flavoured, quick and easy, we couldn’t really ask for more.613 ‘Incredible Plant-Based Desserts: Colorful Vegan Cakes, Cookies, Tarts, and other Epic Delights’ by Anthea Cheng. Published by Quarry Books: £11.89, AmazonCalling all sweet-tooths! This collection of recipes from Australian blogger Anthea Cheng is celebratory food for the keen baker. You certainly couldn’t call dried rainbow pear slices convenient, quick or easy to make, however the impact they have when used to decorate her chai cake is truly show-stopping. If that all sounds a little intimidating, we found the Snack Time chapter much more manageable, with the likes of bliss balls, chocolate cups and cookies vying for attention, as well as Instagrammable breakfast bowls, beautifully presented with nut butters, granola and oats.713 ‘Dirty Vegan Another Bite’ by Matt Pritchard, published by Octopus Books: £20, Octopus BooksAfter 10 years of hard partying finally caught up with him, Matt decided to switch from the crazy pranks of MTV’s Dirty Sanchez to fitness – and is now a completely vegan endurance athlete. Believing a natural diet is key, Matt’s second cookbook is brimming with recipes full of veggies and largely focuses on un-processed ingredients (keeping the vegan cheese or meat-substitutes to a minimum). Some of Pritchard’s favourites include roasting tin laksa, sticky tofu bao buns and rhubarb and custard doughnuts. If you’re yet to convince your pal\u0027s that veganism is the way forward, we reckon the Dinner with Mates chapter will convert a few of them, with all the recipes you need to create a Mexican feast, a perfect picnic, a banging BBQ or a cracking Christmas spread. All in all we found recipes really varied, with us ear-marking nearly all of them to try at once.813 ‘5 Ingredient Vegan’ by Katy Beskow. Published by Quadrille: £12.08, AmazonLet’s face it, at the end of a long day the last thing any of us want to be doing – whether we’re following a plant-based diet or not – is trying to track down long lists of hard to find ingredients. This is the fourth book from the award-winning cook, writer and cookery tutor Katy Beskow and follows a similar simplified format, with each recipe requiring just five ingredients. Chapters include soups, lunches suppers, sweets and basics, with recipes beautifully laid out and gorgeous photography accompanying each one. Far from being basic, we were amazed to see we could create a beautiful Mediterranean briam (a layered courgette, potato and red onion bake from Greece) which was as delicious hot with crusty bread as it was cold for lunch the next day.913 ‘Zaika: Vegan recipes from India’ by Romy Gill. Published by Seven Dials : £10, AmazonGrowing up in a small town in West Bengal, India, very few people, including Romy Gill’s own family, ate meat regularly. It’s this home-cooked vegan food of her childhood that the chef and food writer wanted to share with us through her debut cookbook Zaika – meaning taste, or flavour. There’s an entire section dedicated to bread, including gram flour turmeric pancakes which are perfect with chutneys, a variety of rotis and parathas and light naan bread with nigella seeds. The Light \u0026amp Breezy chapter is all about showcasing the freshest ingredients – think watermelon and mint salad while the Warming the Heart chapter is where you’ll find hearty comfort food such as spicy red lentil dahl. The section we most fell for though was Labours of Love for when you’ve got time to really get lost in the kitchen – rich, creamy and so warming, we recommend the Baingan masala with baby aubergines, dill and coconut.1013 ‘Rebel Recipes: Maximum flavour, minimum fuss: the ultimate in vegan food’ by Niki Webster. Published by Bloomsbury: £18, AmazonThe debut book from award-winning blogger and food consultant Nikki Webster shares the same ethos as her blog Rebel Recipes – that healthy food needn’t be boring or lacking in flavour. Taking inspiration from around the globe, you could never accuse these recipes of being dull. If only we could start every day with creamy spiced coconut porridge and sticky sesame banana! Instead of relying on stale vegan ingredients and recipes – this is new-school vegan cuisine for those seeking full flavours. Although despite this, recipes were easy to follow and largely uncomplicated – with lots of spicy curries, pulses, flatbreads, salads, dips and pickles making an appearance. With mouth-watering photography throughout, the Can’t Believe It’s Vegan Desserts chapter is a particular highlight, with the likes of chocolate ganache tart, easy espresso martini pots and lemon curd and thyme tart. 1113 ‘Green: Veggie and vegan meals for no-fuss weeks and relaxed weekends’ by Elly Pear (Curshen). Published by Ebury Press: £14.99, AmazonWhile this title isn’t 100 per cent vegan, half of the book is made up of plant-based recipes so we felt it was still well worth including. Acknowledging that most of us have more time to experiment in the kitchen at the weekend yet need dinner on the table pronto mid-week, Elly Pear’s book separates dishes accordingly. We’re very keen to incorporate more Sunday night batch-cooking into our weekly routine, in order to eat better later in the week and with tray bakes, one-pot wonders and freeze-able options, this will keep us suitably inspired.1213 ‘Vegan (ish): 100 simple, budget recipes that don\u0027t cost the earth’ by Jack Monroe. Published by Bluebird: £10.66, AmazonDon’t be fooled by the title, every one of the 100 recipes within this book is completely vegan. The “ish” comes from Jack Monroe’s belief that if we were all to incorporate a few more plant-based meals into our diet each week, we’d be better off both environmentally and financially. So you needn’t be a full-time vegan to appreciate the practical, inexpensive solutions within this book. Although perhaps not the sexiest food chapter to ever be written – the whole section on sandwiches was inherently helpful for midweek meal inspiration (especially when you consider the “standard” fillings of cheese, ham, tuna, etc obviously aren’t vegan). In true Jack Monroe style, we loved the no-nonsense, easy to follow recipes and believe we’ll turn to this cookbook on a regular basis. 1313 ‘7 Day Vegan Challenge’ by Bettina Campolucci-Bordi. Published by Hardie Grant: £9.72, WorderyIf you’re tempted to give this vegan thing a whirl but you really don’t know where to start, the 7 Day Vegan Challenge is here to help. There are three menu plans to choose from complete with shopping lists: The Easy Peasy Way (quick meals for those that don’t mind repeating some dishes), For the Planners (which requires a Sunday night batch-cooking session) and Fast \u0026amp Fresh (quick and simple recipes). So a typical weekday might look like, banoffee oats for breakfast, a convincing vegan take on the classic BLT sandwich for lunch and creamy satay noodles with salt and pepper fried tofu for tea.Veganuary becomes bigger every year, but it needn\u0027t be just for Janaury as these cookbooks make it easy and accessible.

People seem genuinely interested in the challenge I’ve set myself\u0026nbsp– but I’ve quickly learnt\u0026nbspthat while they initially want to listen to what I have to say, it doesn’t last very long.I can spot the exact moment where people switch off –\u0026nbspusually when I mention what my favourite type of tofu is or the perils of trying to make jackfruit taste like anything other than cardboard. It isn’t upsetting, but it’s a moment of realisation. It’s like going into work first thing on a Monday morning and asking someone how their weekend was you’re really just\u0026nbspdoing it out of politeness – let’s be honest, you don’t really care.One of the biggest worries I had about going vegan was that I would become the annoying person everyone has to accommodate for: you’re going to a restaurant, do they have vegan options? Nope, can’t go there.I’d like to think I’m quite a self-aware person. I know when I’m being annoying, or when people feel a certain type of way towards me.But whether I like it or not – and whether my friends, work colleagues or the people around me do too – turning vegan is (sadly) the most interesting thing about my life right now. It’s the biggest change to my life for as long as I can remember. The dramatics of this might seem high so read with a pinch of salt and don’t take it too seriously.Here’s my sub-pledge: I’m going to try and keep my conversations about veganism short and sweet. People are interested in what you have to say but not for too long.\u0026nbspHow do you know if someone is a vegan?

RBS\u0026nbspwas found to have mis-sold complex financial products to small-business customers in a bid to boost its own bottom line, while its infamous Global Restructuring\u0026nbspGroup destroyed firms to sell off their assets for a profit.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Davies\u0026nbspsaid: “The essential reason for this is, as the bank has evolved from the financial crisis and the bailout, we have focused on the NatWest brand.“We have exited a lot of the international businesses which were not profitable. That was branded RBS and that’s gone.“It really makes no sense for us to continue to be called\u0026nbspRBS. It was designed for a global group of brands, which we no longer are.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Resigned as Chancellor of the Exchequer.

Of course, it was all part of the Ziggy theatrics, a show that began with DavidZiggy walking out to the drums of “Five Years” and continued with mime, flamboyance and songs that have all become classics. I remember his appearance being heralded by music from Beethoven’s Ninth (also used in A Clockwork Orange, the film being current at the time). In those years Bowie always used it as his theme music. I also remember being blown away by the support act – a fresh, imaginative outfit called Roxy Music. (David Lister)Truly charismatic performers leave an indelible impression and I marvelled at the way Chuck Berry had the crowd in the palm of his hand when I saw him in the 1970s. But few could match Dolly Parton in her prime for her larger-than-life enthusiasm and sheer sense of fun. When the country superstar came to London’s Dominion Theatre in 1983, she played some mean finger-picking banjo, sang beautifully, especially on an a capella version of “Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?” and even did an Elvis impression. Her concert was filmed for a video release and about half an hour after the crowd had left in, they brought in a large group of young punks and Goths (to intercut into crowd shots) and suggest an edgy young following. Happily, I had stayed around and saw her deliver this impromptu extra set, which was full of risqué jokes and blue banter. There’s no one quite like her. (Martin Chilton)You don’t usually realise you’re present at what will become a moment in history. But that sunny July afternoon at Wembley Stadium felt special right from the off, even if the off was Status Quo doing “Rockin’ All Over The World”. There were numerous stand-out moments perhaps on paper the biggest was the return of Paul McCartney, topping the bill after nearly five years self-enforced absence from high-profile performing following the shooting of John Lennon. Somewhat sadly the sound failed for part of “Let It Be”, but we can draw a veil over that. The most stunning set of the day came from Queen: a high energy medley through “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Radio Ga Ga” to “We Will Rock You” and “We Are The Champions”. No one fired up the crowd quite as much that day. And since the band had not been at their most visible around that time, this proved to be their resurrection. (David Lister)Blues titan BB King released two of the greatest concert albums of the 20th-century in Live at the Regal (1964) and Live in Cook County Jail (1971). Even though he was 60 when I saw him at London’s Hammersmith Odeon in 1985, he was still full of energy. He sang with passion and his guitar work was transcendent, especially on gloriously funky version of “The Thrill is Gone”. I skipped my graduation ceremony for the concert and had the good fortune to bump into an old family friend called Ray Bolden, who had worked at Dobell\u0027s Record Shop in Charing Cross Road. King\u0027s face lit up to see Ray, who had put him up in his London flat in the 1950s. The blues superstar could not have been friendlier, despite his tiredness after a long gig. Seeing Muddy Waters live in 1979 was special but BB King at full power, bending guitar notes like no one else, topped even that. (Martin Chilton)When The Jesus \u0026amp Mary Chain reached the status of noisenik godheads with their fourth album Honey’s Dead in 1992, they decided to put together a visceral modern rock revue tour called Rollercoaster that’s still ringing in my ears almost 30 years on. Of the three revolving support acts, Blur opened the night, mid-transformation from baggy latecomers to art-pop pioneers. With Damon Albarn flinging himself wildly around the stage and clambering up amp stacks, they premiered ferocious second-album character studies like “Colin Zeal” while screening films of the journey of meat from slaughterhouse to defecation, in reverse. Most crucially, with their all-horns-blazing new single “Popscene”, they kick-started Britpop right before our eyes. The Mary Chain, meanwhile, were at peak malicious, I left with my skull buzzing, my eyes opened and my tastes re-arranged, convinced I\u0027d seen the new music, and I had. A gig that didn’t just make my night, it made me. (Mark Beaumont)When Pixies came onto a London stage on my birthday in 2004 and played Pixies songs – and music just doesn’t get better than that – it was pure relief, euphoria and dark-hearted epiphany. “Tame” sent me feral, “Gigantic” was titanic, “Bone Machine” crushed out my marrow. Black Francis snarled, barked and ranted through “Gouge Away”, “Monkey Gone To Heaven” and “Debaser”, every bit the demented pervert preacher he ever was Kim Deal’s angelic coos and bass melodies made an unholy pact with Joey Santiago’s werewolf guitar riffs, seemingly played with a plectrum made of Satan’s fingernail. Of their four Brixton dates that week, I lost every ounce of my s*** at three. Best gigs ever, no particular order.North London’s tiny and now-defunct, Buffalo Bar in the 2000s, hosted early gigs from the likes of Bloc Party, The Libertines, The Maccabees – or Foals. Their show took place 14 months before the release of their debut album Antidotes, and it justified their precocious reputation as a live act. That night, the energy of their high-octane math-rock was infectious it’s not often that you see a band in their earliest days and know that this is probably the last time you’ll be able to reach out and touch them. The songs followed: The French Open, Balloons, Hummer”, “Mathletics”, all fuelled by astoundingly complex polyrhythms, interweaving staccato synths and guitar played high on the fretboard in angular electro harmonies, set to punk-disco techno beats and urgent new wave vocals. I’d never seen a rock gig so precisely engineered (a sticker on the synth read Math is for Everyone), yet so exhilarating. There was a true sense we’d discovered something great. (Elisa Bray)Problematic in every way given singer Alice Glass’s October 2017 statement accusing her former bandmate Ethan Kath of sexual abuse, non-consensual sex and controlling behaviour, but this short set in front of a small crowd in a Camden bar was proof that when a performer truly plugs into the mother lode, the intensity they generate can burn itself into your retinas and shake your soul. Glass was 19 years old, and for most of the set just a blur of spectral movement frozen into violent shapes by an almost incessant strobe singing, shouting and screaming her way through songs such as “Courtship Dating”. The result was a reminder that whenever one of your heroes gets on stage to try to channel that primal essence of “rock ’n’ roll” – or whatever the hell it is – most of the time, they’re just trying to find an echo of something that once flowed through them. That can go on for 50 years or more. There’s sadness now in the memory, but on this day in April 2008, Glass had it. (Chris Harvey)918 Nick Cave \u0026amp the Bad Seeds, Brighton Centre, 2008It used to be that rock’n’roll was a young person’s game anyone over the age of 50 still tearing it up on stage needed to calm down and have a word with themselves. Nick Cave, the latter-day harbinger of the apocalypse still identifiable by his raven hair and pallbearer’s suit, has consistently shown us the idiocy of this thinking. I’ve seen Cave perform scores of times and he has never let me down, but this show, which coincided with the release of the album Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!, was a whole new level of spectacular: funny, furious, life-affirming, heavy on the biblical melodrama. Alongside the Bad Seeds, then operating as a seven-piece coolly attired in suits, open-necked shirts and slicked-back hair, Cave showed how musical talent can deepen rather than ebb in mid-life, and how he was – and indeed remains – untouchable in terms of intellect, charisma and sheer feral energy. (Fiona Sturges)Leonard Cohen steps onto the stage, dressed in grey shirt and tie, black waistcoat, trilby concealing his white hair. It\u0027s sweltering. And yet Cohen, in his mid Seventies, is barely breaking into a sweat. Much like his attire, the songs - such as Dance Me to the End of Love and So Long, Marianne – are immaculate, his voice no longer a wail but a raw, rumbling baritone. The Spanish sun is beating down and my friends and I are genuflecting before one of the greatest lyricists of all time. This was to be the only time I saw him live and no performance has ever, in terms of pure emotional intensity, targeted me with such laser-guided precision as his rendition of Hallelujah. The song\u0027s been covered by everyone from Jeff Buckley to Alexandra Burke, but sung by him that day, it\u0027s surely never felt as moving. (Patrick Smith)The great Sixties and Seventies soul singers are nearly all gone now, and I doubt we’ll ever see their like again. Bobby Womack had recovered from colon cancer but was in the early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease, and less than a year from his death in June 2014, when he played the UK in the summer of 2013. He came on stage on a sunny Saturday afternoon at the Latitude festival, to play songs from his brilliant comeback album, The Bravest Man in the Universe, to a basking, picnicking audience. “All soul singers come from gospel,” he told them. Womack’s voice still seemed like a gift from God. The years of cocaine addiction hadn’t altered its richness and warmth. To be in the presence of Womack that day, knowing it would likely be the last time, was very special.1218 St Vincent, End of the Road, 2014Most rockstars, terrified of seeming to be trying too hard, would never dream of hiring a choreographer. But St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, is no ordinary rockstar. For her Digital Witness tour, the musician recruited Annie B Carson to help her dream up a procession of strange, shuffling moves to perform alongside her brilliant self-titled fourth album. At End of the Road Festival – a small, Dorset delight which she had played with David Byrne a year earlier – her headline set was scuzzy, eccentric, and thrilling. At one point, without missing a lick on her guitar, she rolled herself down an oversized flight of white stairs like a glitching robot. Then again, no robot can play guitar like that. (Alexandra Pollard)After 35 years away from the stage it was a moment Kate Bush fans never thought would happen. Beforehand, I was reporting from outside the venue for NME and the excitement and energy was extraordinary, like nothing I\u0027ve ever experienced. One woman told me it would be fine if she died after the gig because she would die happy. The show started with a greatest hits section. And then it all got a bit more, well, Kate Bush, with a dramatic adaptation of The Ninth Wave. Sinking ships, confetti cannons, surreal fish people and a soliloquy about sausages. Act three was more pastoral. The second side of Aerial, The Sky of Honey, was performed in front of the most beautiful visuals I\u0027ve ever seen: birds, a red sun, a moon tilting on its axis and then Kate suspended into the air. Pure theatre. As we filed out, there was a sense that the audience was stunned. I still am. (Lucy Jones)Patti Smith was celebrating the 40th anniversary of her seminal 1975 album Horses at Field Day in Victoria Park, London, 2015. The sky was a perfect blue, and the sun was still blazing hot at 7pm. “I’m sorry about the dark glasses,” Smith said by way of introduction. “I’m not trying to be cool, it’s just, you know… the sun.” “You’re the f***ing coolest!” a fan screamed back. From there, she and her band, including long-serving guitarist Lenny Kaye, embarked on a blistering set that had myself, and many other audience members, in tears. Smith is a ferocious performer, she spat and snarled and howled tearing up her guitar as though it just insulted one of her favourite poets. It didn’t matter if she messed up, as she did on “Break it Up”, because she offered the instantly immortal words: “I don’t do nothing perfect. I only f*** up perfect.” You felt you were in the presence of something momentous. (Roisin O’Connor)When D’Angelo released his surprise third record – the politically fraught Black Messiah – it ended the 14-year hiatus that followed 2000’s Voodoo. It also reminded music fans that the American hip-hop artist was still as monumentally talented as he was back then. Accompanied by his eight-strong band The Vanguard, his show at the Hammersmith Apollo was a visceral, quasi-religious experience. Jesse Johnson, formerly of Prince-produced outfit The Time, added funky hooks to “Sugah Daddy”, while legendary bassist Pino Palladino took time out from The Who\u0027s live shows to join in the fun. At one point D’Angelo led a classic James Brown funk staple, holding three fingers in the air so the band could respond with three loud vamps. One encore was followed by a second that broke the curfew with free abandon, until D’Angelo was left on stage alone, reflective and blissful. It inspired a ine kind of worship, for a show that was appropriately titled The Second Coming. (Roisin O’Connor)A week before she played Brighton, I reviewed Lorde’s Alexandra Palace show in London. It was a five-star performance – the New Zealand musician exorcised the pain of the break-up she\u0027d chronicled on her brilliant second album Melodrama, twitching and twirling as an abstract house party played out in glass boxes around her. The stage design was so good, in fact, that Kanye West may or may not have nicked it a year later. Seeing her in Brighton the following week, without a notepad in my hand, I saw even more clearly all the intimate nuances of her performance – and was free to give in entirely to the exhilarating, heartbreaking melodrama of it all. (Alexandra Pollard)When you’ve been going to gigs for decades, you tend not to expect anything new, just variations – some mind-blowing, others not – on what you have seen before. So when I saw David Byrne’s American Utopia show, it felt like stumbling on the Ark of the Covenant. Here was a man who had been working in music for 40 years completely redrawing the rules of pop performance – no drum riser, no cables, no visible amps or microphones – and taking it deep into the territory of experimental theatre. In opposition to the usual freeform live music set-up, this tour was the result of fastidious planning, with everything rehearsed to the last nanosecond. And yet, forever on the move, dressed in matching grey suits and dancing barefoot in formation, Byrne and his 12-piece band were loose-limbed, unfettered and joyous to watch. And the music was pretty great too. (Fiona Sturges)1818 Christine and the Queens, Hammersmith Apollo, 2018Before her short run at Hammersmith Apollo last year, Héloïse Letissier – known as Christine and the Queens, though she dropped all but the Chris for her second album – tweeted: “I think we finally have some surprises for those who come to the shows!” She delivered on that promise – falling snow and sand, and a balcony homage to Romeo and Juliet – as she redefined what a pop show could be. With a gender-fluid cohort of athletic dancers, she brought to theatrical life her tumultuous journey towards embracing her pansexual identity, and finding liberation. And we went through all those emotions with her, those alternately tender and powerful vocals never faltering despite the restless dance routines. Everyone was on their feet dancing, and her declaration of inclusivity could not have been more empowering: “Vive everyone!” We left thrilled and elated. (Elisa Bray)The long gone Rainbow in London’s Finsbury Park was one of the great rock venues, and though I was young at the time it would be impossible to forget the impact of Bowie in one of his first outings as Ziggy Stardust. “They haven’t even finished building the stage,” I said with breathtaking naievety to the person next to me, on observing the scaffolding and ladder.

(David Lister)Truly charismatic performers leave an indelible impression and I marvelled at the way Chuck Berry had the crowd in the palm of his hand when I saw him in the 1970s. But few could match Dolly Parton in her prime for her larger-than-life enthusiasm and sheer sense of fun. When the country superstar came to London’s Dominion Theatre in 1983, she played some mean finger-picking banjo, sang beautifully, especially on an a capella version of “Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?” and even did an Elvis impression. Her concert was filmed for a video release and about half an hour after the crowd had left in, they brought in a large group of young punks and Goths (to intercut into crowd shots) and suggest an edgy young following. Happily, I had stayed around and saw her deliver this impromptu extra set, which was full of risqué jokes and blue banter. There’s no one quite like her. (Martin Chilton)You don’t usually realise you’re present at what will become a moment in history. But that sunny July afternoon at Wembley Stadium felt special right from the off, even if the off was Status Quo doing “Rockin’ All Over The World”. There were numerous stand-out moments perhaps on paper the biggest was the return of Paul McCartney, topping the bill after nearly five years self-enforced absence from high-profile performing following the shooting of John Lennon. Somewhat sadly the sound failed for part of “Let It Be”, but we can draw a veil over that. The most stunning set of the day came from Queen: a high energy medley through “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Radio Ga Ga” to “We Will Rock You” and “We Are The Champions”. No one fired up the crowd quite as much that day. And since the band had not been at their most visible around that time, this proved to be their resurrection. (David Lister)Blues titan BB King released two of the greatest concert albums of the 20th-century in Live at the Regal (1964) and Live in Cook County Jail (1971). Even though he was 60 when I saw him at London’s Hammersmith Odeon in 1985, he was still full of energy. He sang with passion and his guitar work was transcendent, especially on gloriously funky version of “The Thrill is Gone”. I skipped my graduation ceremony for the concert and had the good fortune to bump into an old family friend called Ray Bolden, who had worked at Dobell\u0027s Record Shop in Charing Cross Road. King\u0027s face lit up to see Ray, who had put him up in his London flat in the 1950s. The blues superstar could not have been friendlier, despite his tiredness after a long gig. Seeing Muddy Waters live in 1979 was special but BB King at full power, bending guitar notes like no one else, topped even that. (Martin Chilton)When The Jesus \u0026amp Mary Chain reached the status of noisenik godheads with their fourth album Honey’s Dead in 1992, they decided to put together a visceral modern rock revue tour called Rollercoaster that’s still ringing in my ears almost 30 years on. Of the three revolving support acts, Blur opened the night, mid-transformation from baggy latecomers to art-pop pioneers. With Damon Albarn flinging himself wildly around the stage and clambering up amp stacks, they premiered ferocious second-album character studies like “Colin Zeal” while screening films of the journey of meat from slaughterhouse to defecation, in reverse. Most crucially, with their all-horns-blazing new single “Popscene”, they kick-started Britpop right before our eyes. The Mary Chain, meanwhile, were at peak malicious, I left with my skull buzzing, my eyes opened and my tastes re-arranged, convinced I\u0027d seen the new music, and I had. A gig that didn’t just make my night, it made me. (Mark Beaumont)When Pixies came onto a London stage on my birthday in 2004 and played Pixies songs – and music just doesn’t get better than that – it was pure relief, euphoria and dark-hearted epiphany. “Tame” sent me feral, “Gigantic” was titanic, “Bone Machine” crushed out my marrow. Black Francis snarled, barked and ranted through “Gouge Away”, “Monkey Gone To Heaven” and “Debaser”, every bit the demented pervert preacher he ever was Kim Deal’s angelic coos and bass melodies made an unholy pact with Joey Santiago’s werewolf guitar riffs, seemingly played with a plectrum made of Satan’s fingernail. Of their four Brixton dates that week, I lost every ounce of my s*** at three. Best gigs ever, no particular order.North London’s tiny and now-defunct, Buffalo Bar in the 2000s, hosted early gigs from the likes of Bloc Party, The Libertines, The Maccabees – or Foals. Their show took place 14 months before the release of their debut album Antidotes, and it justified their precocious reputation as a live act. That night, the energy of their high-octane math-rock was infectious it’s not often that you see a band in their earliest days and know that this is probably the last time you’ll be able to reach out and touch them. The songs followed: The French Open, Balloons, Hummer”, “Mathletics”, all fuelled by astoundingly complex polyrhythms, interweaving staccato synths and guitar played high on the fretboard in angular electro harmonies, set to punk-disco techno beats and urgent new wave vocals. I’d never seen a rock gig so precisely engineered (a sticker on the synth read Math is for Everyone), yet so exhilarating. There was a true sense we’d discovered something great. (Elisa Bray)Problematic in every way given singer Alice Glass’s October 2017 statement accusing her former bandmate Ethan Kath of sexual abuse, non-consensual sex and controlling behaviour, but this short set in front of a small crowd in a Camden bar was proof that when a performer truly plugs into the mother lode, the intensity they generate can burn itself into your retinas and shake your soul. Glass was 19 years old, and for most of the set just a blur of spectral movement frozen into violent shapes by an almost incessant strobe singing, shouting and screaming her way through songs such as “Courtship Dating”. The result was a reminder that whenever one of your heroes gets on stage to try to channel that primal essence of “rock ’n’ roll” – or whatever the hell it is – most of the time, they’re just trying to find an echo of something that once flowed through them. That can go on for 50 years or more. There’s sadness now in the memory, but on this day in April 2008, Glass had it. (Chris Harvey)918 Nick Cave \u0026amp the Bad Seeds, Brighton Centre, 2008It used to be that rock’n’roll was a young person’s game anyone over the age of 50 still tearing it up on stage needed to calm down and have a word with themselves. Nick Cave, the latter-day harbinger of the apocalypse still identifiable by his raven hair and pallbearer’s suit, has consistently shown us the idiocy of this thinking. I’ve seen Cave perform scores of times and he has never let me down, but this show, which coincided with the release of the album Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!, was a whole new level of spectacular: funny, furious, life-affirming, heavy on the biblical melodrama. Alongside the Bad Seeds, then operating as a seven-piece coolly attired in suits, open-necked shirts and slicked-back hair, Cave showed how musical talent can deepen rather than ebb in mid-life, and how he was – and indeed remains – untouchable in terms of intellect, charisma and sheer feral energy. (Fiona Sturges)Leonard Cohen steps onto the stage, dressed in grey shirt and tie, black waistcoat, trilby concealing his white hair. It\u0027s sweltering. And yet Cohen, in his mid Seventies, is barely breaking into a sweat. Much like his attire, the songs - such as Dance Me to the End of Love and So Long, Marianne – are immaculate, his voice no longer a wail but a raw, rumbling baritone. The Spanish sun is beating down and my friends and I are genuflecting before one of the greatest lyricists of all time. This was to be the only time I saw him live and no performance has ever, in terms of pure emotional intensity, targeted me with such laser-guided precision as his rendition of Hallelujah. The song\u0027s been covered by everyone from Jeff Buckley to Alexandra Burke, but sung by him that day, it\u0027s surely never felt as moving. (Patrick Smith)The great Sixties and Seventies soul singers are nearly all gone now, and I doubt we’ll ever see their like again. Bobby Womack had recovered from colon cancer but was in the early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease, and less than a year from his death in June 2014, when he played the UK in the summer of 2013. He came on stage on a sunny Saturday afternoon at the Latitude festival, to play songs from his brilliant comeback album, The Bravest Man in the Universe, to a basking, picnicking audience. “All soul singers come from gospel,” he told them. Womack’s voice still seemed like a gift from God. The years of cocaine addiction hadn’t altered its richness and warmth. To be in the presence of Womack that day, knowing it would likely be the last time, was very special.1218 St Vincent, End of the Road, 2014Most rockstars, terrified of seeming to be trying too hard, would never dream of hiring a choreographer. But St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, is no ordinary rockstar. For her Digital Witness tour, the musician recruited Annie B Carson to help her dream up a procession of strange, shuffling moves to perform alongside her brilliant self-titled fourth album. At End of the Road Festival – a small, Dorset delight which she had played with David Byrne a year earlier – her headline set was scuzzy, eccentric, and thrilling. At one point, without missing a lick on her guitar, she rolled herself down an oversized flight of white stairs like a glitching robot. Then again, no robot can play guitar like that. (Alexandra Pollard)After 35 years away from the stage it was a moment Kate Bush fans never thought would happen. Beforehand, I was reporting from outside the venue for NME and the excitement and energy was extraordinary, like nothing I\u0027ve ever experienced. One woman told me it would be fine if she died after the gig because she would die happy. The show started with a greatest hits section. And then it all got a bit more, well, Kate Bush, with a dramatic adaptation of The Ninth Wave. Sinking ships, confetti cannons, surreal fish people and a soliloquy about sausages. Act three was more pastoral. The second side of Aerial, The Sky of Honey, was performed in front of the most beautiful visuals I\u0027ve ever seen: birds, a red sun, a moon tilting on its axis and then Kate suspended into the air. Pure theatre. As we filed out, there was a sense that the audience was stunned. I still am. (Lucy Jones)Patti Smith was celebrating the 40th anniversary of her seminal 1975 album Horses at Field Day in Victoria Park, London, 2015. The sky was a perfect blue, and the sun was still blazing hot at 7pm. “I’m sorry about the dark glasses,” Smith said by way of introduction. “I’m not trying to be cool, it’s just, you know… the sun.” “You’re the f***ing coolest!” a fan screamed back. From there, she and her band, including long-serving guitarist Lenny Kaye, embarked on a blistering set that had myself, and many other audience members, in tears. Smith is a ferocious performer, she spat and snarled and howled tearing up her guitar as though it just insulted one of her favourite poets. It didn’t matter if she messed up, as she did on “Break it Up”, because she offered the instantly immortal words: “I don’t do nothing perfect. I only f*** up perfect.” You felt you were in the presence of something momentous. (Roisin O’Connor)When D’Angelo released his surprise third record – the politically fraught Black Messiah – it ended the 14-year hiatus that followed 2000’s Voodoo. It also reminded music fans that the American hip-hop artist was still as monumentally talented as he was back then. Accompanied by his eight-strong band The Vanguard, his show at the Hammersmith Apollo was a visceral, quasi-religious experience. Jesse Johnson, formerly of Prince-produced outfit The Time, added funky hooks to “Sugah Daddy”, while legendary bassist Pino Palladino took time out from The Who\u0027s live shows to join in the fun. At one point D’Angelo led a classic James Brown funk staple, holding three fingers in the air so the band could respond with three loud vamps. One encore was followed by a second that broke the curfew with free abandon, until D’Angelo was left on stage alone, reflective and blissful. It inspired a ine kind of worship, for a show that was appropriately titled The Second Coming. (Roisin O’Connor)A week before she played Brighton, I reviewed Lorde’s Alexandra Palace show in London. It was a five-star performance – the New Zealand musician exorcised the pain of the break-up she\u0027d chronicled on her brilliant second album Melodrama, twitching and twirling as an abstract house party played out in glass boxes around her. The stage design was so good, in fact, that Kanye West may or may not have nicked it a year later. Seeing her in Brighton the following week, without a notepad in my hand, I saw even more clearly all the intimate nuances of her performance – and was free to give in entirely to the exhilarating, heartbreaking melodrama of it all. (Alexandra Pollard)When you’ve been going to gigs for decades, you tend not to expect anything new, just variations – some mind-blowing, others not – on what you have seen before. So when I saw David Byrne’s American Utopia show, it felt like stumbling on the Ark of the Covenant. Here was a man who had been working in music for 40 years completely redrawing the rules of pop performance – no drum riser, no cables, no visible amps or microphones – and taking it deep into the territory of experimental theatre. In opposition to the usual freeform live music set-up, this tour was the result of fastidious planning, with everything rehearsed to the last nanosecond. And yet, forever on the move, dressed in matching grey suits and dancing barefoot in formation, Byrne and his 12-piece band were loose-limbed, unfettered and joyous to watch. And the music was pretty great too. (Fiona Sturges)1818 Christine and the Queens, Hammersmith Apollo, 2018Before her short run at Hammersmith Apollo last year, Héloïse Letissier – known as Christine and the Queens, though she dropped all but the Chris for her second album – tweeted: “I think we finally have some surprises for those who come to the shows!” She delivered on that promise – falling snow and sand, and a balcony homage to Romeo and Juliet – as she redefined what a pop show could be. With a gender-fluid cohort of athletic dancers, she brought to theatrical life her tumultuous journey towards embracing her pansexual identity, and finding liberation. And we went through all those emotions with her, those alternately tender and powerful vocals never faltering despite the restless dance routines. Everyone was on their feet dancing, and her declaration of inclusivity could not have been more empowering: “Vive everyone!” We left thrilled and elated. (Elisa Bray)At the beginning of the gig, Sir Elton announced he had been diagnosed with “walking pneumonia”, an infection in the respiratory tract.Later, on Instagram, the singer told fans he was “deeply upset” by the situation.He wrote: “I want to thank everyone who attended tonight’s gig in Auckland. I was diagnosed with walking pneumonia earlier today, but I was determined to give you the best show humanly possible.“I played and sang my heart out, until my voice could sing no more. I’m disappointed, deeply upset and sorry. I gave it all I had. Thank-you so much for your extraordinary support and all the love you showed me during tonight’s performance. I am eternally grateful. Love, Elton xx.”Sir Elton’s Auckland show was part of his 300-date Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour, the last before he retires.In the recent documentary, Elton John: Uncensored, the singer revealed he was “24 hours from snuffing it” when he contracted a serious infection after having surgery for prostate cancer, and said he was so sick he “had to learn how to walk again”.\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If we don\u0027t create standards that people feel are legitimate, they won\u0027t trust institutions or technology.To be clear, this isn\u0027t about passing off responsibility. Facebook is not waiting for regulation we\u0027re continuing to make progress on these issues ourselves.But I believe clearer rules would be better for everyone. The internet is a powerful force for social and economic empowerment. Regulation that protects people and supports innovation can ensure it stays that way.The social network said it wanted its recommendations to spark further debate about the issue of online regulation, and confirmed it planned to publish more papers on the subject of elections and privacy later this year.If designed well, new frameworks for regulating harmful content can contribute to the internet\u0027s continued success by articulating clear ways for government, companies, and civil society to share responsibilities and work together, Facebook\u0027s vice president of content policy, Monika Bickert said.Designed poorly, these efforts risk unintended consequences that might make people less safe online, stifle expression and slow innovation.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Capital spending was down 3.7 per cent and exports dipped 0.1 per cent.“Consumer spending, which slumped following the tax hike in the fourth quarter of 2019, will now struggle to do anything except contract further in the first quarter as the impact of Covid-19 weighs on consumer sentiment, weighing in particular on the consumer services sector,” said Dutch bank ING in a report.“Some further government spending may help to curb any further contraction in GDP beyond the first quarter of 2020.\u0026nbsp“But that will not stop what started off as a technical downturn from evolving into a full-blown recession.”A recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of economic contraction.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Instead, it’s expected to be\u0026nbspa full-blown reboot that ignores the acclaimed trilogy.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFans of the films have been expressing their outrage over the reports on Twitter.“That’s so unnecessary... have movies seriously ran out of ideas?” one wrote, with another adding: “Oh wow so orginal and creative NOT.”Created with Sketch.37 sequels that are even better than the original Show all 37Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Ridley Scott\u0027s Alien may be an acclaimed horror film, but sequel Aliens – directed by James Cameron – is a stone cold action classic. Gone is the ignorant Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) of the original in favour of a hardened badass who returns to the moon, accompanied by a group of space marines, to take on the alien queen. How many years between sequel and original? SevenIt wasn\u0027t until the arrival of Austin Powers sequel The Spy Who Shagged Me that Mike Myers\u0027s comic creations were fully wedged into the hearts of film lovers. If the original was the perfect introduction to Austin\u0027s groovy world, the follow-up was an altogether funnier, bigger and more quotable affair. How many years between sequel and original? TwoCapping off not only your own franchise but a decade-long series consisting of 22 films is no mean feat – and yet Avengers: Endgame balanced all the playing pieces to do so with gargantuan success. How many years between sequel and original? Seven437 Back to the Future Part II (1989)The first sequel to Robert Zemeckis\u0027s Back to the Future is an amusing adventure that sees Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) travel... well, back to the future, to prevent his own son from sabotaging the family legacy. How many years between sequel and original? FourIt was the addition of both Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny DeVito – as Catwoman and the Penguin, respectively – that made Tim Burton\u0027s sequel Batman Returns an even more memorable watch than the original. How many years between sequel and original? ThreeEach instalment of Richard Linklater\u0027s Before trilogy is as good as the last. But, if there is a peak, it surely arrives with number two – Before Sunset – which reunites would-be lovers Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) nine years after they first met in Before Sunrise (1995). How many years between sequel and original? NineThere\u0027s a blistering chase sequence midway through The Bourne Ultimatum involving Matt Damon\u0027s amnesiac spy and journalist Simon Ross (Paddy Considine). It\u0027s adeptly directed by Paul Greengrass – here at the top of his game – and is all the proof you need that the original trilogy improved with each new film. How many years between sequel and original? Five837 Bride of Frankenstein (1935)Depicting Mary Shelley\u0027s classic creature as a pleasant guy just looking for a companion, Bride of Frankenstein is one of the greatest monster movies, let alone sequels, in cinema history. How many years between sequel and original? FourBatman Begins may have been the perfect origin story for the caped crusader, but nothing could have prepared film fans for the classic its sequel would become. Christopher Nolan intelligently crafted The Dark Knight into one of the greatest follow-ups ever made, with several standout action sequences and an untouchable performance from Heath Ledger as the Joker. One for the ages. How many years between sequel and original? Three1037 Dawn of the Dead (1978)George A Romero ditched the entire cast of Night of the Living Dead for its first sequel, Dawn of the Dead, which showed the effects of the zombie apocalypse on a much larger scale than depicted in the black-and-white original. One of the most entertaining horror films ever made.  How many years between sequel and original? 10The glory you feel watching Hellboy II: The Golden Army comes from the knowledge that you\u0027re watching a studio allow Guillermo del Toro to do whatever the hell he wants. A scintillating oddity of a follow-up that surpasses the 2004 original within minutes. How many years between sequel and original? FourNot so much an improvement on the first as one that rips up its rule book completely: Sam Raimi took the character of Ash (Bruce Campbell), who viewers first met in influential 1981 horror The Evil Dead,\u0026nbspand placed him in the heart of what is essentially a slapstick comedy. How many years between sequel and original? SixAfter the lacklustre fourth instalment, Fast \u0026amp Furious 5 was the reinvention the series desperately needed. Bringing in Dwayne Johnson as the bad guy was a genius stroke and the final set-piece – a car dragging a bank vault through the streets of Rio – remains as entertaining as anything the long-running series has ever done. How many years between sequel and original? 10The Godfather Part II set the highest benchmark for what sequels should be, but so rarely are – a crucial chapter in a saga. The film won Robert De Niro an Oscar for his efforts, playing the same role Marlon Brando won an Oscar for two years before. This, alongside another film on this list, is one of two sequels to ever win Best Picture (keep scrolling to find out the other one). How many years between sequel and original? Two1537 The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)The fact that Sergio Leone had barely any money to make The Good, the Bad and the Ugly – the third film in his Man With no Name trilogy – fortuitously led to the casting of the relatively unknown Clint Eastwood. Leone\u0027s film, beautifully soundtracked by Ennio Morricone, is a masterwork that proves less is more: its most classic dialogue-free scenes derived from the fact that Leone had no time to shoot dialogue. How many years between sequel and original? Two1637 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)Gone was the warm glow of Hogwarts in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Alfonso Cuarón\u0027s adaptation of the JK Rowling novel proved the franchise could win widespread acclaim, as well as ticket receipts, if put in the hands of interesting directors. How many years between sequel and original? Three1737 How to Train Your Dragon 2 (2014)Could How to Train Your Dragon endure as one of the most beloved yet underrated franchises of all time? Quite possibly – and its first sequel, which features breathless flight sequences and animation to marvel at, is solid evidence of this. How many years between sequel and original? FourDespite essentially rehashing the plot of the first film, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a bolder, more exciting and, yes, deadlier outing for Jennifer Lawrence\u0027s heroine Katniss Everdeen. How many years between sequel and original? One1937 Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)If Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade isn\u0027t better than series opener Raiders of the Lost Ark, it\u0027s certainly as good. This is thanks to the addition of Sean Connery\u0027s Henry Jones Sr – the father of Harrison Ford\u0027s whip-cracking archaeologist. How many years between sequel and original? EightPerhaps it was down to relief that Iron Man 3 was so revered by critics (lest we forget Iron Man 2 is one of Marvel\u0027s biggest duds). But, Robert Downey Jr\u0027s third solo outing as Tony Starl boasts enough laughs and thrills, not to mention a doozy of a twist, that earns its placement on this list. How many years between sequel and original? FiveLethal Weapon 2 takes what made the original so fun – the wit and twist-filled action – and amps it up as far as it can possibly go. That it throws in Joe Pesci for good measure just makes the results even more sizzling. How many years between sequel and original? TwoLogan rectified the mistakes of Wolverine\u0027s earlier standalone films thanks to James Mangold\u0027s decision to place the character in a far grittier film than he was used to (it was rated 15 in the UK). The result remains a perfect send-off to one of X-Men\u0027s greatest characters, who first played the role in 2000.How many years between sequel and original? 17Gareth Evans\u0027s sequel to The Raid is more of the glorious same, only – somehow – more ambitious. Two hours and 30 minutes of breathlessly-paced fight sequences that\u0027s unlike anything caught on film before. How many years between sequel and original? Three2437 The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003)The second sequel to ever win Best Picture is all about the payoff. While each film in Peter Jackson\u0027s Lord of the Rings trilogy delivers in what it needs to, this final chapter balances all the plates to dish out an epic conclusion that surely would have been everything JRR Tolkien wanted from an adaptation of his classic novels. How many years between sequel and original? TwoNobody could have predicted quite how breathlessly entertaining Mad Max: Fury Road would be. George Miller\u0027s dystopian chase film refuses to relent from the very first second and is just as entertaining with every watch – and far superior to the Mel Gibson original, which was released in 1979. How many years between sequel and original? 36There has never been a bad Mission: Impossible film. However, since Christopher McQuarrie stepped into the fold as director, the series has taken just as many audacious leaps as its lead star, the stunt-loving Tom Cruise. Fallout is a multi-layered, twisty action film that will undoubtedly go down as a franchise classic. How many years between sequel and original? 22All it took was the spirit of Christmas for the Griswolds to get the film they deserved. Chevy Chase heads up this one liner-filled festive treat that\u0027s probably the only Vacation film worth your time. How many years between sequel and original? FourOne critic described Paddington 2 as the Godfather Part II of Peruvian Bear movies and they were not wrong. The sequel somehow manages to convey more charm than the original – which in itself is extremely charming – and has the benefit of starring Hugh Grant as a villainous actor named Phoenix Buchanan. A delight. How many years between sequel and original? ThreeAll eyes were on Shrek 2 thanks to the unprecedented success of the fantastic original, which was released in 2001. What people didn\u0027t expect, though, was that the follow-up would be just as hilarious and even more enchanting. How many years between sequel and original? ThreeSam Raimi managed to outdo himself with Spider-Man 2 (the first one remains a superhero standout) with help from Alfred Molina\u0027s Doctor Octopus and some nightmarish scenes in which the Evil Dead filmmaker delves into his bursting bag of horror movie tricks. How many years between sequel and original? Two3137 Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan (1982)By placing the emphasis on character as opposed to action, Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan righted the wrongs of the classic TV show\u0027s first big screen adventure, a dud that was released in 1979. The result is a staggeringly improved follow-up. How many years between sequel and original? thREEThe Empire Strikes Back would make this list for its twist alone, which ranks as one of the greatest in cinema history, but the film also represents so much more. Episode V established the Star Wars franchise\u0027s staying power by proving A New Hope was no fluke. How many years between sequel and original? Three3337 War for the Planet of the Apes (2017)With War for the Planet of the Apes, Fox\u0027s closing chapter of the rebooted trilogy, Matt Reeves delivered a near-faultless arthouse film parading as a mo-cap monkey-filled blockbuster. How many years between sequel and original?  SixIt would have been easy to chalk up 10 Cloverfield Lane\u0027s acclaim to the fact it was a secret up until a month before it was released. The fact remains, though, that this spiritual successor to 2008 found-footage thriller Cloverfield is a gruellingly tense chamber piece that\u0027s even more nail-biting than the first. How many years between sequel and original? EightThose who believed you couldn\u0027t get a more groundbreaking film than The Terminator likely burst a vessel after watching Judgement Day, a sequel that reshaped what people wanted from their action movies forevermore. It did so while subverting expectation in the most simplest of ways – by turning Arnie\u0027s killing machine, the terrifying villain in the first, into a cuddly force for good. How many years between sequel and original? SevenWhen Taika Waititi took the keys to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, he walked away with one of its greatest films: Thor: Ragnarok. The finished product is Asgards apart from the first of the hero\u0027s two adventures, starring Chris Hemsworth, that were released in 2011 and 2013. How many years between sequel and original? SixSure, the third and fourth instalments might have the emotional payoffs, but –\u0026nbspthanks to a series of standout scenes (the traffic cone pileup, anyone?) – it\u0027s Toy Story 2 that stands tall as the best of Pixar\u0027s sequels. How many years between sequel and original? FourRidley Scott\u0027s Alien may be an acclaimed horror film, but sequel Aliens – directed by James Cameron – is a stone cold action classic. Gone is the ignorant Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) of the original in favour of a hardened badass who returns to the moon, accompanied by a group of space marines, to take on the alien queen. How many years between sequel and original? SevenIt wasn\u0027t until the arrival of Austin Powers sequel The Spy Who Shagged Me that Mike Myers\u0027s comic creations were fully wedged into the hearts of film lovers. If the original was the perfect introduction to Austin\u0027s groovy world, the follow-up was an altogether funnier, bigger and more quotable affair. How many years between sequel and original? TwoCapping off not only your own franchise but a decade-long series consisting of 22 films is no mean feat – and yet Avengers: Endgame balanced all the playing pieces to do so with gargantuan success. How many years between sequel and original? Seven437 Back to the Future Part II (1989)The first sequel to Robert Zemeckis\u0027s Back to the Future is an amusing adventure that sees Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) travel... well, back to the future, to prevent his own son from sabotaging the family legacy. How many years between sequel and original? FourIt was the addition of both Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny DeVito – as Catwoman and the Penguin, respectively – that made Tim Burton\u0027s sequel Batman Returns an even more memorable watch than the original. How many years between sequel and original? ThreeEach instalment of Richard Linklater\u0027s Before trilogy is as good as the last. But, if there is a peak, it surely arrives with number two – Before Sunset – which reunites would-be lovers Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) nine years after they first met in Before Sunrise (1995). How many years between sequel and original? NineThere\u0027s a blistering chase sequence midway through The Bourne Ultimatum involving Matt Damon\u0027s amnesiac spy and journalist Simon Ross (Paddy Considine). It\u0027s adeptly directed by Paul Greengrass – here at the top of his game – and is all the proof you need that the original trilogy improved with each new film. How many years between sequel and original? Five837 Bride of Frankenstein (1935)Depicting Mary Shelley\u0027s classic creature as a pleasant guy just looking for a companion, Bride of Frankenstein is one of the greatest monster movies, let alone sequels, in cinema history. How many years between sequel and original? FourBatman Begins may have been the perfect origin story for the caped crusader, but nothing could have prepared film fans for the classic its sequel would become. Christopher Nolan intelligently crafted The Dark Knight into one of the greatest follow-ups ever made, with several standout action sequences and an untouchable performance from Heath Ledger as the Joker. One for the ages. How many years between sequel and original? Three1037 Dawn of the Dead (1978)George A Romero ditched the entire cast of Night of the Living Dead for its first sequel, Dawn of the Dead, which showed the effects of the zombie apocalypse on a much larger scale than depicted in the black-and-white original. One of the most entertaining horror films ever made.  How many years between sequel and original? 10The glory you feel watching Hellboy II: The Golden Army comes from the knowledge that you\u0027re watching a studio allow Guillermo del Toro to do whatever the hell he wants. A scintillating oddity of a follow-up that surpasses the 2004 original within minutes. How many years between sequel and original? FourNot so much an improvement on the first as one that rips up its rule book completely: Sam Raimi took the character of Ash (Bruce Campbell), who viewers first met in influential 1981 horror The Evil Dead,\u0026nbspand placed him in the heart of what is essentially a slapstick comedy. How many years between sequel and original? SixAfter the lacklustre fourth instalment, Fast \u0026amp Furious 5 was the reinvention the series desperately needed. Bringing in Dwayne Johnson as the bad guy was a genius stroke and the final set-piece – a car dragging a bank vault through the streets of Rio – remains as entertaining as anything the long-running series has ever done. How many years between sequel and original? 10The Godfather Part II set the highest benchmark for what sequels should be, but so rarely are – a crucial chapter in a saga. The film won Robert De Niro an Oscar for his efforts, playing the same role Marlon Brando won an Oscar for two years before. This, alongside another film on this list, is one of two sequels to ever win Best Picture (keep scrolling to find out the other one). How many years between sequel and original? Two1537 The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)The fact that Sergio Leone had barely any money to make The Good, the Bad and the Ugly – the third film in his Man With no Name trilogy – fortuitously led to the casting of the relatively unknown Clint Eastwood. Leone\u0027s film, beautifully soundtracked by Ennio Morricone, is a masterwork that proves less is more: its most classic dialogue-free scenes derived from the fact that Leone had no time to shoot dialogue. How many years between sequel and original? Two1637 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)Gone was the warm glow of Hogwarts in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Alfonso Cuarón\u0027s adaptation of the JK Rowling novel proved the franchise could win widespread acclaim, as well as ticket receipts, if put in the hands of interesting directors. How many years between sequel and original? Three1737 How to Train Your Dragon 2 (2014)Could How to Train Your Dragon endure as one of the most beloved yet underrated franchises of all time? Quite possibly – and its first sequel, which features breathless flight sequences and animation to marvel at, is solid evidence of this. How many years between sequel and original? FourDespite essentially rehashing the plot of the first film, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a bolder, more exciting and, yes, deadlier outing for Jennifer Lawrence\u0027s heroine Katniss Everdeen. How many years between sequel and original? One1937 Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)If Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade isn\u0027t better than series opener Raiders of the Lost Ark, it\u0027s certainly as good. This is thanks to the addition of Sean Connery\u0027s Henry Jones Sr – the father of Harrison Ford\u0027s whip-cracking archaeologist. How many years between sequel and original? EightPerhaps it was down to relief that Iron Man 3 was so revered by critics (lest we forget Iron Man 2 is one of Marvel\u0027s biggest duds). But, Robert Downey Jr\u0027s third solo outing as Tony Starl boasts enough laughs and thrills, not to mention a doozy of a twist, that earns its placement on this list.

RBS\u0026nbspwas found to have mis-sold complex financial products to small-business customers in a bid to boost its own bottom line, while its infamous Global Restructuring\u0026nbspGroup destroyed firms to sell off their assets for a profit.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Davies\u0026nbspsaid: “The essential reason for this is, as the bank has evolved from the financial crisis and the bailout, we have focused on the NatWest brand.“We have exited a lot of the international businesses which were not profitable. That was branded RBS and that’s gone.“It really makes no sense for us to continue to be called\u0026nbspRBS.

While its win was a coup for DreamWorks – the film was the studio\u0027s third victor in a row– it was far from a deserving recipient, especially considering Ron Howard won Best Director over Robert Altman and David Lynch for Gosford Park and Mulholland Drive, respectively.219 Chariots of Fire (1981)While Chariots of Fire is precisely the type of film the Academy usually takes under its wing, the fact it won was a big surprise, considering everybody present had expected Reds to win the top prize. The Warren Beatty film would have been a far worthier winner, too.Cold Mountain lucked out by being nominated in what was a particularly weak year for Best Supporting Actress. Renée Zellweger recovered from failing to win for Chicago the previous year and, in doing so, earnt the unremarkable drama its Oscar-winning tag.Viewers of the Oscars have grown used to unexpected victories, but none was more ill-judged than when Paul Haggis\u0027 drama Crash beat Brokeback Mountain to Best Picture.519 Dances with Wolves (1990)It\u0027s quite soul-destroying to think that Dances with Wolves scooped a total of seven Oscars in the same year that Goodfellas was nominated.Alicia Vikander\u0027s performance in The Danish Girl is by no means weak, but it was nothing on Rooney Mara\u0027s affecting turn in Todd Haynes\u0027 film Carol. Had Tom Hooper not won five years before for The King\u0027s Speech, it seems unlikely that the drama would have picked up any nominations.Put simply, The English Patient isn\u0027t a very good film. Of the nine (nine!) Oscars it won, Juliette Binoche\u0027s trophy for Best Supporting Actress was perhaps the most surprising. The French star herself could barely contain her shock. This will most likely be this list\u0027s most controversial placement, but let\u0027s be honest: Gladiator is not the fantastic film it\u0027s regularly hailed as. Ridley Scott\u0027s overlong historical drama boasts plenty of swords-and-sandal bravado, but not much else.The musical Going My Way may have been the biggest cinematic hit of its year, but it certainly wasn\u0027t better that classic noir Double Indemnity, which it beat to win Best Picture. In fact, it\u0027s nowhere near director Leo McCarey\u0027s greatest film (he won six years previous for the Awful Truth and would be nominated again for The Bells of St Mary\u0027s two years later).There\u0027s a reason why Grand Hotel is the only film to ever win Best Picture without receiving a nomination in any other category. An entertaining film, sure, but nothing more.1119 The Greatest Show on Earth (1952)It\u0027s ironic that a film with the word greatest in its title has gone down as one of the worst winners in Oscars history. A prime example of when the Academy voted for spectacle over quality.To those who don\u0027t care about awards ceremonies, Green Book is a crowdpleaser that boasts decent performances from Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. To everyone else, it\u0027s the damp squib that somehow came out of nowhere to snatch Best Picture from under Roma\u0027s nose. The Imitation Game won Best Adapted Screenplay, which begs the question: what the hell was this distinctly average film doing having any nominations at all?Meryl Streep has won enough Oscars for the world to know she\u0027s evidently one of the finest actors who\u0027ll ever live. Her win for The Iron Lady, though, was one Oscar too many.The year of 1999 marked one of the most remarkable Oscar ceremonies in history for the sole reason that the majority of its winners were terrible choices. Right up there was Roberto Benigni, who beat Tom Hanks (Saving Private Ryan) and Edward Norton (American History X) to win Best Actor for, of all things, Life is Beautiful.It might finally be accepted that disgraced film director Roman Polanski shouldn\u0027t be handed accolades, but back in 2003, this was still what the Oscars were doing. He won Best Director for The Pianist, an award the French-Polish filmmaker could have done without.1719 A Place in the SunA Place in the Sun is a fine little film, but fine little films shouldn\u0027t be winning Oscars –\u0026nbspespecially when they see off competition from more deserving opposition. In this case, director George Stevens beat John Huston (The African Queen), William Wyler (Detective Story) and Elia Kazan (A Streetcar Named Desire) to the Director prize.1819 Shakespeare in LoveYou have to hand it to Shakespeare in Love, it played the Oscars campaign trail perfectly, overtaking war favourites Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line to win the evening\u0027s biggest prize. This doesn\u0027t mean its success has gone down as anything more than evidence of poor judgement from the Academy.It\u0027s often good to hold your hands up and admit that a film is nowhere near as good as you recall. Sadly, Slumdog Millionaire is one of those. While its win no doubt put smiles on the faces of commuters reading the morning papers the next day, the shine has worn off its success in recent years. The rightful winner –\u0026nbspThe Dark Knight – wasn\u0027t even nominated for Best Picture.A Beautiful Mind is one of the mustier Best Pictures winners of the century so far.

The rightful winner –\u0026nbspThe Dark Knight – wasn\u0027t even nominated for Best Picture.She continued, “All voices, however spoken, are valid. Let’s all keep pushing boundaries in whatever way we can, it’s time to get loud.”McGowan had originally criticised Portman for not working with female filmmakers herself, a claim that Portman rebuked in her own statement.“It is true I’ve only made a few films with women,” Portman wrote. “In my long career, I’ve only gotten the chance to work with female directors a few times … Unfortunately, the unmade films I have tried to make are a ghost history.”Natalie Portman responds to Rose McGowan’s dress criticismPortman previously attempted to set up projects with filmmakers including Lynne Ramsay, Marielle Heller and Patty Jenkins – all of which failed to get off the ground with those specific directors attached.“I have had the experience a few times of helping get female directors hired on projects which they were then forced out of because of the conditions they faced at work,” Portman wrote. “I want to say, I have tried, and I will keep trying. While I have not yet been successful, I am hopeful that we are stepping into a new day.”Portman has yet to respond to McGowan’s latest statement.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

May Bulman talks to three\u0026nbspmen kicked out of Britain about how they have tried to start againImagine being ripped from everyone and everything in your life, locked in a cell, then flown across the globe to a country you barely know. You have no friends or family there, no job, and sometimes struggle to even be understood by the locals. This is your new life.That’s the situation facing some of those flown to Jamaica on a controversial charter flight this month, many of whom – though they remain Jamaican nationals – had lived in Britain since they were children. One told The Independent he had only a single\u0026nbspmemory of the Caribbean island:\u0026nbspbrushing his teeth as a small child.The mass deportation, which had intended to return around 50 people before the courts limited the number to 17, has shone a light on human suffering caused by Britain’s returns system, which sees thousands deported each year, often with limited access to legal help to defend their right to stay in the UK.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOne man struggling to build a life after deportation is Tremayne Brown, 29, who was on a charter flight to Jamaica in 2017. He had lived in Britain since the age of six, having moved from Kingston’s Rose Town to south London with his father after his mother, brother and sister were killed by gangs. His father went to prison soon after their arrival – and was later deported – meaning Tremayne was put into care. No attempts were made to regularise his status in the UK.“I was leaving care and I was meant to get my own place and find a job, but then my social worker told me I wasn’t allowed to work, and they weren’t able to give me somewhere to live either, because of my status,” says Tremayne. “I was suddenly classed as an illegal alien.”Created with Sketch.Windrush generation: threat of deportation from UK Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica, with 482 Jamaicans on board, emigrating to Britain.Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 landed them at Tilbury.

But he was not allowed to work. His girlfriend and their baby son needed financial support, so he was pushed into crime.“I was stuck in a place where I wasn’t allowed to work and I couldn’t get anywhere to live. What am I meant to do? I regret it every day. If I didn’t do that, I would be there with my son right now.”Aged 18, Tremayne was convicted for supplying class A drugs and commercial robbery, serving three years in jail. He did his time, then was transferred to a removal centre and issued deportation orders. He says that on entering detention he was told his removal had been cancelled, so did not contact his solicitor. But a week later, he was put on a flight.“One night they came to my door and said, ‘Pack your bags.’ When I was on the plane I called the solicitor and he said, ‘Why didn’t you ring me, I could have cancelled your ticket,’ but that it was too late. I never got the opportunity to fight my case.”A young man who grew up in the hands of the British state was now being flown to a country he had not set foot in for nearly 20 years.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThree years on, he is still struggling to settle. Though he lives with his father, Tremayne yearns to see his loved ones in Britain, particularly his son who, now aged six, has spent the majority of his life without his dad, having to make do with video calls.“He always asks me, ‘Dad, where are you?’ And if I’m coming back and why I left. It’s hard to explain it to him. He might hear his father’s voice and see him, but in reality you want him there in front of you. Through his childhood I haven’t been there. I haven’t been able to take him to the park. Those little things are important and have a knock-on effect on him as a child, having to grow up and say, ‘My father wasn’t there.’ It will make him bitter.”Tremayne struggled to find work, largely because of his reputation as being one of the “deportee boys” who had their chance and lost it. His qualifications were not recognised in Jamaica, but he found a job at a holding company. He says the stigma still weighs on his shoulders. His British accent means he is constantly asked where he comes from and why he was deported.“I have had to start again from scratch. You spend your whole life in one place and then you have to adapt yourself again. Nothing is easy, but you have to try,” he says. “Some days are really hard. I miss my son, I miss my foster mum, I miss the scenery. Having been a young boy and grown up there, I class myself as British. Everything I know is from Britain. I never learned anything from Jamaica.”Another deportee, Chevon Brown, was forcibly removed on a charter flight last February on the basis of a driving offence he committed aged 21 – something he describes as a “stupid mistake”. He had moved to the UK when he was 14 and has no close relatives in Jamaica.As a qualified barber who started working at the age of 16, the 24-year-old had hoped to find a job fairly easily. But he says his name has been tarnished by the insinuation by British politicians that everyone on the charter plane was a murderer, rapist or drug dealer.Chevon rarely leaves the house because he says he can feel animosity from people in the street, and he has sleepless nights worrying about his future.“I’ve asked for jobs, told them I’m qualified, but after they’ve heard my name, they don’t want to employ me. They say how can they trust me when I’ve been deported,” he tells The Independent. “People think we’re going to come here and cause major crimes. Most people think I’m a murderer, rapist or drug trafficker, which I’m not. I went to prison for dangerous driving and I completely regret it because I never knew I’d be serving double punishment for one stupid mistake.”The proof that ministers haven’t learnt the lessons from WindrushChevon, who grew up in Oxford, served seven months after admitting speeding in an uninsured car. It happened after a heated argument with his housemate, when he took the car out and drove away from police.“I knew what I was doing was wrong in the moment,” he says. “I was genuinely scared. I wish I had stopped, given them the key, got arrested and that be that. I had no idea that this would be the aftermath of driving away from the police. If I ever come back to England I don’t want any involvement with police. I just want to live a calm and peaceful life. I want to get a barbershop, get a mortgage on a house, start planning a future, get a car, all those things.“But right now, I’m paying two, three years after the actual thing. I’ve gone to jail, done my time, and years later I still can’t actually move on with my life. I feel like I’m still in prison. It’s worse than prison, because I can’t see my family and friends. I feel like I’m stuck. My whole reputation has been messed up by one silly mistake.”“My dad is getting more and more stressed. He’s got health problems. My 18-year-old brother’s not listening to anyone any more. There’s been a ripple effect from what’s happened to me. My little brother keeps asking me, ‘When are you coming home?’ I can’t give him a definite answer about that. I wanted to set a good example. But right now I feel like I’m actually being a weight on my family, because of all this negative attention that’s been drawn towards me.“I feel more British than Jamaican. My dad brought me to England and said this was where I was going to be living for the rest of my life. So I ed into the new society and this is who I am today. Most people try to tell me to speak Patois, but I feel comfortable speaking English. When I speak the Jamaican language I feel like I have to put it on. I don’t want to put it on.”The level of contact goes down, and that just compounds the sense of lost connectionsWhile charter flights to Jamaica have garnered media attention in the wake of the Windrush scandal, forced deportations from the UK take place throughout the year to countries across the globe, with 9,461 people removed in 2018 and 12,049 the year before – in addition to around 20,000 iniduals removed through the voluntary returns route. An estimated 2,000 of those forcibly removed are put on planes privately chartered by the Home Office, of which a total of 20 charter planes left Britain last year, with the destinations including Albania, Pakistan, Nigeria, France and Ghana.Kweku Abodoli, 39, was deported to Ghana in 2018 after having lived in Britain since the age of 12. In a highly publicised court case, he had been sentenced to seven years behind bars in 2012 after losing £1.4bn while working for Swiss bank UBS. The banker, who had a British partner at the time, was sentenced to five years in jail. Two days after he was convicted, he was informed that he was liable to automatic deportation.“All the way from being arrested through to just after I was convicted immigration didn’t cross my mind. The level of stress goes through the roof,” says Kweku, who now lives with his parents in Accra. “Suddenly, the battle’s not over. I can’t just sit in and do my time and go home.“The pressure in the relationship started to go up, because now she’s thinking, ‘Okay, so I’ve stood by him through this fight, now what? What if I keep fighting if he’s going to get deported anyway?’”Kweku had left Ghana aged four, when his parents moved to the Middle East for work. He is grateful to have his parents and other relatives now in the country, but devastated at how his relationships in Britain – including with his now ex-girlfriend and many friends – have broken down since his return.“It’s the inability of being able to get on a plane and be there for someone,” he explains. “The distance creates massive tension in the relationship. You have to increasingly distance yourself from these really close relationships. The level of contact goes down, and that just compounds the sense of lost connections, which then leads to depression.”‘Cruelty’ as Jamaicans driven to charter flight despite court rulingAfter arriving in Ghana, Kweku spent about nine months sitting in his bedroom, unable to leave the house. He developed a number of physical manifestations of the trauma he had been through. “My body started to swell up a lot,” he says. “We thought it was a heart problem so had a lot of heart tests. My face just blew up like a balloon, my legs were like elephant trunks,”The Ghanaian national acknowledges that he was relatively lucky on his return that, unlike the Jamaican deportees, he was welcomed with open arms by both his family and the country as a whole, who gave him what he describes as a “massive embrace”.“Because of the violence and the cruelty of what happened to me, I think Ghana went, ‘This is a son of Ghana, a son of Africa, why should anyone be treated this way?’ Random people on the street would stop me. Everyone recognised me. They were all saying welcome home,” he says, adding: “My stamina is not back and I’m still dealing with adrenal failure, so I still have to do a lot of work to deal with my stress, but I’m getting back to the point where I’m starting to contribute again.”But Kweku still remembers what he went through on during his deportation: “Of all that I went through, none of it was as bad as sitting at the back of a plane with five G4S guards. I was hyperventilating, sobbing non-stop for four hours.”Branded “foreign national offenders” and “illegal immigrants” by the Home Office\u0026nbspas they wait in cells to be taken away, these deportees are characterised as hardened criminals. But for Tremayne, Chevon and Kweku, these terms – and the trauma – ripple through their lives for years to come as they try to start again, thousands of miles from the place they call home.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

\u0027heartbroken\u0027, London mayor says - but Boris Johnson appears to have rejected itSadiq Khan has made a last-gasp plea for Britons to be able to keep EU citizenship despite Brexit\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspas the best way for the country to be “reconciled”.The idea, long advocated by some senior figures in Brussels, would help people left “heartbroken” by departure from the European Union, the mayor of London said.It would allow British citizens to retain the right to free movement between EU member states after the end of the transition period, in December, as well as voting rights for the European parliament.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Khan put the plan forward as he prepared to meet Michel Barnier, the EU’s Brexit negotiator, and after the two sides stepped up their war of words before trade talks begin.“I am heartbroken that we are no longer a member of the European Union, but that doesn’t mean our country’s future can’t be closely linked with the rest of Europe,” he said.Boris Johnson’s chief Brexit negotiator fires off warning to EU“The prime minister says his job is to bring the country together and move us forward and I cannot think of a better way of reconciling the differences between British voters who wanted to leave, and the millions of Londoners and British nationals who still feel and want to be European.“There would be support from millions of Londoners and British nationals who are devastated they are losing their rights as EU citizens.“As the UK and EU start their next phase of negotiations, I want this issue of associate citizenship to be at the heart of talks about our future relationship.”Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s Brexit coordinator before the UK’s departure, has long campaigned for “associate citizenship” for people angry at losing EU privileges.Created with Sketch.Brexit day: UK says goodbye to EU  Show all 66Created with Sketch.Created with

Starmer plumped for Harold Wilson as the best Labour leader, while Nandy said “I’m hoping we are about to elect her.”Asked in a series of quickfire questions how she would vote in a referendum on keeping\u0026nbspthe monarchy, Ms Nandy replied: “I’m a democrat, so I would vote to scrap it, but actually this is not the priority as a country.”Long-Bailey vows to make it illegal for refuges to exclude trans womenStarmer ‘not concerned’ with being labelled a Blairite or a Corbynista‘Labour will win again only when it comes to love Tony Blair’Sir Keir said: “I wouldn’t.

There’s abuse and hatred and it’s not just Caroline’s case. There are youngsters taking their lives because of what they see on social media.“When I was director of public prosecutions, I tried to persuade social media to take responsibility and their response was, ‘If it isn’t terrorism, we are not going to’. That’s got to change now.”Ms Nandy said it had become “difficult to be in public life at the moment, because there is an unkindness that’s crept into our public debate that I think is detrimental to all of us”.She said there should be “much greater support” made available to people suffering online abuse.And she added: “I think we need to start challenging the public discourse in this country.“It’s not just that it is abusive and unkind, it is also that we have found multiple ways in the last decade to ide ourselves from each other.

Free health care? A jobs guarantee? Isn’t that socialism?Cardi B and Mark Ruffalo among celebrities backing Bernie SandersWhy the rise of Bernie Sanders is making some Democrats nervousWill bitter moderates vote for Bernie Sanders?But while policies such as free universal healthcare are seen as extreme in the US they are perfectly ordinary in Europe.The higher tax and spending proposed by Sanders would also not be out of place on the other side of the Atlantic.The economist Paul Krugman says Sanders is better described as a European-style social democrat rather than a socialist, not least because Sanders isn’t proposing to nationalise private industries.OK, but would this ruin the American economy?The French economist Thomas Piketty even argues Sanders’\u0026nbsppolicies could be beneficial to the US economy\u0026nbspby raising the country’s growth rate, and says that his wealth distribution policies tap into an older tradition of American policymaking.“Remember that the US is actually the country that invented progressive taxation of income and wealth in the 20th century,” Piketty points out.Others have described Sanders as a “New Dealer”, referring to the progressive economic policies put in place by former\u0026nbspDemocratic President Franklin Roosevelt in the wake of the Great Depression of the 1930s.So why are people describing Sanders as dangerous?But it may also be that the genuinely fear Sanders’ policies, even if they are in the mainstream of the European tradition, will do damage in the US context.Or they may be assuming that Sanders, if he won power, would pursue policies that go much further than those he has proposed, with the 78-year-old proving more radical in office, perhaps like Hugo Chavez in Venezuela.Against this, though, is the institutional fact that US presidents are constrained by Congress in what policies they can enact. Sanders might be in favour of relatively radical redistribution, but that’s not true of the wider Democratic party.Even some of Sanders’ rivals for the Democratic nomination, such as Pete Buttigieg, are critical of his policies such as the $15 federal minimum wage.That’s why many analysts – even those who support the principle of “medicare-for-all” – think there is little chance he could actually deliver it, even if he won power.And while some financiers are sounding the alarm, others are more sanguine.Another Wall Street Bank, JPMorgan, recently told its clients that, even if Sanders were elected, “we put the probability of major changes like medicare-for-all or a wealth tax at less than 5 percent.”All of which raises a question: is the risk less that Sanders ruins the US economy than that he disappoints his supporters?Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

No new date was given for the event.The show was a presentation of its so-called Metiers d\u0027art collection, a showcase of its most intricate craftwork and handstitched outfits.Prada said in a separate statement it had put off its Prada Resort fashion show in Japan, originally scheduled for 21 May.The Hong Kong-listed group said the decision had been taken as a precautionary measure as well as an act of responsibility and respect for all those working on and planning to attend the show.Japan remains one of Prada\u0027s strategic markets and relevant events will be scheduled in the country at a more appropriate moment, it said.Germany is sending a second shipment of medical aid supplies to China to help the Asian giant fight the coronavirus epidemic that has infected over 73,000 people.\u0026nbspThe country\u0027s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said the government was sending 8.7 tons of aid supplies worth €150,000 (£124,000), including protection gear and disinfectants.Germany stands firmly on the side of China in the battle against coronavirus and works closely and trustfully with the Chinese officials, Mr Maas said. We have the utmost respect for the efforts China has already undertaken.In an updated statement, a spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: We have the utmost concern for the British people currently on the cruise ship.We are ensuring those who have been diagnosed with coronavirus receive the best possible care in Japan and are organising a flight back to the UK for other British nationals on the Diamond Princess as soon as possible.Boris Johnson offers sympathies to Chinese president over coronavirusBoris Johnson, the prime minister, has discussed the coronavirus outbreak with Xi Jinping, the president of China.A Downing Street spokesman said: The prime minister spoke to President Xi of China this morning.He offered his sympathies for those affected by the outbreak of coronavirus in China. President Xi thanked the UK for its support and in particular welcomed the donation of vital medical equipment to China.The prime minister and president agreed on the importance of the UK-China relationship and resolved to work together across a range of issues including strengthening the economic partnership, to benefit the people of both China and the UK.Ahead of COP26 in Glasgow and the Convention on Biological Diversity Summit in China, the two leaders resolved to work closely together on the issue of climate change. They agreed that bioersity and climate change are two sides of the same coin and must be addressed in tandem if we\u0027re to protect the planet for future generations.British firms must flag up the full extent of the risks posed by the coronavirus outbreak to their businesses in forthcoming annual reports, according to the UK accounting watchdog.The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) said companies have a duty to make up-to-date and meaningful disclosures to investors on the potential impact of the disease, the Press Association reported.It also confirmed it is in talks with accountancy firms over the potential effect that coronavirus - also known as Covid-19 - could have on their ability to sign off accounts, given travel restrictions in China.Here are the latest figures on the coronavirus, which has infected more than 73,000 people globally.— Mainland China: 1,868 deaths among 72,436 cases, mostly in the central province of Hubei— Hong Kong: 58 cases, 1 death— Macao: 10— Japan: 610 cases, including 542 from a cruise ship docked in Yokohama, 1 death— Singapore: 77 cases— Thailand: 35— South Korea: 31— Malaysia: 22— Taiwan: 22 cases, 1 death— Vietnam: 16 cases— Germany: 16— United States: 15 cases separately, 1 U.S. citizen died in China— Australia: 14 cases— France: 12 cases, 1 death— United Kingdom: 9 cases— United Arab Emirates: 9— Canada: 8— Philippines: 3 cases, 1 death— India: 3 cases— Italy: 3— Russia: 2— Spain: 2— Belgium: 1— Nepal: 1— Sri Lanka: 1— Sweden: 1— Cambodia: 1— Finland: 1— Egypt: 1Coronavirus a\u0026nbsp\u0027very dangerous situation\u0027, UN secretary-general saysThe coronavirus outbreak is not out of control but it is a very dangerous situation, the UN\u0026nbspsecretary-general has said.Antonio Guterres told the Associated Press that\u0026nbspthe risks are enormous and we need to be prepared worldwide for that.A small number of Irish people are on board the two cruise ships where coronavirus has been detected, the Irish government has said.Minister Simon Coveney said his Department of Foreign Affairs was in contact with citizens on the Diamond Princess in Japan and the Westerdam off Cambodia.He told RTE\u0027s Morning Ireland: It\u0027s a small number though, and we\u0027re dealing with each inidual case.There is a second cruise ship off Cambodia, we\u0027re working with Irish nationals on both of those ships to make sure they\u0027re safe.And if they\u0027re in quarantine, to make sure those conditions are safe.Coronavirus is deadlier than normal flu, study findsThe Covid-19 disease is far deadlier than the normal flu, a\u0026nbspstudy by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention has found.More than 80 per cent of the cases studied were mild, with severe symptoms such as pneumonia occurring in 14 per cent of them and critical illness in 5 per cent.The fatality rate of 2.3 per cent, which makes it deadlier than the seasonal flu, which typically has a 0.1 per cent mortality rate.France\u0027s health minister has said there is a credible risk the coronavirus outbreak could turn into a pandemic and spread across the world.This is both a working assumption and a credible risk, Olivier Veran told France Info radio.He said France was ready to deal with all the possibilities and its health system was sufficiently robust and well-equipped.Four patients who tested positive for the virus remained in hospital in France, he added. An 80-year-old Chinese tourist died from the coronavirus in France last week, the first fatality in Europe.Head of hospital in coronavirus epicentre dies of diseaseThe head of a leading hospital in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, has died of the disease.Chinese state television said Liu Zhiming, the director of Wuhan Wuchang Hospital, died at 10.30am. He was the seventh health worker to fall victim.The hospital was designated to solely treat virus-infected patients.Another 88 passengers on board the quarantined\u0026nbspDiamond Princess\u0026nbspcruise ship have tested positive for the coronavirus, Japan\u0027s Health Ministry has said, according to the country\u0027s national broadcasting organisation.Here\u0027s some more information on the UK\u0027s plans to evacuate Britons from the quarantined cruises hip, from\u0026nbspRory Sullivan:When asked about the government\u0027s treatment of his parents, Mr Abel described it as appalling.

More like an actress acting the part of someone who cares. As so many of them do.“I find Portman’s type of activism deeply offensive to those of us who actually do the work. I’m not writing this out of bitterness, I am writing out of disgust,” she wrote.Unfortunately, coming from someone who has been so integral in the protest movement, this sounds like sour grapes.Natalie’s response to Rose’s criticism was as elegant and as understated as her protest.She said: “I agree with Ms McGowan that it is inaccurate to call me ‘brave’ for wearing a garment with women’s names on it.“Brave is a term I more strongly associate with actions like those of the women who have been testying against Harvey Weinstein the last few weeks.”She also responded to Rose’s accusation that Natalie has only been directed twice by women.But in this criticism, Rose is seriously missing the point. Female directors don’t get as far in Hollywood as male ones, which is precisely what Natalie is pointing out with her cloak protest. Therefore, there are fewer available to work with.As Natalie said: “It is true I’ve only made a few films with women. In my long career, I’ve only gotten the chance to work with female directors a few times . . . Unfortunately, the unmade films I have tried to make are a ghost history.“Female films have been incredibly hard to get made at studios, or to get independently financed. If these films do get made, women face enormous challenges during the making of them.”By the way, this is not the first time Natalie has protested from within the system.While presenting the best director category at the Golden Globes in , she introduced the line-up by saying: “And here are the all-male nominees.”Again, it’s not a shouty, noisy street protest. But it served to make her point. Just that she did it in a dferent way than Rose might. And that’s fine.In fact, some people think that Rose’s in-your-face type of protest risks alienating some people.I think women should support each other when it comes to vying for equality.But also, Rose just sounded spiteful when she said Natalie was “an actress acting like someone who cares”.Rose is a hero to many women. But she needs to understand that whether their contribution is big or small, loud or subtle, anyone’s effort to affect change helps.JANE Fonda, who looked fabulous at the Oscars, has said she is done with plastic surgery.Well, I guess  is as good an age as any to stop nipping and tucking.She must have a great doctor, as whatever the actress has had done has been done very well indeed – because, in my experience, it’s not often you look better after a facelt than you did before.PERHAPS Andrea Leadsom had a premonition that she was going to be axed as Business Secretary in this week’s Cabinet reshuffle.She recently wrote a column obliquely warning Boris Johnson not to cut the number of female ministers in his Cabinet.Addressing the issue of female board members among FTSE  companies, Andrea wrote: “Working in the City in the Nineties, I saw myself how a male-dominated environment can limit a career.”Unfortunately for her, the warning did not save her skin and she has been sacked, along with Theresa Villiers as Environment Secretary and housing minister Esther McVey.By the way, eight of the  members of Mr Johnson’s first Cabinet were female –  per cent.Despite these sackings, that figure has actually risen – slightly – to nearly  per cent.Ideally, the split would be an even -.But the reality is that business and politics can both be brutal.Men and women alike must accept they might one day get the sack.It simply goes with the territory.Being selected on the basis of gender is just as wrong as being sacked on that basis.Right person, right job, regardless of their gender.THAT is what true equality means.SAY what you like about the bonkers lestyle advice dispensed by Gwyneth Paltrow on Goop – and some of it is seriously out there.But whatever she is doing clearly works.She is, at the age of , nothing short of radiant.In fact she looks amazing and also happy.Not only that but she became instantly relatable to parents everywhere with a confession that her -year- old daughter finds her embarrassing.That’s a good reminder there is nothing like a teenager to keep you normal and down to earth for fear that you will embarrass them, no matter what you do.Although, to be fair, perhaps Gwyneth’s daughter has had a predisposition to feel embarrassed by her mother ever since she named her  . . . Apple.What are the ethics of seat-reclining on a long-haul flight An American Airlines passenger raised the question after video-shaming a fellow traveller who punched and pushed her seat when she reclined it.Bearing in mind the recline button moves the seat about in, I suspect this chap has anger issues, as reclining a seat that has a recline button is hardly an act of aggression.I’d disable the recline button and then all you have to fight over is the armrest.DAMIAN Hurleys resemblance to his mother, Liz, is uncanny.More so than ever in the latest shots of the two of them together, which he posted online this week.Some people think it is vaguely unsettling that he looks more like Liz Hurley than Liz Hurley.But as a mum myself, I think it’s heartwarming a teenage boy should be so happy to emulate his mother.OH the utter folly of the face tattoo!The latest to succumb to this trend, which a few years ago would be, frankly, unthinkable, is Amber Rose.She has had the words Bash and Slash tattooed across her forehead in old English manuscript style.It’s a reference, apparently, to the model’s three-month-old son Slash, and six-year-old son Sebastian.

We truly do.But do Harry and Meghan understand and ever admit to themselves that they owe EVERYTHING to their royal connections Without the magic dust that royalty bestows, JP Morgan — one of the world’s richest banks — would never have flown them in a private jet to an exclusive company beano. Don’t tell Greta Thunberg!And without his royal blood, Prince Harry would not be in talks with Goldman Sachs about a future relationship.If they were not British royalty, Meghan would be a B-list actress whom few people had ever heard of and Harry an old soldier with two rotten A-levelsfrom Eton — a school where my dog Stan could get four good grades and an offer from Oxbridge.I do not doubt Harry and Meghan’s sincerity when they say they want to be financially independent.But because they are poncing on royal connections, the couple have a duty of care to the Queen and to this country.Please don’t embarrass the Royal Family, or British people who shelled out £million for your wedding.Please do not turn into the preening glove puppets of investment bankers.Oh Harry, please don’t turn into Tony Blair in a tiara.Oh Meghan, don’t become the st-century Fergie.Prince Andrew’s reckless friendship with convicted billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein has humiliated and damaged the Royal Family.Andrew’s total lack of judgment may have done irreparable harm to the monarchy.Many of us wonderthe institution will last after the Queen has gone.So show some dignity, Harry and Meghan. Engage your brains, not your bank balance.Have a little DISCRETION. Please do not pimp your royal connections to any passing dodgy billionaire or investment banker who claims to care deeply about your charity work.Frankly, it doesn’t look good so far.The nation cringed when Prince Harry buttonholed Disney boss Bob Iger at the London premiere of The Lion King, aggressively pitching Meghan’s availability for “voiceover” work.A member of the Royal Family begging a Hollywood big-shot for work was not a pretty sight.When they handed in their letter of resignation, Harry and Meghan made lofty announcements about “collaborating” with the Queen, as though Her Majesty, , is some grime DJ who could be brought in to remix their latest single.The brutal truth is that we will not see much of Harry and Meghan in these parts.This week they sacked  loyal UK staff and shut their Buckingham Palace office.But by turning their backs on the royal le, Harry and Meghan have placed themselves in an almost impossible situation.They claim to want to be financially independent of Prince Charles and the British taxpayer.Then they will have to grab the big pay days where they can.They will have to earn phenomenal sums of money to fund the lavish lestyle to which they are accustomed.But there is absolutely nothing in either of their CVs to suggest they can make that kind of dough without flogging their royal connections to the highest bidder.If Harry and Meghan are going to support themselves, they are going to have to get their hands dirty in the working world.Harry’s discussions with Goldman Sachs may be focused on his charity work right now, but investment bankers are not renowned for their boundless human compassion.Big bankers — and mega-rich companies like Netflix and Apple — will look at Harry and Meghan and wonder what they can get out of them.Harry and Meghan are free to demean themselves, as Harry did so spectacularly when he shook his diamond-encrusted begging bowl at the boss of Disney.But please don’t demean this country.Please don’t debase the Royal Family, as Prince Andrew has done.Please, Harry and Meghan — do not embarrass the Queen.Because let’s face it, chaps — without your royal connections, the pair of you really don’t add up to very much at all.After all those wild decades, Keith – who is said to have smoked an estimated , fags in his time – clearly believes in moderation in all things.Especially moderation in moderation.IN a pithy turn of phrase worthy of Oscar Wilde, one commentator mused that Labour’s dishevelled Tracy Brabin looked like she had been “banged over a wheelie bin” in her off-the-shoulder frock in the House of Commons.Showing Tracy how it is done, Kate Beckinsale looked stunning in a very similar off-the-shoulder number at a pre-Oscars party.Kate also looks as though she has never even seen a wheelie bin.But it’s not true. I recall Debbie Harry was a dazzling double NME winner in  – Pin-Up Of The Year and Best Female Singer.The NME may be  years old. But NME award winners never get any older.THE coronavirus could well be China’s Chernobyl – the national calamity that changes everything.As the global death toll of the virus nears ,, the old men in Beijing who run China have never looked so woefully out of their depth.The greatest hero in China today is Dr Li Wenliang, the -year-old Wuhan doctor who tried to warn the Communist regime of the virus.Dr Li was arrested, bullied, humiliated, accused of scaremongering and later died of the virus.That is what happens in a one-party state that considers all criticism to be treason.China does not look like the next economic superpower today.China looks like an inept one-party state that failed to grasp the seriousness of the virus, then stubbornly refused to heed the warnings that could have contained it, and has now exported it to the rest of the world.The coronavirus came out of the so-called wet markets of China, where every conceivable animal is kept in filthy conditions to cater for the Chinese appetite for “exotic” animals.Wolf pups, koala bears and assorted rats, bats and snakes are all on offer for the discerning wildle gourmet, many under the counter.These markets were the breeding ground for Sars nearly  years ago, and they were the breeding ground for the coronavirus.Exactly how stupid can a regime be that allows the existence of these unregulated markets  The virus that is now polluting the entire planet was totally avoidable.Mikhail Gorbachev was convinced that the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl in  caused the collapse of the Soviet Union five years later.The Chernobyl explosion “opened the possibility of much greater freedom of expression”, said Gorbachev. “To the point that the system as we knew it could no longer continue.”If the coronavirus brings down China’s ruling Communist elite, it will be exactly what they deserve.Now Leo has seen his Fine Gael party poll a wretched . per cent of the vote in the Irish general election, going from power to third place overnight.Looks like Leo Varadkar is a teeny-weeny politician now.Now BBC chairman David Clementi squeaks that ending the licence fee will mean scrapping children’s channel CBeebies.Stop our money and you will make all the kiddies cry!But the openly biased BBC stopped being a state broadcaster years ago.It no longer deserves to be funded like one.TANYA McDonnell is a modern success story.Tanya was working in McDonald’s in Washington, Tyne-and-Wear, for £ an hour until a modelling agency spotted her holiday shots on Instagram.“I’d always looked up to people like Kate Moss,” says Tanya. “But I didn’t think I had a chance because I wasn’t pretty enough.”Only in the age of social media could a girl go from having her picture taken on holiday to making a living as a model.And only in the age of social media could someone who looks like Tanya McDonnell fret that she is not pretty enough.I didn’t know he had one.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And more people now watch YouTube than all terrestrial broadcasters put together.Even the BBCs highest paid star, Gary Lineker, says its time to make the fee voluntary, while Dame Helen Mirren admits its had its day.Yet the Government’s policy has provoked howls of outrage, especially from the chattering liberals who seem to regard the licence fee as a sacred part of our constitution.Their squeals of protest are badly misplaced. The fact is that, by guaranteeing a huge revenue stream, the licence fee promotes a culture of excess and mismanagement within the BBC, which has a budget of almost £ billion and employs , people.Its reflected in the vast salaries paid to scores of BBC stars, far beyond market rates, like the £. million previously dished out to Lineker, £, to newsreader Huw Edwards, or the £, to sports presenter Jason Mohammad.You can spot it in the host of botched or extravagant schemes, like the notorious reconstruction of the EastEnders set, whose budget soared from £ million to £. million.Worse still, a staggering £ billion was spent on the refurbishment of Broadcasting House in central London.There is also absurd doubling up among staff, particularly in the news.Last week, the BBC had  correspondents covering the American Democrat primaries in Iowa and New Hampshire, while in  no fewer than  on-air journalists were sent to report on one brief Brussels summit attended by David Cameron.But the lack of any commercial pressure is most easily spotted in the vast, sprawling tiers of flabby bureaucracy.Ab Fab comedian Jenner Saunders once said of the corporation, “It’s become top-heavy in such an ugly way,” adding that it is “an executive-run place for idiots”.A glance through the BBC’s Annual Report for  shows just how correct she was.On these pages, I counted no fewer than eight managers who had “Human Resources Director” in their job titles, all of them on at least £,-a-year.Among them were: Dale Haddon, “HR Director, News and Employee Relations”, on up to £, Rachel Currie, “BBC Group HR Director” on up to £, and Gillian Taylor, “HR Director” on £,.It was the same story with BBC News, whose regiment of well-healed officials included: Fran Unsworth, the “Director of News” on £, Gavin Allen, “Head of News Output” on £, and Jonathan Munroe, Head of Newsgathering” on £,.This grasping spirit prevails throughout the bloated organisation, from the £, “Director of Nations and Regions” to the £, “Director of Radio and Education.”Insulated by public funding, the corporation adores both navel-gazing and self-promotion. So it has a “Director of Communications” on £,-a-year, a “Director of Policy” on £, and a “Director of Editorial Policy” on £,.All that puts into perspective the current moans from the BBC about the need for cuts.But apart from the managerial excess, what also aggravates is how the corporation uses its publicly-funded muscle to promote a fashionable, London-centric agenda.As the state’s monopoly broadcaster, the BBC should be utterly impartial.Yet its output is dominated by trendy political messages on immigration, climate change, Tory cuts, ersity and poverty.The BBC might have lavished reporters on the Democrat primaries, but it gave hardly any live coverage to the recent celebrations in Parliament Square at the moment of Brexit.Typically a Newsnight discussion  that evening – held in a studio bedecked with the blue and gold of the EU - featured two Remainers and one Brexiteer.Left-wing propaganda is continually crowbarred into everything from drama to discussion programmes.Just  per cent of the national workforce is employed in the public sector, yet the BBC is filled with the voices of state employees, most of them whining about under-funding.Left-wing opinions have a stranglehold most topical comedy shows, such as Radio Four’s News Quiz, hosted by the achingly unfunny Nish Kumar.It was Kumar who recently caused a storm by sneeringly presenting an edition of the BBC children’s show “Horrible Histories”, in which Britain’s Victorian past was held up for ridicule.The BBC can get away with this because of its lucrative monopoly as the state’s only broadcaster.

No one is suggesting you won’t have Strictly Come Dancing or Match of the Day or even Question Time and Newsnight.But the media is fundamentally changing. Consumer choice – what you or me choose to consume on the box or on our iPads or phones and at what time – is king.The idea that by  paying £. for a service that we may choose not to watch or listen to AT ALL is insanity.It might be unpleasant for BBC lers but the time has come to accept that the licence fee must evolve into a subscription service, so that the corporation is accountable to viewers and not the current behemoth that puts local newspapers out of business, that competes with national newspaper websites to write about Love Island, and that makes podcasts like Reality Tea all about the MTV reality series Geordie Shore.That is NOT public service broadcasting. It is a blatant and constant attempt to undercut struggling commercial rivals.But a sea change is coming. I truly feel it.Sure, there might be disagreement at Downing Street about exactly what that change will involve.Personally I’m on the side of Dominic Cummings who wants wholescale cuts. Sell Radio  and Radio , shut down the sweeping BBC Online department and focus on true public service programming that won’t be provided where. Then in  allow people the choice about whether they want to pay for what they watch from the BBC or not.But the plan by Boris Johnson - who The Times reports this morning fancies an evolution not a revolution - is also valid. The first step to decriminalise the licence fee is the start of bringing the BBC back in line.The fact we’re even having this discussion is the fault of the BBC, which has proven itself to be untrustworthy and lacking in political impartiality in recent years.It disgraced itself over its coverage of Brexit. It proved it was no longer in touch with vast swathes of the country the folk outside of London who don’t spend their days eating quinoa salads and quaffing champagne with other members of the liberal media elite.It proved itself out of touch for failing to predict the biggest story at the most recent election: Boris Johnson’s historic toppling of Labour’s northern red wall.But what’s most telling is the fact some of the BBC’s biggest proponents are now speaking out to insist the corporation must adapt to change. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Credit: The Mega Agency Dame Helen Mirren is the latest celeb to e into the debate over the licence feeShe said this week: “I think the that the licence fee has had its day.”She joins the BBC’s highest paid presenter Gary Lineker who has said it should be abolished.In all honesty though so should his contract, which costs licence fee payers £. million a year for minimal work.Radio ’s Evan Davis last week said the BBC needs to axe radio stations and either BBC or BBC rather than keep trimming costs around the edges.The need for genuine change at the BBC has reached a tipping point.It has to happen now.

Sadiq Khan made the plea for any British national to claim associate citizenship as he travelled to Brussels today ahead of talks on a Brexit trade deal. The capitalaposs Labour chief said the move would allow British citizens to keep many of the rights they held before Brexit, including the right to move freely between EU member states. The idea was repeatedly floated by European Parliament Brexit chief Guy Verhofstadt and other EU politicians as a way of keeping ties across the English Channel. But any prospect of it actually happening looks bleak - since the UK government plans to bring in a points-based immigration system and erge from EU rules from  January . Mr Khan said: Like so many Londoners, I am heartbroken that we are no longer a member of the European Union, but that doesnapost mean our countryaposs future canapost be closely linked with the rest of Europe. The Prime Minister says his job is to bring the country together and move us forward and I cannot think of a better way of reconciling the dferences between British voters who wanted to leave, and the millions of Londoners and British nationals who still feel and want to be European. There would be support from millions of Londoners and British nationals who are devastated they are losing their rights as EU citizens. As the UK and EU start their next phase of negotiations, I want this issue of associate citizenship to be at the heart of talks about our future relationship.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailLast Thursday, I was begging on the doorstep of Church House, Westminster in the role of a homeless person for five hours from am to pm. You are not taught to do that at college when preparing for ordination  years ago. Nor is it something I was expecting to do at the age of . But something has to be done. I was begging on the last day of the February meeting of the General Synod, the governing body of the Church of England. I was supporting from the street two excellent motions to be voted on that day. One was promoting a better friendship between church members and impoverished people in line with the priority given to it by Jesus. The other was opposing the shredding of legal aid which is blocking access to justice for many. Both motions were passed unanimously. I learnt a little of what it is like to be homeless on the streets. Sitting in the cold for hours on end is boring and very uncomfortable. I did not feel the cold until after I had finished the vigil. Then my body felt chilled until it warmed up in the early hours of the next morning. Charities, shelters and cold weather polices of local authorities simply do not meet the need for or the right to a home in all weathers.  While several people entering or leaving Church House stopped for a chat, most walked by asI was not there. That invisibility while lying on the pavement must be very depressing for long term street homeless people. £. was put into my mug which I gave to one of the three street homeless people begging outside Tottenham who I pass on my journey home. I am planning another session in the role of beggar opposite Downing Street. I founded the Zacchaeus  Trustas a charity in  to respond to the Poll Tax and Taxpayers Against Povertyin  to respond to austerity. Both ZK and TAP are committed to working  with and for the poorest UK citizens without allegiance to any political party. I have worked with and for low income families and iniduals for  years. Debt, hunger and homelessness are now very bad and getting worse.By demonstrating for the homeless I wanted to draw the attention of Synod members to the concerns I hear so often from TAPaposs supporters about the Church of Englandaposs commercial use of very valuable land in ways that do not contribute to ending homelessness. Homeless families in temporary accommodation were also in my mind. According to Shelter at least one parent is employed in , out of , such families in England. There is a statement doing the rounds in Government circles that says putting homeless families in temporary accommodation is all right because they have a roof over their heads.  But homeless families can be forced to move several times in up to and over ten years of roofs over their heads.

Richard had to wade down there and knock the door down. The dog was drowning – it was horrible, but we got him. n“Questions need to be asked about how this happened.” nGordon Churchill, also from Nantgarw, was rescued on his th birthday with daughter Carolyn, who save his treasured RAF medals. nSome homeowners living next to the River Taff, in Pontypridd, felt they had been abandoned. n IYA weather widget  nRobin Williams, , said: “Where’s Boris  Where’s the help ” nWarning of more “heavy” downpours tomorrow and Thursday, Bonnie Diamond from the Met Office said: “There is rain in places where it isn’t really welcome.” nAndrew Morgan, leader of Rhondda Cynon Taf Council, said the region faced a “multi-million” bill to repair “roads, parks, bridges, flood defences and community buildings”. nBoris Johnson was today holed up in Chevening, a grace-and-favour mansion in Kent, refusing to convene a Cobra meeting or visit traumatised families dealing with the Storm Dennis floods. n Top news stories from nThe PM convened a Cobra meeting over flooding when he was chasing votes three months ago. nShadow Environment Secretary Luke Pollard said: “It is a disgrace the Government has not convened Cobra.

leader Sir Ed Davey said: “Boris Johnson’s response to these floods has been shocking.” n\",\"usage\":,\"language\":\"en\",\"semantic_roles\":[,\"action\":,\"text\":\"has been

Storms Ciara and Dennis have ravaged communities and with more heavy rain forecast, environmental scientist Angela Terry said: “As a country we are not preparing. Sending the army to fill sandbags is a sticking plaster.” As river levels rising and more than a month’s rain falling in  hours in places, it is feared that more chaos and destruction is to come. Ms Terry added: “As temperatures rise, the atmosphere can hold more water so downpours are more intense – % more for every degree celsius temperature increase – so flooding will increase. We are currently in a national emergency.” MPs blasted the Government for its lack of action on climate change. Alex Davies-Jones, Labour MP for Pontypridd, said: “This is a big wake-up call. Areas are flooding which have not flooded before. We have to make sure they don’t flood again but also tackle climate change long term. “The Government must wake up to the fact we need to do something drastic now or we will have more situations like this.”  Environment Agency chief Sir James Bevan warned the crisis “is not yet over”, telling people living near the Ouse and Severn rivers to be on high alert as “signicant flooding” is expected later this week. His agency issued a record  warnings over the weekend and  properties were flooded.“Something has changed,” he said. “The climate emergency is driving more violent weather, higher seas and heavier rainfall. We need an approach.”Philip Davies, Tory MP for Shipley, had said “precious little” was done after the  floods and urged the government to “pull its finger out”. But Sir James said “a lot is being done”, highlighting a £.billion investment in flood prevention and a further £billion being offered for the next few years. He added: “You can’t make the whole country flood-proof.” He also said “iniduals have a role to play”, adding that one in six British homes is at risk of flooding.  Ms Terry wants to see more funding for the Environment Agency, local authorities and fire and rescue services. She added: “Spending on vital sea defences and flood barriers has to increase in worst-hit areas. “Some communities will need to move – there are no relocation plans in place so a national debate about floods is urgently required. Planning laws need revision so councils can turn down homes in flood plains.” Hannah Cloke, professor of hydrology at the University of Reading, added: “We’ve always seen big floods but we keep seeing these records broken. These types of events are most likely a taster of what is to come. Clearly, we are not ready for them.” Britainaposs flood hell as communities say aposwe canapost copeapos  Flooded communities still reeling from Storm Dennis are facing more misery this week. Six “danger to le” warnings were issued for the rivers Lugg, Teme, Severn and Wye in Wales and western England. Flood warnings are also in place in Upton-upon-Severn and Uckinghall, Worcs, with residents advised to evacuate after the River Severn burst its banks, closing roads in Shrewsbury.  Major incidents were declared in Hereford, Worcestershire and parts of South Wales as the joint death toll from Dennis and Storm Ciara hit seven. Hundreds of people have been evacuated with , properties damaged by the two storms. The clean-up bill could run into billions. York city centre was inundated by water from the River Ouse. Labour MP for Rhondda Chris Bryant called the situation in South Wales “heartbreaking”.He said people from some of the UK’s poorest areas “lost everything”.But there is more to come with the Environment Agency and Met Office experts predicting “further signicant” floods and  hours of torrential rain.Some  flood warnings are in place across the country.  It comes as a woman who was swept away in Tenbury, Worcs, on Sunday, was named. West Mercia Police said they found a body they believe to be Yvonne Booth, , of Great Barr, Birmingham. Her family said: “Yvonne is a very much loved member of our family and we are all devastated by this news.” Two men died off the Kent coast at the weekend. A climber on Ben Nevis also died, though the cause is unclear. Ciara caused three fatalities. Communities spoke of the devastation.In Hereford, flood water from the River Wye was so deep it covered goal posts at the Cathedral School.Nursery boss Laura Yarwood, , said the “crazy” floods were “the worst anyone in Hereford has seen”. She added: “I think most of the villages have been cut off and there’ve been quite a few evacuations.”  Locals in South Wales grabbed shovels to start the clean-up while others recalled their escapes. Dad-of-two Daniel Patterson, , frantically tried to salvage precious possessions after his we, Terri O’Donnell, , woke him at am. She had heard water pouring into their home in the village of Nantgarw.  Daniel told the Mirror: “I went downstairs and could not believe what I was seeing – the water was coming through the letterbox. “The water was at my ankles so I was rushing round trying to get everything I could upstairs. By then I had two screaming children and a very distressed partner, which made things very stressful. “By am the water was round my waist and I had to just abandon ship. “We have lost a lot, mainly our baby photos, which is very upsetting.”  Daniel, Terri, and their children, Harper, five and Blake, one, went to his mum’s house in Barry, but ed to inspect their home yesterday. Terri said: “It was devastating to look at  years of memories lost. “Seeing the children’s toys covered in mud was the worst.” Paralegal Caroline Jones, , told how her husband, Richard saved their dog after their home was inundated.  She said: “My first thought was the dog, who sleeps in the bathroom. Richard had to wade down there and knock the door down. The dog was drowning – it was horrible, but we got him. “Questions need to be asked about how this happened.” Gordon Churchill, also from Nantgarw, was rescued on his th birthday with daughter Carolyn, who save his treasured RAF medals. Some homeowners living next to the River Taff, in Pontypridd, felt they had been abandoned. Robin Williams, , said: “Where’s Boris  Where’s the help ” Warning of more “heavy” downpours tomorrow and Thursday, Bonnie Diamond from the Met Office said: “There is rain in places where it isn’t really welcome.” Andrew Morgan, leader of Rhondda Cynon Taf Council, said the region faced a “multi-million” bill to repair “roads, parks, bridges, flood defences and community buildings”. Boris Johnson hides from crisis Boris Johnson was today holed up in Chevening, a grace-and-favour mansion in Kent, refusing to convene a Cobra meeting or visit traumatised families dealing with the Storm Dennis floods."},{"url":null,"title":"teen girl who took life","story":"w.mantis  Teen girl who took her own le helps save  people with ultimate kindnessEmily Moore was the third girl under the care of Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys Foundation Trust to have died at their mental health facilitiesA teenage girl who is thought to have taken her own le while a patient in a mental health unit has helped save the lives of five people by donating her organs.  nEmily Moore, , is believed to have taken her own le while in the care of Tees, Esk and Wear ValleysNHS Foundation Trust.  nEmily is believed to be the third girl to die while in the mental health facilities of the same NHS trust.  nChristie Harnett and  Nadia Shar, both , died last summer - sparking a Care Quality Commissioninvestigation which ultimately ruled the hospital should close, reports Teesside Live.  nEmilyaposs dad David, , believes she took her own le.  nBut she passed on the ultimate kindness, her dad said, by donating her organs, and saving the lives of five people in the process.  n  nBaby boy died after his mum was turned away from maternity unit while in labour  nWoman badly injured after driver aposrams into her, forces her into car and speeds offapos  nWriting on social media he said: Emily was a beautul, intelligent girl and we, her family, are truly devastated to lose her to mental health.  nEmily was also a kind and considerate inidual and today she has done the ultimate kindness by saving the lives of five people by donating her organs.  nWe support her decision to be an organ donor and can’t be prouder of what she has done.  nThank you for your support and please talk, listen and be alert to mental health.  nBut the dad remains angry at the death of his daugher.  nHe said: I want answers.  nI have always had concerns with the TEWV trustbecause of where we live, we have got to go with them.   nIaposm devastated, Iaposm let down, Iaposm angry.  nHe had previously been so unhappy with her care he protested with a banner outside West Lane Hospital in Middlesbrough.  nIt read: This hospital is sending my child home to die.

Mr Moore previously protested outside West Lane in May last year claiming he feared Emily would take her own leshe was discharged. He said at the time that staff planned to discharge her - even though she threatened to take her own lethey did. He put up signs around the site, which were later removed, and a large banner. Mr Moore even claimed ligatures had been left in her room, which she used to self-harm.

Natalee Holloway was just  when she vanished during a high school graduation trip to the Caribbean island of Aruba in May . Dutch citizen Joran van der Sloot, , is suspected of killing Natalee - who was last seen with him and another man - and dumping her body, which has never been found. In a new interview, Nataleeaposs grief-stricken mum, Beth Holloway, said van der Sloot once claimed to her that he had the teenaposs remains and he would sell them to her. Appearing on The Dr Oz Show, a daytime TV chat show in the US, Mrs Holloway said: “He promised that he would give me to sell Nataleeaposs remains. That he had Nataleeaposs remains and that he wanted to sell them to me.” In a clip released before the full interview aired on Tuesday, the programmeaposs host, Dr Mehmet Oz, responds: “My goodness, thataposs terrible. He never fought up in any capacity.” Mrs Holloway adds: “Well, of course, it was all a lie. I knew when I stepped into this with Joran, I think everyone knows, we all know when his lips are moving, heaposs lying.”  Natalee, from Mountain Brook, Alabama, was declared legally dead by a judge in January . Van der Sloot, whose father was a judge in Aruba, a Dutch territory, never faced prosecution for her disappearance or death, but reportedly later confessed to murdering her during a secret recording. It is said that he made the confession while in prison for the May  murder of his girlfriend, Stephany Flores, in Lima, Peru. Stephany was killed five years to the day of Nataleeaposs disappearance.  During the same episode of The Dr Oz Show, TV presenter Nancy Grace, host of Justice Nation: Crime Stops Here, was askedthe timeline was a coincidence. She said: “Because it was with such accuracy in many cases, I would say it was planned. But Joran van der Sloot does not plan anything. Itaposs like asking a wolf, or a coyote, ‘Did you plan to murder that gazelle one year from the day you did it last year ’ No, no. Heaposs a killer. Heaposs a killing machine, and I very, very rarely say, ‘I told youapos.

Steven, a reporter for ExmainerLive, tweeted about the hilarious incident and his post quickly went viral.He wrote: The waiter in Nandoaposs just skipped our name on the waiting list for a table because she thought it was a joke.More than , people liked his post, with over , retweeting it.

If it was, we would be in hospital. \" nMr Abel, , wrote that he and his we would be removed from the ship together but they might be separated once they arrive at the hostel. nIn a previous video he had appealed to Virgin billionaire Sir Richard Branson for help. n Coronavirus outbreak  nThe Abels son, Steve, said the conditions on the quarantined vessel were making it dficult for his father to manage his diabetes and that he is also suffering from a tooth infection. nSteve added he could hear his father vomiting in the bathroom the last time he spoke to his mother on the phone but believed it might be due to  \"shock \" rather than a symptom of the disease. n \"The quarantine in Japan has been a failure, that is obvious, soare obviously going to have to go through it again, \" Steve Abel said. n \"I would like them to go through it here where the food is more suitable for my dad. \" nBut he added:  \"Im not actually that worried about the virus - looking at the recovery stats. n \"It is more about the stress, the diet. \" nWhen asked about the Governments treatment of his parents, Steve Abel described it as  \"appalling \". n \"They havent done anything, \" he said. n \"They arent communicating with us, the Foreign Office have my number, my wes number, my brothers number, my sisters number and they havent got back to us on anything and we have been calling them every day for four or five days. \" nSteve Abel told BBC Breakfast:  \"They are very high-spirited people. n \"There are cracks in the armour and they are getting down. n \"My mum breaks down in tears frequently, my dad is short-tempered. n \"They are not getting any communication from our country, so they are in the dark and feeling very unloved. \" nThe ship was carrying , passengers to places such as Hong Kong, Vietnam and Japan when it was quarantined at the port near Yokohama two weeks ago. nThe Foreign Office was organising a flight back to the UK for British nationals on board the ship. nThe department has faced pressure to fly home the  Britons on the Diamond Princess after the US chartered two planes and repatriated  of its citizens. n IYA Hygiene widget  nIt said in an updated statement on Tuesday afternoon:  \"We have the utmost concern for the British people currently on the cruise ship. n \"We are ensuring those who have been diagnosed with coronavirus receive the best possible care in Japan and are organising a flight back to the UK for other British nationals on the Diamond Princess as soon as possible. \" nEarlier, a Number  spokesman said those on board the ship were being contacted about the possibility of a repatriation flight. nOn Tuesday, the Japanese Health Ministry confirmed  more people on board have been diagnosed with the illness, bringing the total to . nThe Abels were the fth and sixth Britons to test positive on the ship. Four others with confirmed coronavirus are currently in hospital in Japan, according to the latest official figures. nThe data comes after Sir Richard Branson said Virgin Atlantic was  \"in discussions \" with the Government over whether he could help those stranded. nHe responded via Twitter to an appeal from Mr and Mrs Abel, who asked the British businessman and philanthropist to charter a special plane. nSir Richard wrote:  \"@VirginAtlantic does not fly to Japan, but we are in discussions with the UK government and seeingthere is anything we can do to help. \" nPrincess Cruises president Jan Swartz said the firm has worked with authorities to send more doctors and nurses on board the ship and has helped fulfil , prescription requests. nHowever, there is still uncertainty over whether passengers will be able to leave the ship at the end of the -day quarantine period on Wednesday. nThe ship was put in quarantine after a former passenger - an -year-old Hong Kong man who disembarked in late January - tested positive for SARS-like coronavirus. nMedics in protective suits began testing passengers and the number of infected guests and crew has steadily increased since the first positive test results. nMeanwhile, the Government has block-booked the Holiday Inn Heathrow Ariel hotel as a potential quarantine zone for international visitors to the UK who develop coronavirus, or for Britons evacuated from overseas. nAs of Monday afternoon, , people in total have now been tested for Covid- in the UK, of which nine have come back positive. nThe death toll in mainland China rose by  to ,, in figures announced early on Tuesday morning, while the number of people infected globally stands at ,, according to the countrys National Health Commission.

Mr Steele, from Wolverhampton, announced he is due to be discharged on Wednesday - and the first thing he wants to do is go for a meal at McDonaldaposs.In a series of Facebook posts, he told friends he will get a hotel room and wait for his we to be released from the quarantined ship, which has been docked near Yokohama, Japan, for two weeks.Are you on board the ship or have you been affected by the coronavirus outbreak  Email webnews@mirror. At least six Britons are among  people who have been diagnosed on the vessel, as the Foreign Office prepares to rescue the UK nationals who havenapost been infected. The Steeles were on their honeymoon when he tested positive for the flu-like virus despite showing no symptoms. Mrs Marshall Steele tested negative. The -day quarantine is due to end on Wednesday, but an extension has not been ruled out. Mr Steele wrote on Facebook: Well have just had great news. i get out of this prison cell tomorrow whoooopey. He wrote to a friend: On Google maps now finding nearest mac donalds.He added: Seems there are loads of McDonalds near cruise terminal so things getting even better. Earlier, he wrote that he would be released after having two consecutive negative test results. At least six Britons on the ship have caught the illness. The latest two are David and Sally Abel, who were celebrating their th wedding anniversary and had become the faces of the quarantine.  The couple, from Woodford Halse, Oxfordshire, had been posting multiple video blogs every day to describe the conditions on the ship and call for the UK Government to rescue the Britons. Mr Abel announced on Tuesday that he and his we were told they had tested positive for the virus after two weeks trapped on the vessel.He wrote on Facebook: There is going to be a time of quiet. We have been proved positive and leaving for hospital soon. Blessings all.But he later told friends he didnapost believe the results, writing: Frankly i think this is a setup! We are NOT being taken to a hospital but a hostel. That’s where partners are sent waiting out there quarantine. David Abelaposs blog update on Monday:  No phone, no wi-fi and no medical facilities. I really am smelling a very big rat here! Waiting for the transfer now. He told a friend: I doubt it was positive. If it was, we would be in hospital. Mr Abel, , wrote that he and his we would be removed from the ship together but they might be separated once they arrive at the hostel. In a previous video he had appealed to Virgin billionaire Sir Richard Branson for help.  The Abelsapos son, Steve, said the conditions on the quarantined vessel were making it dficult for his father to manage his diabetes and that he is also suffering from a tooth infection. Steve added he could hear his father vomiting in the bathroom the last time he spoke to his mother on the phone but believed it might be due to shock rather than a symptom of the disease. The quarantine in Japan has been a failure, that is obvious, soare obviously going to have to go through it again, Steve Abel said. I would like them to go through it here where the food is more suitable for my dad.  But he added: Iaposm not actually that worried about the virus - looking at the recovery stats. It is more about the stress, the diet. When asked about the Governmentaposs treatment of his parents, Steve Abel described it as appalling. They havenapost done anything, he said. They arenapost communicating with us, the Foreign Office have my number, my weaposs number, my brotheraposs number, my sisteraposs number and they havenapost got back to us on anything and we have been calling them every day for four or five days.Steve Abel told BBC Breakfast: They are very high-spirited people. There are cracks in the armour and they are getting down. My mum breaks down in tears frequently, my dad is short-tempered. They are not getting any communication from our country, so they are in the dark and feeling very unloved. The ship was carrying , passengers to places such as Hong Kong, Vietnam and Japan when it was quarantined at the port near Yokohama two weeks ago. The Foreign Office was organising a flight back to the UK for British nationals on board the ship. The department has faced pressure to fly home the  Britons on the Diamond Princess after the US chartered two planes and repatriated  of its citizens. It said in an updated statement on Tuesday afternoon: We have the utmost concern for the British people currently on the cruise ship. We are ensuring those who have been diagnosed with coronavirus receive the best possible care in Japan and are organising a flight back to the UK for other British nationals on the Diamond Princess as soon as possible. Earlier, a Number  spokesman said those on board the ship were being contacted about the possibility of a repatriation flight. On Tuesday, the Japanese Health Ministry confirmed  more people on board have been diagnosed with the illness, bringing the total to . The Abels were the fth and sixth Britons to test positive on the ship. Four others with confirmed coronavirus are currently in hospital in Japan, according to the latest official figures. The data comes after Sir Richard Branson said Virgin Atlantic was in discussions with the Government over whether he could help those stranded.

We still wanted to implement our style of game but it just wasn’t to be on the night.“We still tried to find an opening but we were just lacking a little bit in the final third.”One way in which playing for United is dferent than being at Hamilton, though, is the weight of expectation.More accustomed to fighting at the bottom end of the table, Bingham believes battling for the Championship title is a dferent challenge but that it requires similar qualities.Recent slump in form is no huge cause for concern for league leaders Dundee United\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp united-need-not-fret-over-worst-form-of-season embed # secretStwoJgp\" data-secret\"StwoJgp\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"“It’s a little bit dferent compared to trying to stay up, it’s a dferent kind of mindset you need.“In terms of winning, you still need a mindset to be consistent and there’s a reason why we’re up there and first by  points because we’ve been consistent throughout the season.“We can’t drop that standard evenwe’re playing teams near the bottom, it doesn’t really matter, you still need to be on top of your game. vw, px\"  “It’s a great bunch of lads so we’re just going to keep digging and driving to get that promotion.”The Terrors’ focus now turns to Friday’s visit of Inverness to Tannadice and Bingham is ready to go.“It’s a big club and I was pleased to see the turnout from the away fans on Friday.

Paul Hartley played him further back in front of me and whoever I was partnering but I always felt he was more of a threat further up the pitch.“He creates real problems for defenders because they don’t know whether to follow him when he naturally drops back.“What Gowser does is take real care of the ball when he’s got it and he turns and can see a pass.“The ball he played through for Kane Hemmings’ second goal had to be right and he set the goal up.“I was delighted with Gowser up front and with Kane next to him.”With striking options limited following Danny Johnson’s departure in January and Andrew Nelson’s surgery, James says that plan would have been put to use the previous week against Morton.However, a knock picked up in training ruled McGowan out of the draw at Cappielow.And it was sporting director Gordon Strachan who reminded the Dark Blues manager of the possibility.McGowan started his career at Celtic while Strachan was manager at Parkhead and was given his debut in an advanced position.James added: “It’s something we would have done earlierwe could have.“We probably would have done it at Morton.“He started his career out there.

in front.Anthony DeLuca did win a penalty shot in the th minute but his effort went wide of the target.Troncinsky pulled one back for the Yorkshire outfit to reduce the deficit to - inside the final two minutes but that would be the final score.With a win in their only game of the weekend, the Stars now have a week to prepare for their next game against their arch enemies Fe Flyers at the Dundee Ice Arena next Saturday."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/5e469273da7011.46985477-scaled.jpg ","title":"head coach at lochee amateurs boxing club says young pair can go down same path as rising star sam hickey","story":"Lochee Amateur Boxing Club’s Jerry Howett believes two of his brightest talents can follow in the footsteps of rising star Sam Hickey.Head coach Howett has high hopes for his son Brendan and Luca Flynn and thinks they have just as much potential as former Lochee ABC boxer Hickey – now training with Team Scotland in Glasgow.Both have enjoyed winning starts to the year with Howettearning gold at the Northern District Open Championships  days ago.  Flynnregistered a silver at the same event, following up from his gold at the Scottish Intermediate Championships.And Howett, who comes from a boxing family entrenched in the Lochee community, is delighted with how the pair are progressing.He said: “Luca did well to win at the intermediate Scottish Championships.

It’s been an amazing project.“It’s one of the more talked-about pieces. It has a humour to it, which is dferent.“There’s a whole new precedent for what we can do now.“I want it to be a Nuart installation for as long as the programme runs.”And she said the company is happy to be considered for further artworks.Over the years, the firm has even come up with its own designs – the horse and rider, a family and a man walking a dog, as well as one of a couple hiking in the s, heavily inspired by lestyle brand Barbour.Rosemary added: “The Barbour one was fitting with the time but it’s funny to look at now. I’m glad we ended up not using it.“The other one was a design we came up with. We didn’t want it just to be a horse because people would think we’re just a horse store and we’re much more than that.“It actually got a really positive reaction.“We might still use it in the future, you never know.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/02/pj-jri-110220-02-023-910x564.jpg ","title":"six local heroes get recognition forever as part of city mural1","story":"Six Aberdonians who have made a dference to the lives of others have been added to a mural celebrating the city’s everyday heroes.From showing generosity towards Canadian soldiers in the Second World War to spearheading a campaign which changed the law, the six new additions to the mural on the city’s Flourmill Lane have changed lives in a multitude of ways.Originally created during the  Nuart Aberdeen festival, the project aimed to highlight people who have contributed to the le of the city.The mural, relocated to Flourmill Lane last year, has now been extended after funding from Aberdeen City Council’s Creative Funding programme.The new everyday heroes, chosen by a  of judges from nominations put forward by the public, are: Barbara Russell, a landlady in Aberdeen during the Second World War Justin Ritchie, a volunteer with Street Friends Helping the Homeless and Steve Rae, a Piper Alpha survivor and safety activist.Also chosen were Mark Taylor, for his fundraising efforts, Michael Brown, who campaigned for Clare’s Law after the murder of his daughter and dance teacher Jemma McRae who died after her battle with cancer.Lisa Campbell, great-granddaughter of Barbara Russell, said: “During Dunkirk, soldiers from all over the world who couldn’t get home were dropped anywhere in ports across the UK and the citizens of Aberdeen were asked to help them out.“My great-grandmother took in over  soldiers, mostly from America and Canada and looked after them.“It’s important we get the message out that Aberdeen is a place that welcomes anyone, especially in a bad situation.”Marlene and Alan McRae, parents of the late Jemma, said: “It’s unbelievable that Jemma is up there with the other  heroes. She would be so proud.“Even more importantly for us as a family is that Academy Street Dance Studio will continue to run and that’s a legacy it its own.“She always called the studio her extended family and that’s how it still is.”Offshore safety expert Mr Rae said: “When I was informed that I was chosen I was in disbelief.“As an Aberdonian born and bred it fills me with pride to be recognised as one of its everyday heroes.”Clan fundraiser Mr Taylor said: “I am shocked and also honoured to have been chosen for this award and I would like to thank my family and friends that nominated me.”Mr Brown said: “I’m delighted and humbled to be honoured by my city of birth and raising awareness of Clare’s Law is invaluable.”And Mr Ritchie added: “It feels amazing to be recognised in this way – thanks so much to everyone that nominated me.”Aberdeen Inspired community and environmental co-ordinator Angela Joss said: “While working on this project it became obvious to us that the everyday heroes had changed Aberdeen and the community around them.“We have six examples of amazing Aberdonians and it makes me really proud to be one.”Lord Provost of Aberdeen Barney Crockett praised the scheme and said each of those honoured was a “fabulous ambassador” for the city.And Mike Melvin, ACVO co-ordinator who was on the judging , said: “All nominations were outstanding and very inspiring.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.16768609-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.16768609-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.16768609-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.16768609-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"mikey devlin could return for aberdeens crucial scottish cup replay against kilmarnock","story":"Aberdeen could be boosted by theof centre-back Mikey Devlin for their Scottish Cup fth-round replay against Kilmarnock tomorrow night.Devlin missed Sunday#s - loss to Celtic with a groin strain.Fortunately for boss Derek McInnes, Ash Taylor was fit enough toto the team and score the Reds# goal during a tight encounter.Addressing the media before tomorrow#s Killie clash, which gives both sides the chance of a quarter-final at Motherwell or St Mirren, McInnes revealed Devlin may be available for selection.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCouncillors wil be put in an unenviable position when they finally decidewhere the axe will fall on council services.But exactly how much Argyll and Bute will have to spend will not be known until the daffodils are beginning to pop through the ground.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

McLean levelled the score just before halftime turning a corner by Aitken into the net.The second half was competitive with two well matched teams working hard in the gusty conditions.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

After the session, as the children were heading for lunch, a girl from the class came up and said: ldquoI think the moral in that tale is that we should be kind, but that itrsquos often not easy to do.It was a traditional tale in which the tables are turned on a selfish rich man who had shown no compassion, but then hoped for kindness when he was the one in need. In the brief discussion with this young person, we agreed that itrsquos easier to show kindness to someone who we believe truly deserves it.She told me: ldquoI think the woman in the story did the right thing butIrsquom being honest,it had been me I donrsquot knowIrsquod have been able to be kind like her, because Irsquod have wanted revenge. Thatrsquos the problem, I think, we always think about revenge first. It can make us feel better for a short while but really makes things worse, well at least not better anyway. I try to be kind, sometimes it isnrsquot easy, but I try. Kindness is like a seed we have to plant.I shouldnrsquot have been bowled over by this, for I know a -year-old can have wisdom that many so called grown-ups have forgotten. But I was deeply impressed by her reflection on the storyrsquos message, and her honesty and integrity.This conversation also revealed the power of stories to raise moral dilemmas and human issues without finger pointing or being preachy.And she is right, it can often be very dficult to be kind. The world seems so full of stress, selfishness, anger and intolerance that there seems little space for kindness, except towards those we love and care about. On top of that, it seems increasingly dficult to survive, keep a roof above our heads and pay the bills. Kindness begins at home and often there is little energy, emotion or resources left to think or care about others we arenrsquot responsible for.There can even be a real fear thatwe show lsquotoo muchrsquo kindness we risk becoming a doormat, being used or treated unfairly. We can sometimes watch a child being kind to another and it not being reciprocated, and the temptation then is to suggest kindness isnrsquot shown next time.ldquoWe need to teach people a lesson, is often the mantra which derails our instinct to be kind another way of saying we want revenge. And letrsquos be honest: cruel, uncaring and selfish people can take advantage of someonersquos kindness and revenge does often make us feel better, in the short term anyway.But is the answer to allow unkind behaviour to frame the way we want to live and be treated  Do we respond to unkindness with more unkindness in   So consequently, cruelty with more cruelty, intolerance with more intolerance, selfishness with yet more selfishness  Doesnrsquot this mean that we allow lsquothe lessonrsquo to be that kindness doesnrsquot pay  As Gandhi is famously reported to have said: ldquoAn eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.The truth is, kindness is not weakness but strength. It often isnrsquot easy and takes great courage. It doesnrsquot mean that people should not face consequences for their actions, or that people should be asked to forgive the unforgivable. But it does mean not allowing the unkindness of others to define how we are. We should not allow such acts to clip our butterfly wings.What do I mean by this  There is a theory called the lsquobutterfly effectrsquo. In this theory, it is said that the flapping of a butterflyrsquos wings could cause a chain reaction in which a hurricane could be caused on the other side of the planet. It is not meant to be taken literally, but to show that a very small act, although seemingly insignicant in itself, can have huge, unforeseen repercussions.In this way, kindness is a butterfly. Small acts of kindness may have a huge effect that touches people beyond the knowledge of the person who displayed the kindness. Acts of cruelty and hate also have the same power but all the more reason to flutter the wings of kindness so the wind more likely blows in the right direction.In this way, our behaviour is a butterfly. The way we flap its wings can have huge unforeseeable consequences, either for good or bad, both for ourselves and others. When we are kind, we actually makes ourselves happier too.So to make a real dference, we need only do tiny acts that are easily within our power, and as often as we can. A smile, a moment you truly listen to someone, a helping hand, holding the door open, trying to understand how someone feels, making a cup of tea, not meeting anger with anger, trying not to gain revenge but a change of heart and so on.This is what will truly make up the index of a healthy and happy society. And all of us can be players in this, and beneficiaries of our own kindness.David W Orr, a professor of environmental studies and politics, has said: ldquoThe plain fact is that the planet does not need more successful people. But it does desperately need more peacemakers, healers, restorers, storytellers and lovers of every kind.Great words, but that -year-old school girl already got this.

When the fire effect is switched on, it gives an impressive imitation of a real one.Our small terraced house once had a real fire place, of course, but like so many it was modernised before I moved in, and it was filled in and central heating installed.Yet I am old enough to have lived all my childhood in the lsquos and lsquos without experiencing central heating! It did exist, of course, just not in the houses I lived in as a child!One memory I have is of arriving home from school on a cold winterrsquos afternoon and seeing the smoke coming from the chimney of the church house we lived in at the east end of the Pans. My father had lit the fire early and I still remember its welcoming warmth, and the way it crackled and danced as it defrosted my face and hands. Me and my brothers sat by it, jostling for the best space.Donrsquot get me wrong, Irsquom not complaining about central heating! I know Irsquom lucky to have a warm house and never take it for granted. We donrsquot use the lsquofirersquo for heat, that would be too expensive. But we switch it on for atmosphere. And the effect on the younger kids has been immediate. They sit by it, lie on blankets by it reading and playing and telling stories. I forget that they have little personal experience of having a hearth, even an articial one. The novelty will wane, perhaps, but I hope the cosy pleasure of it wonrsquot.Itrsquos not just the kids, as my we and I love sitting by it in the evening. Wersquove even moved some of the furniture, so this pretend but convincing fireplace, rather than the telly, has become the main focal point of the living room.You could say Irsquom easily pleased, and I suppose thatrsquos true. But our friends have commented on it too, one saying ldquoit really has given your house a dferent atmosphere as he sat by it with the wind howling outside.The hearth has traditionally been the soul of a house. The family would sit by it, soak in the warmth and watch the flames, while telling stories and talking. It was a draw for social communion. Visitors would be welcomed with a place by it and most of the cooking would have taken place there too. The old saying ldquolang may yer lums reekindicated the importance of a lit hearth as a symbol of wellbeing and good fortune.No wonder so many traditions and ceremonies were centred around the hearth. People used to leave objects buried within or near it. There were ious reasons for this: to capture bad spirits that may come down the chimney, for good luck or to deflect a witchrsquos spell. The hearth was seen as a kind of spiritual portal, to be defended and made safe, not just physically.The hearth was also a focus of many ceremonies that marked the changing seasons. The Celtic calendar is full of such events, Imbolc being the most recent. And of course there were the daily rituals of banking up the fire at night, and reviving it in the morning, and keeping it going. All these simple tasks are now fast fading into folk memory.Today, screens are more likely to be the focal point of our homes. Itrsquos kind of unavoidable, of course, and I claim no moral high ground of this issue. But the truth is they drug our senses and dull our conviviality, and, like many parents, we have tried to limit their use in our house. It has felt like a losing battle with my children who, I understand, live in a very dferent childhood to mine. And I readily concede itrsquos got lots of benefits, even though at times I may sound like an old dinosaur lamenting the passing of the Jurassic age.But the arrival of our fake woodburning stove has transformed our house in a way that shows we have lost something in the lsquomodernisingrsquo of our homes. As a storyteller, I have come to understand the importance of a hearth as a focal point for gathering it has the power to bring people together, to share warmth and light but also each otherrsquos presence and social connection. As the freezing wind rages outside, it is a magical space.That magic has been the true gt from my storyteller friend, and she wisely knew it. While much is missing from an articial fire, including the smell and sound of the real thing, our ancestral instinct still kicks in by the visual sight of a flickering hearth.So now my instructions to switch off the screens is more readily obeyed, because it signals time to get together around the fire and lsquobe together properlyrsquo to tell stories and challenge each other with riddles.Burnrsquos poem The Cotterrsquos Saturday Night now has new meaning in our house:To meet their dad, wi flichterin noise and glee.His wee bit ingle, blinkin bonilie,His clean hearth-stane, his thrty wiersquos smile,The lisping infant, prattling on his knee,Does arsquo his weary kiaugh and care beguile,An makes him quite forget his labor and his toil."},{"url":null,"title":"waterside-bistro-chief-takes-castle-inn-dirleton","story":"Brothers Jack and James Findlay have been at the helm of the Waterside Bistro, next to the River Tyne in Haddington, for more than two-and-a-half years.The eaterie was founded by their dad Jim, who also previously ran The Drovers Inn in East Linton, and The Rocks on Dunbarrsquos Marine Road.Now, Jack is expanding the empire by taking over The Castle Inn.He told the Courier: ldquoWe have had quite a soft opening, we just opened yesterday [last Wednesday].ldquoI think the area is lovely and my dad was born in Dirleton, so there is a little bit of heritage there.ldquoWe will be basing it a lot on the Waterside model and obviously myself and my brother will be working alongside each other but from afar.ldquoWe have had tremendous success at the Waterside and we both felt it was probably the right time to look where.ldquoThe Castle Inn was the perfect fit for us.ldquoIt will be myself here and my brother is still based in Haddington.ldquoMy dad is lsquoretiredrsquo but will just be popping in and making sure we are going in the right direction.Twenty-eight-year-old Jack said they already had a good team in place and there were no plans for any ldquodrastic changes.A focus would be placed on locally sourced food, with a daily list of specials.He added: ldquoI would also like to mention the former owners John Dawson and Bert DrsquoAgostino, and want to pay a bit of a tribute to them for their fine work in the trade.ldquoJohn has been fantastic with me and very helpful."},{"url":null,"title":"bench-put-place-memory-tranent-legend-bobby-marr","story":"Bobby Marr, who ran a greengrocer and florist on Tranentrsquos Winton Place for nearly  years, passed away last July.The -year-old was a familiar face to many in Tranent town centre, with hundreds attending his funeral.Marion Hoggan was heavily involved in the fundraising for the bench for Mr Marr, who had colon cancer.She said: ldquoI did not manage the funeral due to work commitments and I felt that I wanted to do something for him.

I came from a lived experience and wanted to do something about it.She has done stellar work since, with the business selling millions of boxes of high-quality tampons, pads and menstrual cups and using the profits generated to donate identical products to charities and food banks. The aim is not just to ensure that no woman has to suffer the indignity of stuffing their pants with loo roll ndash or the health risk of using a product for too long ndash but to raise awareness about how period poverty can affect peoplersquos lives.This week the organisation launched its latest campaign, stocking supermarket shelves with bogus brand UNsanitary to highlight how one in  women and girls are forced to use socks, newspapers and toilet roll to soak up their menstrual flow. ldquoUNsanitary pads is a fake brand, designed to shock, the company says. ldquoIt makes the crippling period poverty these girls and young women still face across the UK relevant and real.It could not be more timely. Thanks to the tenacity of Labour MSP Monica Lennon, Holyrood is in the throes of debating whether free period products should be a universal right for any Scottish resident who requires them. Though the Scottish Government already funds the provision of products in schools, colleges and universities ndash and provides financial backing for a range of charitiesrsquo poverty-eradication work ndash Ms Lennon wants to see that extended.In the introduction to a public consultation on her Period Productsbill, she wrote that ldquoit is to our shame that menstruation is still discussed in hushed voices and that menstrual healthcare and hygiene is not embedded in our health and education systems. By making sanitary products freely available, she added, ldquoScotland can end the silence and stigma that surrounds menstruation and create ldquoa fairer and more equal society.Yet even though  per cent of those who responded to the consultation supported those aims, earlier this month Holyroodrsquos cross-party Local Government and Communities Committee rejected the bill. The SNP and Tory members voted it down on the basis of cost, with only the Green and Labour members giving it their backing.Of course it is only right and proper that every penny of public spending should be properly accounted for, and the disparity between the pound. million Ms Lennon reckons the scheme would cost to run and the Governmentrsquos own estimate of poundm is signicant.But in a country where every one of us can,we so choose, get a free prescription for dandruff shampoo, haemorrhoid cream or mouthwash, it was a shameful decision to make, not least because it gave the impression that sanitary pads and tampons are luxury items that women can somehow do without.Nothing could be further from the truth. As Girlguiding Scotlandrsquos Carolyn Fox-Mackay said last week, period products are ldquoessential products and no one should miss out on opportunities, face isolation or embarrassment simply because they canrsquot afford them. Putting in place a safety net for those who need it would not be profligacy, it would be the mark of a truly civilised society.Ministers are now due to vote on the bill at the end of this month, with a group of  SNP members urging their party to back it. Newly elected Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw, meanwhile, has indicated that he will support it. That does not mean it will necessarily pass, though, with some attitudes around menstruation, poverty and womenrsquos rights appearing depressingly entrenched.Indeed, there are some who believe period poverty is something women should just endure or, bizarrely, take some kind of strength from. Just last month the BBC radio presenter Liz Kershaw won herself as many backers as detractors when she responded to a campaign to put free products in English schools by saying her mother had ldquohad to use old rags which my grandma boiled-washed and she re-used.ldquoHow did she ever manage to get a scholarship to grammar school, go to university and become a headteacher without free tampons  she asked, aswe shouldnrsquot expect things to be better now than they were in the aftermath of the Second World War aswomen like her mother hadnrsquot spent decades earning the right for us all to have a bit more dignity in our lives.Then there are those who donrsquot believe period poverty is a thing, that because supermarkets sell own-brand products at bargain basement prices it is a lie for anyone to claim they cannot afford them. Yet as simple as it may be to dismiss other peoplersquos suffering in this way, the fact remains that even a few pennies is an insurmountable sum when there are no pennies left to give that when faced with buying cheap tampons for herself or a loaf of bread for her children a mother will always choose the latter.Celia Hodson summed this up during our interview when she said that for too many people le is ldquoso vulnerable. ldquoThere are people who are barely managing and living very fragile lives, she said. ldquoIf therersquos a blip it puts their budget onto a kne edge.She also praised the Scottish Government for recognising that vulnerability and ldquohaving a crack at trying to eradicate it. A year and a half later and it is clear that that crack has not been enough, though.

They eat these things buttoxins get in they can bioaccumulate inside the shellfish and when we eat the shellfish, they donrsquot get broken down by heat so cooking doesnrsquot get rid of them.Harmful algal bloomcan spread over a square kilometre of ocean or be concentrated in a tiny area of a sea loch, appearing for a few days, or a week, before currents move it on or it dies from lack of nutrients.The cause of the blooms are in debate but the rise in sea temperatures are recognised to be a contributory factor.Dr Whyte said: ldquoTherersquos a bit of controversy around that [ there are more instances of HAB]. Wersquove got more farms now around the world than ever before and our techniques are getting better and wersquore getting better at finding things in the water so that could be why we seem to find more of them occurring but we are aware they are spreading into areas they never have before.ldquoMost of the toxins are in dinoflaggelates that favour water thatrsquos stratied so when the water heats up and has a nice warm top layer, they live there quite happily. Because of global warming sea temperatures have been rising so we get these stratied layers lasting for longer, theyrsquore more persistent and widespread and they favour the dinoflaggelates who have longer to live up there and breed so they have more effect on the shellfish.The Predicting Risk and Impact of Harmful Events on the Aquaculture Sectorproject is now in its second year of three, and builds on the already established Harmful Algal Bloom and Biotoxin Monitoringreports run by SAMS that is used by Scottish shellfish farmers to monitor sea conditions.Shellfish farmers carry out rigorous testing on their stock to ensure any toxins are detected, using equipment on site and sending samples to be checked to a monitoring programme run by Food Standards Scotland. Via that service, SAMS check around  samples from active shellfish sites in Scotland weekly.The HAB forecast sends out information and alerts to farmers and Food Standards Scotland who will check the shellfish coming off those farmsthere is a bloom nearby. The report, which can be accessed online, also produces a bulletin for the community of Shetland shellfish farmers who requested a specic risk assessment notice that includes what phytoplanktons are present, wind current and sea surface temperatures.If the samples pass the limits, theyrsquoll go ahead for sale andnot, the shellfish farms will be closed down for two weeks to allow the toxins to die out.If shellfish are affected they ldquojust keep on eating whatrsquos coming through and recover and excrete the poisonous stuff so after a few weeks theyrsquore usually healthy, said Dr WhyteThe UK, Ireland, France, Spain and Portugal are working on the euro million PRIMROSE model which will alert countries to blooms in their seas and nearby. Sharing bulletins, expertise and technologies will lead to better monitoring and forecasting and prevention of stock losses.A portal will collect data from satellite analysis, samples and shellfish farmers as well as other sources to predict the blooms.If farmers were due to harvest when a bloom is near, they would test the product and may send it away for further testing, harvesting onlysafe. If there is any doubt, says Dr Whyte, farmers leave their stock in the water.Dr Whyte said: ldquoThe idea is to try and push forward the forecasts as far forward as we can.ldquoWe are using oceanographic models to try and predict when blooms would occur, why and how severe they might be."},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen-exhibition-highlights-historical-women-fringes-society","story":"The charges brought against her included creating a love potion, breaking the wheels of a mill in revenge after the miller refused to give her any meal, and taking bones of the dead from the kirkyard at Dyce, washing them in water which she then used to clean a sick man before casting the bones into the River Don, causing the water to rumble asall the hills had fallen in.She was convicted and subsequently executed by burning - using six loads of firewood.The trial took place at a time when witchcraft paranoia was rampant in Aberdeenshire. Between  and , some  cases were recorded locally with many of the accused, the majority women, put to death following incarceration and torture.A new exhibition running as part of Aberdeens Granite Noir International Crime Writing Festival will shed light on some of the women from the area who were convicted of crimes between the th and th centuries.Drawing from original records found in archives from Aberdeen and its surrounds, Women, Crime and Society examines how women who commit crime, particularly involving murder or violence, can become the subject of a morbid fascination, challenging societyrsquos notion womens role as nurturers.From the Enactment Book to the Kirk Session records, the exhibition highlights the position of poverty-stricken women.From prostitution to infanticide, petty theft to sex before marriage, records show women, many in desperate circumstances, turning to crime.While a number of featured cases relate to infanticide, there occasionally appear to be mitigating circumstances, as in the case of Catherine Anderson, an outworker from Pitfodels accused of concealing her pregnancy - a crime in itself - and smothering her newborn child.Her counsel, Mr J C Wilson pleaded for clemency, stating that the girl was in a state of starvation, deserted by the father of the child and ldquoIndeed in the most wretched circumstances ndash without food, without clothing, and without the means of procuring them, and altogether alone and in her misery, her child was born, and this child unfortunately met its death.The Kirk Sessions, the lowest court of the Kirk of Scotland, dealt with societal control and frequently tried women accused of concealment of pregnancy or extra-marital fornication. One such case was that of Margaret Dunbar - while the court acknowledged that she had been raped twice and named her attacker on record, she was brought before them accused of having a child out of wedlock.Another case highlighted deals with Anna Durward and Margaret Campbell who, in , had been held in the Tolbooth for lsquoseveral yearsrsquo accused of murdering their own children.

Work is expected to be completed later in the summer.A spokesman for Scottish Water said the aqueduct drops by . metres from the north end of Loch Katrine to the south of Milngavie.The bulk of the work being carried out is lsquostandard concrete and mortar repairs,rsquo he added.ldquoHowever, to stabilise exposed rock sections, the project team is using an unusual technique that involves drilling into the rock, inserting steel anchor bolts up to  metres long, attaching steel mesh reinforcements and then spraying concrete until structural integrity is established, he said.ldquoGiven that some of this work is more than half a mile along the aqueduct from entry chambers, electric buggies are being used to move equipment, materials and workers.David Wilkinson, Scottish Waterrsquos senior project manager, said his team of engineers is enjoying working on the project and has been impressed with the work our Victorian forefathers.He said: ldquoOur recent inspections have shown that the aqueduct is in remarkably good condition for its age. Itrsquos mainly constructed from tightly joined masonry blocks in an arched shape. Very little movement or even mortar deterioration is evident. The quality of the workmanship is very impressive.ldquoTo ensure that water can flow by gravity from Loch Katrine to Mugdock and Craigmaddie reservoirs in Milngavie, the aqueducts are laid at a gradient of  inches per miles. This equates to the aqueduct dropping one metre vertically for every  metres horizontally, which means it is virtually flat and drops only . metres during the entireof the old aqueduct. That would be dficult to achieve today with modern surveying equipment and laser levels. To have achieved this  years ago, in deep trenches or freshly blasted tunnel, is quite incredible.ldquoItrsquos also a great tribute to the people who designed and built it that the aqueduct is still so environmentally-friendly and delivering massive benefits to Scotland in the st century.He added: ldquoThis is a pretty unique project and is something of a labour of love for many of us on the team. The work is challenging, time consuming and often very detailed.ldquoHowever, to get up close and personal with such a key asset, with all of its remarkable history, is a great privilege for all of the team."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-afraid-real-power-brokers-behind-government","story":"The attempted bullying and subsequent resignation of Sajid Javid, the former Chancellor, demonstrate an increase in the power and political leverage now held by Mr Cummings. He has become the Thomas Cromwell to King Boriss reign and the Cabinet will increasingly be an acquiescent talking shop, wholly under his control and offering little or no resistance to his political direction as he manipulates the indolent Prime Ministers alleged vision to supplant it with directives of his own with no accountability.There is a high level of apprehension in Government circles at present regarding one of Mr Cummingsrsquos leading aides, Andrew Sabisky. Mr Sabisky may well represent the top of a substantial iceberg with regards Dominic Cummings and his inordinate influence over the decision making of the Prime Minister. The Labour Party has called for Mr Sabisky to resign following publication of his extreme views on eugenics, women and female genital mutilation, though the party in power appears to be ambivalent about his immoral and antediluvian views.Be under no illusion, Mr Sabisky and his fellow advisers are key people in government who are responsible for turning the philosophy of Mr Cummings into practice, including social policy. Like a medieval fiefdom, Parliament and Cabinet will be increasingly sidelined at the expense of democracy and transparency. We have a Prime Minister of questionable morality, a limited conscience and the work ethic of Homer Simpson. The real power broker in the UK is Dominic Cummings who dominates a supine but media-friendly Prime Minister and will exploit his many weaknesses to guide the country down his post-Brexit de- regulated but deeply flawed Utopia.Be afraid, be very afraid.Owen Kelly, Stirling.\"A STATE which dwarfs its men, in order that they may be more docile instruments in its hands.... will find that with small men no great thing can really be accomplished\" . So what about a prime minister who fills his Cabinet with sycophants and yes-men  While Boris Johnsons Cabinet reshuffle clearly serves his greed for power it also shows a dangerous lack of foresight.Ann Marie Di Mambro, Glasgow G.THE nightmare on Downing Street continues. Whilst media attention was distracted by the PMs \"call and response\" game at the first reshuffled Cabinet meeting last week, Rishi Sunak, the new Chancellor, informed fellow ministers that all departments had to find five per cent savings so the money \"could be used on other priorities\". During the General Election campaign the PM appealed to the electorate not to be judged by his predecessors austerity measures, he did not approve of them. So how should these cuts be interpreted Its another lie of course, we should all know better by now than to question his promises. The future is further spending cuts, including to the Department of Healthand to the Home Officeso Boris Johnson can spend money on ... the NHS and the police.Paul Shaw, Dunblane.I READ with considerable interest the comments by journalists and political pundits on the departure of Sajid Javid as Chancellor as both a victory for No  and a consequential diminution of the role of the Treasury asof the public purse.Reference has also been made to the historic stand-offs between previous Prime Ministers and their Chancellors asthis was a necessary and indeed healthy part of the workings of the UK Government.The emerging view is that the consequence of this ldquoclipping the Treasuryrsquos wings will result in a weakening of the effectiveness of Central Government specically because the Treasury will not be able to put a brake on stop future ideas and developments.Although this message is loud and clear, I read little in the way of evidence demonstrating the historic effectiveness of the UK Treasury in the overall management and direction of the UK economy.The ability to stop ideas and initiatives because of their funding needs has, it could be argued, proved to be a major weakness in the UK Governmentrsquos ability to both anticipate trends and to be fleet of foot in generating innovative policy and spending solutions as well as the ability to create and mobilise whole government solutions to the wicked issues that bedevil our society.If the strengthening of the role of No  results in a new capability, a new capacity to develop and implement a clear long-term strategy for the worldrsquos fth largest economy beyond the current and somewhat embarrassingly limited mantra of  new hospitals HS , additional police officers and so on then all well and good.One can only hope.George Thorley, Carluke.ALASDAIR Gallowayis absolutely correct that at the  Scottish Parliament elections the SNP vote exceeded its total vote at the  \"tsunami\" election when it achieved what Mr Galloway rightly calls the \"impossible\" majority. In addition, when Mr Galloway refers to the historical fact that the  elections did not result in an independence referendum, may I remind himthat the  Scottish Parliament elections were held several weeks before the EU referendum, before Scottish voters knew that they were to be taken out of the EU against their will, and that the assurance given to us during the independence referendum that only by voting No could Scotland guarantee her place in Europe was worthless. Moreover, the SNPs  manesto acknowledged that there would not be a second vote on independence unless there was a change of circumstances such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will. Following that, the SNP won the majority of Scottish seats at Westminster at the  General Election, and last December Nicola Sturgeon put Indyref at the heart of the SNPs campaign, and won another \"tsunami\" election.Boris Johnson has nevertheless declared that there wont be a second vote on independence and like Mr Galloway I wonder as to \"what sort of electoral result would be enough\" in order that one be held. One thing is clear there is no use looking for democracy from the Scottish Tories new leader Jackson Carlaw, who is \"totally opposed\" to another vote evenopinion polls show voters in favour of one, evenvoters keep voting for the independence-supporting parties and even\"growing numbers\" of members in his own party support a second independence referendum.Mr Carlaw has slammed the door on putting Scotlands future into Scotlands hands, preferring to keep Scotlands future in the hands of Mr Johnson despite Scotland decisively slamming the door on the Prime Minister only two months ago.Ruth Marr, Stirling.IN his desire to persuade Westminster to agree to Indyref , Alasdair Galloway asks ldquowhere do we go next \". Apart from disassociating myself from being any part of his ldquowe, as sovereignty rests with the people, rather than seats in Holyrood, permit me to respond to him by wheeling out my view that it is the people he has to persuade before the Scottish elections in , and the only true reflection of his success or failure in that will be the total number of votes cast for the parties standing respectively for or against Indyref. I am unable to see the relevance to any of this in his reference to the votes cast only by Conservatives in the EU referendum.Alan Fitzpatrick, Dunlop.JACKSON Carlaw needs to mind his language.In January of this year he said: \"Ive spent the last  months taking on Nicola Sturgeon. Im asking our party to let me spend the next  months taking her down.\"At the launch of his leadership campaign one of his four objectives was \"Beat the SNP\". More recently he has declared that \"the SNP is an evangelical, faith-based cult\".Not only has Mr Carlaw managed to be offensive to women, people who have a religious faith and SNP members and voters, he has set a tone which is misogynistic, adversarial and deeply disrespectful.The political discourse needs to be better than this. Political discourse has been described as \"the formal exchange of reasoned views as to which of several alternative courses of action should be taken to solve a societal problem\".Reasoned views are exactly what we need from politicians of all parties, andMr Carlaw considers himself a leader then lets hear some positive suggestions for what it is possible to deliver rather than deficit-based rhetoric. To simply hurl insults with macho bluster gets us nowhere and suggests that Mr Carlaw is not up to the job.Carol Vanzetta, East Kilbride.ROBERT IG Scottexplains why \"the people of Scotland voted against the SNP\" in the  referendum. I lived and voted in west Fe in  and the SNP did not feature on the ballot paper I received. Perhaps they had dferent ballot papers in north-east Fe. My decision to vote Yes for independence had nothing to do with the SNP and everything to do with the the surge in support for Ukip south of the Border. I cannot understand why so many Scots seem to swallow the Unionist myth that Scottish independence would mean perpetual rule by the SNP in stark contrast to my belief that the SNP would appeal to very few after independence.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.AT the Glasgow Labour leadership hustings , Rebecca Long-Bailey demonstrated how little she understands the constitutions dominant role in Scottish politics. If she becomes Labour leader and, as a consequence of her constitutional stance, Labour at Westminster and Holyrood back Indyref on the SNPs timetable, the Tories will surely strengthen their position as the principal opposition party after the  Holyrood election, with Labour losing yet further ground.Scottish independence voters will iniably back the real thing, the SNP, not Labour, that has form for preicating on this issue.

Winter is a tough time for wild birds, but as spring approaches, and the weather becomes warmer, we should expect to hear more tweeting in our gardens.The company is asking keen photographers to share their snaps, with a chance to win a gt card for the store. Daniel Bingham, senior pets buyer for Wilko, offered some advice on helping wild birds thrive during the colder season.He said: “Birds feed every day and don’t store energy well, so one or two bad days in cold weather or without food can be very dangerous for them.“Put out a good selection of food in feeders or on tables to attract birds to your garden — things like fat balls are nutritious and high in energy — perfect to help them maintain weight and stay fuelled.“Put some soft food down for the songbirds who can’t reach the feeders. Suet blocks and pellets work particularly well, as they give the birds a great energy boost and plenty of calories.“Don’t forget to provide fresh water. Ponds, puddles and other water sources may freeze over, making them inaccessible to birds. Birds can be timid so you’ll need to be patient build up trust by sharing plenty of treats and you could soon be rewarded with the perfect wild bird shot”.The Wilko wild bird competition runs until March .

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”In a response to Councillor Stockan, the minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, says Orkney Islands Council is “wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.”He says minsters understand the “signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities with responsibility for ferries” and that the Government has “made clear our commitment to Orkney’s internal ferry services” with additional funding of £. million in total over the past two years.Councillor Stockan said: “I am extremely disappointed that the First Minister has chosen not to respond to our considerable concerns directly, or to meet with me to discuss an issue of fundamental importance to our community.“I can only describe the Government’s current position as irrefutable discrimination against the people of Orkney. The additional funding we received over the last two years was welcome, but fell far short of what is needed to fully fund our internal ferry service.“I call on the Government to address this when the budget is published this week — and I have asked the other parties at Holyrood to offer us their full support in securing full and fair funding for Orkney.“The running and replacement costs of Western Isles ferries are fully subsidised by the Government. It is only right and proper that we in Orkney should be treated in the same way.”In the letter, Councillor Stockan also criticises the Government for its continued failure to introduce Road Equivalent Tarf on routes linking Orkney to the Scottish Mainland.“The roll-out of RET began on West of Scotland ferry routes more than a decade ago, reducing fares for local people and visitors alike,” he added.“It is our firm belief that there is no impediment preventing RET being introduced on Orkney routes, and that any further delay is unfair and will result in signicant prejudice against local ferry users.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He played in bands in London, rubbing shoulders with the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton and his jamming buddy, Ritchie Blackmore, who went on to form the legendary rock bands Deep Purple and Rainbow.He even jammed at a party with Cream bassist and vocalist, Jack Bruce.A visit from Screaming Lord Sutch, who wanted him to go to Germany with him as a bass playermade Jim think again about a career in rock music.His first passion was always art, and comic book art was his favourite genre.He declined Lord Sutch’s offer and after a few years ed to his beloved Orkney. Here he continued drawing for TV comics before working for AD. He was then head-hunted by the American giants, DC Comics and Marvel Comics.Sadly, Jim suffered with Parkinson’s Disease for over  years and passed away on December , .Despite the diagnosis he continued drawing, painting and writing original sci-fi stories for many years.This celebration of his le and art is dferent from other recent exhibitions, as it contains his le story, original artwork and artefacts relating to him.It also features many Orkney related pieces, rather than just sci-fi heroes like Judge Dredd and Batman.Local characters from the th century hang alongside paintings showing the story of St Magnus, wartime Hoy and illustrations from books, like The Bard of Ballarat and Willick o’ Pirliebraes.Jim’s we, Wendy, said: “I am delighted that the Orkney Museum is having an exhibition of my late husband Jim’s work.“The fact that a young boy from the small Orkney island of Hoy should become world famous in his chosen field of comic book illustration is an achievement in itself, but there were many other aspects to Jim’s le.“This exhibition gives an insight into his early le in Hoy, as well, as his time in the RAF and the excitement of being in the London music scene during the ‘swinging sixties’.“I think it is a true reflection of the times he lived in and I hope it will interest the folk who see it.”The Orkney Museum is open Monday to Saturday, .am-.pm, .pm-pm.

He also asked for an update on the progress of current candidate mast locations in Burray, Hoy and Stromness.In response, Paul Wheelhouse, minister for connectivity and the islands, stated that no new proposed mast locations have been introduced since April  and — despite regular engagement with mobile operators — no operator has committed to using any of the candidate mast locations.Last July, Mr McArthur wrote to mobile phone operators urging them to engage constructively with the programme in Orkney.The MSP said: “It is disappointing to see that progress in closing gaps in mobile phone coverage across Orkney appears to have stalled.“While the Minister has provided assurances that discussions with mobile phone companies are ongoing, there is no sign they are prepared to engage seriously.  Sites have been identied in Stromness, Hoy and Burray, yet people and businesses in these communities are missing out on the better mobile coverage that should be available.“Meantime, efforts to identy new sites appear to have come to a complete halt. That is not good enough.“Ministers and mobile phone operators clearly agreed that public money was needed to plug existing gaps in the network. Since then, however, neither has been prepared to follow this up with action on the ground. As a result, we now have a G Infill Programme that is doing next to no infilling.“I will be urging Ministers to investigate why so little progress has been made and reiterating the need to get the programme back on track”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The second advert, due to be screened in the spring, will showcase Orkney’s lestyle, along with work and study opportunities in the county.The adverts comprise footage created by Orkney-based digital content agency, Start Point Media, as part of the Digital Media Orkney Project, a three-year Orkney Marketing Programme initiative funded by LEADER, Highlands and Islands Enterpriseand Orkney Islands Council .Editing and advert composition was undertaken by STV as part of its Growth Fund initiative, aimed at encouraging Scottish businesses and organisations to advertise on the channel.Morag Robertson, economic development officer at OIC, said: “We decided to create these impactful television adverts with the backing of STV’s Growth Fund and the LEADER programme, as a complement to our marketing activities and as a way of driving more visitors to the official Orkney website, Orkney. It’s the main portal now for our visitor information, and the place anyone keen to learn more about living, working and studying in the islands should head, so we felt a TV campaign would be a great way to both highlight the site and everything Orkney has to offer.”“We’re really delighted with the quality of the two adverts,” added Maureen Shearer, development manager at HIE in Orkney. “The feedback on the first, focusing on Orkney as a visitor destination, has been fantastic and we’re already seeing an increase in the hits on the Orkney website.

One by one, they planted the rough wooden memorials in the grass –  in all – each one marking a le lost to drugs. As they did so, they reflected on the good times, and lamented the waste.The last to plant his cross was Steven Currie. Steven’s older brother Peter McGrattan – known to most as Big Ped – was obsessed by music. “He was into punk when he was a boy, then U, Inspiral Carpets, Stone Roses, Oasis,” says Steven, who has the word “Brother” tattooed on his arm. “He was the man for the music, and you would follow suit because you looked up to him.” Steven would sit on the floor while Peter played DJ. “I’d tap tap my feet and think: ‘That’s quite good, that.’ His taste was superb. He could have been one of those guys that spotted bands.”But Big Ped carried a bit of weight and it affected his self-esteem. He trod that well-worn path from alcohol through soft drugs, heroin and crack cocaine, on to the grave. He died of a Valium overdose, after eight years clean, in August , dying in their mother’s house. “The paramedic came in and said: ‘He’s gone,’” Steven says. “I sat with him on the floor and cuddled him until they came and took him away.” Gone, but still loved still remembered.We are in the grip of a drugs deaths emergency here in Scotland, as everybody knows. Our drugs death rate is the worst in Europe. The toll for  was , – the highest it has ever been. It will come as little surprisethis year’s is higher still. The crosses are a reminder that each of the , was an inidual robbed of their future.En masse, they capture the scale of the problem. Spread out in rows like war graves, they say: “Here is a generation being wiped out, while those at the top play politics.” Is this too harsh  Maybe. Yet even as Steven placed his cross, the UK and Scottish governments were squabbling over rival drugs summits to be held in Glasgow a day apart. “My drugs summit is better than your drugs summit,” they blustered like children.Of course, politicians on both sides can justy their position. The UK government will say it announced its conference first. “But without consulting us, and without including those with lived experience,” the Scottish Government will counter. If either party does not understand how pathetic it sounds – how pathetic it is – for two governments who share responsibility for drugs policy to be unwilling to cut the crap and share a table, I suggest they get out of politics for a while and look at this from beyond the bubble. I suggest they spend some time in those communities where people are losing their lives for want of inter-agency collaboration and a coherent policy.This is not to suggest the Scottish Government is doing nothing. Last year – under pressure, and having previously cut frontline services – it set up the Drugs Deaths Task Force. In the recent budget it announced an extra £.m to be spent on “delivering innovative projects, testing new approaches and developing a national pathway for opiate substitute therapy”.The Scottish Government conference will also provide training in the use of Naloxone, which reverses the effect of drugs overdoses, and a demonstration model of a drugs consumption room. It insists what takes place there will “inform” its contribution to the UK summit the next day. And yet the mutual blame game neither side appears able to stop does not augur well.So often we hear about successful policy where, particularly in Portugal where drugs have been decriminalised, users have been de-stigmatised and those who consume can choose between harm reduction and rehab.But the key to Portugal’s success was not merely the approach itself, but the political consensus that formed around it and an unshakeable commitment to that approach through successive governments.Here in the UK, we are still treating drugs policy like a political football a forum for the airing of grievances a battleground for ideological dferences. This was happening long before the general election, but it is worse now the Tories have a thumping majority.The destructive relationship between Westminster and the Scottish Government – and more specically between Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson – is spilling into other areas too, most notably the COP climate conference which will take place in Glasgow in November.This conference is supposed to build the coalition necessary to break the deadlock on international climate action – and therefore requires UK-wide co-operation and a gt for diplomacy.Already, however, it has been reduced to oneupmanship. Despite being advised otherwise, Johnson has refused to give Sturgeon any formal role in proceedings. And there have been disputes over the venue itself. With the conference set to be held in the Scottish Events Campus on the north of the river, the Scottish Government booked out the Science Centre on the south. But now the UK government says it needs both sites and has accused the Scottish Government of trying to undermine its plans. To make matters worse, the Prime Minister is said to have referred to Sturgeon as “that wee Jimmy Krankie woman” to which Sturgeon responded “ Boris Johnson wants to make personal insults against me, I’m a big enough girl to make personal insults back”. All highly constructive.I think most of us accept Johnson would try the patience of a saint. As last week’s reshuffle demonstrated, he – or rather Dominic Cummings – is hell-bent on exercising control. Claire Perry claims he sacked her as the president of the COP and replaced her with former international development secretary Alok Sharma because Whitehall couldn’t cope with an independent conference. Sharma is said to have a questionable record on environment issues.Given all this, it must be tempting to answer criticism by pointing out that “Johnson started this” and that he is a twat of the highest order. But that gets us nowhere. Meanwhile, the planet burns.Aware, presumably, that tit-for-tat fighting is destructive and childish, Sturgeon has called for a reset in relations. But for that to happen, the UK government will not only have to be willing to co-operate on key issues, the Scottish Government will have to stop constantly passing the buck southwards.The constitutional debate is not going to disappear. Both governments will be arguing over the legitimacy of a second independence referendum for some time. But they need to be able to set that argument aside when it comes to shared crises such as drugs deaths and climate change.Only by attempting to find common ground can progress be made. If that requires pride to be swallowed, and teeth to be gritted, then so be it. There are too many crosses already in Springburn too many species already extinct.

We must surely, he added, be witnessing a historical record – a government in crisis after just two months in power.Meanwhile, Labour-supporting commentators lined up to explain the replacement of Javid with, as one columnist described him, the “alarmingly obedient” Rishi Sunak.I’m bound to say that for a man mired in crisis, Johnson appears remarkably relaxed. When he and his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, told Javid they wanted his team cleared out and replaced by a new staff of advisers working across both  and  Downing Street, they must have know there was a chance – a good one, at that – that the chancellor wouldn’t wear it. His decision to walk cannot have come as a shock.McDonnell’s description of a government in crisis is, I’m afraid, inaccurate. Rather, what we’re seeing is a Prime Minister fully in control. There is no crisis.In Javid’s eager beaver replacement, Johnson has precisely what he wanted: a compliant chancellor who will do what he desires.Quite why Sunak’s loyalty should be seen as “alarming”, I’m not sure. There is nothing in the rule book of politics that says the sign of a good chancellor is a willingness to defy the prime minister. Was Tony Blair’s Labour government improved by the fact chancellor Gordon Brown spent his every waking moment seething with resentment over his rival’s supremacy  No, it wasn’t, was it  In fact, briefing and counter-briefing by Number  and Treasury sources meant the fractured relationship between prime minister and chancellor frequently got in the way of smooth government. When both men would rather have seen their policy agenda make headlines, their bitter relationship became the focus of media attention.When, finally, Brown realised his ambition of becoming prime minister, he could not change his ways. A man born to plot, Brown soon began undermining his chancellor, Alistair Darling, destroying a professional and personal relationship that had endured for years.David Cameron and George Osborne entered government in  having learned from their predecessors. Relations between Downing Street and the Treasury were good for the first time in a long time.Cameron and Osborne were a team and they always understood the pecking order. Each got what he needed from the relationship.But Johnson has no such partner. The Prime Minister has no political soulmate.This being so, what, exactly is the problem with Johnson wishing to take a firm grip of the Treasury  It is, I think, the sort of thing that might look to voters like strong leadership. Few, I’d wager, now lament the passing of the Javid era.Among Johnson’s immediate priorities is solidying the Conservative vote in areas of England which once ed Labour MPs. The Prime Minister will want to deliver for areas in the Midlands and the North of England which went Tory for the first time in generations. If he does not make good on his promises of regeneration and investment then the PM risks watching those voters drt back to Labour.What Johnson needs, right now, is a chancellor who is completely on board with this agenda. But there is something  beyond the Prime Minister’s desire for a compliant chancellor at play, here. Johnson has just sent a message to every member of his parliamentary party that the rules of the game have changed. His demand is complete loyalty, nothing less.From what McDonnell describes as a crisis will, I think, spring a period of uncommon stability in government. Last year, Johnson won the parliamentary majority he craved. Now, he has stamped his authority on his party in no uncertain terms.This same message came across loudly and clearly in Johnson’s dismissal from his cabinet of former leadership contenders Andrea Leadsom and Esther McVey. Leadsom is a popular figure among members of the Tory Party’s Eurosceptic right wing. Johnson’s calculation is that he need not concern himself with the feelings of those members. Javid comes out of the last few days rather well, I think. No chancellor can complain about a demand for loyalty but the order to dismiss his team of advisers was a step too far, one provocation too many.That Javid said no to this suggests he has something about him, after all.In a statement following his resignation, the former chancellor reiterated his support for Johnson. I wonder how long this will last.It is undoubtedly the case that when political parties lose discipline, they lose elections. Look at the SNP. For decades, they did nothing but tear each other apart over the best way in which independence might be achieved. Bitter recrimination was part and parcel of SNP membership. And then Alex Salmond ed as party leader for a second stint and he laid down the bloody law to his colleagues. There was to be no briefing about colleagues, no criticism of government policy, and no public disagreement over any of the party’s positions.What followed was as period of unity in the SNP ranks that continues – the occasional domestic disturbance, aside – to this day.I’m not sure Johnson is behaving especially dferently to the way Salmond did. Doubtless, opposition parties will taunt Chancellor Rishi Sunak when he next rises to speak in the House of Commons. They will leave him in no doubt that they consider him a poodle.But each and every one of Boris Johnson’s opponents will privately admire the way he strengthened his grip on the Tory Party last week.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"it s nessie mystery skeleton washed up on scots beach leads to speculation it s loch ness monster","story":"The photos of the rotten carcass on Balmedie Beach in Aberdeen were posted on a local community Facebook page - Fubar News - after it was revealed following the powerful storm which battered the country last week.

After a spirited campaign by his opponent Michelle Ballantyne, Carlaw in the end won comfortably with a % to % share of the members’ votes cast. The party should be thankful to Ballantyne for ensuring there was a contest, not least for allowing Carlaw to now say with authority he has an unequivocal mandate to run the party. She also gave voice to concerns that have been building up over recent years about party management. Carlaw will surely want to address these rather than exacerbate them. While the candidates did their best to present themselves as dferent and thus offer a genuine choice, the reality is they had far more in common than what ided them. For the party this is a good thing as members now have to unite behind Carlaw’s leadership and turn their attention to the most important challenge facing them – defeating the SNP in the  elections.Their first goal will be to prevent the SNP having an overall majority like that won by Alex Salmond in , but then lost by Nicola Sturgeon in . Despite the appalling performance of our public services under the management of the SNP government, recent polling suggests it could yet win such a huge mandate. While possible I think it unlikely, for once the electorate begins to consider the SNP’s record in detail its failure must begin to pay idends for the opposition. Also fundamental to the debate is how the dominance of Brexit will recede, allowing more oxygen to be given to the scrutinising the performance of SNP ministers.The second goal must then be to lay the ground for a new administration that locks the SNP out of government evenSturgeon wins the most seats. An alternative minority administration that enjoys a comfort and supply arrangement would be the most likely route – as neither Labour nor the Liberal Democrats will want to even hint at a coalition, never mind formalise one. In an effort to kill-off such a prospect the SNP will seek to demonise any party offering to work with dreaded Tories – or “Tory Scum” as the infamous banner that graces nationalist marches brands over half a million Scottish voters. In response the argument has to be put that it was the Tories who provided a comfort and supply arrangement to Salmond and Sturgeon between -. If the Tories were good enough for the SNP then, why should it not be good enough for Carlaw to do the same with other partiesit’s best for the for the country It is impossible to say what role the Labour Party will play in all of these developments too much depends on how its UK leadership election works out, but there are other encouraging signs that offer hope to unionists. Yesterday Scottish Business UK, the pro-Union business group backed by hundreds of Scottish businesses and including many household names, published a new paper advocating a more positive and assertive approach by the UK government. Included in the paper Strengthening the Union: A Framework for Business Success were proposals for a UK Department of the Union which would have grant-aiding powers to assist directly initiatives that will help the UK’s cohesiveness. These might be community based or infrastructure projects – but they would clearly demonstrate and say on the tin they have been delivered by the UK.Other ideas included an Office for Budget Responsibility for the Union that would bring more transparency to encourage both accountability and value for money in public spending. Interestingly it is argued the new OBR could become a force for helping achieve UK-wide spending commitments in Scotland as well challenging them. The paper also considered issues from taxation to fisheries, cultural exchange within the UKto migration. Some may fly, others probably will not, but the fact that a business group is bringing forward positive ideas that can add value to being in the UK illustrates how the UK’s status quo is never set in stone.Indeedthere is one dference why the UK’s advocates won the independence referendum of  but the Europhiles lost that of  is the UK is evolving and decentralising by devolving power out to nations and cities – whereas the EU is taking more and more power for itself. Other unionist organisations are also stirring Scotland in Union, the largest campaign group defending the Union launched a Valentine video message last week and another offering ten reasons Scotland is stronger in the UK. That might not seem especially unusualbut the adoption of a positive rather than negative tone represents a change in approach away from the project fear of the past and, I believe, will begin to pay idends. Likewise the meetings being organised around the country by the unionist lobbying group Scotland Matters demonstrates the level of activism outside party circles is growing. True, such events are not at the levels of Yes activism, but that’s not the appropriate comparison, the point is no such activities were even being considered by unionists before the last referendum in . This time Unionists of all parties or none are mobilising in advance of the  elections to head off nationalism before any referendum.Later this weekend in Newcastle-upon-Tyne the discussion forum “These Islands” holds a two day conference to explores issues of culture and identity that are rarely given enough thought by unionists.The growth of such activities points to a more confident and less complacent approach from unionists be they large or small “U”. It shows a willingness to do grown-up politics, to have adult and reasoned debate away from the obscenities and hatred spouted at marches, worn on T-shirts and sprayed across social media that too many nationalists have descended into.All of Scotland’s pro-British parties can tap into this new wave of unionist optimism – and then maybe learn to work together.Brian Monteith is editor of ThinkScotland.org©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"independent scotland would face five year wait to rejoin eu","story":"An independent Scotland would take - years to rejoin the EU, a major new report today finds.And it warns that Scotland would effectively be forced to adopt the euro or see its influence shrink within the EU.The report, entitled The EU Blueprint Pathway for Scotland’s Accession to the European Union under Independence, was published by political scientist Anthony Salamone in Edinburgh.It urges Scotland to rejoin the Brussels bloc after a Yes vote as this would be in the countrys \"economic, social and geostrategic interests.\"Scotland will be in a \"strong position tosatisfy the political and economic dimensions\" of EU membership, the report adds.: Angus Robertson aims to become Edinburgh MSP \"Scotlands accession would not pose a challenge to the EUs integration capacity,\" it states.And although theof accession process is not defined, it would not happen immediately.\"Scotland will reasonably take - years to join the EU,\" it adds.\"The Government should adopt a target to EU accession of  years.\"In the meantime, Scotland should seek to broker an \"Association Agreement\" on issues like customs and trade.A majority of Scotsvoted to Remain in the EU in the Brexit referendum on , but the weight of votes south of the border swung the outcome in favour of Leave.Nicola Sturgeon is demanding the right to hold a fresh referendum on independence this year in response to Brexit and would seek to rejoin the EU after independence.The Scottish Government has insisted it has no plans to join the EU single currencyit becomes member state.

Mrs Child claims that after initially stating that he was working under one of the warm home schemes, prior to the work being carried Mr Crilly said he now had his own company – the Central Heating Team. February  to begin the work and fitted the staircase. February that the remaining materials would be delivered on st February and that the fitters would then finish the staircase. February in which she outlined work outstanding and issues related to the work carried out along with photographic evidence of it. She also told him that she would leave a key for the workmen to access her house as she had to go to Inverness for surgery.: “They were very happy with their job, but I went in to have a look and the staircase was dangerously on a forward tilt. There was no headroom # you actually had to duck to get in the attic space. So I brought this all to Mark’s attentionand he said #yes, I’ll get them to do something about it# – but what they did was wedge in an extra bit of wood underneath the staircase to try and put the tilt backward. It’s not fixed to the floor, there’s no banister, there’s no handrail at the top. I started looking at building regulations and there isn’t two metres clearance.”She added: “The underfloor heating was fine, no problems –but I think that is really all they are capable of doing because they weren’tjoiners.”After multiple messages asking Mr Crilly what would be doneto recty the damage Julie conducted a search through Companies House to finddetails of the Central Heating Team. She discovered that it was a limitedcompany but that it did not mention Mark Crilly at all.She spoke to one of the company’s directors, David Mastertonwho told her that Mr Crilly was merely one of their lead generators and that itwas through them the underfloor insulation had been carried out. She added thatshe was told Mr Crilly did not have the correct certication in place to undertakethe internal wall insulation. Mrs Child said that Mark Crilly emailed her in April  to say that Mr Masterton would arrange for a joiner to sort the staircase as soon as possible. In June , Julie managed to track down the joiner in question.He told her that Mr Crilly had casually mentioned that there might be work for him but nothing more. Mrs Child claims that the joiner inspected the work at her home and said he was shocked at the poor workmanship and was not interested in trying to put it right.In September , Julie employed the services of theStornoway-based firm Alex Murray Construction.She said: “I went to Alex Murray Construction and they said ‘they have cut through ceiling joists, which they haven’t reinforced, it’s dangerous – you shouldn’t be using the stairs # that all needs to come out or be strengthened.’“They sent us a quote for about £, to put it back to what it was before. They suggested that we speak to the building inspectors.”In November  Comhairle nan Eilean Siar conducted a building inspection of her home.Mrs Child said: “They said ‘your home insurance is invalid. There are major structural ceiling joists that have been chopped through without any reinforcements –you have a problem and have an assessor come in, the first thing they are going to do is come up to the attic and your insurance will be void#.”Following the building inspection, Mrs Child contacted Mr Crilly to determine who was liable, to which she claims he said he was.After sending him the quote and building report, and withher house no longer insured and vulnerable to the winter weather, she sent aletter at the start of December. This explained that the couple would give MrCrilly fourteen days to pay the quote in full otherwise they would take legalaction.She said: “He did email us and offer the deposit and money on completion but as we had already told him, the construction company would not accept that. They needed the money paid up front. He never got a valid quote for the work with them nor took it any further. All he has done is stall at every opportunity.“He has made us feel very foolish and like complete idiots.We came over here for the quiet le and we’ve no mortgage – so that we can makea few changes with our little business. There is no money in the bank to repairwhat he has done.” contacted Mr Crilly for comment, but we have not received a response."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/001WH1402NCA.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 14th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

When the family approached us, they didn’t have a grave number but informed us the grave was in City Cemetery. When we checked our records, three people had been buried in the grave at City Cemetery.“It later transpired that the correct grave which belonged to the family of the deceased was actually in Glenalina Cemetery, which is adjoining. We appreciate the immense pressure on families when arranging the burial of a loved one and apologise for any upset that was caused by Council during this dficult process.”Responding to the council’s apology, a family member insisted that council officials had earlier admitted entering the wrong coordinates for the plot, incorrectly entering the letter ‘j’ instead of ‘i’.“We totally expected Belfast City Council to turn the blame back on us,” she said.“My brother told the council that the correct grave was in the top part of the City Cemetery, officially called Glenalina, but they obviously didn’t listen.“The council should just admit that whoever keyed in the plot number got it wrong.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"familys fitting tribute to danielle","story":"THE family of a Glengormley woman who died just weeks before she was due to begin a new le-extending cystic fibrosis drug have raised over £, in her memory.Danielle McFalldied at Antrim Area Hospital in October after a week in intensive care.She was diagnosed with the disease aged just six weeks and after being diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of  she developed cirrhosis of the liver.Danielle was due to start the new drug, Orkambi, which can improve lung , after a deal was struck with US drug manufacturer Vertex.However, Danielle became ill on October , soon after the announcement was made, and died on October .In her memory, her family decided they wanted to do something and recently held a fundraiser for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust in Cltonville Golf Club.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Danielle’s mother Angela explained: “She fought long and hard all her le and we all really miss her.“We wanted to do something in her memory but had never done anything like this before.“It was a daunting task to organise something from nothing but we sat down and got sponsors who donated vouchers and prizes for a ballot.“As we got closer to the event, we worried more and more about whether it would be a success.“It was a freezing night in January and we were worried that people wouldn’t come out but thanks to a combination of hard work and incredible generosity, we raised far more money than we ever expected to.“We put on a buffet, had great music from DJ Gerry and a ballot draw.“We had vouchers for make-up salons and barbers, loads of drinks hampers, tickets to the Belfast Giants and the Game of Thrones Giant’s Causeway tour and the main prize, which was a gigantic perfume and make-up hamper from Medicare in Northcott.”Danielle’s family managed to raise an amazing £. for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and Belfast International Airport have pledged an additional £ to the total raised.“It was a really fun-filled night and as a family, we would like to thank all who helped make it possible.“We’re overwhelmed by the result and are glad that out efforts paid off as fantastically as they did.

It is the jewel in the crown of Belfast.“The Council say it is closed due to health and safety issues. Nature has caused damage with trees growing and it has really been left abandoned by the Council.“Enough is enough. We need to start now and start fixing it up.”The call has been backed by historian Joe Baker from Belfast History Project.“Clton Street is one of three ancient cemeteries in Belfast,” he explained.“It is the most unique because it didn’t belong to a church. It belonged to the old Belfast Poor House at Clton House.“It opened in , two years before United Irishmen rebellion.“For me, the most remarkable thing is the ersity of graves. It is a small graveyard but there are , people buried in it.“That is so many le stories. It is a very historic place. The largest famine grave and largest cholera grave is in there as well as the graves of famous names such as United Irishman Dr William Drennan and the McCracken’s.“I am hoping it gets re-opened so people can learn more about its history.“It is also one of the very few green areas in the district so it would be a huge asset to the local community.“The Council say about costs and health and safety but that can be addressed very easily.”The motion has been referred to next month’s People and Communities Committee to allow time for a report to be brought back by Council officers.A spokesperson for Belfast City Council said: “We can’t make any comment until that report has been discussed at the March meeting of the People and Communities Committee, a decision made and subsequently agreed by council.”"},{"url":null,"title":"derry mayor michaela boyle backs council dog fouling plans after losing sight as a child","story":"Dog walkers have been encouraged to clean up after their pets PA Wire PA Images FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDog walkers have been encouraged to clean up after their pets February   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe mayor of Derry has spoken about being blinded in one eye by dog mess as a child after backing proposals to tackle fouling in the city.

Dogs would need to kept on a leash in shared-use parks and the council is also researching the possibility of DNA testing of fouling to identy dogs. The council has undertaken a review and our Health and Communities Committee has recently looked at new powers to encourage dog owners to keep their pet on a lead, with an officer who could enforce that, said Ms Boyle. There would also be rules around dogs entering land where they#re not supposed to be.Ms Boyle, who is herself a dog owner, said there are more responsible dog owners than irresponsible ones but that the council has been forced to act. It#s not just about having dog dirt on feet or wheels of buggies or on footpaths - there are serious consequences, she said. The mayor said after she contracted toxocariasis, a potentially lethal disease carried in dog faeces, she had to undergo a number of operations to try and save her sight. I do remember being in hospital for long periods of time to save my eye and that has a lot of implications when you#re a young child at school - learning to see through one eye. Now I don#t know what it#s like to have two eyes but at the time losing the sight was a big adjustment. It affected my schoolwork because I couldn#t see the way other children did, she said. The -year-old said there has always been a stigma associated with her condition, which she first experienced while a pupil in school. I have a slight turn in my eye, when it gets tired it#s more noticeable and I would have been called all sorts of names and bullied. Back in the day I had to wear a patch and it wasn#t very nice. Sometimes children can be horrible when it comes to singling someone out. You get through it and it#s something that is thrown at you that makes you stronger.As well as dog owners, the mayor said she is calling on all members of the community to report dog fouling whenever possible. People living in communities have to report it and it#s completely confidential, you won#t face the wrath of your neighbours. We want to review what worked in the past and what hasn#t worked in other places. It is about looking at new ideas and new solutions, she said. When it comes to cleaning up after your own pets, Ms Boyle said being aware of personal hygiene and cleanliness is important. I have cats and dogs and it is about being responsible. Hygiene is a big thing, washing your hands when you#re feeding your pets and using gloves when you#re cleaning up. The council provide poop bags so there shouldn#t be any excuse not to clean up.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.RegisterAlready have an account Log in Belfast   ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadI was ‘burned’ from UUP leader’s job by unionist sectarianism – NesbittJust % in Northern Ireland would vote for unity, major study revealsEasyJet flight s to Belfast airport after passengers #smell gas#Glider service to west Belfast withdrawn after attacks Northern Ireland legend Harry Gregg to be laid to rest on Friday,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He also discussed how Unionism can benefit from embracing NI#s growing ersity. pic GBgWvKXVTC— EqualityCoalitionFebruary , Sectarianism: The Key Facts was commissioned by the Equality Coalition – an alliance of non-governmental organisations convened by the public service union Unison and human rights organisation, the Committee on the Administration of Justice.Mr Nesbitt quit as UUP leader in  after a disappointing Assembly election.Some attributed his party’s poor performance to Mr Nesbitt’s campaign pledge to transfer his second preference vote to the nationalist SDLP as he urged voters to back a middle-ground powersharing coalition.Addressing Monday’s event at Stormont, Mr Nesbitt recalled as a child being driven by his father to the hills around Belfast to watch sectarian disorder that saw Catholics and Protestants burned from their homes.“A more recent memory is a couple of years ago when I was leader of the Unionist party and I said I would give a preference vote in the  election to the SDLP and, figuratively, I was burned out of office by some rather sectarian reaction from the unionist community.“My message, completely thinking from the unionist perspective, to unionists is wake-up.”Mr Nesbitt said the old reality of a Protestant majority in Northern Ireland was gone. vw,vw,px, px\"Mike Nesbitt announces his resignation as UUP leader in  He said the region was no longer the binary Protestant or Catholic – but was instead an increasingly erse society.Mr Nesbitt, who co-sponsored the report launch at Stormont with SDLP MLA Colin McGrath, then referenced a story he had read recently about how a certain species of frog reacts when in a pot of warming water.“The characteristics of the frog isyou put it in a pan of cold water and slowly and really slowly bring the water to the boil the frog dies because it doesn’t realise that the environment around it is changing in a manner that represents an existential threat to its existence,” he said.“And I think and fear that unionism sometimes is that frog.“We need to be aware that things are changing. We need to stop disregarding the importance of human rights and we need to think about how we tackle sectarianism.”Mr Nesbitt said one of the most effective ways to tackle sectarianism would be the creation of a single education system.“If you are mixing children from the ages of three or four every day you are giving them an inoculation against sectarianism.“Andwe can tackle sectarianism we can tackle one of the most toxic legacies of our Troubles.”There is \"a long legacy of sectarian decision making\" in Northern Ireland\" - Dr Robbie McVeigh, who is launching his new research report, Sectarianism: The Key Facts, at Stormont today. He argues for the effective equality proofing of decisions going forwards. pic UhoPCwzAE— EqualityCoalitionFebruary , The -page report was penned by independent researcher Dr Robbie McVeigh.Dr McVeigh said there was a need to consider the problem in the context of Northern Ireland’s changing demographic landscape.He said the region was no longer characterised by a Protestant majority and Catholic minority and was instead a place of “three minorities” – Protestant, Catholic and increasing number who identy as neither.He said disparities between Protestants and Catholics still existed in many areas across the public sector – expressing particular concern about stalled efforts to make the PSNI more representative of the community it serves.He urged authorities in Northern Ireland to learn from an initiative undertaken by former prime minister Theresa May when she ordered an audit of all government departments to establish areas where racial disparities existed.Dr McVeigh said departments were then challenged to either explain the disparities or take action to address them. vw,vw,px, px\"Declan Kearney said sectarianism was the ‘elephant in the room’ across society in the region Stormont Junior Minister Declan Kearney also addressed the event. He insisted the executive was committed to tackling the “poison” of sectarianism.“Sectarianism remains endemic within northern society and in my view it is at the very crux of all our political, social and community isions,” he said.“Sectarianism isn’t some kind of abstract concept – it is omnipresent.“In many ways, it is our elephant in the room.”PA,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadI was ‘burned’ from UUP leader’s job by unionist sectarianism – NesbittJust % in Northern Ireland would vote for unity, major study revealsEasyJet flight s to Belfast airport after passengers #smell gas#Glider service to west Belfast withdrawn after attacks Northern Ireland legend Harry Gregg to be laid to rest on Friday,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Many of the pupils at Ballougry PS have a family link to the school and children come from as far afield as Eglinton and Donemana to be educated there.We have children whose parents, grandparents and even great grandparents have been at the school.The parents have such fond memories of their time here that they want their children to enjoy the same type of education, no matter where they are living.Mr OKane believes that attending a small primary school equips children well for the transition to secondary school.In a small school setting you have to get on well with everyone and the children thrive on it.In bigger schools you can jump around friendship groupsthings arent working out, but here you just have to work it out.We were very happy with out recent transfer test results and our children will be moving on to every post primary school in the city.”Mr OKane concluded: The feedback that we always get is that the children really do represent us well.Among the schools best known past pupils is renowned actress, Amanda Burton, well known for her television roles, including Heather Black in the Channel  soap opera Brookside, Beth Glover in Peak Practice, Sam Ryan in the BBC crime drama series Silent Witness, Clare Blake in The Commander and Karen Fisher in Waterloo Road.Her father was a headmaster at the school. googletag.cmd.push Photos: Tom Heaney   googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The entire programme of Ulster U football championship quarter finals were wiped out, including Derry’s clash.Its the second storm to hit the province within a week.Storm Ciara battered the province for the first half of last week with weather warnins for wind, snow and ice in place until last Wednesday.County Derry Post reader Ronan Higgins captured some of the snow which fell on Carn Mountain during the poor conditions.His image, captured last Wednesday morning, made Slieve Gallion look more like a an expensive ski destination. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

McGlone said the community have been making their voices heard in a series of recent meetings.He said: “Anyone in recent days who has been at the upper end of Maghera, Fairhill, Glen Road area will see what that a one-way system will cause for Maghera – traffic bedlam.“We have had numerous meetings with council officials and Cllr Martin Kearney and myself had a meeting a fortnight ago with representatives from the Department of Communities .“That meeting was attended by a number of local businesses from Upper Main St and representatives from the parish and school.“The DfC heard very clearly that this was not a good idea and I think the council and its consultants have got the message.”In a statement, Mid Ulster Council said: “The Public Realm Scheme plans are at outline design stage.“The Council is currently reviewing the design options following consultations before Christmas and hopes to bring design options forward once the reviews are completed.“NIE have installed a current temporary one-way system for a number of days on Upper Main Street Maghera to enable their improvements to the NIE infrastructure.“The temporary traffic management system is currently being monitored by Department for Infrastructurepersonnel.“For any related traffic issues, members of the public should contact NIE or DFI Roads who authorise all Street Work Permits for such work.”Despite the setback, Patsy McGlone is hopeful a revision of the proposals can deliver much-needed investment in Maghera.He said: “It was a silly idea but there are loads of opportunities for Maghera and loads of opportunities for a Public Realm Scheme, so let’s work this one through.“Let’s make sure this time that those in charge of this scheme are listening to the local community and drawing on their very positive views.“I’ll be there to support the local community in that regard.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is the height of laziness and demonstrates a total disregard for residentsShe continued: “The cost of removing this rubbish will now be passed on to the ratepayer and, as has already been well covered this week, their rates are already high enough. Why should ordinary people pay for gathering up material for which the owner refused to pay its disposal She concluded: “It is completely unacceptable to destroy a local beauty spot and ruin the environment for residents.

Creator, Tony McCourt, , said a similar Facebook page exists for the Brandywell area so he felt it was only right to set one up for Creggan.  Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between. Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want. It is my pleasure and my honour. The world is ours and we can think it into whatever we want it to be. And together, we are making it happen.

The Tobermore-born former footballer’s death was announced by the Harry Gregg Foundation on Monday and local MLA John Dallat paid tribute to the County Derry man. He said: “Harry Gregg was a selfless giant. Despite his incredible talent and success, he remained a down-to-earth gent. “He was a wonderful role model for our young people. Harry did nothing but project a positive image for our area and for that we are extremely grateful. “I wish to offer my deepest sympathy to his family.” Gregg was a survivor of the  Munich air disaster, in which  people lost their lives, where he twice ed to the burning wreckage to help both team-mates and strangers, including a -month old baby and her pregnant mother. googletag.cmd.push Just  days after the tragedy, the goalkeeper lined up in a - victory for the Red Devils over Sheffield Wednesday, in a remarkable act of courage and resilience. In his programme notes before Gregg’s belated testimonial in , Manchester United’s then-manager Sir Alex Ferguson dubbed him ‘a most reluctant hero’. The footballer had been working as a carpenter before the world of professional football beckoned, combining woodwork with spells playing for Linfield and Coleraine in the Irish league. Harry’s talent initially earned him a move to Doncaster Rovers at the age of , before Matt Busby made him the world’s most expensive keeper, bringing him across the Pennines to Old Trafford for pound,. googletag.cmd.push Bad luck with injuries meant that Gregg did not manage to pick up a medal from his time in Manchester and he transferred to Stoke before retiring at the end of the - season. He set up the Harry Gregg Foundation in order to give back to the community that raised him and was fiercely proud of his Northern Ireland roots. Perhaps his finest moment in the green jersey came months after the Munich air disaster, when he starred for his country in the  World Cup. Gregg helped Northern Ireland reach the last eight of the competition and was later named the best keeper at the tournament. He was awarded an OBE in the  New Year Honours list and leaves behind a legacy that highlights his dedication to the grassroots game. In a statement on their Facebook page, the Harry Gregg Foundation said: “It is with great sorrow that we inform of the death of Manchester United and Northern Ireland legend Harry Gregg, OBE. “Harry passed away peacefully in hospital surrounded by his loving family. “The Gregg family would like to thank the medical staff at Causeway Hospital for their wonderful dedication to Harry over his last few weeks. “To everyone who has called, visited or sent well wishes we thank you for the love and respect shown to Harry and the family.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Hoban is a top player and the more games you play you get more experience playing against him but hes a very good player and were unlucky not to come away with the win tonight.”Toal was as disappointed as anyone that the Derry defence was breached in the way it was, insisting that the visitors deserved a point at least.“I thought the boys dug in well and defended well and another day we would have come out of here with a result,” he said. “I thought the new players were brilliant, I thought every player was brilliant. Oriel is always a tough place to go but I thought the boys kept their shape brilliantly throughout the game. We know the way that Dundalk are with corners and we talked about it during the week. Its just unlucky, theres not much more you can say. I thought all the boys were excellent tonight and we just have to stay positive, thats the main thing. “We had chances too and another day we take one, but we have to stay positive because we have a big game on Friday against our rivals Finn Harps.”DesperateToal, like his manager and the City fans, is desperate to end the winless run against Dundalk, but on this occasion that recent frustration continued with yet another narrow defeat to the champions.“Every man gave everything and you cant fault the commitment,” Toal continued. “Thats the way it is here. The boys were brilliant and unfortunately we didnt get that luck. Maybewe had got one of those nicks in the box going our way it would have been good but on another night they go in and we just have to deal with the defeat. We dont accept defeats but at the end of the day there are a lot more games left so we just have to stay positive.”It is now onto the first home game of the season against Finn Harps with Toal hoping that he and his team mates can get off the mark for the new season. “We definitely want to get the first win for the fans,” he said. “The Brandywell is our home pitch. Were not going to dwell on this defeat,. Were looking to the game on Friday and were going to take each game as it comes and hopefully we can stay positive and get the win on Friday. “Harps is always going to be a tough game because of the rivalry between the two clubs but they will definitely be good so we just have to be on our game and hopefully we can get the three points.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

That is the view of manager Declan Devine who expects his players to bounce back against Finn Harps this weekend.Last season, the Candystripes lost nine league games in all, but each time hit back with a positive result, picking up six wins and three draws. Devine is hoping to continue that trend this year, starting with the first home game of the season against Harps at the Brandywell.“Well not be judged on coming away to Dundalk,” he insisted. “Weve got to make sure we win our next game. Last year we didnt lose two in the spin and weve got to make sure we dont do it again this year.“The players will be grand. The derby game will take care of itself. We have a brilliant bunch of lads and we have a brilliant backroom staff and the secret now is to make sure that we dont lose two games on a spin this year. “Its key that we do that. It doesnt matter who youre playing, you have to make sure thatyou lose a game you get back on the horse and you make sure you dont lose the next one.”Of the many positives coming from the game at Oriel Park, the performance of the City defenders was one that particularly impressed Devine.Danny Lapanu is  years of age and is a fantastic player,” he agreed. “Eoin Toal is turning  this weekend and is a fantastic player, He was outstanding. “Eoin Toal has been coming here and playing against Pat Hoban since he was . This was the first night I really seen him man up against Hoban. Hes played well against Hoban in the past but Eoin Toal was excellent.Imagine what Danny Lupano will be like two years down the line. Hes a beast of a boy, hes a great lad. He gets forward and defends. He was playing against one of the best players in the league and hasnt put a foot wrong.” googletag.cmd.push GuttedDefeat in the opening game was not on the cards for Devine, but the City boss is not going to mull over the loss for too long.Were absolutely gutted but I want to sit back and reflect over the weekend and we will want to take a lot of positives out of this,” he continued.I think we have good players, players who firstly wanted to come to our football club and secondly wanted to improve and thats the key. “Its the first game of the season. Theres  games to go and weve got to make sure every game takes care of itself. If we keep getting the same application, the same buy-in and the same desire then we will be alright.”It is now  games since City enjoyed victory at Oriel Park, but despite more frustration against the champions, Devine sees continued progress.Its not that long ago every time Dundalk played Derry they were hitting four or five,” he said. “When they came off the pitch they knew they got a right good game. We had a couple of half chances towards the end to sneak an equaliser but Im delighted with the signings weve brought to the club. Theres a lot of disappointed people in the changing room and that shows how far weve come, in such a short period of time. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

As a result, innovative ways will have to be found to include the building in the new retail scheme which could also include new housing.There are also some who believe that a multi-storey car park mdash with retail outlets on the ground floor mdash should be considered in the new development and built on top of the existing Irish Street car park footprint.Local council officials say that they are committed to working with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the Irish Street site.They hope that working alongside local people on the redevelopment proposal will provide consultants charged with coming up with a design on the way forward with an understanding of what residents and traders would like to see and what would work at this particular site.The development brief for the town centre location is expected to outline what all those involved in the process would like to see happen in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Leading High Street brands including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have expressed an interest in the Irish Street location which is the last large scale development site remaining in Downpatrick town centre.It is over two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative, with local council officials confirming recently that ious pockets of land which make-up the Irish Street site have now been purchased.Downpatrick councillor Oonagh Hanlon has welcomed confirmation that a so-called soft market testing exercise is to proceed shortly.ldquoThis will allow potential developers and interested parties an opportunity to visit the Irish Street site during a planned open day. This will allow them to give their views on the potential of the site and point out any likely constraints within any proposed project, she explained.Cllr Hanlon added: ldquoThe feedback provided will be used to assist the Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council to prepare a development brief for the site.ldquoThe regeneration project for the former police base site provides an opportunity to regenerate Downpatrick town centre.

But I am committed to working to find solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives across Northern Ireland.ldquoI will be assessing the pressures across my department reflecting on my priorities, the commitments in the lsquoNew Decade: New Approachrsquo document and the budget made available for the period ahead.Ms Mallon said that as a result, it is therefore ldquotoo early to comment on specic schemes such as the Ballynahinch bypass.Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the by-pass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.During last weekrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, there was across-the-board political support for a motion seeking a meeting with Ms Mallon and seniors roads engineers to discuss the Ballynahinch scheme.It was tabled by Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who is keen to see work starting on the near two-mile scheme to link the Newcastle and Saintfield roads.He said the scheme has been shovel ready for some time and is hoping the Department for Infrastructure will allocate funding to allow construction work, which is expected to take in excess of  months to complete, to begin.Cllr Walker argued that the Newry, Mourne and Down area has missed out on signicant roads funding for decades, with many major schemes constructed in other parts of the Province.He added: ldquoThe time has come for this council to demand its fair share of infrastructure funding. I have been a councillor for over  years and the bypass issue has been raised during every one of them.Slieve Croob councillor Cathy Mason described Ballynahinch as the ldquogateway to the wider South Down area through which all traffic must pass, including HGVs. She said this not only frustrates drivers who are part of the through traffic, but increases tension and danger for those living, shopping and working in the town.Cllr Mason said that housing is also being permitted up to the line of the planned new road and includes the potential for a park and ride site.She added: ldquoThe bypass has been proposed since the s and for decades local community and political representatives from all parties have demanded this new road. The new infrastructure minister must signal the start of work on the multi-million pound road scheme.Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess is also keen to see work on the bypass get underway and hopes that Ms Mallon will also formally sign off the scheme to upgrade the final section of the A between Doranrsquos Rock and Rowallane Garden in Saintfield.He said: ldquoThe bypass is critically important to the social and economic regeneration of not only Ballynahinch, but the wider South Down area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12th February 2020 New Queens.jpg","title":"New queens of Ulster  ","story":"ST Maryrsquos High School, Downpatrick, lted the prestigious Erne Cup for the first time at the Mid Ulster Sports Arena, Cookstown, last Wednesday afternoon with a blistering display of attacking football.Victory was no more than the local girls deserved when they gained revenge for last seasonrsquos heartbreaking cup final defeat to the same opposition.St Maryrsquos started the game strongly and turned their possession into scores with an early goal from Saulrsquos Cara Doran settling the nerves.The Enniskillen girls were simply not allowed to play their vaunted expansive game and Katie Convie raced in almost immediately to make it - to - when she capitalised on a poor kick-out.St Fanchearsquos had no intention of giving up their title without a fight and replied with three consecutive points.

Local authority officials hope that work on the much-needed project can start within four years.News of the new leisure centre plan, exclusively revealed in the Recorder last October, is being discussed by senior council officials and local politicians and recently topped the agenda during a special workshop examining the way forward.Among the proposals being examined are building a new complex at the rear of the current Newcastle Centre, which enjoys protected status. This would also result in the current outdoor Tropicana swimming pool being bulldozed.Local politicians were recently presented with an update on progress on a new leisure proposal, with council officials confirming this week that a review of ious feasibility studies and their findings is being considered by the organisation.While the local authority said that it is not yet in a position to confirm any plans or timelines in relation to the Newcastle Centre or indeed the Tropicana, it insists any new-build will not encroach on the promenade at the rear.Most signicantly, the council has confirmed that any commissioning of a full economic appraisal and business case would involve consultations, including public meetings, as part of the process.Council officials say that they are ldquoacutely aware of the need for improved leisure provision in Newcastle and are keen to address criticism that on wet days in the resort, there is little provision for both residents and tourists.While redeveloping the existing Newcastle Centre, which forms part of the Annesley Buildings, is one option moving forward, there are suggestions that given the age of the building, the scale of the work involved an the constraints of the site, a new-build at the rear would be more most cost-effective.One of the key issues the council will have to address is how it intends to replace the Tropicana , as widely expected, it will be bulldozed. There are those pushing for an indoor water facility which would be available all year round.Council officials are also keen to ensure that the redevelopment of the Main Street site is in keeping with a part of the resort where millions of pounds have been invested over recent years. Serious consideration will also have to be given to on-site car parking, included adequate disabled provision.In addition, council officials say that they recognise that as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor leisure facility which has been its Achilles heel for some considerable time.Two sites were previously identied for a new leisure centre in the resort, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive.

There are many who believe that the EU is the ten horned beast mentioned in the Book of Revelations, and there is certainly enough symbolism connecting it with Babylon to cause those who aren’t convinced to at least suspend judgement.

God doesn’t feature in the EU constitution, and most of the EU’s fanatical supporters are attracted to what they perceive to be a materialistic cornucopia.But where does England go from here  There is no point in escaping from the frying pan just to land in the fire. The English speaking world, to which Brexiters assume we will now be setting our sights, is in no better a moral shape than that of the EU itself. The form of worship that dominates today in the USA and the British Dominions takes the form of idolising the things that God hates. We are living in an era where presumptive sin is gloried.Let’s consider where England has reached today since it first bent the knee to Moloch in . Recently a policeman in the East of England walked into a place of work and confronted an employee in the presence of his workmates. The policeman calmly announced to the employee that he is not being charged with any crime, but that he has committed a “non-crime” which will be reported as a “hate-incident”, and that the matter will be recorded. The hate speech in question was never fully spelled out in the media, but it seems to have amounted to mocking the things that satan likes.What of course made the story even more interesting was the fact that a brave judge condemned the action of the police and informed us that we have never lived in an Orwellian society. Maybe not, but we would appear to be on the verge of it. The trial runs are certainly at an advanced stage. And it as yet remains to be seen whether or not Mr Justice Knowles himself gets a visit from the Thought Police to be relieved of his job. So with half of England eager to crawl back into the clutches of the ten horned beast again, what of the other half  What is their vision of England’s future  They were very keen to get out of the EU, so keen in fact, that they were quite happy to surrender to Irish republicanism and leave Northern Ireland behind. There wasn’t a single dissenting ‘Conservative and Unionist’ MP who stood up for the Union when it came to the crunch  This paints a picture of a selfish spirit, and this doesn’t inspire us to believe that England’s future will be bright.How do English Brexiters expect an independent Great Britain to thrive when it is morally bankrupt  God only supports nations where the people keep his laws, and there is no sign at all of ato the Christian morality that was the backbone of European civilisation for centuries. We are witnessing a nation that has no qualms about sacricing her own people in order to make things easy for themselves. It’s a nation which has sold out to satan, and unless it changes its ways, its destination will be akin to how things ended a few thousand years ago down at the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah.FD Tombe, Belfast BT"},{"url":null,"title":"brave harry gregg won right be called true football legend ","story":"Michelle ONeill asks Sinn Fein members to be very vigilant after police warn the so-called New IRA, plan to attack a Sinn Féin member using an under car explosive deviceUPDATE: PSNI reinforce phone scam warning to NI residents - public asked to HANG UPNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensNewsPeopleBrave Harry Gregg won the right to be called a true football legendHarry Gregg!

Ryan explained how a friendship forged in football gave birth to what is believed to be the only dedicated retro football shop in Northern Ireland.He said: “Pete and I are both Bangor fans – that’s a real labour of love – but we didn’t know each other until we met through work. We worked together for years in Yell where we pretty much talked about football non-stop.A Linfield shirt from  “The idea to start selling shirts online came after I’d been over to watch the Frampton fightand I went to the Classic Football Shirts Shop in Manchester. It’s  times bigger than the shop we have here.“I was with my fiancee at the time, now my we, and I said to her I’m going to try and do something like this online. I know how to do marketing, I love football, social media is easy enough when you know what you’re doing so I thought, I’ll give it a go. She didn’t object so that was a good start.“I started doing the shirts online last December. I got a bit of traction so I applied for a stall at St George’s in December and again in August.“I was getting married in July so I probably should have only been concentrating on that and nothing , but then I found out this unit in Smithfield was available. The Northern Ireland Subbeteo print is the top seller“Just before I was getting married – I think it was only a couple of days – I signed for the unit. Just before we got married I had to break the news to my we that I now owned a shop.“Around that time I spoke to Pete about coming on board. He said, ‘you don’t know what you’re doing, I don’t know what I’m doing, let’s see what we can do together’.”Askedthe dynamic changes when something you love becomes your job, Pete said: “I could never see us getting bored of it, I think I’ll forever be in that bubble, it’s something I love. “People work in office jobs and talk about football all day, that’s what we were like. Now we’ve got a set up where we can talk about football to whoever comes in and it’s part of the job.”Some of retro kit coasters for saleRyan commented: “On the business side of things we’re talking to clubs, striking up partnerships with other companies. Everything revolves around a love of football.”Pete said: “It’s good getting into the business side of it. There’s a buzz that comes from speaking to commercial managers of football clubs, trying to strike up partnerships.“It’s really easy to speak to people over here, quite a few clubs have heard of us.”He continued: “We’ve four clubs from the Irish League we’re in partnership with – Portadown, Linfield, Glentoran and Cltonville – and we’re branching across into England too.”At the moment the NI Classic Shirt Co is a part time venture, with the shop open on Thursday afternoonsand Fridays and Saturdays from . to .pm.Pete said: “We’re hoping to get full time. We’re going after clubs in England, Scotland and the League of Ireland as well as more local clubs. If they put in orders of a lot of units that can allow us to get a regular income and go full time.The interior of the shop in Smithfield market“We want to do as much Irish League stuff as we can with every club, that’s including the Championship. It would be great to get everyone on board. We’ve got a concept that can work with any club in the world.”Some of the shop’s best selling items are art prints of Subbuteo players from the Irish League or national team in kits from the eras in which they played. Another popular line sees a selection of classic kits displayed on coasters, mugs, T-shirts and art prints.And for those who like memorabilia they can wear the shop has a great range of old shirts, some match-worn.The strike partners leading the retro football revolution in Northern Ireland talked about some of their key team mates in their bid to climb the commercial ladder.Ryan said: “Tom Woodsdoes the Subbuteo prints. I approached him way back in the summer. I saw what he was doing with teams all over the UK. I commissioned him to do the Northern Ireland one which is a fantastic seller for us. “It’s kits from ious eras worn by  of the best ever players – there’s nothing like this available anywhere .“For the Subbuteo designs the club sends us photos of the players, we send them onto Tom and he works his magic. “We’ve also got him to do some Irish Leagues teams that we’ve teamed up with.” Pete continued: “With Hally Designs, they produce artwork featuring classic kits and you can turn them into prints or coasters or mugs or T-shirts. “They also do art prints of classic moments like when we beat England -. “We persuaded them to branch into the Irish League.”Ryan said: “There’s always new ideas out there, new brands to team up with.”In one of the framed prints by Hally Designs I spot the dubious yellow Broomhill kit which Glenavon wore in . It’s a kit I still own, but can’t recall wearing this side of the millennium.“Some of the worst kits are the best loved,” commented Ryan. “Some of them are an acquired taste. The fans love the Cltonville Kit Kat kit, we keep selling out of that on the coasters.”As well as the bespoke printed items, the shop is home to an array of old football programmes and some rare football shirts.Pete, an Arsenal fan, is particularly proud the shop has recently acquired the club’s yellow and blue ‘bruised banana’ away kit from - as well as a ‘Bergkamp ’ Holland shirt from .He said: “Bergkamp was the top man for me. It’ll pain me to sell those shirts but that’s how a business works.”Ryan said: “When I say we get shirts from all over the world I’m not trying to be vague, they genuinely come from all over the world. “There’s a Linfield top in there I got from Hong Kong. We’ve worked with collectors in Thailand, we’ve got stuff from America. “We get stuff locally as well, for example we sold a ‘ Red Star Belgrade top that had belonged to a guy who lived just outside Belfast. It was bought by someone in Miami, Florida. That shirt has done some miles.“There’s a Rangers match-worn Alex Cleland in there with number two on the back. It came from a collector in Asia.“We do get requests from people looking for specic shirts. There’s a network of collectors you can put a message out to and see what people have.”Of the resurgence in the Irish League that has helped boost the sales of memorabilia, Pete said: “We’re finding a lot of people are coming back to Glentoran and there’s been a big cash injection at Larne. “Some matches are on BBC, some on Sky Sports. You are getting good crowds again, it’s coming back.“Just last week we sold a the Glentoran home kit from - by auction for £. I reckon it would have cost about £ to £ at the time.“The Irish League is our bread and butter, but we want to branch out into the lower leagues in England and Scotland. “We’d especially love to get our own club Bangor on board. There’s a big fanbase still there.”Ryan said: “We’ve spoken to a few Irish League players on Twitter – we’ve got feedback from Joe Gormley and Liam Boyce, they both like their versions on the Cltonville Subbuteo print.”Ryan continued: “We don’t come from a retail background, we’re just football fans.“Initially I was just emailing every address I could find, pitching to them and explaining what I was trying to do. Now we’re speaking to clubs on the phone.“Obviously George Best put Northern Ireland on the map but recently with us doing well in the Euros people are paying attention outside of here.”While the online shop is rising in prominence the lads are trying to spread the word that they have a physical shop in Smithfield as well. “So many people come in to the shop and say they didn’t know we were here,” said Ryan. “Now they’re coming once a month to see what new things we’ve got in. Word of mouth for us is massive, customers telling their friends.“In most sports shops in Northern Ireland you can only get the most recent kits from the main Premier League, European and Scottish teams.

I started the week as usual by walking Isaac to school, enjoying a father-son chat about the day ahead. has seen a rocky start with wildfires ravaging through Australia and tensions rising in the Middle East but this cannot set the tone for what is to come.As someone who has family in Australia, I am truly appalled to see the spread and devastation of the fires, but also the initial response from senior Australian politicians.Their denial of the link between the climate emergency which we face globally and the disaster which has swept across their nation is completely incomprehensible.Moving forward we must accept that we are in a state of emergency and must take drastic action to limit as much of the impact as practicably possible.We certainly have an interesting year,not decade ahead. The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His second vegan recipe book, Dirty Vegan: Another Bite, was released last month alongside a tie-in BBC cookery programme.Last Friday, Matt Pritchard visited the Penarth Pier Pavilion to discuss his latest culinary enterprise and prepare a vegan dish with Mel Grfin of Grfin Books.Pritchard has not lost his mad-dash style and performative vigour. He relished his new role as he prepared for the talk: ldquoI enjoy it, man. Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great. It was just  years of mayhem.ldquoWe were getting paid to travel around the world.

In , the BBC aired the first series of Dirty Vegan.ldquoIf yoursquod told me  years ago that Irsquod be sitting here with you now and talking about vegan cooking books, I would I have laughed in your face, he said.Pritchard said that he was forced to leave Twitter last year because of abuse from online trolls and members of the Welsh farming community.Why were people so hostile ldquoBecause of guilt. Anger does it. Cognitive dissonance. Theyrsquore too lazy to change or they donrsquot want to believe it.ldquoBut the evidence is there. What I care about is the evidence and the animals.\"I donrsquot want to kill something that doesnrsquot want to be killed. If you eat steak, how can you say you care for all animals In his characteristic salt-of-the earth way, Pritchard hopes to entertain audiences with his new series whilst gently educating them about the benefits of vegan cooking.ldquoYou know, therersquos   arguing about Brexit. Therersquos   arguing about meat and veganism.ldquoWersquore all arguing amongst ourselves like lunatics. This show is just there for people to enjoy. ldquoTherersquos a bit of fun in it.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win. Keir fits the bill. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Assembly should not ignore the issue this time around.Responding to public concerns about the new plans, a spokesman for the Welsh Government said: ldquoIf EDF Energy submits a formal application, Natural Resources Wales will carry out a thorough assessment of the proposed activity before making a determination, having regard to the need to protect the environment and human health, as required by the Marine and Coastal Access Act .ldquoI know many constituents are very worried, said Stephen Doughty MP for Cardf South and Penarth.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be a dumping ground for others, and I will continue to raise concerns on behalf of residents and report back any information I receive.To comment on the proposed sample plan, visit NRWrsquos consultation page before Wednesday, March  at: naturalresources.wales permits-and-permissions permit-applications-consultations-and-decisions current-consultations-marine-licence-applicantions hinkley-point-c-sediment-sampling-plan-sp  langen article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

She said: ldquoIt has been a privilege to be headteacher of Dinas Powys Primary for so long.ldquoEvery day is dferent, bringing its own rewards and challenges.ldquoI have witnessed the great success of our pupils and now have the wonderful experience of over  children of our past pupils attending our school.ldquoThe whole team of staff ensures the best possible opportunities are provided for all our lovely children.ldquoIt is dficult to choose a single highlight. I enjoy it all ndash from meeting the parents and their child on admission, to organising the annual budget and ensuring the school is well resourced and maintained.The school recently renewed its green status under the Welsh Governmentrsquos coloured banding system which recognises its high performance.The New Curriculum for Wales, which will be implemented in , has already been fully embraced by the school.Staff have been trained in co-operative learning and emphasis has been placed on active participation in class.The school prioritises the health and wellbeing of its students.Mrs Thompson said: ldquoThe school has a recognised ethos of warmth, care, and love with an inidual approach to all pupils and their families which ensures that children feel secure and make the best academic and social progress throughout their school le.In January, the school was invited to become a flagship school as part of the Jigsaw programme, a mindful approach to personal and social education.This is further supported by the schoolrsquos Values Programme which promotes values such as honesty through books, lessons and visiting speakers.There are also several wellbeing groups which support the childrenrsquos needs.As part of its movement towards the New Curriculum, the school developed a new project this year, CF: Our Local Area and Beyond.This encouraged children to explore their local community and express what they liked about it.As part of the CF project, Year  visited Peter Alan and are currently undertaking drawing work to be displayed in the estate agentrsquos window.Year  were invited to the opening of the play park in the Edenstone Woodlands housing development where each student planted a flower bulb as part of the CF project.The school received pound from Studio Response for their participation.As anyone who visits the school will know, books are highly valued. Mrs Thompson is personally committed to creating a culture of enthusiasm for reading and said that she enjoyed seeing children becoming readers and getting ldquohooked on books.ldquoTo be able to read opens all education to our children, she continued.ldquoResearch is forever reporting that a child who is read to or who reads for pleasure will become a success.The schoolrsquos library holds an extensive collection of literature and each term a portion of the school budget is allocated for the purchase of books.On World Book Day, the owner of Grfin Books, Mel Grfin, will bring a pop-up book shop to Dinas Powys Primary where children can buy a book for pound.The school also participates in eCalm in collaboration with Dinas Powys Library, meaning that every child is a member.The school has its own student council, Pupil Voice, which is active on both sites.The Eco Committee recently introduced an Eco Bear to encourage all pupils to be eco-friendly and this year the school had its Platinum Status renewed by Eco Schools.The school has invested heavily in Lego resources and iPads and has received grant funding from Dow Corning supporting this investment in promoting science, technology, engineering, and mathematics .As part of its commitment to the importance of STEM, the school participates in the National Primary Maths Challenge.Two students from Dinas Powys Primary have reached the Bonus Round in this yearrsquos challenge.The school has achieved the Cymraeg Campus Bronze Award Charter that commends its commitment to the Welsh language and culture.Strong links with outside agencies include CAVMS music tuition and JAFFA Club.Last November, students from Dinas Powys Primary School performed Shakespearersquos The Tempest at The Riverfront Theatre, Newport, as part of the Shakespeare Schools Foundation.They also sang at St Davidrsquos Hall with the Cardf and Vale Christmas Showcase Cluster Choir in December.The schoolrsquos two dance squads will shortly be performing at Barry Memorial Hall for Best Foot Forward on Wednesday, March .For more information on the school, visit dinaspowysps article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay.

The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce.

Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
