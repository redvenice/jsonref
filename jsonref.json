[{"url":null,"title":"Band actors launch quest buy J R R Tolkiens 4 5m former Oxfordshire home","story":"Share this article In 1947, with their children now grown, Tolkien and his wife Edith left 20 Northmoor Road for the Oxford suburb of Headington before heading to Bournemouth in 1959 after the author\u0027s retirement The house was later bought by a private buyer in 2004 for more than £1.5million and is now adorned with a blue plaque which reads: \u0027J.R.R. Tolkien, Author of Lord Of The Rings, Lived here 1930-1947.\u0027    It was given Grade II-listed status on the basis of Professor Tolkien\u0027s importance despite having no particular architectural qualities. Last year, Oxfordshire estate agents Breckon and Breckon said it was \u0027situated on a generous plot within a leafy central north Oxford suburb\u0027 and described the property as \u0027substantial\u0027.      On Wednesday, Sir Ian and a host of celebrities shared their support for the initiative by releasing a fundraising video to mark the launch of the project. In their appeal they said: \u0027In 1930 a family moved to 20 Northmore road, a big house in the university city of Oxford, England. \u0027The young father entertained his children with his stories about a hobbit called Bilbo Baggins and Bilbo went on a quest to the lonely mountain in the company of a wizard.\u0027The young man was J.R.R. Tolkien and in the 30s he wrote The Hobbit and by 1939 England was once again at war.\u0027The shadow of that war and the earlier one in which Tolkien had himself fought would stretch across the pages of The Lord of the Rings from the shire to the marshes but ultimately good would triumph and peace return both to Middle-earth and the world of 1945.\u0027They added: \u0027Tolkien\u0027s world has been the inspiration for many artists, writers and filmmakers  but so far there has been no specific place dedicated to the appreciation of Tolkien\u0027s life until now.\u0027For the first time in many years the Tolkien house is up for sale. We many never have an opportunity like this in our lifetimes to convert the home and grounds into that little haven of beauty and creativity that Tolkien would have recognised and that included restoring the garden that he loved so much.\u0027Sir Ian later took to Twitter to write: \u0027Unlike other writers of his stature, there is no centre devoted to J.R.R. Tolkien anywhere in the world.\u0027The hobbit hole at the end of the garden maybe? Spaces for quiet and reflection like Rivendell. This is our vision at project Northmoor, a charity set up to purchase the house and then go on to set up the centre.\u0027 While Ms Golding added: \u0027It is with great joy I announce along with and many others the campaign to #SaveTolkiensHome! Watch the video and please donate to create the first world centre for Tolkien in his old home. #SaveTolkiensHome.\u0027Alongside setting up a permanent residence for his literary work, the project aims to include an online presence inside the house in order for writers and artists to take programme without having to leave their homes. Last month it was revealed that a previously unpublished anthology of work by the iconic author would be released next summer.The collection of essays on topics ranging from Elvish reincarnation to which characters had beards will be called The Nature of Middleearth. The British author, who wrote the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, continued to explore his fantasy setting of Middle-earth until his death in 1973. His estate has authorised the new book, which is to be published by HarperCollins in June, The Times reports.  HarperCollins\u0027 deputy publishing director Chris Smith added: \u0027It offers readers a chance to peer over Professor Tolkien\u0027s shoulder at the very moment of discovery: and on every page, Middle-earth is once again brought to extraordinary life\u0027. The writings will be edited by Nasa computer engineer and Tolkien expert Carl F Hostetter. He previously worked with Tolkien\u0027s son Christopher on editing his father\u0027s writings, until Christopher\u0027s death earlier this year. To donate or for more information: www.projectnorthmoor.org                    "},{"url":null,"title":"Why UK approved Pfizer vaccine Europe","story":"Share this article Dr Fauci telling CBS News: \u0027I love the Brits, they\u0027re great, they\u0027re good scientists, but they just took the data from the Pfizer company and instead of scrutinizing it really, really carefully, they said: \u0027\u0027OK, let\u0027s approve it, that\u0027s it.\u0027\u0027 And they went with it\u0027.His accusation was denied by the MRHA today, with a spokesman saying it \u0027rigorously assessed the data in the shortest time possible, without compromising the thoroughness of our review\u0027.Gavin Williamson mocked Europe and the United States this morning as he insisted that Britain beat them to rolling out a coronavirus vaccine because it was simply \u0027a much better country\u0027.In response European Commission spokesman Eric Mamer said \u0027we are definitely not in the game of comparing regulators across countries\u0027, adding: \u0027This is not a football competition, we are talking about the life and health of people.\u0027 Explaining the differences in approval processes between the UK and US, Professor Evans said: \u0027The processes carried out by the FDA and the MHRA are basically very similar.\u0027The only major difference is that the FDA may reproduce all the tables submitted by a company by re-analysing the data. \u0027This has been a notable difference between the FDA and other regulatory authorities around the world. Virtually no other regulator will regularly reanalyse from raw data to verify the analysis carried out by a company. We do not know how often there are substantive differences between an FDA analysis and a company analysis. \u0027We may well see differences in interpretation of the data between a regulator and a company, but this type of difference is regularly seen by all regulators, whether they reanalyse the data or not.\u0027It is very clear that the UK assessment of this has followed all the usual processes, but has been working incredibly long hours and seven days a week both with MHRA staff and with their academic advisors for quite a long time on initial and interim data before the final data were submitted. \u0027It is entirely possible that had this pandemic occurred in a year’s time when the MHRA was fully or more than fully occupied with work for the UK, then the speed with which they would have been able to authorise a new vaccine would have been longer than others rather than shorter. \u0027It will be important to have some evidence that the UK assessment process was deficient in some regard and I think that is very unlikely. In my judgement the assessment of this new vaccine will have been done more rigorously currently then a routine assessment in a non-pandemic situation. \u0027There is a spotlight on this whole process and if it were to be the case that a problem appears with the vaccine that had been missed by the MHRA and its advisors, then their reputation would be damaged very severely so the incentive to get it right now is very high. It is easy to say the speed means not careful, but it is also possible to understand other reasons for the speed than lack of care."},{"url":null,"title":"Grandfather 68 turns WWII bomb shelter BAR","story":"Grandad finds World War II air raid shelter hidden under his lawn after 40 years"},{"url":null,"title":"New mother 35 barred entering Makro store breaching social distancing rules","story":"Share this article \u0027But when we came out of lockdown again, and we could partially open as a gym, we thought let\u0027s do another deep clean so went to Makro again.\u0027But they stopped me at the door again and said you can\u0027t come in with a baby.

If Johnson wants to keep up and build global momentum for the clean energy transition, he must cancel the next round of oil and gas licensing, end all future exploration and ditch the legal requirement to extract as much as possible from the North Sea basin.”The IPPR thinktank called on the UK and Scottish governments earlier this week to phase out oil and gas production through a series of declining five-year targets, and scrap a controversial policy that calls on North Sea companies to extract as much oil and gas as they can from the ageing basin.Deirdre Michie, the chief executive of Oil and Gas UK, told the  that a hard deadline on oil and gas production – similar to the ban on the sale of new fossil fuel vehicles from 2030 – would be a “blunt instrument” that could lead to “unintended consequences” for investment and thousands of jobs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b62cbf6758b3fcb0ba3efdc925ac111db04cd0d/331_237_2230_1339/master/2230.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=135be9f3edf46af503250d65bea0ce82","title":"10 of the best food markets in sweden anyone for smoked moose meat or cloudberry doughnuts","story":"A deli in Lapland and a trendy Gothenburg hangout are two perfect places to trawl for Swedish delicacies … but they’re just a taste of things to come for epicureans on a mouth-watering Scandi adventure• New national restrictions apply from 5 November, please consult government advice before planning to travel1. Teatern, StockholmShopping centres and gourmet cuisine rarely coincide, but Teatern’s amphitheatre-shaped food court – inside the Ringen mall of trendy Södermalm district – proves a happy exception. Happy, and affordable: the nine restaurants here see A-list chefs serving twists on “fast food” at deliberately low prices. A veggie samosa, for example, costs around £7.50. Pizza, ramen and veal kebabs might be among the alternatives while one long-term resident is K-märkt’s Daniel Roos, the pastry guru entrusted with dreaming up Crown Princess Victoria’s wedding cake, which stood 3.3m high.2. Saluhallen, GothenburgSweden’s second city is commonly lauded as its culinary capital. And at Saluhallen, Gothenburg’s biggest indoor market hall, not far from the Vallgraven Canal, gastronomes can trawl 40-odd shops for everything from hot cinnamon rolls to semi-hard herrgård cheese. Some delicacies are domestic, others imported. Among the restaurant options is the Parisian bistro-style bar Salut, where each week on Oyster Wednesday you can sup a glass of cava for 75 krona (£7), to wash down oysters at 20 krona (£1.75) each.4. Hemmagastronomi, LuleåThe gateway to Swedish Lapland and many northern lights hunts, Luleå is an easy-going university city whose food scene has restaurateurs making creative use of such local Sami ingredients as reindeer meat and Arctic char. You’ll find a similar larder in red-painted Hemmagastronomi, a large deli, bakery and bar, which doubles as Luleå’s unofficial food market. Purchase chocolate truffles, cold-pressed olive oil or coffee, then sit down to topside of reindeer with a parsley root purée or, if you just want a sweet hit, a cloudberry doughnut or two.5. Östermalms Saluhall, StockholmHaving adorned the capital’s classy Östermalm district for 125 years, this elegant glass and red-brick landmark reopened in 2020 after a renovation that reinstated its original, star-shaped layout. Across three floors, the counters of some 20 long-standing family businesses display fresh seafood, cured meats, cheeses, praline-piped chocolates and breads. There are a few restaurants and wine bars, too, at which to pause look out for Mesh where wraps and “healthy plates”, bursting with freshness, each cost about £10.6. Höganäs SaluhallThe saluhall at Höganäs, in the far south, may be off the beaten track but it is a sight to behold – stalls overflowing with a colourful array of fresh fruit and veg, displays of irresistible Swedish pastries that smell ine, and then there are the breads and the deli … if you’re after a picnic, the meats and cheeses from local producers will certainly hit the spot. Ready for a sit down after all that browsing? Head to the cafe or, if you’re really peckish, the restaurant where you can choose from dishes such as salted ham with root mash and mustard sauce, almond-breaded fish with brown butter, and basil-baked chicken, all keenly priced at 111kr (about £10).7. Saluhallen Slakteriet, VästeråsJust outside Västerås, an under-the-radar city by Lake Mälaren, Saluhallen Slakteriet represents a much happier chapter for what used to be a slaughterhouse. In 2013, the premises received a top-to-tail makeover and now youthful visitors flock to gobble down poke bowls, fried wonton knots, mango cheesecakes or other flavoursome offerings. If, on the other hand, you’re on a hunt for local produce, make a beeline for Veggoköket, a vegetarian restaurant that prides itself on sourcing ingredients locally, and which bakes its own breads and cakes. Its hard-to-resist dishes include bean salad with roasted mushrooms and Jerusalem artichoke, home-baked focaccia with pesto, cheese and sun-dried tomato, and lasagne served with herb pesto.Across the market as a whole, there are lots of open spaces between the stalls in which to sit and eat, and food trucks park up outside. Lunch is typically the busiest time, and it’s worth noting that the whole place is closed on Sundays and Mondays.8. Möllevångstorget, MalmöMalmö is known as Sweden’s most multicultural city, and few districts demonstrate that better than Möllevången and its near-namesake market. Open from Monday to Saturday, vast Möllevångstorget is a kaleidoscopic extravaganza of haggling fruit and veg sellers. As days end, many give remaining produce to people who can’t afford to purchase items. Restaurants with outdoor terraces, offering a range of tempting global cuisines, fringe the broad plaza, and it’s easy to eat for under a tenner.9. Kville Saluhall, GothenburgGothenburg’s up-and-coming northwestern district of Kvillebäcken has been compared to such hip ’hoods as New York’s Williamsburg and Berlin’s Neukölln. Undertake the short, river-crossing tram trip out to Kvillebäcken and you’ll discover artsy boutiques, coffee houses, vegan restaurants and its two-storey riverside market hall, which scooped a national architecture award after opening in 2013. Amid a chrome and pale-brick interior, diners devour the likes of ceviche or pizza while stallholders hawk smoked moose meat, shrimp salad and exceptional pralines.10. Hötorget and Hötorgshallen, StockholmIn the shopping district of Norrmalm lies Hötorget, a plaza that has hosted a lively fruit-and-veg market for nearly 400 years – the sellers are entertaining, and you might bag a good deal. If you’re in search of more international fare, head to the plaza’s south side and Hötorgshallen, where you’ll find wild-boar cuts, fresh seafood or Chinese teas. Should you be feeling peckish, you might just be tempted by skagen toast: often served as a starter, it features shrimp, crayfish or crab, with mayonnaise and herbs, atop good bread. But epicureans shouldn’t visit on Sundays – Hötorgshallen closes and a giant flea market replaces Hötorget’s produce stalls.Welcome to Sweden when the time is rightTo find out more about Sweden’s rich and varied cuisine, head to Visit Sweden were you’ll find information on everything from food and drink festivals to bars, cafes and restaurantsGet advice about travelling to Sweden, including the latest information on Covid-19 restrictions at gov.ukforeign-travel-advicesweden"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cf3ab524a5f18736b1934ea781b454c23614b00/0_54_2480_1488/master/2480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b66194ecf4048b2a6d2b19582aa7d6e8","title":"from a sensational sauna to a ufo bedroom 10 amazing swedish designs you wont want to miss","story":"When cutting-edge creativity meets fantastical landscapes, the results can be quite breathtaking … take a look at how Sweden is inspiring an architectural revolution• New national restrictions apply from 5 November, please consult government advice before planning to travelFrom the ancient wooden dwellings of the middle ages to the experimental postmodernism of the 1960s, Swedish architecture has charged through countless different styles and eras, bending European trends to its own Nordic context while also creating an independent vernacular.The country’s architects now frequently lead the field, and a vibrant tradition of modern design has resulted in great experimentation and innovation over recent decades – from spectacular feats of civic engineering to hip saunas and the coolest hotels, all wonderful for the visitor to behold.These are 10 of the most design-forward buildings and sights for cultural travellers to lay their eyes on:1. Öresund Bridge, MalmöA road and railway run parallel across one of the world’s longest cable-tied bridges then, at an artificial island, disappear into an underwater tunnel as if being sucked down a plughole.This incredible 16km (9.9-mile) structure seems to defy the possibilities of engineering, while creating a valuable trade and transport link between Copenhagen, in Denmark, and Malmö, Sweden’s third largest city. The Öresund Bridge section alone is about 8km (5 miles) long and will be familiar to British TV viewers as the setting for the Scandi-noir drama The Bridge.2. The Sauna in Frihamnen, Gothenburg In a land peppered with sleek designer sauna huts, both private and public, which showcase the ingenuity of talented architects, for one to be widely praised by design critics as the country’s most spectacular is quite an accolade. The Sauna in Frihamnen, which opened in a newly fashionable area of Gothenburg in 2015, immediately caused a sensation with its striking metal form, built from rusted corrugated steel. The design made extensive use of other recycled materials, too – 12,000 glass bottles were used in the construction of the changing rooms alone. Happily, it’s free for anyone to use, alongside an outdoor pool by the river in which to cool off.3. Treehotel, Luleå Swedish LaplandA global accommodation gamechanger when it launched its treetop cabins in 2010, the Treehotel has come to be one of the most recognisable and lusted-after places to stay in Scandinavia.Suspended 4-10m above ground in a spectacular Lapland pine forest are seven cabins, inidually designed by renowned architects, among them the Swede Bertil Harström, who is the only one to have created two treehouses – the UFO, resembling a flying saucer, and Bird’s Nest, whose exterior is a frenzied mass of sticks and branches.Guests go cross-country skiing through forest, watch the aurora borealis, kayak, and feast on gourmet meals of wild moose with foraged berries. There’s time, too, for fika picnics, which embrace the Swedish tradition of having a cosy break for coffee and cake with friends.4. Artipelag, VärmdöArtipelag, a vast exhibition centre that celebrates art, architecture, Swedish design and food, sits in a natural environment of pine trees, cliffs and magnificent views, about 20km (12.4 miles) east of Stockholm. The aim of the architect Johan Nyrén was to create a building in harmony with its surroundings and the elements. As a result, a crackling fire welcomes visitors into the entrance hall, from where they see seawater glittering through floor-to-ceiling windows. In the cafe and patisserie, a huge rounded gneiss rock protrudes through the floor. Outside, larch boardwalks skip across rocks and water to a sculpture trail through the forest. To make the visit even more special, gallery-goers can travel to Artipelag through the Stockholm archipelago on board a 19th-century ship.5. ArkNat shelters, High CoastEvery year since 2017, groups of young architecture students have taken to the 130km (81-mile) High Coast Trail in north-east Sweden to design and build beautifully crafted wind shelters and resting places for hikers as part of the ArkNat project. The High Coast, a Unesco world heritage site of granite cliffs and rocky islands, stretches from Hornöberget in the south to Örnsköldsvik in the north. Along the trail it’s a joy to stumble across and take time to appreciate the ArkNat spots, such as Forest Cradle, a curvaceous floating wooden day bed in the forest near Mount Skuleberget. For 2021, the project moves from the High Coast region to the southern county of Skåne to provide a fresh crop of inventive havens along glorious walking trails.6. Kalmar konstmuseum, KalmarOne of the country’s most interesting contemporary art museums, the Kalmar konstmuseum, on the south-east Baltic coast, was the result of an architecture competition that attracted almost 300 entrants. The winners, Martin Videgård Hansson and Bolle Tham, envisaged a black cube housing four floors of exhibitions, studios, a library and offices, with views over the sea and the city. In contrast to the dark, wood-clad exterior, the interiors are of smooth, pale concrete where light and shadow play. The Kalmar konstmuseum won Sweden’s most prestigious architecture prize, the Kasper Salin Prize in 2008, its inaugural year.7. Icehotel, Jukkasjärvi, northern SwedenThere can’t be a traveller on earth who hasn’t heard of the magical Icehotel, 17km (10.5 miles) east of Kiruna and 200km (124 miles) north of the Arctic Circle, which was the world’s first when it opened in 1989, and has reinvented itself extravagantly every winter since. Between October and December each year, dozens of artists and collaborators chip away at ice from the Torne River to form spectacular new suites – one may be full of ice toys, another a frozen winter garden. The newly created ice extravaganzas are available for occupation from mid December this year to the end of March, but one section of the hotel, Ice 365, now remains open year round, using solar energy to freeze rooms. If you can’t fit in an overnight stay, day visitors are welcome at the ice bar and exhibitions.8. Naturums, nationwideIn many countries, visitor centres at nature reserves tend to be lacklustre prefab cabins devoid of style. Not in Sweden, where 31 design-led naturums (nature rooms) in national parks and nature reserves are examples of architectural brilliance. The centres host activities, exhibitions and provide information about the beautiful areas they inhabit, yet even their own aesthetics are cause for admiration. Naturum Vänerskärgården-Victoriahuset’s facade of wooden strips, for example, was inspired by the reeds and driftwood of its surroundings at Lake Vänern – the EU’s largest lake – and features a hotel, too.9. Sara Cultural CentreNot far from the Arctic Circle, the city of Skellefteå is building the Sara Cultural Centre, which, at 20 storeys high, is expected to be the world’s tallest wooden building. Due to open in 2021, the structure will house a theatre, art gallery, museum and the city library. There will be a hotel and a restaurant, too, both of which will have panoramic city views. Designed by architect Oskar Norelius, this futuristic building pushes the boundaries of what can be achieved in timber construction, while at the same time having a low environmental impact thanks the renewable nature of wood. Additionally, its green roof will contribute to thermal insulation, enhance bioersity and delay rainwater run-off.10. National Museum, StockholmIf any building exemplifies Sweden’s ability to pay homage to its past while embracing the future, it’s the National Museum. Opened in 1866, it is not only one of Europe’s best preserved 19th-century museum buildings but one of the most modern thanks to a five-year renovation that was completed in 2018. While the building’s symmetrical facade was restored to its former glory using stone that matched the original, the interior was sensitively updated to allow more of the museum’s vast collection of art to be displayed in a contemporary manner. The museum also gained a glass roof, a lift and a new restaurant that serves classic Swedish cuisine with a modern touch, think elk stew with pickled red carrot or seared cured salmon with cucumber salad.Welcome to Sweden when the time is rightTo discover more about architecture and design in Sweden, head to Visit Sweden were you’ll find even more places you won’t want to missGet advice about travelling to Sweden, including the latest information on Covid-19 restrictions at gov.ukforeign-travel-advicesweden"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fe16ebdb3b035d83ff5838b59f9a08ae2dcdc94/0_162_2480_1489/master/2480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=450f904c8f24f81cc383168ce53b8f56","title":"heres to cinnamon bun day and stinky herring 10 things you need to know about swedish food","story":"From reindeer pizza to a cheese whose flavour might depend on the mood of the cows, there’s so much more to Sweden’s cuisine than Ikea meatballs …• New national restrictions apply from 5 November, please consult government advice before planning to travel1. Everyone loves a crayfish partyIn Britain, our most popular summer food ritual involves eating mouth-burning chips with a wooden fork on the seafront. In Sweden, summer is celebrated with the kräftskiva – a crayfish party that’s the highlight of any self-respecting Swede’s calendar. Held in early August, flagons of beer and chilled shots of liquor are served alongside freshwater crayfish, Västerbottensostpaj (a cheese flan) and plenty of rowdy singing. In keeping with the generous spirit of the kräftskiva, guests wear bibs and party hats, making for an unforgettably joyous celebration.2. The coffee break is a venerated ritualLike the siesta in Spain, or British elevenses, fika is an essential pause in the Swedish working day. Although fika is more about catching up with friends than the coffee itself, you’ll still find some fantastic cafes across Sweden serving up superlative grinds. Even better, coffee often comes with kanelbullens (cinnamon buns) or kardemummabullar (cardamom buns), which are universally delicious.3. Cinnamon buns have their own national dayThe Swedes are world-class at celebrating their baking traditions, with festive days dedicated to worshipping waffles, carrot cake and even shrimp sandwiches. But the most beloved is kanelbullens dag, which falls on 4 October each year and celebrates Sweden’s famed, fragrant cinnamon buns. If you’re a fan of pastry, it’s an ideal time to visit Sweden and indulge – and a lot more fun than svampens dag (mushroom day).4. Sweden’s national cheese is utterly uniqueMade to a closely guarded recipe at Burträsk, in northeastern Sweden, Västerbottensost is known as the king of Swedish cheeses. Strong and tangy, with added crunch thanks to its salt crystals, attempts to recreate its unique flavour outside Burträsk have failed. This has been attributed to everything from the type of wooden shelf the cheese is aged on, to the mood of local cows – a short documentary has even been made about the phenomenon. Whatever the reason, it’s a must-try, especially during crayfish season, when it’s put to delicious use in Västerbottensostpaj, a flan served to accompany the crayfish.5. It’s home to one of the stinkiest foods in the worldIf crayfish aren’t fishy enough for you, visit Sweden for the surströmmingspremiӓr, or sour herring premiere, which falls on the third Thursday in August. To make surströmming, raw herring is preserved in salt and fermented for six months, resulting in a powerfully acidic flavour and unmistakable aroma that has led surströmming to be branded one of the world’s smelliest foods. Banned by certain airlines, the cans of fish need to be opened outside (never indoors) and are often eaten with tunnbröd (flatbread) or knäckebröd (crispbread), boiled potato, onions and a dollop of sour cream. Apparently they taste better than they smell!6. Crispbread is preferred to the fluffy stuffSpeaking of knäckebröd, these tasty rye crispbreads are ubiquitous in Sweden, and you’ll find them served alongside your main meal in restaurants or piled with all manner of delicious toppings as a snack in the country’s ubiquitous cafes. Crunchy and earthy, they’re the perfect edible platter for meats and cheeses (including Västerbottensost, of course), smoked salmon, fruit spread and even caviar.7. Sweets are for SaturdaysThe Swedes are notoriously sweet-toothed, each eating around 15kg of sweets per year. In 1957 the Swedish medical board advised families to limit their intake to one day a week – which evolved into a tradition known as lördagsgodis, or Saturday sweets. In feeding this day of treats, the country’s pick-and-mix shops are bounteous, offering delicious traditional pickings such as salted liquorice, lingonberry chocolate and the much-loved Swedish fish (actually wine gums). Dip in, you’re on holiday ...8. It’s a berry-lover’s delightForget plain old strawberry: Sweden’s favourite jam is lingonberry, which is dollopped on to everything from pancakes and knäckebröd to meatballs and (of course) herrings. A trip to Sweden is your chance to try cloudberries, which look like pink-and-amber blackberries and have a similarly sharp kick. They’re known as “arctic gold”, but thanks to the Swedish allemansrätten – the “freedom to roam” rule – anyone can set off on a berry-hunting expedition. If you’re lucky, you might come across the åkerbär, or arctic bramble, a type of raspberry that’s considered a delicacy and often turned into a sweet liqueur.9. Reindeer meat is surprisingly deliciousIn Sweden, Dasher, Dancer, Prancer and Vixen are more likely to be found on a dinner plate than delivering presents. Reindeer meat is lean and high in protein, and is as versatile as beef: here, you’ll find it stuffed into pitta bread, dollopped with lingonberry jam, cold-smoked, roasted and even served as a pizza topping. Traditional Swedish restaurants offer some delicious opportunities to try it – perhaps best not to tell the kids.10. Craft beers aboundBeer-lovers are well catered for by Sweden’s independent craft breweries – the country has around 400 – and Stockholm in particular has a great craft-beer scene. While familiar names such as Brewdog abound, head for a local brewery or specialist beer bar to try something a bit different. The Stockholm Brewing Company has a taproom alongside its brewery which is open on Fridays and Saturdays. Regular theme nights, pop-ups and events, make a visit here as eclectic as its beers (which include a brew spontaneously fermented with yeast captured from the air as it cools outside).For an alternative drinking experience, head to PangPang, one of Stockholm’s first microbreweries. Known for its handmade beers, often created with a twist, you might be tempted by its sour IPA brewed with coconut cream and pineapple or the imperial stout aged in new medium-toasted American oak barrels.

Nor any carol singers to soothe your frayed festive nerves. And even the most hardened bargain hunters are going to feel less than gung ho about bustling through crowds in search of the perfect gift. Pandemics have a way of sucking the joy out of most things – and Christmas shopping is no exception.And yet: let there be light. All is not lost, because the Christmas store window, rich in tradition of pomp, pageantry and fever-pitch overexcitement, is making a last-minute attempt to bring some joy to the high street. Window dressing, an art form with a long and illustrious heritage that boasts Giorgio Armani, Andy Warhol and Salvador Dalí as alumni, is attempting to bring a happy ending for what has been an annus horribilis for retail.On the corner of Sloane Street and Knightsbridge, Harvey Nichols’ window sells nothing more expensive than optimism. There are no products, just “BRING ON 2021” spelled out in fairground lights, alongside a disco ball and a couple of snowflakes.Until last week, retailers did not know for certain if their stores would be able to open for in-person Christmas shopping. “This design needed to take us through being in lockdown or not,” says Lisa Clemenger, the visual concept manager for Liberty, where this year’s window theme is Peace, Love and Liberty. “We knew that, even if the shop was shut, people would love walking past it.” Selfridges, standing by the principles of its ambitious Project Earth sustainability pledge and taking inspiration from the time-honoured family tradition of bringing the same baubles down from the loft each year, raided its stockrooms for past-season decorations to hang on the trees that line its Oxford Street windows. The result is “slightly more homemade”, says Morag Hickmott of Selfridges, “but still with dazzle and glamour”.Walking, being a safe and sanity-preserving activity, has had to do a lot of heavy lifting in the having-fun department this year. Now that autumn’s gorgeous fall of red-and-gold leaves is turning to mulch, nature is not at its most enticing. Fingers are firmly crossed for a white Christmas, naturally. But, until then, a socially distanced outing to admire some chic and glamorous retail theatre from the alfresco safety of a pavement could make a welcome alternative to the usual lap of the park.“I’ve hardly been in any shops this year,” says the window display designer Petra Storrs, who has created festive displays for Hermès and Christian Louboutin in the past. “Walking around outside has become my main activity. In lockdown, at times where I might normally pop to the shops, I was doing loops of my area with no particular destination, just as a change of scene from working from home. So this year I have particularly appreciated the Christmas lights and window displays popping up.” For 2020, Storrs was commissioned by Facebook to create displays for three female-owned small businesses, to highlight troubling research showing female-owned businesses to have been hit hardest by the pandemic.New York’s holiday season windows are, in any other year except this, a major draw for the tourists who usually flock to the city in December. This year, the streets are quiet – but the windows are in full voice. Saks Fifth Avenue’s 2020 windows, which are a homage to “How We Celebrate Now” – a food truck outside an apartment building for a socially distanced festive dinner, for instance – are a reminder “of the greatness of this city”, its chief executive, Marc Metrick, told the New York Times last week.Just don’t go pressing your nose up against the window."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa5b0ee3b5e8fdac8963762e1f73c17d0132e3ed/0_143_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=93f4a6f3aff37c0c628bbdb74f33c6a1","title":"satin sparklers good coat all ages gets festive","story":"Party season looks different this year, but the All Ages team are still finding time to sparkle - and to share their highlights of 2020"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c4981fac209c7b1ff3809bb6d88546775383ea2/397_50_1517_910/master/1517.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=c1bb0b2637c2b12ddd8cca13a6bc8f45","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"A north London derby, Lampard v Bielsa and the probability of some David Moyes magic with West Ham?A year ago José Mourinho was widely being cast as a dour, retrograde choice for the Spurs job while Mikel Arteta was to be hailed as the man to drive Arsenal into a bright new future. The temptation might be to archly enquire how that is all going, but the more relevant point is that managers cannot always be pigeonholed. They may have one thing in common at Sunday’s north London derby, though: neither Mourinho nor Arteta is minded to be gung-ho in games of this magnitude, much as Arteta in particular might behave differently if he had a better-balanced squad. This looks likely to be a cautious affair given Spurs’ increasingly convincing designs on the title and Arsenal’s need to arrest a deeply concerning autumn slump. Both sides will be looking for their front men to make the most of chances. Harry Kane invariably does so, but can Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, badly out of sorts this season, rise to the big occasion once again?

While Neco Williams and Curtis Jones conjured the winning goal between them, Caoimhín Kelleher was first to receive a bear hug from their manager. The goalkeeper’s ability to play with the ball at his feet, born of playing as a midfielder in his schoolboy days back in Ireland, would seem to push him ahead of Adrián, rather less of a ball player, in the reckoning to stand in for Alisson, the latest victim of Liverpool’s plague of muscle injuries. Williams and Jones may play their part, too, as Klopp’s rage at the scheduling continues to be justified by senior players breaking down. Wolves are also having to look to youth, with Raúl Jiménez set to be missing for some time after fracturing his skull at Arsenal on Sunday. Fábio Silva, who came on at the Emirates after that sickening injury, showed fleeting glimpses of what made him worth £35m from Porto. Nuno Espírito Santo is being characteristically cautious with him, but a vacancy has arisen. JBSheffield United pummelled West Brom last weekend but still lost, leaving Chris Wilder to demand “better technique, better composure and better quality” from those on the end of their chances. Something has to change quickly: Oli McBurnie was an almighty handful last season but is yet to get off the mark this time Oliver Burke has not scored either and, although David McGoldrick has chipped in twice, the veteran is unlikely to drag the Blades out of trouble single-handedly. Chris Wilder is yet to alight upon a pairing that looks capable of turning things around. One bonus is that Lys Mousset, another success story last term, is back. He is unlikely to start against Leicester on Sunday, though, and Wilder must be tempted to hand Rhian Brewster a recall. The 20-year-old has been in and out of the side since his expensive move from Liverpool and, while raw, he is a livewire customer inside the box. Perhaps a run in the side for their big summer investment would deliver some much-needed points. NAWhile he may not trumpet it as frequently as Jürgen Klopp, Sean Dyche is so concerned with the litany of injuries suffered by Burnley players that he has launched an internal investigation. Nick Pope, Robbie Brady, Josh Brownhill, Jack Cork, Phil Bardsley and Jóhann Gudmundsson were all absent from last weekend’s shellacking at Manchester City, continuing an injury-hit year for Dyche’s side. “Sometimes you get these periods of injuries,” said Dyche. “Maybe it’s just one of those things, but we are analysing it and we are working closely with the sport science and the physios to see if there are things we’re not quite fathoming out.” Pope, who missed the City game through the concussion protocol, should be back for this weekend’s game against Everton, while Brownhill and Bardsley are also expected to be available. BGCarlo Ancelotti kicked off his spell in charge of Everton with a Boxing Day win over Burnley and could scarcely ask for more accommodating opposition as his team try to emerge from the rut that has followed their blistering start to the season. A laboured win over Fulham halted a run of three consecutive defeats for Everton, who subsequently squandered enough chances to win several games in an entertaining defeat against Leeds. Ancelotti has switched from 4-4-2 to a 3-4-3 in their past two games, a formation that left them vulnerable at the back but helped them bag three goals against Fulham and register nine shots on target against Leeds. Rather than abandon it, Ancelotti may opt to stick with it against a team mired in the bottom three. BGThe renewal of a north-south rivalry that dates back to the late-1960s heyday of Ron “Chopper” Harris and Norman “Bites Yer Legs” Hunter will not be met by the white-hot atmosphere of yore. A socially distanced crowd of 2,000 will be spread sparsely for a fixture last staged in May 2004, a 1-0 home win courtesy of a Jesper Gronkjær goal that was the last act of both Claudio Ranieiri’s Chelsea tenure and Leeds’ top-flight status for 16 years. The two clubs’ trajectories have finally brought them back together and Frank Lampard, Chelsea’s midfield general that Saturday afternoon, is in charge of a team that has become the stingiest in the Premier League. Meanwhile, Leeds have kept clean sheets in their last two matches, and did a real number on Everton last week. Lampard will be reunited with Marcelo Bielsa, with whom no love was lost in the ‘Spygate’ scandal that took place during the Londoner’s time at Derby. Were Leeds fans allowed in, their feelings for Chelsea’s manager would have been made clear. JBA textbook counterattacking performance helped Fulham to a confidence-boosting win over Leicester and Scott Parker’s side will need every ounce of belief available to them for their trip to the Etihad to face Manchester City. Parker tried a 5-4-1 formation on Monday, his focus on nullifying the threat of Jamie Vardy, Youri Tielemans and James Maddison, then attacking at speed on the break. Having enjoyed such success he is likely to go with it again and it could conceivably yield further idends if his side catches the City defence on one of their increasingly frequent off-days. BGZaha or not Zaha? That is the question for any team about to face Crystal Palace. Despite the signing of Eberechi Eze, Palace remain heavily reliant on Wilfried Zaha, whose absence in their last two matches led to sorry defeats against Burnley and Newcastle. If he is not fit enough to play this weekend, then West Brom will be even more confident of following up their maiden league win of the season with another. They will hope that Matheus Pereira plays as well as he did in last weekend’s victory over Sheffield United, when the Brazilian constantly created havoc for the opposition with his tricky dribbling, astute passing and precise set-piece deliveries. PDWho are the team currently occupying fifth place in the Premier League after 10 games, and what have they done with the real West Ham? Among many people’s favourites for relegation before the season began, David Moyes’s side have now won three games on the spin, prompting speculation their manager has finally got his mojo back since it deserted him six years ago at Manchester United. It is his former club who travel to the London Stadium this weekend, where they will face a Hammers collective bolstered by shrewd recruits and all apparently pulling in the same direction for a manager many considered to be a beaten docket. On the pitch at least, West Ham are far from the basket-case outfit many predicted before the season began. BGGraham Potter is sure to tell his players to be extra careful on Monday. Only Fulham have committed more fouls in the Premier League this season than Brighton, who would be best advised not to give away free-kicks within 30 yards of goal, ie James Ward-Prowse territory. Southampton could be boosted by the returns of Nathan Redmond and maybe even Danny Ings, who resumed training this week. Brighton will have Tariq Lamptey back from suspension and can expect another dominant performance from Yves Bissouma, who has grown into one of the league’s most accomplished midfield generals. Brighton have not beaten Southampton at home since 2012 but have a good chance of changing that – so long as they tackle smart.

Having amassed a strong cult following through multiple mixtapes, the 23-year-old rapper’s debut album doubles down on her raspy, crushing sound.From the frantic shouts of “Can you feel me?” on opener Candy onwards, her explosive personality heats up blood-boiling tracks like Check Me Out (“She don’t like me? Omg! Shocker”), but she also heads into emo-rap in her collaboration with Trippie Redd in Loser, a rallying cry to all those who deviate from the norm (“see you trying way too hard to fit in  we goin’ shopping loser, get in!”). The distorted guitar riffs and hard-hitting keys from producers like Take a Daytrip and Tay Keith complement her brazen vocals well.With a long list of bitesize tracks that average out at the two-minute mark, some moments are forgettable, like STFU and Let it Out, where the screamed raps and bass-heavy production become tiresome, one-dimensional and low-impact.

But with less than a month until the UK’s trade with the EU moves to new rules – whether under a deal or no-deal scenario – it is possible that continuing attempts to gain a win for British fishing industry could scupper much larger parts of the UK economy.Fishing is a politically charged issue on both sides of the Channel. Boris Johnson has talked of the UK becoming “an independent coastal state” and exploiting the “recapture of our spectacular natural marine wealth”, while Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, has warned the UK against using fish as a “bargaining chip” (apparently not a pun on Britain’s national dish). Meanwhile, far bigger industries in the UK economy are left waiting.Output from financial and insurance activities – a large proportion of which is carried out in London – was £125bn last year. Yet the government quickly gave up on the City’s hopes for special access to the European market, and there are still questions about whether Brussels will view UK firms as equivalent to their EU rivals in a regulatory sense after 1 January. Bankers have been the subject of public and political ire since the global financial crisis of 2007-08, but it is clear that the focus on fishing risks neglecting the basic functioning of much weightier parts of the economy.Lord Liddle, a veteran of European trade negotiations who advised Peter Mandelson when the latter was the EU’s trade commissioner, said Brussels’ negotiators will have organised their strategy around offensive and defensive interests. That approach does not seem to have been mirrored on the UK side, with the British government giving up on securing favourable rules of origin – which decide whether cars made with imported parts will attract tariffs – while holding firm on fishing.“To have ended up with this great row about fishing suggests to me they haven’t made those calculations,” he said.Liddle said the UK got a poor deal on fishing in the 1970s when joining the European Economic Community, but added that Johnson’s promises of a renaissance for the British fishing industry seemed overly optimistic.Even if the number doubled from the 12,000 fishers the government says there are now, the industry would still be a minnow compared with the 864,000 people working in the UK car industry, according to the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders.There is an irony in the fact that the automotive and finance were two of the industries most assiduously courted by Margaret Thatcher during the 1980s. Now they face an overnight transition to World Trade Organization terms on 1 January – a disaster in their eyes – under another Conservative prime minister.Yet the collapse of Brexit negotiations is unlikely to benefit much of the UK fishing industry in the short term. Many of the fish favoured by Britons are imported, while the species native to UK waters are more popular in overseas markets.Tariffs would overnight change the terms of trade, potentially making some exports unprofitable. That could mean a glut of cheaper fish in the UK, a possible boon for consumers – as long as British people can learn to love mackerel once more – but falling prices would be unlikely to revive fishing regions.The dynamic is mirrored on the other side of the Channel, where the French president, Emmanuel Macron, is keen to be seen as fighting for France’s relatively poorer northern coastal communities before elections in 2022. Yet across the entire EU and UK the fishing industry employed only 180,000 people in 2017.The brutal realities of the trade-offs in the negotiations are becoming clear. The car and finance industries would never say it aloud, but there is exasperation among executives and unions that their fortunes, and the fate of other sectors, are reliant on the government’s efforts to expand a much smaller industry.However, bigger sectors are wary of being seen to criticise a smaller counterpart.

If it wasn’t, it wouldn’t have been approved. It wouldn’t have got the clearance from the MHRA.”The government’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) says its priority is to prevent Covid-related deaths and protect health and social care staff and systems.Elderly care home residents and their carers are first on the JCVI’s list because their risk of exposure to the virus is higher and because the risk of death closely correlates with older age. They are followed in priority by anyone else over 80 and frontline health and social care workers.Even so, for pragmatic reasons NHS staff are likely to be the first group to receive the PfizerBioNTech jab. This is because the vaccine needs to be stored at ultra-cold temperatures, which can be achieved more easily by using hospital facilitiesTogether, care home residents, their carers and the over-80s make up nearly 6 million people, and frontline NHS staff a further 736,685. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has said he expects 10m doses of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine to be available this year, so if this is the only vaccine authorised, everyone else would have to wait until further doses become available next year.\u0026nbspCovid-19 vaccines are expected to be delivered at three types of venue: NHS trust “vaccine hubs” at hospital sites mass vaccination centres, which are in the process of being set up at places such as\u0026nbspfootball stadiums, conference buildings\u0026nbspand racecourses – these are expected to vaccinate up to 5,000 people a day and at GP surgeries and pharmacies. GPs can also visit care home residents and housebound patients at home without them needing to travel.While there is some evidence to indicate high levels of short-term protection from a single dose of vaccine, a two-dose schedule is what has been approved by the\u0026nbspMHRA.The second dose will need to be delivered at least 21 days after the first, and both will be injected into the deltoid muscle – the thick triangular muscle we use to raise each arm.For the Pfizer vaccine, its efficacy rate was calculated seven days after the second shot. It is likely that people will have some protection before this, but this is how long it will take for full protection to kick in. We will learn more about the extent of protection and how long it lasts as data from ongoing clinical trials comes in.Unlikely. England’s deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, has said he believes Covid-19 vaccines should be delivered according to clinical priority rather than allowing people to jump the queue if they can afford it.Also unlikely, at least in the short to medium term. Assuming more than one vaccine is approved, the priority will be distributing any available doses to the people who need it as quickly as possible.His comments came after Anthony Fauci, the US’s leading infectious disease scientist, said the MHRA had “rushed through” its approval, although he later apologised and blamed his remarks on a “misunderstanding”.Fauci, who leads the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, initially said the UK “ran around the corner of the marathon and joined it in the last mile” and “rushed through that approval”.He contrasted that with the approach of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which he said had been careful to avoid “cutting corners” because it did not want to fuel vaccine scepticism.Fauci later told the BBC he did not mean to imply “any sloppiness” and said: “I have a great deal of confidence in what the UK does both scientifically and from a regulator standpoint.”Asked on Sky News on Thursday morning about Fauci’s comments, Sharma said: “You should also see what Dr Fauci has subsequently said overnight about the fact that he is confident in the processes that we have followed.“I just want to make this point because you’re absolutely right about giving people the confidence that the vaccine is safe. The MHRA, which is the regulator in the UK, is independent. It’s also regarded actually as a gold standard of regulation by international scientists, people around the world.”Dr June Raine, the head of the MHRA, had previously insisted that “no corners had been cut” in vetting the vaccine. Raine will reportedly undertake a series of interviews with local and commercial radio stations on Friday in an attempt to convince the public the vaccine is safe.There are serious concerns within government that anti-vax campaigners are latching on to scepticism about the rapid approval of the immunisation.The PfizerBioNTech Covid jab is an mRNA vaccine. Essentially, mRNA is a molecule used by living cells to turn the gene sequences in DNA into the proteins that are the building blocks of all their fundamental structures. A segment of DNA gets copied (“transcribed”) into a piece of mRNA, which in turn gets “read” by the cell’s tools for synthesising proteins.In the case of an mRNA vaccine, the virus’s mRNA is injected into the muscle, and our own cells then read it and synthesise the viral protein. The immune system reacts to these proteins – which can’t by themselves cause disease – just as if they’d been carried in on the whole virus. This generates a protective response that, studies suggest, lasts for some time.The two first Covid-19 vaccines to announce phase 3 three trial results were mRNA-based. They were first off the blocks because, as soon as the genetic code of Sars-CoV-2 was known – it was\u0026nbsppublished\u0026nbspby the Chinese in January 2020 – companies that had been working on this technology were able to start producing the virus’s mRNA. Making conventional vaccines takes much longer.Adam Finn, professor of paediatrics at the Bristol Children’s Vaccine Centre, University of BristolThe deputy chief medical officer for England, Jonathan Van-Tam, also hit back at critics, telling the BBC: “If you’re a regulator who’s slightly further behind, what do you say to justify your position that you are further behind? Words such as the ones we’ve heard perhaps.”The UK announced on Wednesday it had become the first western country to license a vaccine against Covid, opening the way for mass immunisation with the PfizerBioNTech vaccine to begin next week for those most at risk.Sharma said he was “very confident” that 800,000 doses of the jab would be available for the start of the rollout next week and that he hoped the UK would have “some millions by the end of this year”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec4ac4224cbce9e709d1818b32e3fc2d008f4e98/0_60_4005_2403/master/4005.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=f7052073d84329baeb89acb907d8bfff","title":"joe root eye on the ashes south africa england odi cricket","story":"The ODI series against South Africa is next in line but England’s Test captain is already looking ahead to the big prize in AustraliaJoe Root returns to England duty on Friday in the first one‑day international against South Africa but he is honest enough to admit the 2021-22 Ashes series – “the opportunity of a lifetime” – is occupying plenty of head space.Root was not part of England’s 3-0 win in the Twenty20 series, but the 29-year-old still harbours a burning ambition to make the squad for October’s World Cup. He believes trying to match the power-hitters has been detrimental to him and now hopes his finesse will prevail. However, Test cricket remains the primary focus and Root remains on course to become the first Englishman since Johnny Douglas in 1920-21 to lead two Ashes campaigns down under. Mike Brearley twice led tours of Australia, but the urn was not at stake during the hastily arranged 1979-80 series.When asked how much he is thinking about the Ashes, Root said: “There’s no point hiding from it or trying to make it look like we’re not focused heavily on it, because we are. A lot of thought and planning has gone into things.Root’s first Ashes series as captain three years ago resulted in the urn being meekly surrendered in a 4-0 defeat. The vice-captain, Ben Stokes, was absent following the infamous Bristol incident, a boozy narrative dogged the tour and Ricky Ponting struck a nerve when comparing Root’s soft-spoken leadership to “a little boy”.“In the last year or so we’ve settled. That’s given us something to draw back to and compare ourselves against, rather than just thinking about outcomes all the time. It will be tested in Sri Lanka and India but that’s exciting. Keep improving and it’s another string to our bow when it comes to Australia.”Root will pay “a huge amount of attention” to Australia’s forthcoming Test series against India that begins on 17 December in Adelaide, with nine Tests against the latter next year and the home side set to hand debuts to two promising rookies. David Warner’s groin injury means the 22-year-old Will Pucovski is due to open following 495 runs in three Sheffield Shield innings, while in Cameron Green they have a new all-rounder whose batting has drawn comparisons with Ponting and, though returning from a stress fracture, bowls fast-medium from a 6ft 7in frame.“It will be brilliant to watch two of the best teams in the world going at it, but also the immediate challenges of India, the conditions in Australia and a few new players,” Root said. “All the information we can gather will be vital.”Looking at the immediate challenge of South Africa in 50-over cricket, however, Root has three shots at ensuring 2020 is not his first full calendar year in international cricket without a century in any format. “I’ve not hit my straps the way I’d like to – in Test cricket in particular – but having had this break, I’ve looked at a number of things to change and work on. You have times when your game is tested, you have to adapt and that’s where I am now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a525e486710893192f3b3fe7cd6554e7d158c39f/1_164_624_374/master/624.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=586d404bbb4423ac8281410c7039a1fa","title":"australia vs india live t20 cricket international twenty20 aus v ind 2020 series match game start time teams latest scores manuka oval canberra updates","story":"18th over: India 127-6 (Jadeja 12, Sundar 6) Starc comes back and wants to clean up, but it doesn’t go his way at first. A couple of wides, a draw shot from Sundar – edged between the left-hander’s legs and away to the fine leg fence. A dozen from the over. 17th over: India 115-6 (Jadeja 8, Sundar 0) First ball of the next over is the one that goes for six! Henriques’ night of parsimony comes to an end, as he bowls a length ball that Pandya leans back on and smokes over wide long-on. The next ball is similarly well hit, a cut shot, but the one player within a mile of it at cover on the circle is lined up by the shot directly. It’s still hit so hard that they run a single by the time Swepson recovers to throw the ball back in. Jadeja, a left-hander now, cuts in the same direction and Swepson can’t stop it, but deep cover will. Pandya back on strike goes long down the ground and Abbott pulls off a ridiculous save. All the way back on the rope, at long-off, the ball looks like it’ll clear him but he gets up and taps it back into the field of play before landing, and keeps the scoring to two.Next ball is when Pandya goes again and gets out. Has to go for it, Pandya, and gets more height than distance as he tries to hit Henriques over long-off. Smith comes in from the boundary to take the high ball securely. 16th over: India 104-5 (Pandya 7, Jadeja 6) Pandya walks across to try to glance Hazlewood and misses, and the ball soars over his middle stump. That’s the second ball of the over, and it makes five overs without a boundary for India. Pandya is content to nudge a single. They’ll have to take on somebody at some point. Not Hazlewood. Jadeja drives a run, Pandya another. Then two from a fumble, seven from the over. 15th over: India 97-5 (Pandya 3, Jadeja 3) Zampa isn’t letting the brakes off. He gives them four singles, driven down the ground, and finishes his bowling for the night with figures of 1 for 20. 14th over: India 93-5 (Pandya 1, Jadeja 1) A leg bye, a single and a wicket. That’s the Henriques over. He’s got 2 for 11 from three. India have Pandya and Jadeja together, the two who saved the day on Wednesday. They put on 150 from 108 balls there. They’ve got a lot less time to do something here. Another simple wicket goes down. Rahul feels the need to up the ante, tries to lift Henriques down the ground, but the cutter doesn’t give him good enough purchase and Abbott runs in from long-on to take the catch. 13th over: India 91-4 (Rahul 51, Pandya 1) What an over, Adam Zampa. Dives across to field the last ball and keep it scoreless, and all up the over cost two singles and returned the wicket. They’re falling with the soft pitter-patter of summer rain, now. The Mullet strikes with a shortish ball outside off, Pandey’s cut shot loops off the top edge, and Hazlewood uses his long reach at short third on the circle to lunge forward and take it low about the ground. Cheers as Hardik Pandya comes to the middle. 12th over: India 89-3 (Rahul 50, Pandey 2) First ball of the over when the wicket falls, which lets Henriques get through a quiet one to new man Manish Pandey. A brace down the ground and a wide are the only scores. Swepson into the act with his fielding now too. A straightforward one, Samson trying to power a cover drive, instead lofting it flat to the edge of the circle. Henriques vindicates the decision to bowl him. 11th over: India 86-2 (Rahul 50, Samson 23) Abbott just can’t stop being clobbered. Bowls a short ball, maybe the chance of pace, that sits up outside off. Samson leaps like a salmon and makes good contact while mid-air, cutting over cover for four. KL gets strike and turns a single for his fifty. Abbott bowls Samson a wide, then a ball on the pads that lets Samson hare back and e into his ground for a second run after playing it square. “So what do we think about the switch-hit controversy?” emails Dave Langlois. “To me it seems as though the batter is taking a considerable risk in changing his or her stance at the last moment, and this probably offsets the advantage of outwitting fields. And it’s so exciting and counter-intuitive to watch. The curmudgeonly complaints have quite surprised me.”Dave, just for you I have prepared this treatise on the very topic. 10th over: India 75-2 (Rahul 48, Samson 15) Moises Henriques with the ball. Underused during Wednesday’s ODI when others were being clobbered. Starts well with his seamers, hitting a length and keeping them to three singles, then two runs nudged square. A couple more singles, seven from the over, you’ll take that. 9th over: India 68-2 (Rahul 45, Samson 11) Swepson for his second, and gets dealt an absolute monster by Samson! It’s that top-spinner again, but Samson is much more decisively back on his stumps, pulling ferociously. The ball carries all the way to the concrete pedestrian concourse that circles Manuka, where it hits the ground, half-volleys into the wall, and does that so hard that carries all the way back onto the field of play. That’s a rebound of probably... 20 metres? Travelling. A few balls later, Rahul gets a ball short enough to pull for four, despite two outfielders in front of square on the leg side. 8th over: India 56-2 (Rahul 40, Samson 4) Double leg-spin in this game, that’s a treat. Adam Zampa backs up Swepson with an over conceding five singles. A triumph in T20 cricket.7th over: India 51-2 (Rahul 38, Samson 1) It’s been all on Rahul tonight, and it still is as Sanju Samson joins him. Swepson, back in the team and gets the biggest prize of all! His first over, having played a solitary T20 for Australia at Edgbaston back in mid-2018. He bowls flat and fast and gets bounce, looks like a top-spinner. Kohli sees the length and tries to pull but the ball is through him too fast and bounces too much, hitting high on the cross-bat and looping back to the bowler. Quite the moment. 6th over: India 42-1 (Rahul 31, Kohli 8) Sean Abbott on for his first bowl of the day... and India will pick up where they left off against him on Wednesday. He went for 49 from three overs at the back end of that ODI. Tonight, after a couple of singles, Rahul aims a big loft over midwicket, gets a thick outside edge and it flies up and just over short third man for four. Undeterred, Rahul goes for the same shot next ball and completely nails it over deep midwicket for six! That’s more like it. Abbott pulls it back at the end with a couple of dot balls, jamming up Rahul for room. 5th over: India 30-1 (Rahul 20, Kohli 7) Adam Zampa comes on. Leg-spin in the Powerplay. Two fielders out at long-on and deep mid. Everybody up on the off side. Zampa bowls a nice curling leg-break, teasing just outside off. KL Rahul scorches it along the carpet for four. Two more runs to that deep mid, as Kohli hustles back to the non-striker’s for the second. The repeats the dose, identically. 4th over: India 21-1 (Rahul 11, Kohli 7) That’s the definition of dismissive. Hazlewood bowls a decent length ball, fast, a touch straight, and Kohli just wafts it off his pads over midwicket for four. Poetry. Hazlewood has got Kohli out the last four times they’ve played an ODI, but India collect eight runs comfortably from that over.3rd over: India 13-1 (Rahul 9, Kohli 1) Well, Rahul got that over going with the first boundary of the day, slashed over backward point, but Starc comes back with the first wicket of the day. Kohli is at the crease early, and off the mark first ball guiding a run to deep third. There’s Mitchell Starc back! Full, swinging, lighting up the stumps. That thing he does better than anyone. This ball is left-arm over to a left-hander, angling in at middle stump, Dhawan plays an unconvincing waft across the line, and it swings away to evade his bat and clip the outside of off stump, still going fast enough to knock it out of the ground. Some delivery.  2nd over: India 6-0 (Rahul 4, Dhawan 1) Josh Hazlewood at the other end, Australia’s Test set-up continuing in the shortest form. How well did he bowl in the one-dayers? Such a good operator now. He’s starting off perfectly here, almost a full over at the left-handed Dhawan, just the right angle across him, back of a length so it’s hard to hit, drawing some missed shots and some outside edges, conceding a nicked single and a leg bye.  1st over: India 4-0 (Rahul 4, Dhawan 0) Mitch Starc to bowl after missing the third ODI the other night. Starts pretty nicely. Full, swinging, pitched up outside the off stump. Four balls in similar fashion, which isn’t always his go. Rahul drives at a few but can only beat the field for a couple of runs. Finally gets a straighter ball and flicks two more to fine leg. The Australian team and extended squad come out onto the field without their shoes and stand around the Walkabout Wickets artwork, in a display of solidarity with Indigenous Australians. They’re also wearing their new Indigenous art uniforms tonight, which look excellent. It’s quite the picture with the late sun over the ground and the long shadows of the light towers stretching from one side to the other. If you want some trivia, Cameron Green is out there wearing AJ Tye’s shirt.While we’re waiting, feel free to read this terrific, insightful, brave, incisive essay on the switch-hit, authored by... yeah, it was me.Interesting for Australia with D’Arcy Short opening now that Warner is out injured. Finch there with him, Matthew Wade keeping and batting at three. Swepson the leg-spinner comes into the team from outside the white-ball squad, which is interesting. Ashton Agar hurt his calf muscle the other night and left them short on spin. Swepson was in the Australia A squad to play the red-ball warm-ups before the Test series. Kohli says, “It’s a great chance to have a look at a few players. Pretty excited for them.” Lots of changes from the ODI side. Jasprit Bumrah rested after a tough couple of games. T Natarajan bowled well on ODI debut and keeps his spot. The IPL boys in Chahar and Sundar get a run. KL Rahul to the top of the order, Samson into the middle. The form players remain: Dhawan, Kohli, Pandya, Jadeja. And the hosts will bowl first, says captain Aaron Finch. So they’ll take the common approach and chase. Didn’t quite work for them in the last ODI here on Wednesday but they should have won that one, really.Drop us a line. The email and the Twitter channels are open as usual, so if you have any thoughts on the game or the wider world, feel free. Email or tweet @GeoffLemonSportA change of pace today, as we move from the 50-over game to the 20-over game. The first of three Twenty20 Internationals between Australia and India, this one in Canberra before the next two in Sydney. The home team was playing the 50-over games as though they were 20 overs a lot of the time, so perhaps that won’t make much difference. The Indians have just come off months of IPL, so they should be well attuned to the demands of this format. They won the ODI in Canberra on Wednesday so they’ll be feeling a bit more cheerful about playing again at this ground. It’s a warm sunny late afternoon at the moment, so we’ll look forward to a mild evening with the cricket on.

Making conventional vaccines takes much longer.Adam Finn, professor of paediatrics at the Bristol Children’s Vaccine Centre, University of BristolUnder the new rules, content that makes false claims about Covid-19 vaccines will be removed from Facebook and Instagram once those claims have been debunked by public health experts. The company says it is an extension of an existing policy to remove false claims about Covid-19, which has been applied to 12m pieces of content since March.“Given the recent news that Covid-19 vaccines will soon be rolling out around the world, over the coming weeks we will also start removing false claims about these vaccines that have been debunked by public health experts on Facebook and Instagram,” a company spokesperson said. “This is another way that we are applying our policy to remove misinformation about the virus that could lead to imminent physical harm.”Such content “could include false claims about the safety, efficacy, ingredients or side effects of the vaccines”, Facebook said. These could be claims that coronavirus vaccines contain microchips, or conspiracy theories that are known to be false, such as the idea that specific populations are being used without their consent to test the vaccine’s safety.“Since it’s early, and facts about Covid-19 vaccines will continue to evolve, we will regularly update the claims we remove based on guidance from public health authorities as they learn more.”The policies are significantly stronger than Facebook’s typical rules against misinformation, under which false claims are marked as such and suppressed by the curation algorithms, but are not removed from Facebook and Instagram entirely. The distinction, the company said, was because misinformation about Covid and Covid vaccinations “could lead to imminent physical harm”.As recently as 2018, Facebook allowed anti-vaccination content to spread unchecked on its platform. In July of that year, the company first introduced its policy of deleting misinformation that could lead to physical harm, and has applied it sparingly to content about vaccinations in the years since – focusing primarily on the most clearly false claims about specific vaccines and vaccination programmes.Since then, it has steadily tightened the rules. In 2019, the company banned adverts that included misinformation about vaccines, in an effort to reduce the spread of “vaccine hoaxes”, and announced that it would be suppressing groups and pages that spread anti-vaccine misinformation.It wasn’t until the pandemic that Facebook took further action. Last month, the company banned all adverts that discouraged people from getting vaccinated, a step up from simply banning misinformation in such adverts. Now, adverts on the platform will only be able to oppose vaccination if they do so from a political viewpoint – such as opposing politicians or laws which call for mandatory vaccination.The topic has a personal connection for the Facebook founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg. His philanthropic organisation, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, has embarked on a flagship effort to “cure all disease”, with a number of avenues of research being pursued, including a specific focus on vaccinations, through the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68f48eaf83a2ccf0de35782a19e5ef1d316f9e1d/0_191_5018_3013/master/5018.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6fddb548125a09bc32ea128e06182f4","title":"democrats mail in voting 2020 election analysis","story":"Analysis: the 2020, conducted during a pandemic, led to a change in voting habits that could have ended in disaster, but didn’tWhen America began shutting down this spring because of the Covid-19 pandemic, it transformed the already high-stakes 2020 race into a precarious high-wire balancing act.Election officials across the country, many of whom were already underfunded and under-resourced, began scrambling to find places where they could safely offer in-person voting, and poll workers, who tend to skew older, began to drop out. Disastrous primaries in Wisconsin and Georgia offered alarming signals that America was barrelling towards a chaotic general election.Amid this mayhem, states where few people typically vote by mail were suddenly forced to scale up and run elections in which most people were expected to vote that way, hoping to avoid long lines and human contact amid the pandemic. As the year wore on, a sharp partisan ide emerged. Donald Trump railed against voting by mail, while Democrats aggressively encouraged supporters to do so.For Democrats, it was a risk. In many states, vote by mail had not been used before – including key battlegrounds of Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. For voters used to casting their ballots in person, voting by mail offered a new set of rules and procedures to follow and a voter could have their ballot rejected for even a small mistake.While Democrats waged an aggressive legal battle to loosen mail-in voting restrictions many Republican officials refused to do so. Congress allocated a fraction of the estimated $4bn needed to run elections with significantly scaled-up mail-in voting. Despite severe mail delays this summer, Republican officials in Texas and Ohio limited opportunities for voters to return their ballots in person. Texas Republicans fought to block people from being able to register to vote online and sought to reject 127,000 ballots cast using drive-thru voting. Republicans in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan and North Carolina strongly objected to efforts to give voters more time to return their ballots and election officials to count them. In Alabama, the state’s top election official successfully went all the way to the US supreme court to block counties from offering curbside voting. In Oklahoma, after the state supreme court struck down a law requiring voters to get their ballots notarized, Republicans moved quickly to reinstate a revised version of the measure.Now, nearly a month after the election, the risk appears to have paid off for Democrats. The nightmare scenarios largely didn’t occur – there weren’t widespread mail delays leading to millions of Americans being disenfranchised, as many feared this summer. Instead, states with little vote-by-mail experience were able to match more experienced states in running a successful election. More than 100 million people voted early, either in person or by mail – a record number.“I’m fairly convinced at this point that the Democratic strategy and the Democratic advantage in vote by mail was just crucially and critically important to Biden’s win,” said Tom Bonier, CEO of TargetSmart, a Democratic data firm that tracks voter data. “There’s absolutely no way we would have hit these record levels of voter turnout, nationally, without this massive adoption of mail voting.”The partisan fights around voting in recent years have been shaped by a belief that, generally, more people voting benefits Democrats. But research earlier this year showed that, on the whole, vote by mail does not generally benefit one political party over the other. As Trump continued to attack vote by mail throughout the year, some Republicans worried he was sabotaging his own voters, dissuading them from a method of voting that might be more convenient and easy than going to the polls.While the switch to mail-in voting alone cannot explain election results, Democrats did in fact do well in places where many people chose to vote by mail, according to data collected by the  and ProPublica. Counties where people voted by mail at high rates were more likely to swing Democratic compared with four years ago.As far as raw votes go, many of them came from large suburban counties which swung heavily toward Democrats compared with 2016.Jay Tucker, the chair of the Pike county Democratic committee, said there was “no question” mail-in balloting helped improve Democrats’ performance this year. He said he and other organizers were able to closely track who had requested a ballot and regularly followed up with those who hadn’t returned a ballot.“We worked our ass off on that,” Tucker said. “One of the biggest mistakes that Trump made in this election was not backing mail-in voting. Because I think a lot more people came out.”In Michigan, one of the places that swung hardest towards Democrats was Kent county, home to Grand Rapids. Trump won the county by four points in 2016, but Biden carried it by six points this year. Eighty per cent of the people who requested mail-in ballots returned them, something that contributed to Democrats doing well there, said Gary Stark, the chairman of the county Democratic party.“I think that the absentee voting was a factor in the higher turnout. I think a number of new voters did use absentee ballots or mail-in ballots this time. No way to prove that, but that would be my gut assumption,” he said.But the repeated Republican attacks on the process appears to have shaken some voters’ faith in the process.Deadlines for returning absentee ballots flipped back and forth as lawsuits made their way through the courts. There were hundreds of election-related cases brought in state and federal courts this year. The US supreme court declined to lift restrictions on mail-in voting in the handful of them that reached it. It took a federal lawsuit to get the United States Postal Service to be transparent and make detailed commitments about how it would guarantee the timely delivery of ballots.“My mom was like, no, don’t put anything in the mail. Don’t trust the mailbox. Walk it inside and drop it in,” said Sonni King, who requested a mail-in ballot and returned it in person at a satellite voting location in Philadelphia days ahead of the election.“I’ve been hearing a lot about the whole mail issues and the breaching and all of that so I felt like this was a safer route,” said Brittany Davis, who voted in person on election day in Philadelphia.There’s also the fact that some communities had a more difficult time voting by mail. As the election neared, Black voters in North Carolina overwhelmingly had their ballots flagged for potential rejection.Native Americans also faced severe hurdles to voting by mail – postal service on reservations can be unreliable and the nearest post office might be hours away.The success of mail-in voting this year could mean that more people will vote by mail in the future, Bonier said. That could mean more election infrastructure that supports the sending and counting of these ballots – a process that caused some of the biggest legal fights of the election.“Historically, generally when people vote by mail once, they do it again. It is habit-forming,” he said. “What we’ll see in terms of the trend line is this election represented a massive spike in interest in mail voting, and some of that will recede, but we’ll settle at a point where far more people in this country will vote by mail in future elections than did prior to 2020.”Still, if states will continue to embrace the dramatic expansion of mail-in voting after a record turnout election. Republicans in Georgia, as well as Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina senator, have already suggested revisiting the rules around mail-in voting. Such an approach would fit in with a well-documented Republican strategy of trying to make it harder to vote to preserve the party’s power.“I think we could see some rolling back. It would be hard to justify that given how high turnout was, and the goal should be higher participation,” Bonier said. “But just given the polarization we’ve seen specifically on this issue of mail voting, it’s unreasonable to assume there won’t be at least some efforts to restrict mail voting in future elections.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6677c3579391592ad94837258fd40bf24ef932c6/0_81_6534_3919/master/6534.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=3fe1449bc215db5afeea9bad18b2655a","title":"anthony fauci apologises for implied criticism of speedy uk vaccine approval","story":"US diseases expert, appointed as Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, says he has ‘great confidence’ in British counterpartsAmerica’s leading infectious diseases scientist, Anthony Fauci, has apologised for implying that he thought Britain’s drug regulator had rushed through its coronavirus vaccine approval.His comments came a day after Britain became the first country to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine for general use, prompting some scepticism among European neighbours and suggestions of politicisation.Fauci, who leads the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the BBC: “I have a great deal of confidence in what the UK does both scientifically and from a regulator standpoint.“Our process is one that takes more time than it takes in the UK. And that’s just the reality,” he said, adding: “I did not mean to imply any sloppiness even though it came out that way.”Fauci had earlier described Britain’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) as having “ran around the corner of the marathon and joined it in the last mile” and “rushed through that approval”.He contrasted that with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which he said had been careful to avoid “cutting corners” because it did not want to fuel vaccine scepticism.“In fact, they were even rather severely criticised by their European Union counterparts who were saying, you know, ‘That was kind of a hotdog play’,” Fauci had said.Fauci made his original comments ahead of his first meeting with Joe Biden, after which the president-elect confirmed the doctor – who endured a difficult relationship with Donald Trump – would stay on as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and appointed him as chief medical adviser.June Raine, the head of the MHRA, had previously insisted that “no corners had been cut” in vetting the vaccine.The deputy chief medical officer for England, Jonathan Van-Tam, also hit back at critics, telling the BBC: “If you’re a regulator who’s slightly further behind, what do you say to justify your position that you are further behind? Words such as the ones we’ve heard perhaps.”Britain’s MHRA was also praised on Wednesday by Moncef Slaoui, a former pharmaceutical executive turned chief adviser to the US government’s Operation Warp Speed programme to develop Covid-19 vaccines and treatments.He told reporters on a call that the British agency was on a par with the FDA as the world’s best regulator and described it as being the “scientific engine” of the European Medicines Agency before Britain left that organisation following Brexit.An advisory panel of the FDA is holding a public meeting on 11 December to evaluate the same vaccine, and approval could follow shortly after.The EU for its part has insisted the bloc has not fallen behind.Germany’s health minister, Jens Spahn, addressing a videoconference of his EU colleagues, said on Wednesday: “The idea is not to be first, but to have a safe and efficient vaccine.“It is a matter of expertise, obviously, authorisation. But as we’ve seen from comments from the UK, it’s also a political issue for the European Union.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aaa23aa3a6cd7046727298eb59b18792381497ee/0_0_7022_4215/master/7022.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a921cc38a92bb56ad4944c055a2b51a8","title":"friday briefing crunch weekend in brexit deal talks","story":"Bill looms that would break withdrawal agreement … Biden: let’s all wear masks to kick off my presidency … Merkel heir-designate runs into troubleHello, Warren Murray with one more briefing to cap off the week.Senior EU diplomats on Thursday said Barnier was treading on some of the “red lines” set out for him in the negotiations, although they expected him not to go further. The Irish taoiseach, Micheál Martin, said the EU should trust in Barnier to deliver. “We are now at a very critical and sensitive point of the negotiations … I want to see a deal done and I believe a deal is possible.” Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said: “We are in the space of days not weeks. Closing out a negotiation as complex as this one is never going to be easy.” The wobble in the talks could tee up a long expected arbitration meeting between Boris Johnson and the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. Meanwhile, London Labour MPs have been told by City Hall that the public “overwhelmingly” wants them to back a Brexit deal, as Keir Starmer tries to avert a damaging party rift. After Labour’s crushing defeat in last December’s general election, Starmer is minded to whip his MPs to vote in favour of a deal, partly to send a message to Brexit voters whose seats Labour lost to the Tories.Mask America safe again – Joe Biden intends to call for all Americans to wear masks for 100 days after he becomes president. Biden also said that “when Dr Fauci says we have a vaccine and it’s safe” he would be willing to join Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama who have pledged to get vaccinated on TV.Fauci himself has apologised for appearing to criticise Britain’s speedy approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. “I did not mean to imply any sloppiness even though it came out that way,” said the leading US infectious diseases expert, whom Biden has just designated as his chief medical adviser. In the UK, NHS staff have been bumped down the vaccine priority list after a drastic rethink. Hospitals will instead begin by immunising care home staff, as well as hospital inpatients and outpatients aged over 80. NHS bosses have warned the 800,000 doses in the UK’s first consignment from Belgium may be “the only batch we receive for some time”. Doctors in England are meanwhile anxious that letting households mix over Christmas will lead to people infecting vulnerable relatives. Dr Susan Crossland, president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said: “In my opinion the relaxation of rules at Christmas is crass in the extreme.”Anyone seen Britain’s wallet? – The Bank of England has been rebuked for losing track of £50bn worth of banknotes. The Commons public accounts committee (PAC) said the equivalent of a stack of £5 notes more than 800 miles high had essentially gone “missing” because the Bank did not keep close enough tabs on cash usage. The National Audit Office says they may be in use overseas or in the UK. The PAC speculated that some might be stuffed under mattresses or circulating in the shadow economy. The Bank has said more people are probably hoarding cash during the Covid-19 pandemic. Meg Hillier, chair of the PAC, said: “£50bn of sterling notes – or about three-quarters of this precious and dwindling supply – is stashed somewhere but the Bank of England doesn’t know where, who by, or what for, and doesn’t seem very curious.”Merkel hard act to follow – In 15 years in power Angela Merkel has gained a reputation as Germany’s “Teflon chancellor” because her opponents’ criticism never seemed to stick. But her designated successor, Armin Laschet, is a magnet for bad press. When the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) started the race for a new leader in February, Laschet, premier of North-Rhine Westphalia state, was the frontrunner. But his talent for crisis management came under scrutiny when he pushed loudly to ease the nationwide lockdown – only to have to reimpose one in his own backyard, as infections took off in the town of Gütersloh.This week it emerged his state handed PPE contracts worth a total of €42.5m to a fashion company that pays his son to show its clothes on his Instagram channel. Laschet denies nepotism, saying the PPE offer had been the cheapest. In the meantime, approval ratings have soared for his rival, the Bavaria state leader, Markus Söder. Delegates will vote in a digital party congress in January. It is all a far cry from when everyone thought the current CDU leader, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer or “AKK”, would succeed Merkel – only for her to announce her resignation in February.Covid changes how we eat – Britons are drinking rosé all year round and firing up their barbecues in the depths of winter, according to a report on how food and drink trends have been “fundamentally reshaped” by the pandemic. Cooking at home has become the new commute, providing a clear separation between work and home time, while more than half of households have been more carefully planning recipes and meals. The annual report from Waitrose underlines a shift towards online shopping, initially triggered by initial lockdown but now set to stay. After panic-buying early in lockdown, more than half of respondents said they valued food more now and were wasting less, while pickling and fermenting and making the most of their freezers.Nice job, kid – A 15-year-old scientist and inventor has been named as Time magazine’s first “kid of the year”. Gitanjali Rao from Denver, Colorado has invented new technologies including a device that can identify lead in drinking water and an app and Chrome extension that uses artificial intelligence to detect cyberbullying.She said she hoped she could inspire others to dream up ideas to “solve the world’s problems”. Gitanjali was chosen from a field of 5,000 US-based nominees, which was whittled down to five finalists by a committee of young people alongside comedian and TV presenter Trevor Noah. Time began awarding its man of the year honour in 1927, later updating it to person of the year, but this is the first time it has named a kid of the year.Families across the UK are being allowed to gather over Christmas, even as tens of thousands of new coronavirus cases are recorded each day.

It is also going to be a challenging time for shoppers, as they try to get organised for a Christmas like never before with more than 40 shopping days taken from them almost overnight.We know the problems all too well, but we know the solution, too, or at least part of it.

Letterkenny has a 14-day incidence of 288.7, having fallen from above 300 a week ago. The latest figures show the 14-day incidence rate of the disease up to November 30th. Nationally the incidence rate of the virus stands at 87 cases per 100,000 population, and following the six week lockdown the country has one of the lowest rates of Covid-19 in Europe.Carndonagh local electoral area in Co Donegal, currently has the second highest incidence rate at 271.2.Dundalk-Carlingford in Co Louth, has the third highest rate (257.8), followed by two Donegal electoral areas of Milford (254.2) and Buncrana (250.4). Of the 10 local electoral areas with the highest rates of Covid-19, five are located in Co Donegal. The others are Cork City South local electoral area (243.1), Claremorris in Co Mayo (232.1), and Piltown (215.5) and Callan-Thomastown (201.1) in Kilkenny. Other areas with high rates of coronavirus included Adare-Rathkeale, Co Limerick, which recorded a 14-day incidence of 198.5, Dundalk South in Co Louth (194.2), Longford (174.5), Drogheda Rural, Co Louth (167.8), and Laytown-Bettystown, Co Meath (164.1). DublinIn Dublin, Blanchardstown-Mulhuddart, in the west of the county, had the highest incidence rate at 167.1. Throughout the pandemic data has shown higher rates of Covid-19 in the north and west of the capital, with lower rates in south Dublin. Ballymun-Finglas local electoral area had the second highest incidence (150.9), followed by the North East Inner City (141.5). Glencullen-Sandyford local electoral area in south Dublin had the lowest incidence in the capital at 49.2 cases per 100,000 population. Blackrock had the second lowest incidence at 62.3, followed by the Rush-Lusk local electoral area at 63.4.

Our wage bill ashore would be around €1.25 million but our wage bill with the fleet would be up around €10 million. Fishing is what keeps Beara going,” he said.Nolan’s claims are supported by a 2010 Bord Iascaigh Mhara report on the importance of the sea for Castletownbere and surrounding areas. In the end, it concluded that 81 per cent of everything that happens in the town depends on the sea.Despite consolidation and fleet reduction seen elsewhere, Castletownbere has maintained its numbers, leaving it, in October 2020, as the State’s second biggest fishing port after Killybegs and, the largest white fish fishing port. Each €1 million worth of fish land generates €2.2 million on land.Killybegs is primarily a pelagic fishing port. In Irish terms, this means mackerel and herring. In Castletownbere, the focus is on demersal or white fish such as hake, cod, haddock, plaice, sole, monkfish and megrim. All of which command higher prices.So, while the 235,085 tonnes of mostly pelagic fish landed in Killybegs up to October were worth €108 million, Castletownbere’s far smaller haul of 34,613 tonnes – including 26,562 tonnes of whitefish was worth nearly €106 million.Given the importance of fishing to Beara, it is little wonder that Nolan and fishermen like Damian Turner of the Irish South and West Fishermen’s Producer Organisation are anxiously looking towards Brussels and London.Expressing scepticism that Boris Johnson sees fisheries as some latter-day totemic Britannia battle, Nolan points to the history of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), the issue of quotas and how they were allocated in the beginning, and now.Economic zonesLooking to a map on his office door, Nolan points out the plethora of the Roman numeral-marked symbols that sets out fishing areas, the types of species, and the quantities of them that can be capturedThe Common Fisheries Policy sets quotas ever year, or every two years for each species in fishing areas designated by the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas. Each state is given a quota based upon the Total Allowable Catch and its traditional share of that.“The one thing that we have that is good here in Ireland is that the Irish quotas belong to the Irish people – you get an allocation off the government on a monthly basis for some species, seasonally for others, but you don’t own the quota, it is retained by the Irish people.“In the UK in contrast, you own the quota so if I’ve a fishing boat, I can turn around and sell the quota and sell it as a business to the Norwegians or the Dutch and a huge amount of British quota is now controlled by the Norwegians and the Dutch, particularly when it comes to mackerel.”The British may say that they have been wronged by the EU over the amount of fishing waters they have been given under the CFP, but the only place where they genuinely have a complaint is along the South coast of England where they compete with the French.“Boris has nailed his colours to mast on fishing and has been very jingoistic about it, talking about ‘Taking back our waters’ but the reality is that for the last 20 years, British fishermen have been selling their quotas out the backdoor to anyone with a cheque book.”Within the EU, prior to Britain’s departure, the UK controlled the largest amount of fishing waters with its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) covering some 743,965 sq kms followed by Spain with 560,957 sq kms, Ireland with 425,346 sq kms and France with 344,395 sq kms.The British EEZ extends north, to off the Norwegian coast, down the North Sea, tapering to half way across the English Channel and down to the Channel Islands and then back up the Irish Sea before looping around Northern Ireland, extending 200 miles west of Scotland.The area includes many rich fishing grounds in both the Irish Sea and the Celtic Sea such as the Labardie Bank, the Jones Bank and the Smalls as well as fishing grounds off Rockall, all of which are fished by Irish trawlers for whitefish, pelagics or shellfish.‘Paper fish’Chairman of the Irish South and West Fisherman’s Organisation, Damian Turner, who targets white fish in his trawler, Roise Caitríona, is worried, too, that a talks collapse could see Irish boats blocked from fishing in UK waters.His concerns are twofold - not only will Irish boats no longer have full access to rich fishing grounds like Labardie and the Smalls, which Ireland shares with the UK, they will now face added competition from Spanish and French boats which will also be displaced and are likely to look to Irish waters for fish.“The UK has about 30 per cent of EU fishing opportunities but if it leaves without a fishing deal, the Irish zone will then hold the majority of fish available to be caught by the EU fleet so Ireland will have lost out on what we take from UK waters and our waters will become the target for other EU boats.”Turner says that in such a scenario where displaced Spanish and French trawlers start fishing in areas like the Porcupine Bank some 180km off the West coast, the number of such vessels would have to be limited to ensure stocks can be protected.“Even if a deal is done, where is Barnier getting his €117 million of fish that he is offering to the UK – it’s paper fish – nobody knows if the fish are going to be in UK waters – fish don’t recognise borders – what’s in UK waters today could be in Irish waters next week or vice versa.”Pierside, Turner’s thoughts on displacement are echoed by local skipper Ross Minihane, who with his father and brother, employ 50 crew on their four boats, the Alannah Reilly, the Dawn Ross, the Sarah David and Ocean Venture II.“This year with the Alannah Reilly, we would have spent five months fishing in English waters. We would have spent three months on the Jones Bank 40 miles from the Scilly Isles. It’s good prawn ground but we are only going there because we don’t have enough prawn quota here.“There are plenty of prawns in the Porcupine Bank off the west coast but we haven’t been given enough quota there for years – instead we have to go into UK waters which now accounts for 40per cent of the income of the boat and if we are displaced from UK waters, we lose that income.”Dinah Busher from Kilmore Quay in Wexford has disembarked from her family’s boat, the Ellie Adhamh and she nods in agreement as she tells how she too fishes for prawn in the Labardie Bank – shared by Ireland and the UK – because she hasn’t enough quota in the Porcupine.“We fish for prawn in the Labardie and we also fish for cuttlefish – cuttlefish is a member of the squid family like octopus but it’s not governed by quota – and we fish for the cuttlefish in UK waters - we spend five months based in the UK, operating out of Plymouth or Brixham in Devon.“But if there isn’t a deal done to allow us to continue to fish in UK waters, then that’s all off limits to us and we’re losing out on five months of income – fishing is tough enough as it – the price of prawn has fallen because Covid has closed all the restaurants in Europe so demand dropped hugely.“To be forced out of UK waters and then having to compete with French and Spanish boats that have bigger quotas than us in our own waters – it’s unbelievable – it doesn’t make sense – we are struggling to survive and yet other boats have bigger quotas than us in our own waters.”Ross agrees and says the solution is simple: “We fish around Rockall for squid, which like cuttlefish isn’t governed by quotas, but to get there we have to steam through monk and megrim fishing grounds and see French and Spanish boats fishing for them when we don’t have quota for them.“There is plenty of fishing Irish waters if the EU gives us the quota – we shouldn’t be begging to go to someone else’s waters – we have the richest fishing grounds in the world but we’re not being given enough quota in our own waters – that’s the only reason we’re fishing in UK waters.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsIn the plague-deserted halls of academe, lonely professors wept for joy into their dusty mortar boards.White-coated boffins abandoned microscopes in shiny laboratories and danced around the test tubes. What a day for the planet. What a day.First the vaccine, and now this.It could have been perfect. But no, the Taoiseach had to go and ruin it all by deliberately trying to kill rural Ireland stone dead for the sheer hell of it. “Stop nailing the lid on the coffin of rural Ireland!” roared Limerick TD Richard O’Donoghue in the Dáil on Wednesday, glaring with horror at Micheál Martin. At least they didn’t know about this in the universities, institutes and seats of higher learning across the globe, where celebrations continued long into the night. The second big breakthrough came in the way they tend to do: unexpected and all of a sudden. It happened early in the afternoon from high on a balcony in the auditorium of Dublin’s Contention Centre when a certain Independent TD for Kerry rose to his feet and tackled the Taoiseach on the continued closure of country ale-houses under Covid restrictions. ‘Scientific proof’“Where is your evidence?” bellowed Danny Healy-Rae. “Where is your scientific proof that pubs in rural Ireland were or would be the cause of transmission of the virus?” That would be Danny “I believe God above is in charge of the weather” Healy-Rae, famous denier of the science of “this climate change thing”. The one and the very same Danny – fairy forts are causing dips in the roads – Healy-Rae, demanding to hear empirical evidence for shuttering pubs serving alcohol without the ballast of food because they are supposedly more conducive to the spread of coronavirus than their fancy-schmancy gastro cousins.“Where is that evidence, Taoiseach?” he persisted, itching to run his slide rule over the scientific data. “If you have it, bring it forward because you haven’t put it out there yet.”The shock news of deputy Healy-Rae’s belated conversion to the value of evidential science pulsed around the global research community. Leading experts were further cheered and encouraged when they saw images of the formerly sceptic influencer speaking in the Dáil – he had three biros neatly arranged, caps pointing uniformly upward, in his shirt pocket. One of their own, now.Denouncing the Government’s decision to keep “wet” pubs closed during the partial reopening of hospitality businesses in the run-up to Christmas, DHR accused the Taoiseach of hurting and “belittling” thousands of rural-based publicans and their patrons. The move was “anti-village” and would lead to unregulated drinking where “we’ll need good strong jeeps and vehicles to find them”.Danny’s cri de coeur echoed an earlier, equally impassioned plea from his Rural Independent Group colleague, Mattie McGrath, who berated the Taoiseach for destroying the pub, dance and arts industry with the latest Level 3 restrictions. ‘Summarily dismissed’Despite huge efforts to achieve compliance with the guidelines during the recent lockdown, they have been “summarily dismissed” and told not to reopen. “I want you to get real and tell us what you have got against the pubs … the dancing schools and the artists. It’s totally illogical what you’re doing and it’s unfair.”The virus kills people and the only motivation behind any of the moves his Government is making is to protect lives. “It is wrong of you, deputy, to play politics with it by asking the rhetorical question: ‘What have you against pubs?’”As an old school Fianna Fáil TD, Micheál has been holding constituency clinics in public houses the length and breadth of his constituency well before the gastro-pub became a thing. His irritation with the question and its implication that he has it in for publicans was palpable. “I have absolutely nothing against pubs,” he protested. “Don’t be so silly. For God’s sake, it’s too serious an issue to reduce it to that.” The measure was taken for public health reasons because lives are at risk. “The Government has the pubs ruined,” interjected Michael Collins, one of Mattie’s Rural Independent sidekicks. Collins returned to the ruination of the country pubs after Danny Healy-Rae’s touching decision to come out of the science closet. “It is quite obvious you are protecting the pubs in Dublin,” declared the Cork South West Independent – a shocking allegation to level against a Cork South Central Taoiseach. Michael Collins was cynically saying what he wants his constituents to hear, but if he holds his nose and endures a walk around Dublin – or any other part of urban Ireland – he will discover that the suffering and angst is far from confined to lounge bar owners off the beaten track. ‘Very foolish man’“It will never be forgotten in every town and village in rural Ireland for what you have done to those pubs. I can assure you Taoiseach if you think it will be forgotten, you’re a very foolish man in this hour of your life,” foamed the fulminating Collins. He was followed by a fourth RIG member, Richard O’Donoghue from Limerick county, who reeled off the names of villages within a 15-mile radius of his home in Granagh where not one pub is open. “You’re shoving them into towns and cities if they want to meet someone.” Like Danny Healy-Rae, he wondered who would police the parties when people congregate in private instead. This drink thing is very confusing. One minute it’s all about the lonely aul lads who just want the odd glass of stout and some company before tootling home in the car of an evening, and now it’s about them haring away on booze-fuelled all-night benders because the local is shut. It only gets worse because the gastro-pubs are a problem too. It’s not that long ago since Danny was objecting to the new Bill to tighten the drink-driving laws and arguing, among other things, that having a big feed before driving is almost as bad as having a few gargles.“If you eat too much and get in behind the wheel of a car, then you’re a danger on the road because you are likely to fall asleep after eating a big meal,” he told an Oireachtas committee examining the legislation.Even if there was no pandemic you’d be nearly afraid to leave the house after thinking about it. In fairness though, this was before Danny embraced the science.The Taoiseach wearily insisted to the RIGers he is neither anti-rural nor anti-village nor anti-jobs. The current situation is nobody’s fault, he said. It’s the fault of a virus, a global pandemic.Which, of course, is totally fake news. It is clearly the fault of Dem Above in Dublin.Sensible green tea man Micheál heaved the heaviest sigh. “There is nothing I would like better right now than a pint in some rural pub in an idyllic village in the west of Ireland.”It was one o’clock in the afternoon.Who could blame him.

Photograph: Tolga AkmenAFPGettyTalks between EU and British negotiators continued in London on Thursday night amid warnings that significant gaps remained as time was running out to reach a deal.Stefaan De Rynck, a senior adviser to EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier, told a seminar in Brussels that the talks were “probably past kilometre 40” in a 42km marathon.“The long and the short story is that talks are continuing in London. Significant ergences remain. Both sides are working hard to overcome them, but the outcome is uncertain,” he said.Most of the legal text of an agreement running to hundreds of pages has already been agreed, but differences remain on fisheries, the level playing field of fair competition guarantees, and how the agreement should be enforced.Sources close to both sides said that talks could continue through Friday and perhaps the weekend, with British prime minister Boris Johnson expected to speak to European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen before any final breakthrough is possible.Mr Johnson’s official spokesman said on Thursday that the prime minister still intended on Monday to restore to the Internal Market Bill treaty-breaking clauses that were removed by the House of Lords.The clauses would allow British ministers to breach the Brexit withdrawal agreement by deciding unilaterally how to implement parts of the Northern Ireland protocol.The spokesman also confirmed that the British government would next week introduce a taxation bill that is expected to include clauses allowing British ministers to determine which goods moving from Britain to the North should be considered at risk of moving into the EU single market and are subject to tariffs.Mr Barnier said this week that either legislative move would make agreeing a trade deal very difficult.France has been among the EU states most resistant to British demands for a much greater share of the fish in its own territorial waters. But during a visit on Thursday to France’s biggest fishing port, prime minister Jean Castex said his country’s fishermen must prepare for a new era.“It is a negotiation and a negotiation must lead to compromises. And we must be with you in these compromises,” he said. “A new era is about to begin. I would like there to be a specific support plan.”Best countryMeanwhile, Britain’s education secretary Gavin Williamson on Thursday contradicted health secretary Matt Hancock’s assertion that Brexit had allowed Britain to approve a coronavirus vaccine earlier than other countries, instead insisting it was because Britain was the best country.“I just reckon we’ve got the very best people in this country and we’ve obviously got the best medical regulators – much better than the French, much better than the Belgians have, much better than the Americans have. That doesn’t surprise me at all because we’re a much better country than every single one of them,” he told LBC radio.“I think just being able to get on with things, deliver it and the brilliant people in our medical regulator making it happen means that people in this country are going to be the first ones in the world to get that Pfizer vaccine.”\u0026nbspDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

And I think we’ll see a significant reduction.’ Photograph: Ruth FremsonThe New York TimesJoe Biden will ask Americans to commit to 100 days of wearing masks as one of his first acts as president, stopping just short of the nationwide mandate he pushed before to stop the spread of coronavirus.The move marks a notable shift from president Donald Trump, whose own scepticism of mask-wearing has contributed to a politicisation of the issue.That has made many people reticent to embrace a practice that public health experts say is one of the easiest ways to manage the pandemic, which has killed more than 275,000 Americans.The president-elect has frequently emphasised mask-wearing as a “patriotic duty” and during the campaign floated the idea of instituting a nationwide mask mandate, which he later acknowledged would be beyond the ability of the president to enforce.Speaking with CNN’s Jake Tapper, Mr Biden said he would make the request of Americans on inauguration day, January 20th.“On the first day I’m inaugurated, I’m going to ask the public for 100 days to mask. Just 100 days to mask — not forever, just 100 days.

organic matter recovered from the treatment of sewage - which was due to be recycled as an organic soil conditioner. Police sought to play down concerns that there was any ongoing risk to the public, but urged people to continue to “avoid the area if possible”. One witness, who said he worked in a building around 900 metres away from the waste recycling centre, described how a “shockwave shook the building”.“The shutter door made the strangest noise I’ve ever heard,” he added.Another man who had been working around half a mile from the scene said “all our windows rattled”. A helicopter on the scene following the explosionJawad Burhan, who had been in a warehouse directly opposite the site, spoke of his conversation with a distraught worker leaving the scene of the blast.I started asking \u0027what\u0027s happening here?\u0027 and one of the workers told me there had been a big explosion and he told me that they had one or two missing people, this was around 10 minutes after the explosion,” he told Sky News.The worker who was there was inside the warehouse and he told me \u0027I don\u0027t need to talk about this anymore, I lost my colleague and I don\u0027t know if I lost more and more\u0027 - it\u0027s a really bad moment for everyone.”The plant was set up by Wessex Water in 2009 to operate under the name Geneco and it treats more than 700,000 tonnes of waste every year.The waste is transformed into “usable products such as biofertilisers and renewable sourced gas and electricity powering many thousands of local homes”, according to Geneco’s website. Boris Johnson and Priti Patel were among the politicians to offer their condolences in the aftermath of the explosion. Darren Jones, the MP for Bristol North West, said he was “conscious this is the second serious incident in Avonmouth” in recent weeks, after a major fire at a metal recycling plant. He said: Once our emergency services have resolved this incident and helped any injured workers, I’ll be calling on the Environment Agency and the Health and Safety Executive and others to ensure lessons are being learnt for the future.”Colin Skellett, the chief executive of Wessex Water, said: “We are absolutely devastated that the tragic incident at our site earlier today has resulted in four fatalities.“Our thoughts are with the families, friends and colleagues of those involved.“We are working with the Health and Safety Executive to understand what happened and why.”Avon and Somerset ConstabularyTravel latest news: Quarantine exemption for business travellers prompts backlashPolitics latest news: France threatens to veto Brexit dealHow the UK will get Pfizer\u0026#39s Covid vaccine from factory to patientCoronavirus latest news: Care home residents stopped from hugging visitors amid \u0026#39safety concerns\u0026#39 of rapid tests The priority list for the Pfizer vaccine -

There aren’t that many appetising dishes you can make from sludge. Singapore this week became the first government to approve the sale of cultured meat to the public. The nugget in question is made by a US company, Eat Just, by growing cells extracted from living animals. These are put in a petri dish and fed with a nutrient-rich solution including bovine fetal serum: blood drawn from the foetus of a cow. Once the cells have begun to ide and multiply, they are placed in a bioreactor and fed with more of this life-giving slop. The resulting mush is then mixed with other ingredients to make something with enough texture and flavour to be turned into a nugget.New technology like this is about to “disrupt” the food system on a grand scale, as scientists search for ways to feed the planet without destroying the planet. Lab grown meat gets all the attention because of its Frankenstein qualities. But other futuristic foods are closer to commercial viability. Aeroponic crops, grown without sunlight, soil or water precision fermentation, which produces vats of protein powder from thin air farmed seaweed farmed algae farmed insects. We’re not just talking novelty packets of fried crickets, either, but huge industrial units seething with black soldier flies, to be ground up and fed to livestock as a sustainable alternative to grain.Revolting, eh? And yet, if we are honest with ourselves, not nearly as revolting as the status quo. Consider the production of a “normal” chicken nugget – 2.3 billion of which are eaten every year in the US alone. It begins, typically, with the miserable end of the miserable life of an intensively-farmed animal. At around six weeks old, the future nugget is either gassed to death or hung up by its legs and dipped into an electrified bath of water, before having its throat cut. The meat is then stripped from its breast and ground into a paste. In most cases, this paste is bulked out with other, cheaper ingredients – connective tissue, ground bone, and such like – before being battered, fried and gobbled up by hungry teenagers on their lunch break.If humans can learn to eat that with relish, we can surely adapt to anything. We moved house earlier this year, and reluctantly inherited a small pond. Motherhood makes one instinctively wary of bodies of water, even when they are only three feet deep. I had vague apprehensions of danger, mess and laborious upkeep, and my husband had to talk me out of filling it in. This would have been an all-too common act of environmental vandalism. A group of scientists this week called on the Government to do more to protect “small waters”, such as ponds and ditches, which can provide “critical bioersity hotspots”.Our own pond, in urban east London, contains frogs, sticklebacks, water boatmen and even leeches. In summer it is full of newts, performing a languid breaststroke between the lily pads. Blue tits flutter around its edges, occasionally plucking a tasty leech from the shallows. Cats and foxes come to the pond to drink, leaning into the water with their hindquarters in the air like buffaloes at a watering hole. It is a hotspot indeed: not just of bioersity, but of beauty, education and pure, meditative pleasure.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"primary school pupils outvote teachers wanted rename school","story":"A primary school has decided not to rename itself after one of the UK\u0027s first black headteachers after its pupils voted against the move.Beckford Primary School got its name from 18th Century slave owner, William Beckford, and governors agreed to change it in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests in June.Parents, staff and students were given the option to rebrand the school as Gilroy Primary School, after Beryl Gilroy who was the headteacher for 14 years from 1968 - making her one of the first black heads in Britain.A campaign was launched in favour of Gilroy, and received support from more than 750 people, including Oscar winner and former pupil Dame Emma Thompson.But despite teachers voting overwhelmingly in favour of the teacher, four in five pupils voted for something else - as did three quarters of the parents.The other two names put to the vote were West Hampstead Primary School, which won, and Broomsleigh School - the school\u0027s original 19th century name.Ms Gilroy who ran the Beckford in 1968-1982 and became an education expert and author described by the British Library archive to be the most extensively published Caribbean writers of her time.The petition backing naming the school after Ms Gilroy said: Given the reasons to be reconsidering the name of the school, re-naming this great school after Beryl Gilroy would be the perfect way of addressing contemporary concerns while also honouring the school\u0027s history of successful inclusion and ersity.Many, including Ms Gilroy\u0027s daughter Darla, had hoped that the school\u0027s new name change would send strong message for future generations of pupils.But pupils and parents at the school - which is in Fortune Green ward - overwhelmingly voted against Gilroy in favour of West Hampstead.A breakdown of the voting showed that of 393 children to vote, 55 per cent wanted West Hampstead Primary School, 25 per cent Broomsleigh, and 20 per cent Gilroy.Of the 220 parents to vote, 53 per cent wanted West Hampstead Primary School, 24 per cent Gilroy, and 23 per cent Broomsleigh.Of the staff, 50 per cent wanted Gilroy, 27 per cent said West Hampstead and 23 per cent Broomsleigh.The decision was approved by the governing body on Tuesday.The rebirth of the school has allowed the head to put in place a new curriculum that will include lessons on its history.William Beckford, an MP and former mayor of London who owned a house in West Hampstead, North London, near the school had made a vast fortune on the backs of hundreds of slaves working on his sugar plantations in Jamaica.The school’s headteacher Sam Drake said: The renaming of the school gives us an unparalleled opportunity to design and enact a new curriculum that is in line with our school values.I, along with the rest of the staff cannot wait to share it with our children whilst ensuring that our school continues to be a special place for them to learn and thrive.A mural of Beryl Gilroy will be unveiled at the school after the new name change comes into force in September.The chair of governors Madhavan Raman added: Whilst we are starting a new chapter in our school\u0027s history, we mustn\u0027t forget the pivotal role that Beckford Primary School has played in so many people\u0027s lives over the years.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"britons must eat less meat colossal net zero target achieved","story":"Meeting the UK\u0027s legal target to cut emissions to net zero to curb climate change is a colossal challenge, the National Audit Office (NAO) has warned, with people needing to eat less meat and drive electric cars to achieve it. The UK has enshrined the goal to reach net zero emissions by 2050 in law, which means cutting greenhouse gases as much as possible and offsetting remaining pollution by planting trees or using technology to capture carbon.The NAO said the costs of achieving net zero were highly uncertain.But the costs of failing to act would be far greater because of the need to adapt to substantial changes in climate, such as building flood defences and dealing with the impacts on health of higher temperatures, the report said.The NAO also said the Government needs to spearhead a concerted national effort to achieve net zero, which would be likely to involve widespread changes to people\u0027s lives such as driving electric cars or eating less meat.The Government will need to engage actively and constructively with all those who will need to play a part - across the public sector, with industry and with citizens - to inject the necessary momentum, it said.The report said the Business Department (Beis) and Treasury are not collating the total costs and benefits of policies that contribute to net zero, adding they should gather information on how much the Government is spending to achieve net zero, how much has been committed and how much it has spent, including the cost of policies on consumer bills.Plans by Beis to set out a clear net zero strategy before UN Cop26 climate talks in Glasgow in November 2021 are a critical step for achieving the emissions cuts, to help identify people, policies and funding, the NAO added.The report also warned that the departments responsible for delivering net zero have yet to put in place what they need for effective cross-government working and processes to make sure all of government steps up to the challenge.Gareth Davies, head of the NAO, said: While emissions have reduced steadily in recent years, achieving net zero is an enormously challenging long-term project, which will require well thought-out cross-government co-ordination to drive unprecedented changes across society and the economy.Government needs to step up to the challenge, ensuring it has a clear strategy to achieve its goal and accurately monitoring progress.It will have to reach outside of Whitehall and bring together the public sector, industry and all of us as citizens in a co-ordinated national effort ning decades.Responding to the report, Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee, said the net zero target was daunting.The Government hasn\u0027t put its own house in order yet or done enough to put the UK on course to meet older, easier targets. It\u0027s time to lead by example and shift its efforts up a gear, she said.Next year\u0027s strategy can\u0027t be hot air it needs to set out what every part of Government is going to do, what the Government expects others to do and how it is going to make sure everyone pulls their weight.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 4th december 2020","story":"Blue, the border collie having fun in the snow with his master on the Cathkin Braes overlooking the City of Glasgow, Scotland, UK.Travel latest news: Quarantine exemption for business travellers prompts backlashPolitics latest news: France threatens to veto Brexit dealHow the UK will get Pfizer\u0026#39s Covid vaccine from factory to patientCoronavirus latest news: Care home residents stopped from hugging visitors amid \u0026#39safety concerns\u0026#39 of rapid tests The priority list for the Pfizer vaccine - and how it will be rolled outWhat exactly is the Pfizer vaccine, who will get it, and is it safe?Inauguration Day 2021: when is Joe Biden sworn in as US president, and what will it look like during Covid-19?Covid-19 vaccine: Latest updates on Oxford, Moderna and Pfizer breakthroughs - and who will get it first?US expert Anthony Fauci \u0026#39did not mean to imply sloppiness\u0026#39 in UK\u0026#39s rapid vaccine approvalGyms are open: what the new tier rules mean for fitness centres post-lockdownCan I meet up with friends and family?

Searches for healthy recipes on Waitrose, was up 134 per cent compared to pre-pandemic times.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"travel news restrictions corridors covid tests business travellers","story":"Business travellers arriving in England will be allowed to skip quarantine from tomorrowTravel quarantine to be cut from 14 days to 5 – all your questions answered ​The 23 countries you can (feasibly) visitHow to get a Covid test for your holidayCan I go on holiday? What the new tier system means for getaways ​Sign up to the  Travel newsletterThe Government is facing growing anger over its decision to allow business travellers to skip quarantine when arriving from high-risk countries.The Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps, announced yesterday that ‘high-value’ executives will not need to self-isolate upon arrival in England from December 5, while holidaymakers returning from countries on the ‘red list’ still have to quarantine.The move, recommended by the Global Travel Taskforce, has prompted accusations of hypocrisy from Labour politicians, who have pointed out that millions of people living in Tier 3 have been told not to travel.Jim McMahon, the Shadow Transport Secretary, said: If this government was serious about supporting the economy and jobs it would bring forward a proper package of financial support for businesses and the self-employed and a comprehensive plan for airport testing. Instead we have Tory ministers announcing loopholes for those they consider \u0027high-value\u0027.Performing artists certified by the Arts Council, TV crews, journalists, and elite athletes have also been granted quarantine exemptions, although strict conditions stipulate they will “only be exempt when undertaking the specific business activity and will only be able to meet with others as required by that specific activity.”The announcement came immediately after Mr Shapps confirmed that there will be no changes to the travel corridor list this week, leaving the number of restriction-free holiday options at just 23 destinations.Scroll down for more updates.​There have been growing calls for the Government to open up business travel for some months now, with industry experts throwing a  spotlight on the billions of pounds it contributes to the UK economy each year.Tracey Edginton, Head of Press at Visit Britain, has posted a helpful summary:Heathrow is planning to charge drivers £5 to drop off loved ones from next year in what they claim is part of a “green initiative,” writes Oliver Gill.Airport bosses claim the new charge will encourage travellers to use public transport and help it reach its sustainability goals. In a move that threatens to enrage legions of travellers as Britain re-emerges from the pandemic, the airport is set to impose a “Forecourt Access Charge”.Heathrow said the charge would protect the business financially after racking up £1.5 billion of losses in 2020, while preventing a “car led airport recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic” Manchester, Stansted and Birmingham airports already charge drivers from drop-offs. Gatwick has announced plans to introduce a tariff in the future.Read the full storyThe vast majority of people are being discouraged from booking holidays by the complex and often conflicting Covid rules that now govern international travel.Skyscanner\u0027s global marketing, brand and content senior director Jo McClintock said: “People want to travel and we know there is pent-up demand from the searches we are seeing for flights and for more information, but confidence has been hit by the lack of consistency between countries worldwide regarding measures and restrictions. “Consumers just do not understand the complex rules and are crying out for transparent, detailed information.”As might be expected, the business travel industry has welcomed the move to open up travel for some workers, although Clive Wratten, CEO of The Business Travel Association (BTA) has urged ministers to extend quarantine exemption to other sectors. However, business travel takes many forms and all should be exempt. Engineers, humanitarian workers, retail buyers and many other professionals travelling for work are all crucial to the UK economy.Here\u0027s yesterday evening\u0027s travel update from Grant Shapps, confirming the groups who will be exempt from quarantine restrictions from tomorrow:Before we start, here are yesterday\u0027s top travel stories:Business travellers, along with a clutch of other professions, will be exempt from quarantine after December 5No new travel corridors, howeverTravel to Wales from Tier 1 and Tier 2 areas of England and Scotland is permitted againDespite a vaccine, industry insiders fear travel will not return to normal until 2022Politics latest news: France threatens to veto Brexit dealHow the UK will get Pfizer\u0026#39s Covid vaccine from factory to patientCoronavirus latest news: Care home residents stopped from hugging visitors amid \u0026#39safety concerns\u0026#39 of rapid tests The priority list for the Pfizer vaccine - and how it will be rolled outWhat exactly is the Pfizer vaccine, who will get it, and is it safe?Inauguration Day 2021: when is Joe Biden sworn in as US president, and what will it look like during Covid-19?Covid-19 vaccine: Latest updates on Oxford, Moderna and Pfizer breakthroughs - and who will get it first?US expert Anthony Fauci \u0026#39did not mean to imply sloppiness\u0026#39 in UK\u0026#39s rapid vaccine approvalGyms are open: what the new tier rules mean for fitness centres post-lockdownCan I meet up with friends and family?

Q. Vaccines usually take years to develop, so how can the Covid- vaccination be safeit’s ready in months  Professor Van-Tam: These vaccines have been through phase one, phase two and phase three, just like ordinary vaccines. With the Pfizer vaccine, I think the total clinical trial size is something like , the AstraZeneca results so far reported are based on just over , volunteers – there’s at least another , to follow, and the number size for Moderna is very similar. These are very, very big studies. The numbers involved were essentially the same as you’d expect for a normal peacetime vaccine, and on top of that the safety assessments and the assessments of effectiveness at the end are the same. Dr Raine: The public can be completely confident that Covid- vaccines will only be available once they have met robust standards of safety, quality and effectiveness. As Covid- is a public health emergency, scientic evaluation and approval is being done in the shortest time possible while complying with established and robust safety, quality and effectiveness standards. Extensive knowledge on vaccine development with existing vaccines is applied. Safety is our watchword. Everyone can be absolutely clear that the standards that need to be met, will be met. I am completely confident that there has been no pressure whatsoever on the agency and our expert staff to pass the vaccine. None at all. Q. How have you decided who gets the vaccine first  Dr Ramsay: We looked at a lot of data showing who was getting infection and who was dying from infection. The primary thing the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationlooked at was death rates by age, by clinical factors, and by any other factors that GPs could measure, such as deprivation, geography or ethnicity. It’s very clear the death rate is much higher as you get older, particularly over . That’s why we’re prioritising people in older age groups, then coming down in age, picking up people who are clinically vulnerable and those who have underlying conditions along the way. Those working in health and social care will be high on the list as well – they are at risk because they’re getting exposed to infection every day and they may be spreading it to others. The same goes for care home workers – they’re a very high priority.  Q. Will the vaccine prevent disease or just reduce symptoms   Professor Van-Tam: If you’re going to prevent transmission you need a vaccine that is taking out the illness and also the asymptomatic infections. There are some signs from AstraZeneca that this might be the case. That does not mean the other vaccines where results have already been announced or that are or are still in development, don’t also reduce transmission it’s just we don’t know at this point in time. We hope they will because they’ll have a bigger effectthey can take out transmission. Q. Are there any side effects  Dr Ramsay: All the side effects are predictable – the kind of thing you get with other vaccines: a sore arm, bit of a temperature or feeling a bit fatigued, so we’re expecting it to have a similar safety profile to other vaccines. Professor Van-Tam: Every single vaccine authorised for use in the UK has been authorised by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency . The three components of authorisation are a safety assessment, an effectiveness assessment and a manufacturing quality assessment – all three need to be ticked before anything is authorised. But there is not a single medicine without side effects. Is it possible that rare side effects could come to light that you’d never pick up in a clinical trial of ,-, patients  Yes, it is – but that’s no dferent from any other medicine.  Q. How will the vaccine be rolled out  Dr Ramsay: The actual act of giving the injection isn’t particularly skillful – all nurses are trained and most vaccines are given by nurses, but with the flu jab we use health care assistants. The key thing is they work under the supervision of nurses. I think there’s going to be a lot of dferent models used because, for example, with elderly, frail people they’re clearly not going to drive to the nearest centre – you might have to take vaccine to them in their home. The hospitals will probably be doing their staff, then there will potentially be these vaccination sites which will probably be more important for the slightly younger population who can drive there. Q. Is there anyone who shouldn’t have it   Dr Ramsay: A reason to defer a vaccination is being pregnant – that’s just being precautionary. We don’t expect there to be a problem, but without having the vaccine tested on pregnant women we’ll probably recommend they wait until after they’ve had the baby. Similarly, it hasn’t been tested in children, although a teenager would probably respond similarly to a young adult so they could likely have the vaccine. Q. Will it be available privately  Professor Van-Tam: I don’t know, but I think it would be a bad thing for public healththe rich and privileged were able to pay their way to the front of the queue, leaving someone at very high risk and not wealthy low down the list – and they would be there’s going to be a global shortage of these vaccines. So I’m opposed to that. Q.

The UK’s current trading arrangements with the bloc expire at the end of the month, leaving little time to get a deal agreed by negotiators and approved by the EU’s leaders, Westminster and the European Parliament. Hopes of an imminent deal appear to be fading after Thursday’s negotiations in London between the teams led by Lord Frost and the EU’s Michel Barnier. A senior UK Government source said: “At the th hour, the EU is bringing new elements into the negotiation. “A breakthrough is still possible in the next few days but that prospect is receding.”Meanwhile, Boris Johnson will press ahead with plans allowing ministers to tear up the Brexit orce deal he has already agreed, despite the current round of UK-EU talks being at a critical stage.The Government will ask MPs to reinstate controversial legislation giving ministers the power to break international law by ignoring provisions in the Withdrawal Agreement relating to Northern Ireland. MPs will vote on the UK Internal Market Bill on Monday, potentially throwing the talks on a UK-European Union trade deal into deep crisis unless an agreement can be reached by then. The EU has already taken the first steps in a legal action over the legislation. The Government will also introduce the TaxationBill, which reportedly includes measures to override parts of the orce deal struck by the Prime Minister and the EU in . MPs will be asked to reinsert the controversial Northern Ireland provisions into the UK Internal Market Bill after the Lords voted to remove them. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “We have been clear that those clauses represent a legal safety net to protect the integrity of the UK’s internal market and to protect the huge gains of the peace process.” The Taxation Bill will include “measures which are required to prepare for the end of the transition period”. Askedthat would include the power to waive tarfs on goods crossing the Irish Sea, the spokesman said the details would be set out next week.

Being quizzed by a wedding planner during a Facebook QA the PM didnapost offer any more concrete support for the industry.But pushed he did reveal that he thinks it is safe for couples to start putting down plans for their big day - so long as it is in the summer of next year. Pushed on what he could do to support wedding planners - who have seen their businesses collapse as people lack the confidence to plan big events - Mr Johnson said: “If you are thinking about the summer, I think you will be alright. “It’s my strong hope and belief that by the summer, one way or the other, whether by vaccination, which I hope and believe we will have delivered by Easter, as I say, or by lateral flow testing, we’ll be in a dferent world. “So, my hope is that by summer it really will be a dferent world for the weddings and events industry.” While this isnapost a full cast iron guarantee, it is the strongest hint that ministers have yet given that full wedding ceremonies and receptions will be able to begin. Asked about his own wedding plans, Mr Johnson said: “I didn’t want to drag that in, but, anyway, I’ll take that one offline, as they say. “I think mass testing will help before Easter, hopefully, well before Easter, but I think you should be able to plan for a really much more active summer, and lots of happy nuptial events all over the UK.”  In response to another question  suggested teachers would have to rely on testing rather than vaccines to help manage coronavirus disruption.The Prime Minister said that the joint committee on vaccination and immunisationhad drawn up a “pretty sensible list” prioritising the elderly and vulnerable, as well as health and care staff. Asked whether teachers would get a jab to help minimise the need for “bubbles” of schoolchildren being forced into self-isolation, Mr Johnson said: “We want, in the end, to vaccinate everybody who could be at risk of either dying from the disease or transmitting it to those who are likely to be vulnerable. “On your point about teachers, of course we will prioritise everybody who is at risk of spreading it in that way or could be vulnerable to it.

But how will people - including people who live in care homes who will get the jab in hospital - know theyaposre in line for it  Hereaposs what you need to know. The first to get the vaccine will have appointments at hospital anyway, and the hospital will get in touch  Hospital staff will inform you about whether youaposll be getting the jab during an existing appointment next week. Typically they may be people who were already down to come into hospital next week for an outpatient appointment, Sir Simon said. If you are going to be one of those people next or in the weeks that follow, the hospital will get in touch with you. You donapost need to do anything about it yourself. Over the next few weeks, GP-led vaccination centres will open up in local communities, and will contact at-risk patients to invite them in for the jab. Sir Simon said: That will be followed in the subsequent weeks by GP practices coming together in each area to operate local vaccination centres. He went on: GPs will be in touch with their at-risk patients, inviting people to come forward for vaccination.

And they fight tooth and nail to prevent them from organising in trade unions.

The truth is that the Government cost lives and livelihoods by being too slow to go into lockdown, too slow to provide kit and testing and too slow to protect people in care homes.

Duncan Wheelhouse, , claimed he joined the chatroom to find “like-minded gay men” and was “surprised” by the images of child abuse being streamed. This was rejected by a judge at Kingston Crown Court, who heard he pleasured himself to the images and made comments about the footage. Judge John Lodge QC said: “The defendant, rather than indicating ‘why are we watching images of child abuse ’, participates in the online chat room - indicating to people in the chat room he shares such proclivities they might have in respect of those children.” Wheelhouse, who has worked in television for over  years and also worked for ITV, was dismissed by the BBC after police came to his office to arrest him.  David Burgess, defending, said: “He has been shunned by his former colleagues, his employers, his friends, and in many ways he remains a lonely gay man. “It’s unlikely he will work again, certainly in the field which he has been. His future looks gloomy indeed.” Kingston Crown Court heard the National Crime Agency sting found Wheelhouse by linking the IP address to his rented flat in Soho. Prosecutor Richard Milne said: “There’s been a National Crime Agency investigation into child abuse in particular by the use of Zoom conferences. “On the  March, , there were three people present. This defendant in particular used the username ‘Gperve’.” It said two Category ‘A’ videos and two Category ‘B’ videos were streamed on the chat, including the abuse of a baby and a -year-old boy.  Wheelhouse made a number of inappropriate comments, including references to the victim’s young ages, and was also seen taking drugs. He was arrested in May  and his home was searched, but officers did not find evidence of any indecent material on his devices or that he had Zoom installed on his computer. Charges were not brought until March of this year and he appeared at Westminster Magistrates’ Court last month to admit two counts of possessing indecent images of children. Mr Burgess said: “This is a man who has worked for the BBC and ITV and other news organisations for more than  years, unblemished service and it is nothing short of a tragic fall from grace for him that he should find himself sitting where he does today. “He was at a pretty low avenue in le. Personal tragedy of the highest order in the last few years. Almost certainly that caused him to drink far in excess and take drugs as can be seen on the video footage involving crack cocaine.  “All sense of judgment seems to have deserted him. He attended chatrooms as a lonely gay man. “He was taken by surprise when the images that he then voluntarily continued to watch were posted. It was not his design to see such images, he hadn’t done so before and he has never done so again.” Judge Lodder handed Wheelhouse a jail term of four months suspended for two years and ordered him to carry out  days of rehabilitation activity.

A poll carried out by the Mirror and local news sites across the UK shows a lack of confidence in the Governmentaposs tier decisions, as well as the fact that  per cent of people would have carried on in lockdown. The survey ran on the Mirror and local news sites this week after the new tier system was announced and implemented in December. According to our latest survey,  per cent of people who responded on the Mirror website think where they live is in the right tier as lockdown was lted yesterday. Of those who responded,  per cent said they weren’t in the right tier and  per cent weren’t sure. Like the country as a whole, most respondents were in Tier or Tier  , while  per cent didn’t know what tier they’re in. Those in Tier  were least likely to say they were in the right tier , compared to  per cent in Tier  and  per cent of those in Tier .

When it comes to the restrictions imposed by the tier system, just  per cent think they’re just right. Of those who think they need adjusting,  per cent said they are too tough and  per cent said they’re not tough enough.  Based on the survey, which received , responses,  per cent of respondents think there should be a Tier  that stays in full lockdown, compared to  per cent who didn’t. On the current rules,  per cent agreed that restaurants and pubs should be takeaway only in Tier . For Tier ,  per cent disagreed with the rule that restaurants and pubs could only serve alcohol with a substantial meal but  per cent agreed they should have last orders at pm and close at pm and  per cent agreed with table service only. Asked what was most important going forward to ensure areas either stay in their tier or go lower,  per cent said people needed to follow the rules.  They also thought it was important that people wore masks as they’re supposed to , kept social distancing , and self-isolated where appropriate . Other things that people thought might be helpful to stay in or drop a tier level were people being tested regularly , hospitalisations continuing to fall , and regular updates on the local situation so people can behave appropriately . Across Reach’s national and regional titles, just over half of those surveyedthought where they live was in the right tier.  But  per cent don’t think they’re in the right level of restrictions. A similar proportionthink leaving national lockdown was the right thing to do, compared to  per cent who thought we should have stayed in. Just under a quarter of peoplethink the restrictions where they live are just right. People were slightly more likelyto think they were too tough than not tough enough .

To say I was shocked is an under statement.After deciding it was time for change, Matt joined Ripped Gym in Basildon with a friend who encouraged him to get into shape. From that day I have never looked back and was going  to the gym once a day for an hour, even on Christmas day.

I can play football with my son and go on bike rides with my daughter and now personal train my we.  And Mattaposs message to people who want to follow in his footsteps  Get in the gym and do not worry about what everyone  thinks, no one is looking at you.

One customer who wound up queueing for more than two hours in Manchester branded it aposorganised chaosapos. On Wednesday night, a Primark in the Trafford Centre was one of just  stores around the UK to open around the clock.Enthusiastic bargain hunters piled into the store to shop for the first time since the national lockdown started, reports the Manchester Evening News. Dubbed aposwild Wednesdayapos, retailers were expecting swathes of shoppers to head to the high street as they welcomed customers back after a month of closure. Hundreds descended on the Trafford Centre branch in the early hours of Thursday morning. Fans of the brand reported y queues snaking around the perimeter of the mall. Some were left out in the cold for over an hour waiting to get inside. Several complained of a disorganised queueing system and understaffed tills meaning shoppers had to wait in a long line to pay.  Maria Garrido, who travelled to the Trafford Centre from Wigan, says she was heading to the late night shopping event to get some new pyjamas. She described the scenes as organised chaos.  She said: We arrived at .pm and queued up for over two hours to get in. It was organised chaos.  As we were in the queue for so long, we actually saw that some of the security were letting some people from the back of the queue up the escalator and in through the upstairs entrance. It really should have been one entrance and one exit! We complained to the manager who was very nice about it. But inside was a mess the queue for the till was another hour- hour and half. One of us got straight in to wait in the paying queue as soon as we got in. I went and got what bits I needed. I’d never do it again but we have some funny memories from last night and had a laugh even went for a McDonald’s on the way home at am!  Another social media user shared photos of exhausted shoppers sat on the floor inside the shop waiting patiently to pay.  She said she had been waiting almost  minutes to check out - and this was at three in the morning. While another revealed she waited for  minutes in the queue outside before leaving and heading back home. Ellie Birkinshaw, , travelled from Winton to browse for Christmas presents and a payday treat with her boyfriend.  She said they arrived at .pm and the queues were going from the front downstairs entrance, all the way through Barton square and out the back entrance, along the building outside and round the car park. Ellie said her boyfriend even joked about orcing her before they got married after seeing theof the queue and thought about leaving but says she stayed for the experience. She said: I wanted to be able to say I was one of the people that attended the only -hour opening of Primark throughout the pandemic. It was freezing outside, but thankfully not raining! We were waiting for about  minutes in the cold outside before we were inside and under shelter. The queuing experience was horrendous though. We were queueing from : pm until roughly :am. We would have been in a lot sooner, however after queueing about three quarters of the way, they stopped letting people in at the downstairs entrance for about  minutes whilst they allowed in from upstairs.  It was so frustrating as we had been waiting all that time and people towards the back of the queue basically had a aposfast trackapos. Despite the disappointing experience in the queue, Ellie said it was totally dferent once inside and praised the store for how it handled the late night shopping.  She added: Inside was so quiet, the most quiet Iaposve ever seen it. We had so much freedom shopping and not worried about being too close to everyone especially with the current times. Was really easy to see everything as you could tell they tried their best to keep it as tidy and as well-stocked as possible. The only bit of it that definitely was not organised well, where the tills to pay for your shopping. Out of roughly  tills they only had three members of staff serving at any one time. This meant you then had to wait for over an hour in a queue just to pay for your stuff.

Richard Anstee, managing director of Glamorgan Brewing Company said the company had no other choice but to dump more than  casks after the move was announced.The devastated businessman told Wales Online he started to dispose of all casks which were set to be delivered to  Welsh pubs in time for December.Hundreds of kegs were opened up with countless pints of beer sent spilling out onto the floor before heading down the drains. Mr Anstee explained that the brewery began planning for Christmas back in August and that as a result of the Welsh Governmentaposs announcement earlier this week, around , or , pints would be poured away. He said: Itaposs catastrophic. Itaposs our busiest month of the year and itaposs where we take all our money which will take us through the quieter months of January and February and itaposs just going to kill every single Welsh brewer out there. Weaposve planned for Christmas for the last three to four months.

We will try to sell some through our small brewery shop but weaposve planned and weaposve geared up for the month of December so weaposve got literally hundreds of kegs there ready for all the pubs in Wales that will most likely go down the drain because theyaposve all got an expiry date coming. Last December we turned over £. million. This year weaposll be lucky to take £, in our shop so itaposs monumental how much money weaposll lose.Pubs and bars have described the devastating  impact the alcohol ban will have on their business,  but the issue spans further up the supply chain. Richard described the ban as absolutely catastrophic for the industry entering what usually would be the busiest month of trade throughout the whole year.The brewery supplies  pubs across Wales,  including Bar   and Whetherspoons, who have already announced  they will be closing. When it comes to Christmas we start planning in September, we start brewing in October to November. One of our problems is, which is usually a good problem, we have one of the best selling Christmas beers in Wales. We have  casks of beer waiting to go out to pubs which wonapost get used now. All this stock has expiry dates. We will lose hundreds of thousands of pounds on stock. We will just open the casks and pour it down the drain in our brewery.

The pair have been issued with a termination of employment notice “due to a serious breach by operator Punch Pubs, Yorkshire Live reports. It comes after the couple decided to leave free drinks - their own, not pub stock - on tables outside for people paying their respects at the village memorials on November . The pair was initially told by officers that Ms Cashonaposs DPS licence would be revoked over Covid- breaches, but North Yorkshire Police later denied that was the case. Punch Pubs have now asked the publicans to vacate the premises - which is also their home - by New Yearaposs Day. I donapost blame Punch, theyaposve been backed into a corner by the police, said Mr Cookson, who described the situation as emotionally draining. The police had told Punch that they would like to review their premises licence because of that. Thataposs why weaposve been sacked. The couple said they are remorseful but feel that the punishment for their naive act of kindness has been too severe.  We feel our case is being dealt with far more harshly than others. For instance,  The Coach and Horses in Harrogate  - also under the control of North Yorkshire Police’s licensing ision - were issued with two warnings due to continued flouting of the Covid rules, said Mr Cookson. They were then prosecuted as per the police statement ‘only as a last resort’, unlike the one strike and your out applied to ourselves. He added: Itaposs not consistent you know.

It thrives on our normal human behaviour and all those places and opportunities where we come together.  It underlines why we need to take further, targeted action now. We will focus these changes on places where we meet and where coronavirus thrives, drawing on recent evidence from the UK SAGE group of experts about what interventions have had the biggest impact on the virus.

He was speaking on BBCaposs Question Time, less than  hours after Englandaposs national lockdown was lted, but with heavy restrictions hampering the pub trade. Most areas have entered a tougher version of Tier , allowing dferent households to meet outside pubs for drinks as long as they order a substantial meal - but not go indoors. Also appearing on the show, celebrity chef, pub owner and restaurateur, Tom Kerridge, said the hospitality trade was not responsible for the surge in cases during Englandaposs second wave. He said even during the Eat Out to Help Out campaign in the summer hospitality transmission rates never rose above - percent, adding such draconian measures are killing the industry - particularly non-food serving venues - for no good reason.  Mr Kerridge, who has appeared on MasterChef, Saturday Kitchen and Great British Menu, went on to ridicule the loophole which means people in non-wet pubs can order a Scotch egg as their substantial meal with their pint. Askedthere is any science to back up the restrictions in pubs, Prof Openshaw, appearing via video link, said: I think itaposs fair and very clear that there are things that transmit the virus really well. And thataposs often in venues where thereaposs poor ventilation, loud music, people having to shout to overcome the noise and then youaposre omitting a lot of spittle particles, which contain a lot of the virus.  So thataposs perfect transmission environment. If you have a quiet environment with well-ventilated areas where you can have social separation, then thereaposs lots of well-managed places where you can go and have a meal and so on, and drink a pint at the same time where the transmission risk is very very low. But I think it has been clear that loud music and shouting in a close environment is perfect for transmission of the virus.

Jack, , and Saskia, , were stabbed to death by convicted terrorist Usman Khan at a prisoner rehabilitation event last November. The -year-old was shot dead by police on London Bridge. Khan was out on licence when he attended the event, organised by Cambridge University’s Learning Together scheme. A writ lodged at the High Court last week by lawyers for Saskia’s mother, Michelle, under the European Convention on Human Rights claims her right to le was breached by failings. Henry Pitchers QC, for Ms Jones’ family, told a pre-inquest hearing last month that when Khan was freed West Midlands Police assessed him as “at the highest level of risk”.

Combined with her saving habits and frugal nature, she managed to wipe out thousands of pounds of debt in just months. Yvette, from Exmouth Devon, has used a iety of methods to stash the cash. From survey sites to collecting supermarket club card points and entering competitions, this money-saving mum-of-three is doing it all. She said: “I took the -day challenge last year where you save from p on the  January and this increases daily up to £. on day . “At the end of the year you should have £ but I adapted it to make it less pressured and ticked off amounts as and when I made some money. “I try to save up from December to November, when I open the pot to start buying presents for Christmas. “I always use a tin with a money slot on the top so there’s no temptation to open it early.Ms Duigan, who lives with her husband David, , and their children, makes money by putting up unwanted clutter on Facebook marketplace.In addition to this, she buys items second hand from charity shops and car boot sales, to resell online for more money. The mum said: “I have always tried to be careful with my money and only buy the things I need, rather than want. “In the past, I have tried to have a budget for Christmas but using a savings pot meant I actually have the money set aside for presents at Christmas rather than trying to find the money or putting it on a credit card. “I don’t believe in spending endless amounts of money on presents, especially on children as I don’t think it’s necessary or appreciated.  As well as paying off her £, debt, Ms Duigan has saved £ this year and is aiming for £ saved in . Yvette said: “I have just started next year’s pot and I hope to get to £ by next December.“I will continue to sell small bits and will be doing another declutter after Christmas to get the savings pot off to a good start.” Like many shoppers, the mum-of-three, used Clubcard points which allows her to save and has got her a great deal on her Christmas dinner this year.She said: “Through the year I collect supermarket points such as Nectar points and Clubcard points. “Sainsbury’s always does a double-up event in November and this year I saved up enough to buy Christmas jumpers for the boys. “I also earn Amazon vouchers by using receipt scanning apps such as Shoppix, which again you can save up and cash out as soon as you get enough points. “The money from the pot and the vouchers have covered nearly all of the Christmas presents I have bought this year. “I currently have £ worth of Tesco vouchers which should pay for my Christmas food and drink so hopefully that’s Christmas covered!” Through reselling, she makes around £-£, a month, adding: “I have always enjoyed saving money and making money and in , I challenged myself to pay off £, I had on a credit card because last summer we bought a new house to renovate.  She said: “I focused on making and saving money to get it paid off as quickly as possible and did it in four months. “I mainly sell clothes on eBay, and books and games on Amazon. “After taking voluntary redundancy in the summer I am now reselling full-time rather than going back to a ‘normal’ job. It’s so flexible I can look after the boys and have choice over how to spend my day. “Just before setting up my business I was easily making about £ a month from selling part-time on eBay and with other side hustles I was making £-£ a month. “When I tell people what I do now for a job most people’s reactions is ‘oh is there money in that ’ But the truth is eBay appeals to a worldwide audience so anyone can make a good amount of money whether they want to sell just a few items or a few million! Many of the new millionaires in  have been made through selling on eBay.”The thrty mum now uses her expertise to help others by sharing advice on her Instagram account ."},{"url":null,"title":"three tier 2 places now","story":"NewsThree Tier  areas now in Englands worst  coronavirus hotspots, latest data showsLatest Public Health England figures show that Basildon, in Essex, has the eighth highest infection rate in the country, despite being in Tier  - and Redbridge and Havering in London also feature in the top mirrorShareCommentsByDave BurkeIan Jones:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video coronavirus-numbers-uk-deaths-pass-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

The government is facing a backlash after imposing strict restrictions on huge swathes of the country. Basildon in Essex - which this week dodged being put into the highest tier - now has the eighth highest infection rate in the country. London boroughs Redbridge and Havering have the th and th largest rates respectively. By comparison Stratford-upon-Avon, which is in Tier , is st out of  local authorities. Local leaders in the Warwickshire town this week launched legal action, saying they should not face the toughest restrictions.See below to find out what the latest infection rate is in your area Swale in Kent has the highest infection rate in England, while Medway, Thanet, Gravesham, Maidstone and Dover also feature in the top . Woking, in Surrey, and Ashford, in Kent, have also seen sharp increases in the number of people testing positive for the virus, which has claimed more than , lives across the UK.The first doses of the approved coronavirus vaccine are due to arrive in the UK today.Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer for England, confirmed the jab from Pfizer and BioNTech - approved by the UK medicines regulator on Wednesday - will hit British shores in hours, not days. Yesterday Boris Johnson told a Downing Street press conference: It will inevitably take some months before all the most vulnerable are protected - long, cold months.So itaposs all the more vital that as we celebrate this scientic achievement we are not carried away with over-optimism or fall into the naive belief that the struggle is over.

The President-elect intends to hit the ground running after his inauguration on January  and believes the measure will see a signicant reduction in coronavirus cases. Data suggests one US citizen currently dies every  seconds from the virus, with the country leading the world in cases and deaths. Just  days to mask, not forever.  days. And I think weaposll see a signicant reduction, he said. Speaking to CNNaposs Jake Tapper, former senator Biden said he will issue a standing order that masks must be warn in places where he has authority, such as federal buildings and in interstate transportation.In what was his first joint interview with VP-elect Kamala Harris since winning the election last month, the veteran public servant said he has asked Dr Anthony Fauci to stay on as chief medical adviser and part of his virus response team. The infections expert and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has often come to blows with Trump over his pandemic response.Biden has strenuously followed coronavirus recommendations, leading to jibes from Trump during the election about his constant mask-wearing. The out-going Republican leader, on the other hand, opted to hold huge rallies throughout his  campaign, with crowds of often maskless supporters not abiding by social distancing. After testing positive for the virus himself, Trump quickly ed to work at the White House and regularly reiterated it was not something Americans should worry too much about. The billionaire businessman was also often criticised for appearing to put the ailing economy before peopleaposs lives.  Biden, meanwhile, told Tapper his plan is to find a balance between ensuring Americans believe the vaccine to be safe and introducing policies to curb the spread without shutting down the economy. The former Vice President to Barack Obama added he would be happy to publicly get a vaccine jab once Fauci says it is safe, to demonstrate his confidence. People have lost faith in the ability of the vaccine to work, he said. Already the numbers are really staggeringly low, and it matters what the President and Vice President do.

She found an L-shaped five-seater sofa complete with ottoman online for an incredible price of £, saying she hoped it would be big enough for herself, her fiancé Joseph, and the five children to squeeze onto for the time being. After patiently waiting  weeks for it to be delivered by Wayfair, Pinky became a little concerned when Jospeh told her the package that had arrived look a lot smaller than he expected. My fiancé was in when it arrived and he said it seemed small, but I thought maybe it needed to be assembled to make shipping easier, she said. But it wasnapost until they unboxed it that Pinky discovered she had accidentally ordered a sofa for toddlers, which was just  inches tall - and posed for hilarious photos on the furniture she hoped would fit all seven of them. I had to laugh, itaposs literally a baby sofa, said the -year-old property manager from Florida. I would never have dreamed I was buying it for a child. I thought it was going to be an actual sofa, big enough for my living room. It didnapost say anywhere that it was for a child and it was listed in the living room section on the website. It said it seats five so I thought at least the five kids would be able to squeeze on it and me and my fiancé could sit on the beanbags for now. I was looking forward to it arriving because we donapost have any furniture and I waited ten weeks for delivery. Itaposs annoying because now I have no furniture in my living room but Iaposve had a sad childhood and Iaposve been homeless. Iaposve been able to buy my own house now so Iaposve been given too many lemons to complain, I just found it hilarious.

The woman, called Kristin, stumbled across the mysterious document at her mumaposs house, which named the unknown child Clyde Fabian and even included an ink marking of the babyaposs footprints. But after confronting her mum, she discovered the truth. Her secret brother was actually a Cabbage Patch Doll - a popular toy in the s which came with their own birth certicates and adoption papers. Her mum had held onto the papers, and the doll, thinking that it could be worth something one day. Kristinaposs sister Chloe shared the hilarious blunder on Twitter, where it racked up more than , likes.She said: I may have done a lot of embarrassing things in my le, but my older sister actually once found a cabbage patch kids birth certicate in my moms filing cabinet, started screaming at and accusing our mom of hiding our ‘brother’ Clyde Fabian from us, and she was like . Why my mom kept the birth certicate  She thought the cabbage patch might be worth something one day bc it was an original. Why she kept it with our birth certicates  I don’t know. That’s the part of the story where my mom did an embarrassing thing.  Clyde Fabian was dressed in scrubs and a face mask with Babyland General Hospital printed on it. My mom picked this doll out because my dad is a doctor and she thought it was cute,” Chloe said. She explained that sheaposd been reminded of the hilarious story after Kristin gave birth to a little girl, and their younger sister bought her a babygrow that read aposClyde Fabian is my uncleapos. Chloe continued: When my older sister Kristin had her first baby, my hilarious younger sister @catjaddy had this onesie made for our niece.At least Kristin has a good sense of humour about the whole snafu.

The Tangerines can take something from this one.Verdict: One point.The - defeat in Ayrshire back in August will go down as the low point of United’s season so far.It’s a result the players will be eager to put right and give themselves and the fans an early Christmas present.They dominated Killie at Rugby Park in the summer but silly inidual errors cost the Tangerines on the day.IAN ROACHE: Why it’s time Dundee United fans acknowledged fine job Micky Mellon is doing – and how  points from  league games should be judged\" title\"#IAN ROACHE: Why it’s time Dundee United fans acknowledged fine job Micky Mellon is doing – and how  points from  league games should be judged# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp ian-roache-why-its-time-dundee-united-fans-acknowledged-fine-job-micky-mellon-is-doing-and-how--points-from--league-games-should-be-judged embed # secretIucqcTBoN\" data-secret\"IucqcTBoN\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Thankfully, those kind of mistakes are no longer associated with a team that’s screwed the nut in recent times.The defence is standing firm, Nicky Clark is taking his chances while Marc McNulty and Lawrence Shankland will be hoping to join him.Going up against a mid-table rival on home soil and under the floodlights, United should need no further motivation to win this one.Verdict: Three points.Boxing Day brings the Steelmen to town as Stephen Robinson pits his wits against Mellon and his men.Neither side are particularly potent in front of goal but, after a dreadful start to the campaign, the ’Well have found their feet in recent times.Tony Watt and Mark O’Hara are key for Robinson’s side going forward, while Scotland centre-half Declan Gallagher won’t give United’s frontline an inch.The Lanarkshire side are another who’ll have aspirations of making the top six and will come to Tannadice for what will, no doubt, be an even contest.At Fir Park back in August, United ran out deserved - winners and should have enough to edge Motherwell, not what they once were, out again.Verdict: Three points.Who knows what the situation will be at Parkhead at the turn of the year as boss Neil Lennon’s future hangs in the balance.What is for certain, though, is a trip to the East End of Glasgow is always daunting with the players they possess.Arguably, however, it’s a good time for United to play the champions, with the Hoops having won just twice in their last  games in all competitions after being dumped out of Europe and the Betfred Cup.The night-time clash will also represent Celtic’s eighth game of the month and comes just before the second Old Firm derby of the season on January .The picture will likely be very dferent, though, as the Celts focus fully on the Premiership, with the Scottish Cup Final out of the way, and cutting Rangers’ lead at the top.There’s just too much riding on this for Celtic and I expect they’ll show up on the night.Verdict: No points.Total:  points.EXCLUSIVE: Dundee United kid Lewis Neilson on living next door to Stuart Armstrong, EPL ambitions and why he’s every inch a star in the making\" title\"#EXCLUSIVE: Dundee United kid Lewis Neilson on living next door to Stuart Armstrong, EPL ambitions and why he’s every inch a star in the making# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-united-lewis-neilson-stuart-armstrong-interview embed # secretxuZZoeYJ\" data-secret\"xuZZoeYJ\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\" vw, px\"  Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-telegraph-first-epaper--month\": today for unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  nThis offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\": today and get unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite. nThis offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-telegraph-web-epaper\",\"evening-telegraph-first-epaper--month\",\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Enjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.\",\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

He looks pacy, good technically and I expect him to be a handful for any Championship defence.The Dundee manager will be feeling much happier about his team and his chances going forward this term.The task now is to make the fans happy with their team’s results or these baby steps will be too little, too late.GOING purely by the form tables at the Tony Macaroni on Saturday you’d put Dundee United as favourites at Livingston.However, the departure of manager Gary Holt throws a spanner in the works of that sort of thinking.Despite basing their bid for Premiership survival on their ability to pick up points at home, Livi have lost four of their last five in the league on their own patch.That’s including damaging defeats to Hamilton and St Mirren, teams in and around them.For Micky Mellon’s United, they are proving a tough nut to crack for opponents and are enjoying a seven-match unbeaten run with few goals conceded in there.Their last three away trips, however, haven’t yielded any goals. Stalemates against the Saints – two at McDiarmid Park and one in Paisley.So, normally you’d expect a tight affair with few goals thanks to neither side exactly banging the goals in.However, there are now a couple of wildcards to throw into the mix.For Livi, the departure of Holt has already given them a bounce against Ayr at the weekend with a - win.For United, the ever-fitter and sharper Marc McNulty is looking better with every appearance.He’s due a goal soon and, by his own record so too is Lawrence Shankland.Saturday’s contest really is up in the air.WHAT a mess the authorities are making of VAR and all these rules changes.Whether it’s offside or the handball law, every little tweak made seems to complicate matters even more.It’s remarkable we can look back on the old times of hand-to-ball or ball-to-hand with envy.It didn’t seem to have so many problems – or penalties.We need a simpler approach.Go with the on-pitch official’s decision unless it can be seen within  seconds there is a clear error.And for goodness sake, help the poor refs by simplying the laws. vw, px\"  Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-telegraph-first-epaper--month\": today for unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  nThis offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\": today and get unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite. nThis offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-telegraph-web-epaper\",\"evening-telegraph-first-epaper--month\",\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Enjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.\",\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

He asked me to write an article for his testimonial programme which I was delighted to do.“Then I had done one for Rab Douglas when he did a charity fundraising dinner at the Invercarse so I already had a couple of them done.“And lockdown gave me the chance to finally write the whole thing.“Going back through history there are so many wonderful anecdotes and stories.”Some of the profiles hark back right to the beginnings of the club in , taking in the World Wars and right up to the glory era of the s and s.Mentions of Bill Shankly’s famous boot room at Liverpool as well as one of the club’s greatest managers are included.There’s also a family tie with Courier columnist Jim Crumley writing the profile of his grandfather Bob Crumley.“Going right back there were ‘Crumley’s Boys’ as the team in the early part of the th century were known – Bob Crumley was the goalkeeper,” Kenny said.“His profile is written by his grandson, Jim Crumley. So that was a very personal piece written about Bob Crumley who went blind and suffered from shellshock from World War One.“If you go right back to the start of the club and the first-ever season, Dundee had three players capped for Scotland and one was goalkeeper Francis Barrett. Then in the s Dundee were runners up in the league three times and the goalkeeper then, Billy Muir, was capped.“There’s also George Anderson, who was most famous as one of the club’s great managers, winning the League Cup with guys like Billy Steel in the team.“He was a goalkeeper in his playing days and played for Dundee in  . Aberdeen didn’t play during World War One so Anderson joined on loan and ended up winning every competition Dundee entered into.“There’s also Reuben Bennett, who was part of the famous boot room of Bill Shankly’s Liverpool. He won the B Division in his time at Dundee.“There is also a great Bennett story he used to tell of being a hardman at Dundee.“He said he was knocked unconscious in a game at Dens and was taken to hospital.“He tells that he woke up in the DRI, left the hospital, ran up the Hilltown and then paid to get back into Dens and finished the game!”The book includes every goalkeeper to have worn the shirt – great and not so great – until the end of last season, including young Harrison Sharp who made his debut against Elgin last year.It is available from the club shop, Amazon and eBay. vw, px\"  Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-telegraph-first-epaper--month\": today for unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  nThis offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\": today and get unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite. nThis offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-telegraph-web-epaper\",\"evening-telegraph-first-epaper--month\",\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Enjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.\",\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

International Airport have called for a similar policy to be introduced north of the border, amid concerns over the impact of the pandemic on the travel and aviation industries.Now Andrew Bowie, the MP for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine, has written to Scottish Government health minister Jeane Freeman and transport chief Michael Matheson urging them to adopt the measures.He said: #Whilst I was initially supportive of both the UK and Scottish Governments’ approaches to travel corridors and quarantine, there is no doubt that such rules have had a signicant impact on our aviation sector.#Going forward, it is vital that both short-haul and transatlantic flights are able toto more normal levels and in order to do this, we must see increased testing and the mandatory quarantine period reduced.#This I believe is particularly crucial for the future of our smaller, regional airports, like Aberdeen International Airport which serves my own constituency.#A spokesman for the Scottish Government said: “We recognise the impact that the pandemic has had on airports and airlines and we are exploring alternatives to quarantine that minimise the risk to public health.“We are aware of the UK government’s plans to introduce test to release and we are working with the main commercial airports in Scotland and clinical advisors to understand the risks and benefits of such an approach here.#We are currently assessingtest to release can be implemented in a way that minimises risk, which includes understanding the capacity of private sector labs to conduct testing to a minimum standard as well as determining the best time for a pilot of this nature.“It is important that any travellers arriving in the UK understand, and respect, the dferent restrictions in place in the

Saints, however, failed to harness the wind advantage and it was the home side who looked the more threatening in the early stages.Skipper Lewis Buchanan registered Saints first effort on goal in the th minute, cutting in from the right to send a well-struck shot just wide of the postage stamp corner.Saints manager Donald Black made early use of the agreed rolling substitutes policy, sending on Fraser MacFarlane in the th minute to replace Alan Buchanan in the centre forward#s role.It didn#t take MacFarlane long to make an impact and his neat turn on the edge of the D created the space for a right foot volley which arced away from the Red Star keeper#s right hand to nestle in the bottom corner and give Saints a st minute lead.Red Star cancelled out the Saints advantage on the stroke of half-time after good work on the right from Chris Hart took him all the way to the bye-line from where his cutback picked out Stuart MacLean on the six-yard line for an easy finish.With the wind gathering pace, a long second half was in prospect for Saints and it took the hosts just four minutes to capitalise on their controlled first half performance when central defender Ben Forbes poked home an Andy Weir right wing corner through a sea of legs.After Lewis Buchanan had headed a th minute Andy Weir left wing corner off the line, Weir#s follow up delivery from the opposite flank picked out right full back Coll McCallum eight yards out for the home side#s third goal.Red Star stretched their advantage still further on the hour mark when Ben Forbes whipped a wind assisted free-kick from the halfway line into the postage stamp corner giving Murdo MacKenzie no chance.After keeping the hosts at bay for  minutes, Saints conceded a fth goal with almost the last kick of the ball. Murdo MacKenzie did well to parry a dipping -yard Aaron Moore shot, but luck deserted the Saints keeper when the ball broke to Ewan Litster, who chipped over the stranded keeper into the unguarded net.With the rain coming horizontally, both sets of players were delighted to hear referee Jimmy Litster#s final whistle immediately after the restart signalling a stampede for the sanctuary of the ious cars and vans in the school car park."},{"url":null,"title":"combating covid but at what cost","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We know that our early ancestors split from chimpanzees, our closest ape relative, around - million years ago , and that the first near-humans of our genusevolved in Africa at least . Myr.These forerunners eventually gave rise to us , but our knowledge of what happened between these dates is very limited, largely because fossilised remains are extremely rare.Common illustrations depicting how our upright posture, facial features and lack of body hair gradually evolved are based on few skeletons of ancient ancestors. Most notable is that of Lucy, a young female skeleton dating back to . Myr.Lucy was discovered in the Afar depression, Ethiopia, in , and was assigned to a species more primitive than ours , and named A. afarensis after her location. In the s a few teeth and bone fragments were found that proved to be similar to, but even older than, Lucy, dating from ^ Myr and called A. anamensis. it was assumed that Lucy was directly descended from this ancient primate.Not surprisingly, there was much excitement in the field when anthropologist Yohannes Haile-Selassie discovered a near-complete skull of A. anamensis dating from approximately . Myr. He found the skull, simply known as MRD for now, during his fieldworks at Woranso-Mille, Ethiopia, in . As the oldest and most-complete skull of A. anamensis, this find allowed detailed comparison with Lucy’s species.There was general agreement that, like the illustration, our ancient ancestors descended one from another in a linear fashion. So most experts assumed that A. anamensis evolved directly into Lucy’s species.Haile-Selassie’s detailed study of MRD suggests, however, that the two species co-existed in Africa for at least , years, presumably with the potential for interbreeding. This undoubtedly shakes up previous thoughts and reshapes our understanding of Homo evolution.But only time will tell Haile-Salassie says he hopes to find the rest of MRD’s skeleton # and even earlier members of our Homo genus # which should certainly help unravel our deep past."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 17 congratulations and jubilations","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Some applicants do not have English as their first language and Citizens Advice Bureauoffices have experience in obtaining advice via interpreters.Outreach clinics, centred in local area job centres, are also a feature of the CAB service and enable job centre staff to refer clients directly to a CAB Advisor based there for a day.Any cuts will increase the workload on CAB offices exponentially as thousands more may be made redundant, find they have no income of any kind, and turn to CAB for advice. Cuts will undoubtedly affect the vulnerable in our society immediately, with theIn cities such as Glasgow, the closure of offices would mean that many claimants could find it impossible to travel to other parts of the city and, in any case, with an already growing list of applicants those offices would soon be overwhelmed,they are not already.Several members of CAB staff have already been made redundant. I believe that more may follow without additional funding.In Glasgow alone, five offices face closure, though it is estimated that in excess of , people in Glasgow sought advice from these offices in the last year. This is likely to be the case in major cities around Scotland.Our petition calls on the Scottish Parliament to urge the Scottish Government to provide urgent funding to Citizens Advice Scotland. It can be found on the Scottish Parliament website # petition number PE: Urgent funding for Citizens Advice Bureaux.Alistair S Stephen, by emailSir,The Covert Human Intelligence Sources Bill currently going through Westminster, dubbed the Spy Cop Bill, gives agencies including police, armed forces, HMRC, and even the Food Standards Agency permission to break the law with impunity.These agencies will be permitted to break international and domestic law in direct contravention of the Geneva Convention on human rights.Why is this legislation being brought in, and why are HMRC and the Food Standards Agency being given such powers  It is beyond belief that the majority of MPs actually voted for this bill.A clue may come from recent comments made by the home Secretary and endorsed by the prime minister about #leftie lawyers# and #do-gooders#, referring to human rights lawyers and refugee organisations.As for the Food Standards Agency, clues might come from the other very concerning bill in process at present which is the Internal Market Bill which contravenes the Good Friday Agreement and the devolution settlements for Scotland and Wales by undermining the authority of the devolved governments, as well as breaking an international treaty signed less than a year ago.This bill contains some deeply concerning clauses which would come under the remit of The Food Standards Agency which normally only has jurisdiction south of the border, but this bill would enable a UK trade minister to unilaterally overrule Scottish legislation on food safety standards to allow for a trade deal with the US, and the importation of sub-standard foods and food products.It is also the case that any UK minister or appointee would be able to overrule any Scottish legislation. This could affect all aspects of our lives.The Spy Cop Bill is a means of enforcing the Internal Market Bill by using the threat of underhand means. Thus piling illegality on illegality with regard to international law.We need to be very concerned on both counts.Amnesty International has already voiced its grave concerns, as have other international bodies and governments.Surely independence is now the best option for Scotland, where we can build a better, fairer nation for ourselves one that obeys international laws and respects the basic human rights of all its citizens, with a written constitution to ensure that no future Scottish government could ever impose such draconian legislation on the people of Scotland.Cecilia Rees , Lochgilphead.Sir,The Covid- pandemic continues to be exceptionally dficult for all of us, but has also led to crisis levels of #pet poverty# in the UK.PDSA is a charity that provides free and low cost vet care for those who struggle to pay treatment costs for their sick and injured pets.Since the first UK lockdown began, we’ve seen an overwhelming number of additional enquiries from pet owners who have hit hard times.

Martin Bonar replaced Scott Johnston for Saints while Chris Hart made way for Innes Meikle for the hosts.The deadlock was broken in the th minute from a quickly-taken free kick by Cammy Hill after Martin Bonar had been brought down in the centre circle by James McGuiness.Hill spotted Aaron McKay in space on the right and sent him scurrying forward. McKay cut into the box and picked out the run of Craig MacEwan who was foiled from six yards by Ally Lewis.The young keeper#s good work was undone when he couldn#t hold MacEwan#s shot allowing the ball to spin away from him.Ben Forbes was on hand with a sliding challenge to knock the loose ball away from MacEwan but only as far as Gavin Forgrieve, who gleefully tapped home from four yards.Lewis saved again from MacEwan three minutes later this time managing to hold onto the ball at the second attempt before a neat Matty Kelly turn on the corner of the Star -yard box wrong footed Ben Forbes creating the space for Kelly to curl a ball to the far post a matter of inches in front of the outstretched boot of Scott Maitland.Maitland got forward again in the st minute finding Gavin Forgrieve in front of goal. He took the ball down well only for Innes Meikle to get back with a vital challenge at the expense of a corner kick.Martin Bonar climbed well at the back post to meet Forgrieve#s delivery from the right but couldn#t direct his header on target.Despite being unable to hit the target himself Bonar was able to claim an st minute assist for the second and final goal.The big midfielder, a key member of Red Star#s  Scottish Amateur Football League Premier Division Two title winning side, won possession well in the centre circle and opened up his former team mates with a perfectly weighted pass for the forward run of skipper Craig MacEwan.Top marksman MacEwan comfortably beat stranded Red Star keeper Ally Lewis with a deft chip from  yards into the unguarded net.Referee Jimmy Litster, who ensured the two local rivals remained on friendly terms throughout, called time on proceedings after three added minutes with both sides satisfied to complete another  minutes while the majority of their respective league rivals remain side-lined."},{"url":null,"title":"in praise of john campbell factor mor","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The town on its present site would be taking shape by the time young Zachary began his schooling.His education, however, was said to be #rudimentary#, so young Zachary began teaching himself Latin and Greek as he absorbed English classic literature.Employed from the age of  in a merchant#s office in Glasgow, historical references describe him falling into #bad company# and indulging in excessive drinking.At the age of  in  he emigrated to Jamaica to take up a role as a book-keeper, effectively a slave overseer, on a sugar plantation. Such was his horror and disgust at the way in which slaves were treated on the plantation that he became an implacable opponent of the slave trade.He gave up his job in Jamaica # by this time a #model book-keeper# # and ed in  to Britain and secured a position in London. His sister Jean had married Thomas Babington of Rothley Temple, Leicestershire, a country gentleman and ardent evangelical. Babington took MacAulay under his wing and introduced him to the Clapham Sect # a group of Tories against slavery.Among them was William Wilberforce, founder and leader of the anti-slavery movement.Through working with the Clapham Sect, MacAulay was invited in  to visit Sierra Leone # the West African colony established to provide a home to emancipated slaves from the United States who came to Sierra Leone via Nova Scotia.In , aged , he was promoted to the post of governor and remained in the post until .Returning to England on a slave ship, he brought with him  African children, with the hope of finding them a better le in the Clapham Sect community.He settled in Surrey following his marriage to Selina Mills on August , .Having witnessed the misery of slavery, MacAulay became a member of the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, working closely with Wilberforce, and soon became a leading figure in the parliamentary campaign. He later became secretary of the committee, which became known as the African Institution.The campaign succeeded in , with an Act of Parliament making the slave trade illegal throughout the British Empire. The practice, however, was to continue despite this victory.Many abolitionists had thought slavery would fade away once the slave trade was stopped, but that failed to happen.MacAulay continued in his activism, helping seize a slave ship in . On this act, William Wilberforce commented in a letter to MacAulay, #you really deserve a statue#.In the s MacAulay turned his attention towards securing the total abolition of slavery itself. He helped found the Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slaveryin , and was editor of its monthly publication, the Anti-Slavery Reporter from its launch in .His major contribution was the collection and collating of a huge volume of evidence showing the true scale of slavery # a role to which he was ideally suited as a skilled statistician with a meticulous approach and an exceptional head for figures.It was also during this period that MacAulay co-founded University College London.Publication of the Reporter continued until , but by the end the work had worn MacAulay out and he had got into debt.In  Selina died and, with his finances in disarray, MacAulay was exiled to Paris in  # the year the Slavery Abolition Act came into force which ended slavery throughout the British Empire.He ed to England once his debts were liquidated and died on May , . He was buried in a London cemetery, but after the site became a public park # St George#s Gardens # the exact location of his grave was lost.MacAulay is commemorated with a le-sized memorial bust in Westminster Abbey.To mark the th anniversary of his birth in , a memorial plaque was unveiled in the gardens, donated by the Royal Statistical Society, the Friends of St George#s Gardens, University College London and the Clan MacAulay Association.William Wilberforce said of Zachary MacAulay: #My sober and deliberate opinion is that you [Zachary MacAulay] have done more towards this consummation [abolishing slavery] than any other man.#For myself, I take pleasure in acknowledging that you have been my tutor all the way and that I could have done nothing without you.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a family passion for scotlands beauty","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Frances and Ross depict the ever-changing and often harsh weather conditions which frame their Argyll home.A Family Affair explores their shared artistic tropes as they both represent the landscape of Scotland’s islands and west coast, working in nature, directly inBoth use oil paint and other media, drawing with the brush or palette kne to make urgent, swt marks that capture the fleeting effects and drama of changing weather.They also share Crinan, where the Ryan family has run the Crinan Hotel since the mid-seventies, from where Ryan left for school, then art school and set out on extensive travels. But the beauty of Argyll # and his boat Sgarbh # drew him back.Earlier this year Ross held his second solo exhibition with The Scottish Gallery, but due to lockdown not a single person was able to attend.Frances has been a regular exhibitor with the gallery for years with her distinctive Hebridean seascapes and landscapes showing the repeated mots of Iona, The Mull of Kintyre, the bays around Crinan and the view across to Jura and the Corryvreckan.Like a good modernist Frances is reluctant to give any commentary on her works but Ross, on the other hand, makes extensive notes on his journeys allowing others to understand how hard-won the paintings are, particularly in winter when the harsh conditions create privations and huge physical problems. Each painting becomes a manestation and record of time and place.His affinity with the natural world is reflected in his long-term project of setting messages in bottles on the ocean, which brings him encounters as he journeys to meet the people who find them, and make new works at the location of the find.A Family Affair will be presented concurrently with Mark Hearld’s Menagerie, which will transport visitors to an animal-filled world with a series of prints, woodcut and linocuts inspired by the artist’s love of British flora and fauna.A Family Affair and Mark Hearld’s Menagerie will be at The Scottish Gallery in Edinburgh between Saturday November  and Wednesday December ."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column november 20 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

All representatives who are isolating or unable to attend must be able to speak up for their voters.We noted as early as June that the abrupt shut-down of remote participation was bound to leave communities unrepresented as the pandemic continued to rage. The Commons took a step backwards in ending this too early.MPs and voters need consistency and transparent standards for how these crucial democratic decisions are made.We can#t have ato the conga line chaos we saw in June, or the decisions simply being made on a whim by a minister.MPs need clarity about how they can continue to represent their voters during this stark second wave and beyond.There must be far greater transparency over how these decisions on participation are made, rather than ministers being forced to act at the last moment.Since some MPs may be isolating or not safe to travel in person, there’s a real threat for democratic representation and political equalityremote participation continues to be strictly limited or indeed denied. Virtual proceedings in the summer were a real success in bringing parliament into the st century. Let’s learn from that and ensure all voters are heard.Darren Hughes, chief executive, the Electoral Reform Society.Sir,SNP ministers must outline how they are planning for a Covid- vaccine rollout across Scotland.People are understandably feeling positive about a potential vaccine for coronavirus, which is why it is critical for the SNP government to lay out the detail of its roll-out plans as a matter of urgency.We can ill-afford to repeat the same mistakes we saw with the flu vaccination earlier this year.Ministers need to set out what infrastructure is being put in place right now so they are ahead of the game when it comes to rolling out any vaccine across Scotland when it becomes available, and doing so fairly and effectively.Getting this right will be particularly important for the Highlands and Islands with our dispersed population and challenging geography.We must be assured that our region does not end up playing catch-up with the central belt which is an understandable concern locally, given the track record of this government in other matters affecting us.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP and Shadow Health Secretary.Sir,In the recent storms  houses at Bruach Gorm, Port Charlotte, using the communal West Highland Housing Association satellite dish lost half their sky channels including BBC  and STV.As I write, it#s been  working days since at least three of us that I know reported the issue to West Highland, but not a word of a fix date.The dish has done well for  years, but things degrade over time. I had an inkling this year there would be a dish problem and in the summer I bought a TV aerial kit for £ # a lot cheaper than fitting a dish.I put the aerial in the loft and there is a good reception, with BBC  and STV back. It is storm proof in the loft, though was disappointed with the lack of channels from the Bowmore transmitter.I Googled it and the mast is a Freeview Light and lacks channels other UK areas enjoy. I use Sky HD freeview channels but with Sky you have to navigate the TV guide through all the blocked subscription channels to find the one you want to watch. Via the Bowmore mast the TV guide just lists the the Freeview channels, which is great.Freeview said that there were more channels available on main transmitters than there was on relay transmitters, which play a vital role in providing more remote areas with TV coverage.There are a lot of aerials on houses and I think Islay#s TV transmitters should get an upgrade to the same channels as other areas expect.I will also raise this issue with those elected to improve our lives, including our MSP, MP, council leader Councillor Currie and Councillor Horn.Colin M Campbell, Port Charlotte, Isle of Islay.Sir,I think we all need a boost of positive news, so I would like to appeal to your readers to give a brave and special young person in your area the credit they deserve by nominating them for the  WellChild Awards.We are looking for inspirational children and young people who have defied the odds in the face of serious illness and the selfless nurses, doctors, brothers, sisters and friends who help care for them.This is your opportunity to give them the recognition they deserve at a prestigious event regularly attended by WellChild Patron, The Duke of Sussex.Nominations are open now so please get yours in before the closing date on Monday December  at noon.

The current bus stop and car park at the head of Glen Croe would also be bypassed. This is an important public transport link for local residents.The consultation launched by the Scottish Government’s Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson is a muddled exercise. It confuses the urgent need to decide on an alternative route for a new road through Glen Croe with the much longer-term strategic transport options for improving connectivity between Argyll and west-central Scotland.Most of the strategic options involve a number of new civil engineering challenges including the construction of bridges over Loch Long and Loch Fyne and extensive road building, both new and upgraded. For reasons of cost and complexity, none of these options are likely to be implemented within this decade.Whatever long-term strategy options may be investigated for their feasibility, there remains the urgent need to build a new road in Glen Croe. It will always be necessary to link the communities of Arrochar Tarbetwith Loch Goil, Cairndow, north Loch Fyne, Inveraray and beyond with the A.I note that both my local community council in Loch Goil and Argyll and Bute Council support the route that follows the existing forest track on the opposite side of the glen from the Rest and Be Thankful without a similar risk of landslides. Compared with the strategic options, this is a modestof road to construct.The sooner that steps are taken to realise this solution the better it will be for all who currently suffer the increasingly frequent road closures due to climate change and the unstable hill.Alastair R Moodie, LochgoilheadSir,Every year thousands of children contact Childline about being bullied online and tell us that they feel it is hard to escape from.Lockdown has intensied these feelings for many and since April we’ve counselled more than , children and young people across the UK about online bullying.Children have told us about people sending threatening or abusive messages and being pressured into engaging in sexual conversations. Others have shared that they’ve been excluded from online games by other children, while some spoke of online identities being stolen to embarrass or cause trouble while using their name.Before lockdown measures were first introduced this year, the average monthly number of counselling session with children about online bullying was . Between April and October that value increased by  per cent to a monthly average of .This is worrying, particularly as we continue to adhere to strict social-distancing restrictions across Scotland and children continue to spend more time online. Bullying can have a long-term impact on the mental wellbeing of a child and, as we mark Anti Bullying Week this month and beyond, it’s important to ensure that every child knows who they can turn to for support.If a parent thinks their child is being bullied online, it can be hard to remain calm, but it’s crucial not to overwhelm a child with questions. Taking their device away is likely to make them feel like whatever has happened is their fault instead, it’s helpful to listen to their worries, suggest they take some time away from certain apps, and provide them with reassurance.Adeniyi Alade, service head of Childline at NSPCC ScotlandSir,Boris Johnson’s comment that devolution has been #a disaster north of the border# and #Tony Blair’s worst mistake# should hardly come as a surprise to anyone.The Tories have never been great supporters of devolution, vehemently opposing both the referendums in  on establishing a Scottish Assembly and in  on the Scottish Parliament.Most recently the devolution power grab that is highlighted in the Internal Market Bill simply reinforces this stance.The Scottish Social Attitudes surveyon constitutional preference found that only seven per cent favour abolition of the Scottish Parliament and it found that trust in the Scottish Government sits at four times that of the UK Government. This points to it hardly being a disaster.For those accused of scaremongering that there is a threat to Holyrood, Mr Johnson’s comments are clear vindication. The irony of all this being that devolution has given new le to the Scottish Conservatives after its wipe out in  and it is now the opposition in the Scottish Parliament.Be under no doubt that the Scottish Parliament, which was hard fought for, is under threat and we must do all in our power to defend it.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures november 27 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Businesses need to act now! This is true for retail, those trading in consumer goods, services and investment, construction and housing as well as vehicle and haulier firms. The UK Government has put a raft of measures in place for all firms across England, Scotland and Wales. Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove said: “We are leaving the EU single market and customs union. This will bring both new challenges and new opportunities for businesses. We recognise this is a challenging time for everyone. We are determined to support businesses to be ready for  January  and beyond. ”These are actions to take now#Procurement expert Laura Hobbs has led the way for the construction industry to prepare for the end of the UK transition period. Laura is the UK and Ireland One Procurement Programme Lead at Royal BAM Group, which is among the biggest construction firms covering England, Wales and Scotland. She said: “We have created a snapshot to give a clear picture for the industry where we believe pinch points are.” Laura explained: “I decided to pull my peers together, all the other main contractors that are part of the Construction Senior Leaders Group which I chair. We decided to write one set of questions for the end of UK transition and also share the workload – to go to all those dferent product categories key to construction.“As main contractors we deal a lot with sub-contractors so we need to ensure the message gets further into the supply chain.”The Construction Senior Leaders Group also includes representatives from Skanska, Costain, Murphys, Laing O’Rourke, housebuilders Berkeley and clients including Highways UK and Clarion Housing Group. Manufacturers are employing new customs experts to help them get in position for the new start, creating more strategic programmes to negate any currency fluctuations. Laura worked with Build UK, receiving useful information around imports and exports from the UK Government. “Information is the key and preparation is essential. The organisations we work with have been preparing for this for a long time so they are on their final rehearsal now. “To be able to give your own business the comfort you are going into this in a planned, coordinated way, it is key for people to start the exercise sooner rather than later,” stressed Laura. She said the new start will bring opportunities to invest in the UK supply chain. “We always see the positives and, definitely for the UK, there are opportunities coming.”"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 18 follow me","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

But, usually, it means yoursquoll find it more dficult to exercise your rights.This applies even where we see a rapid purchase of a company thatrsquos gone into administration, where on the surface it looks like itrsquos businesses as usual.Can Iitems to a retailer thats gone into administration It depends. Once a retailer goes into administration the administrators role is to try and save the company, and in doing so, it may take the decision not to accept s.But you could ask for a refundthe things you bought werent delivered, or you could claim for the cost of a repairthey were faulty.Do myrights still apply after a company has gone into administration If yoursquove been supplied with faulty goods and the company is placed into administration but is still trading, you may be able to get a replacement or a refund in the normal way under the Consumer Rights Act.If the company isnrsquot trading while itrsquos in administration, yoursquoll need to make a claim to the administrator as an unsecured creditor, so it may be unlikely that youll get a refund in this case.Butyou donrsquot submit a claim in writing to the administrators then it is highly unlikely that they will stand to get their money back. We think itrsquos worth at least trying.If you have a faulty item, you could register your claim with the administrators for the cost of fixing the item, or for a refundtheres still time to reject the item.Can I still use my warranty after a company has gone into administration If you bought an item thats faulty and it came with a warranty, you should be able to claim a refund or repair from the manufacturer under the terms of the warranty.You may be able to make a claim on an extended warrantythe cover was provided by a third party .If the retailer goes into administration and the goods are faulty, then your manufacturers warranty should cover you for at least the first year. Check your documentation to seethis is the case.Check the small print carefully to see who actually provided the warranty cover. Often itrsquos provided by a third partyin which case you shouldnrsquot be affecteda store ceases trading.If the cover was provided by the retailer in question, then it depends on what happens at the end of the administration period.If the retailer ceases to trade, then unfortunately you would lose the benefit of the extended warranty.Remember that youll usually get a manufacturerrsquos guarantee with an item that will provide some protection for the first year - sometimes even longer.Can I claim from my card company If you paid for goods that cost less than pound on a credit or debit card, you may be able to claim under chargeback.If youve bought something on your credit card costing more than pound, means the card provider is jointly responsible for any breaches of contract.You can claim under Section  of the Consumer Credit Actthe item is faulty.Write to your credit card company with details of your claim. You can use our template letter to claim a refund from your credit card companya retailer goes bust.Can I claimI only paid a deposit You dont have to have paid the full amount on your credit card ndash the card company is liable evenyou made only part of the paymenton your card.Its the value of the goods youre buying thats key, not the amount paid on the card.Under Section , as long as the value of the product is between pound and pound, then youll be covered, regardless of how much you paid on your card.So, for example,you ordered a new camera and paid a pound deposit with your credit card and paid the balance of pound by cheque, youd be covered for the whole poundthe company went out of business and you didnt get your camera.Can I still use my gt vouchers after a company has gone into administration A number of high street stores have refused to allow customers to use gt vouchers after going into administration. Unfortunately, this is within the law.But,the administrator takes this decision its worth waiting a few days to seeit will change its mind.If your gt vouchers are refused, you need to make a claim in writing to the administrators with proof of your vouchers.You can find the name of the administrator on the website of the retailer that has gone into administration.But theres no guarantee youll get all of your money back, and it could take up to  months to process the claim properly. And, not all administrators will take this approach.If you want to get your money back, you can use our template letter to claim a refund for vouchers from a bust company.Can I make a chargeback claim for gt vouchers If a company is accepting gt vouchers then chargeback claims will not be accepted.If gt vouchers arent being accepted and you bought gt vouchers on your card, you should be able to put in a chargeback request to your bank on the grounds that the vouchers are fundamentally dferent from what you paid for.This is because you expected to be able to exchange the vouchers for goods of a certain value and instead theyre worthless.If the vouchers were given to you as a gt, its trickier to make this argument. The person who received a voucher as a gt cant make a claim.But the person who bought the vouchers could put in a chargeback request to the bank. You can use our letter template to help you make a chargeback claim.Its worth noting though, that theres no guarantee the administrators will accept chargeback claims.Can I get my cashback If you were supposed to get cashback as part of your purchase, it depends on how the cashback offer was set up -

Of those , six are employees of MOWI and a further seven are employees of companies who directly benefit from contracts with MOWI. Only five would appear to have no direct personal financial interest in the application.Several of these letters are clearly copied from a template, perhaps instructed by their employer.It is hard for the  objectors, who are probably mostly local people or regular visitors, to compete with the money that MOWI is prepared to put behind its increasingly desperate attempts to force yet another fish farm on the unwilling local communities.Clearly almost the only people who want a salmon farm are those who stand to make personal financial gain from it. Can there be a clearer indication of how undesirable farms are I suggest local people who have the long-term interests of the region at heart # as opposed to the short-term economic interests that MOWI has # make their views known to the council, referring to planning application   MFF.Use your own words and make clear that you are not employed by any salmon farming company.Can I ask councillors, when considering the application, to attend to the views of the local people you represent, rather than overseas companies Ed Tyler, Scottish Green Party, Argyll and Bute Branch.It was very interesting to read that Argyll and Bute Council favours the Glen Croe option running adjacent to A to be a permanent solution to this ongoing threat.I really do hope this means using the forestry road on the opposite side of the valley #adjacent# to current A. This really does seem to be the ideal solution.Yes, it would no doubt cost a lot but the alternatives mean an ongoing struggle with no really sound final solution to this very serious problem.Argyll and Bute residents businesses have been amazingly patient over the years but we all live with the knowledge that the current road is so unsafe and dangerous, and the day could easily come that we hear of a fatal accident due to yet another landslide.Argyll has always been a very beautul, special part of Scotland. What a boost it would be to the economy for visitors to come here with no threat to their lives as they travel in.The expense of completing this major new road would be more than justied in a prosperous new outlook for our beloved Argyll.Scotland has boasted great engineers in its past history, let’s trust there are still those out there capable of the task.Moreen Moller, Clachan.A free online confidence-building course to help people in Argyll and Bute find their lives again after losing sight will be available later this month.Living with Sight Loss is being run by the charity RNIB Scotland over four Thursdays starting on November  until December . It will take place from .am to .am.If you’re living with sight loss in Argyll and Bute, this course can help provide the practical and emotional support you need to face the future with confidence.Living with Sight Loss offers a combination of facilitated online sessions and talks about what help and support is available and how it can be accessed. A range of dferent themes will be covered, including mobility and daily living, emotional support and wellbeing, assistive technology, eye health, peer support and leisure time.As well as an opportunity for people with sight loss to connect with each other, family and friends are also invited to join and participate.The course is part of RNIB Scotland#s Need to Talk initiative, funded by the European Union#s Interreg programme to support people in peripheral communities.

We know only too well the fear and distress fireworks cause to pets, with  per cent of owners reporting their pets being affected # trembling, being physically sick and being too frightened to leave the house for days after.We would urge people to let their know neighbours knowthey’re planning to have fireworks and also to use low-noise fireworks and sparklers this year where possible for the sake of pets and people who may struggle with them across the country.Claire Stallard, animal behaviourist, Blue Cross.Key workers in Britain are rightly receiving the recognition and appreciation they deserve, with NHS staff, care workers and delivery drivers among the professions that have been praised for their heroic efforts this year.But, some of the most essential workers in developing countries worldwide are continually overlooked and neglected. Working animals play a key role in the world’s poorest communities and help provide a livelihood for more than half a billion people.An estimated  million working horses, donkeys, camels and elephants are relied upon to transport goods, food, water and firewood. By doing the jobs of trucks, tractors and taxis, this invisible workforce ensures the survival of poverty-stricken families.However, these animals often endure appalling conditions, with poor nutrition and no access to veterinary treatment when they are sick or injured.At the animal charity the Society for the Protection of Animals Abroad , we believe that working animals overseas should receive the respect, compassion and vital veterinary care they desperately need.On International Working Animal Day , please find out how you can show your support for these hardworking animals by visiting www.spana.org iwad.Geoffrey Dennis, chief executive, SPANA.This week marks Occupational Therapy Weekand I want to personally thank these unsung heroes who make a dference to so many lives.As someone living with a terminal illness, I am a day patient at the Marie Curie Edinburgh hospice and I never imagined occupational therapists would play a vital role in my le.Whether it has been attending relevant classes to ease conditions, such as fatigue, anxiety and breathlessness, to discovering what allowances I was entitled to and taking part in the ious day therapy sessions on offer, they have also made sure I can continue living independently at home too.Their constant support and advice has kept me safe in these unprecedented times and without occupational therapists, my le – like so many others – would be very dferent to what it is today.Thank you.Helen Hogg, Midlothian."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 17 congratulations and jubilations","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We predict there will be as many as , more pets eligible for our services over the months ahead, as a direct result of the economic hardship caused by the pandemic.For many sick and injured pets, whose owners are struggling financially, PDSA is their only emergency service.For more information on PDSA and the pet care crisis and how you can help, please visit PDSA.org.uk whywematterPaul Manktelow # PDSA VetVolunteers and staff from our NSPCC school service aren’t able to deliver our free Speak Out, Stay Safe assemblies in person at the moment, because of restrictions in place to reduce the spread of Covid-.But, so that we can continue to work alongside staff in primary schools to help children know what to do and who to speak tosomething is worrying or upsetting them, we have launched a virtual programme.

It also followed a US decision to stop using RAF Machrihanish as an operating base for its maritime patrol aircraft.FIFTY YEARS AGOBronze Age skeleton uncovered in cistA tomb, believed to be about , years old, has been excavated in a field behind Highland Parish Church, Campbeltown.Dr E Peltenburg, the Glasgow University tutor in extra-mural archaeology for Argyll, excavated the Bronze Age burial cist at the request of Father James Webb, who discovered it recently.A badly crushed skeleton has been uncovered together with well-preserved grave goods, including jet beads and beautully worked flint blades.These finds are being carefully treated and studied at present.The excavation was a topic of conversation at recent Wednesday afternoon archaeology classes held in Argyll.Other extra-mural classes in the area include The Le Sciences of Campbeltown, Plant Le of Kintyre, which is held in Tayinloan and a course on western Scotland traditions at Bowmore, Islay.A new course, Introduction of Astronomy, will start in Campbeltown in January.Waterspout observed off Kintyre coastAn unusual natural spectacle, a waterspout, was witnessed last Thursday morning on the west coast of Kintyre.It was estimated by one observer to have been about , feet in height.Mr AC MacAllister, Tigh Na Baan, Glenbarr, first saw the waterspout about am and drove south keeping it in view.At one point he was travelling at mph, yet he did not succeed in drawing level with it.The waterspout was in sight for about  minutes before it was engulfed by a hail storm off Westport.Mr MacAllister said: ‘It passed down the coast about a mile offshore. I have seen a film of a waterspout taken in Cyprus so I am certain that this was a genuine waterspout.’Mr MacAllister mentioned several persons who also witnessed the sight, including farmworkers at Glenbarr.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOA boon to pensionersThe rise in the cost of living during recent years brought in its train many cases of hardship to that class of superannuated public servants whether engaged in teaching, police or other national service.Retired on allowances which were reasonable at the time these were granted, such pensioners made repeated and, till now, fruitless representations to the Secretary for Scotland through ious Scottish MPs.We are glad to note, however, that their petition has atsecured from the Treasury equitable payment on a percentage basis and regulated according to the whole means of living presently held by a pensioner and his we.Full conditions and particulars have just been intimated to those immediately affected.

It cost the lives of  British servicemen and severe injuries to many more but it made Blair a rich man, resulting from his popularity in America where many of my friends still think the sun shines from his posterior.I would agree, however, that allowing the electorate in Scotland to vote in favour of devolution, was undoubtedly Blair#s second biggest mistake.His motivation was to placate those crying for Scottish independence, following the discovery of North Sea oil, but the irony was that it led to a series of disastrously incompetent Labour Lib Dem coalition governments.These in turn resulted in the electorate choosing, in , a minority SNP government, enabled by support from the Greens.My letter would be far too long were I to dwell on all the areas of incompetence in Holyrood government since , so I#ll confine my evaluation to education, upon which the future of Scotland depends.In , Salmond#s election promise was primary school class sizes of under  but, two years later, Fiona Hyslop changed that target to fewer than  pupils. That was just before Salmond sacked her and Mike Russell admitted smaller class sizes might not be possible before .Those councils that did enforce the limit of  only did so by refusing places to children whose siblings were at the same school.The #attainment gap# between children from poorer backgrounds and those from more affluent areas has continued to widen rather than diminish, as Nicola Sturgeon promised, while older students cannot find places at Scottish universities because these have to be allocated to foreign students, whose fees are a necessity to fund the universities.Meanwhile, I hate to think what Scotland#s deficit is now. It was around eight per cent of GDP before Covid decimated so many areas vital to Scotland#s economy.Doubtless, Alex Orr will remind me Scotland cannot legally have a deficit, but an independent Scotland could and it would prevent the dream of Scotland rejoining the EU from ever being attained.Brian Gee, Carradale East.In the recent storms,  houses at Bruach Gorm, Port Charlotte using the communal West Highland Housing Association satellite dish, lost half our Sky channels, including BBC  and STV.As I write, it’s been  working days since at least three of us that I know reported the issue to West Highland, but not a word of a fix date.The dish has done well for  years, but things degrade over time. I had an inkling this year there would be a dish problem and in the summer I bought a TV aerial kit for £ – a lot cheaper than fitting a dish. I put the aerial in the loft and there is a good reception, with BBC  and STV back. It is storm-proof in the loft, though I was disappointed with the lack of channels from the Bowmore transmitter.I Googled it and the mast is a Freeview Light and lacks channels other UK areas enjoy. I use Sky HD freeview channels but with Sky you have to navigate the TV guide through all the blocked subscription channels to find the one you want to watch. Via the Bowmore mast, the TV guide just lists the freeview channels, which is great.Freeview said that there are more channels available on main transmitters than there is on relay transmitters, which play a vital role in providing more remote areas a TV coverage.There are a lot of aerials on houses and I think Islay’s TV transmitters should get an upgrade to the same channels as other areas expect.I will also raise this issue with those elected to improve our lives, including MSP, MP, council leader Councillor Currie and Councillor Horn.Colin M Campbell, Port Charlotte, Islay.I think we all need a boost of positive news, so I would like to appeal to your readers to give a brave and special young person in your area the credit they deserve by nominating them for the  WellChild Awards.We are looking for inspirational children and young people who have defied the odds in the face of serious illness and the selfless nurses, doctors, brothers, sisters and friends who help care for them.This is your opportunity to give them the recognition they deserve at a prestigious event regularly attended by WellChild Patron, The Duke of Sussex.Nominations are open now so please get yours in before the closing date on Monday December  at noon.

This time it was to Perth to compete in the novice section of the Scottish Youth Championships, arriving in Perth on Saturday for Sunday’s competition.And on Sunday, playing third out of  bands, they had to leave before the results were announced. So there was much cheering and celebrating on the West Coast Motors bus on the journey home when the news came through that they had done the town proud and received a gold award and first place.This was an amazing feat for such a young and inexperienced band the youngest member Erin McLellan celebrated her eighth birthday on Sunday and the oldest member was only .TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGONo pledge on munitions dump surveyThere are no immediate plans for a survey of underwater munitions dumps in the Clyde and North Channel areas.Scientists from the marine research laboratory at Torry last week completed their survey of the area between the Beaufort’s Dyke dump and the nearby site of British Gas pipe laying operations.The operation has been blamed for disturbing thousands of Second World War fire bombs which were washed up on beaches in Kintyre, Mid Argyll, Islay, Jura, Gigha, Arran, North Ayrshire and Northern Ireland.But Scottish Office minister Raymond Robertson told MPs last week that the evidence connecting the pipe laying with the firebombs was ‘circumstantial’.Mr Robertson refused to commit the government to carrying out any further sea bed surveys in the areas around other munitions dumping sites off the west coast of Scotland.FIFTY YEARS AGOCriomaganMr Donnie Ronaldson, of the Argyll Arms Hotel, Southend, was host to a number of hoteliers and restauranteurs at a display of micro-wave cooking by the Scottish AGH Vending Company of Dundee which is the selling agent for Philips Microwave.Mr Robert Beveridge, the sales representative, gave a comprehensive demonstration on micro-wave cooking.Middleton discusses Common Market with fishermenMr George Middleton, chairman of the Herring Industry Board, revealed at a press conference last week that the board had been in touch with the Secretary of State for Scotland about the widespread alarm among fishermen about possible Common Market entry.Mr Gordon Campbell has replied: #It is not possible to make anything like the final assessment of the likely effect until we know in detail the regulations the European Economic Community proposes to make in implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy, and until our negotiations for entry have gone much further.#Mr Middleton assured fishermen on the pier during the discussions that the board existed to protect fishing interests and to fight any policies potentially harmful to the industry. He assured the fishermen that the board was well aware of the dangers entry into the Common Market presented.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGONews from Islay # honouring Mr and Mrs Anderson, CarnainOn the evening of Friday November   a concert was held in Newton School, the object of which was to give material expression in honour of Mr and Mrs Anderson, Carnain, who lost their two sonsin the Great War.The concert was remarkably successful, people being present from almost all parts of Kilchoman as well as from Kilarrow and Kelmeny, and the accommodation was taxed to its utmost capacity.Mr Cullen, Bridgend, in his own inimitable manner, occupied the chair and voiced the feelings of an enthusiastic audience in an excellent speech.He said they were gathered there that night to do honour to Mr Angus Anderson, an old soldier and the father of soldiers # of two sons who gave their lives for their King and Country.Mr Anderson joined the nd Argylls in , just  years before the Great War broke out. He was, for five and a half years, orderly to Captain M’Neill of Colonsay, latterly Colonel M’Neill # the much-loved Commanding Officer of the th Argylls.Mr Anderson’s two sons were buried in France # John at Mailly Wood and James in an unknown soldier’s grave.The chairman announced that the proceeds amounted to £ s dand this was augmented by a handsome cheque from Mr Morrison of Islay House."},{"url":null,"title":"leader november 27 2020","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

So there will be one window on st December , two windows on December  and so on – and they should stay in place until Twelfth Night.Everyone is invited to walk or drive around the parishes and spot the decorated windows. A guide will also be available in the village shops.In this way, we hope to brighten the preparation for Christmas for everyone.More than , children are admitted to hospital every day in the UK and it has never been a scarier time for them.With unfamiliar wards, health professionals in additional PPE, only being able to have one parent with them, and no visits from their brothers or sisters during the pandemic, it can be very worrying and lonely.That is why play and distraction services in hospitals are now more vital than ever. Having access to toys and entertainment, when recovering or waiting for treatment, or using play as a distraction for procedures can help to alleviate pain, aid recovery and bring joy back into children’s lives.At the children’s charity Starlight, thanks to our supporters, we provide hospitals with boxes filled with toys, games and puzzles to be used on wards.This year, Starlight’s fundraising income has fallen due to many cancelled events, which is why we have started our Time to Play campaign. Our goal is to raise £, before the end of the year to help , children get access to play in hospital and limit the negative effects of illness on their childhood.It’s easy to support and our website has fun ideas of how to take part, including our Stream for Starlight fundraiser for computer gamers.Or,you are able to, please considering making a simple one-off donation. However big or small, it will help Starlight to continue to be there to support children and their families this Christmas.I’m hoping your readers will join together and help support Starlight, to bring back joy into the lives of the , seriously ill children living in the UK this Christmas.Please visit www.starlight.org.uk time to help us.

Others have shared that they’ve been excluded from online games by other children, while some spoke of online identities being stolen to embarrass or cause trouble while using their name.Before lockdown measures were first introduced this year, the average monthly number of counselling sessions with children about online bullying was . Between April and October that value increased by  per cent to a monthly average of .This is worrying, particularly as we continue to adhere to strict social-distancing restrictions across Scotland and children continue to spend more time online. Bullying can have a long-term impact on the mental wellbeing of a child and, as we mark Anti Bullying Week this month and beyond, it’s important to ensure that every child knows who they can turn to for support.If a parent thinks their child is being bullied online, it can be hard to remain calm, but it’s crucial not to overwhelm a child with questions. Taking their device away is likely to make them feel like whatever has happened is their fault instead, it’s helpful to listen to their worries, suggest they take some time away from certain apps, and provide them with reassurance.Adeniyi Alade, service head of Childline at NSPCC Scotland.Boris Johnson’s comment that devolution has been #a disaster north of the border# and #Tony Blair’s worst mistake# should hardly come as a surprise to anyone.The Tories have never been great supporters of devolution, vehemently opposing both the referendums in  on establishing a Scottish Assembly and in  on the Scottish Parliament.Most recently the devolution power grab that is highlighted in the Internal Market Bill simply reinforces this stance.The Scottish Social Attitudes surveyon constitutional preference found that only seven per cent favour abolition of the Scottish Parliament and it found that trust in the Scottish Government sits at four times that of the UK Government. This points to it hardly being a disaster.For those accused of scaremongering that there is a threat to Holyrood, Mr Johnson’s comments are clear vindication. The irony of all this being that devolution has given new le to the Scottish Conservatives after its wipe out in  and it is now the opposition in the Scottish Parliament.Be under no doubt that the Scottish Parliament, which was hard fought for, is under threat and we must do all in our power to defend it.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.While this year Christmas is going to be dferent from usual for many of us, it is still a time for preparations and extra food.

We watch the news and hope restrictions will be eased, but we are afraid of that too, as this could lead to the virus spreading. So we wait and watch and wonder – a bit like the shepherds of old, gathered on the hillside, waiting and watching and wondering.It has been a tough few months and for many it has been a gruelling and harrowing few months.How do we celebrate in such times Yet, I have heard so many people say: #Well I’m going to put up my tree and I’m going to do it early to bring some cheer into our lives.#We are a people of hope, even in the darkest days.We wait in the darkness for we know that even the darkest night has the first streaks of dawn to lighten the sky.So as we approach the time of preparing to welcome the Christ child once again, we will wait hopefully."},{"url":null,"title":"fundraising star lights up the night","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is true for retail, those trading in consumer goods, services and investment, construction and housing as well as vehicle and haulier firms. The UK Government has put a raft of measures in place for all firms across England, Scotland and Wales. Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove said: “We are leaving the EU single market and customs union. This will bring both new challenges and new opportunities for businesses. We recognise this is a challenging time for everyone. We are determined to support businesses to be ready for  January  and beyond. ”These are actions to take now#Procurement expert Laura Hobbs has led the way for the construction industry to prepare for the end of the UK transition period. Laura is the UK and Ireland One Procurement Programme Lead at Royal BAM Group, which is among the biggest construction firms covering England, Wales and Scotland. She said: “We have created a snapshot to give a clear picture for the industry where we believe pinch points are.” Laura explained: “I decided to pull my peers together, all the other main contractors that are part of the Construction Senior Leaders Group which I chair. We decided to write one set of questions for the end of UK transition and also share the workload – to go to all those dferent product categories key to construction.“As main contractors we deal a lot with sub-contractors so we need to ensure the message gets further into the supply chain.”The Construction Senior Leaders Group also includes representatives from Skanska, Costain, Murphys, Laing O’Rourke, housebuilders Berkeley and clients including Highways UK and Clarion Housing Group. Manufacturers are employing new customs experts to help them get in position for the new start, creating more strategic programmes to negate any currency fluctuations. Laura worked with Build UK, receiving useful information around imports and exports from the UK Government. “Information is the key and preparation is essential. The organisations we work with have been preparing for this for a long time so they are on their final rehearsal now. “To be able to give your own business the comfort you are going into this in a planned, coordinated way, it is key for people to start the exercise sooner rather than later,” stressed Laura. She said the new start will bring opportunities to invest in the UK supply chain. “We always see the positives and, definitely for the UK, there are opportunities coming.”"},{"url":null,"title":"new provost for argyll and bute","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Most of these were killed before the mid-s.The species all but vanished from the region – dedicated whale surveys from ships off South Georgia resulted in only a single blue whale sighting between  and  – but more recent surveys suggest blue whales are making a comeback.A survey in February  resulted in  blue whale sightings and numerous acoustic detections.Lead author Susannah Calderan of the Scottish Association for Marine Science , Oban, said: #The continued absence of blue whales at South Georgia has been seen as an example of a population that was locally exploited beyond the point where it could recover.#But over the past few years we’ve been working at South Georgia, we have become quite optimistic about the numbers of blue whales seen and heard around the island, which hadn’t been happening until very recently. This year was particularly exciting, with more blue whale sightings than we ever could have hoped for.#As well as looking for whales, the researchers used listening devices, which can detect the loud, low frequency calls of whales over long distances and can also work in rough weather.The team also had records of whale sightings reported to the South Georgia Museum by mariners and tourist ship passengers and photographs of blue whales, which enable inidual animals to be identied.In total,  blue whales have been photo-identied from South Georgia between  and , although none of these matched the  whales in the current Antarctic blue whale photographic catalogue.Susannah added: #We don’t quite know why it has taken the blue whales so long to come back. It may be so many of them were killed at South Georgia that there was a loss of cultural memory in the population that the area was a foraging ground and that it is only now being rediscovered.#There are limited opportunities for dedicated whale surveys in the region, known for its harsh weather and inaccessibility, but such surveys are crucial to the future management of South Georgia’s seas.Co-author and whale ecologist Dr Jenner Jackson of the British Antarctic Survey, which led the  whale expedition, said: #This is an exciting discovery and a really positive step forward for conservation of the Antarctic blue whale.#With South Georgia waters designated as a Marine Protected Area by the Government of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, we hope these increased numbers of blue whales are a sign of things to come and that our research can continue to contribute to effective management of the area.#The team’s analysis was funded by South Georgia Heritage Trust and Friends of South Georgia Island, which also funded the collection of some of the data used. Acoustic and sightings data come from expeditions led by the British Antarctic Survey, with funding from the Darwin Initiative and EU BEST from the Swiss Polar Institute Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition, funded by the ACE Foundation, Ferring Pharmaceuticals and the Australian Antarctic Division, and Government of South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands.This international collaboration includes scientists from the SAMS, BAS, Australian Antarctic Division, US NOAA, International Fund for Animal Welfare, Government of South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands, South Georgia Heritage Trust, University of Washington, Texas AM University at Galveston and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 18 follow me","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

East Lothian is a particularly good place for short-eared owls as it offers the right habitat ndash such as lowland grazing marshes and rough grassland ndash that wintering lsquoshortiesrsquo need.During summer, short-eared owls are likely to be seen in moorlands ndash their preferable breeding habitat. As they nest on the ground, usually in the shelter of tall grass, the breeding site must have sufficient cover to conceal the nest.Shorties are unusual for owls because they prefer to hunt in the daytime. They can be seen hunting as they quarter an area looking for their prey. lsquoQuartering flightrsquo is a mixture of flapping and gliding sometimes they hover before dropping down onto the prey. It is not uncommon to see several shorties hunting over the same area. They occasionally hunt from a perch or while standing on the ground. Unlike other owls, shorties carry their prey in talons. They feed on small mammalsthat comprise around  per cent of their diet.Short-eared owls are ghostly as they soundlessly flit over the landscape. There is nothing more magical than watching an owl turns its head towards you whilst keeping the body still.My adventure with them started two years ago during a visit to Aberlady. It was a sunny and windless Saturday morning when I arrived at the reserve. I hung my camera over my shoulder and rushed over the bridge. The tide was slowly coming in, so the lagoon did not host many birds. There was no one around and I was so instilled with the surrounding silence that I could hear my own thoughts.As I walked further towards the coast, I saw a pale bird to my left. My initial thought was lsquoseagullrsquo however, after I looked through my camera, I realised it was an owl. I could not believe my luck! I know I say this a lot, but I really am a lucky person when it comes to wildle.Even though the ground was covered in frost, I decided to sit down in tall grass ndash no matter the sacrice, when it comes to wildle my priority is to remain invisible to avoid any disturbance.From my vantage point, I witnessed the owl freeze in mid-air for a split second and pounce with its head down. I must admit it looked quite comical at first. It did not catch anything the first time, so I kept watching, hoping for another attempt.Before long, I realised the owl was joined by another shortie. Could I have asked for more ! The second owl rushed towards the first one and as it got closer it straightened its legs and scratched the first bird with its talons.The owls were clearly manesting some disagreement but it cooled down fairly quickly. The second bird decided to retreat and, as it flew past me, it looked straight into my camera before it finally vanished from my sight. The moment when the birdrsquos eyes met mine was hypnotising. I was so entranced that I needed a while before I was ready to carry on with my photography.After this wonderful experience, I wanted toto the reserve a week later. But on that visit I found the owls further towards the coast where it was dficult to photograph them, although I still enjoyed watching them.

But, usually, it means yoursquoll find it more dficult to exercise your rights.This applies even where we see a rapid purchase of a company thatrsquos gone into administration, where on the surface it looks like itrsquos businesses as usual.Can Iitems to a retailer thats gone into administration It depends. Once a retailer goes into administration the administrators role is to try and save the company, and in doing so, it may take the decision not to accept s.But you could ask for a refundthe things you bought werent delivered, or you could claim for the cost of a repairthey were faulty.Do myrights still apply after a company has gone into administration If yoursquove been supplied with faulty goods and the company is placed into administration but is still trading, you may be able to get a replacement or a refund in the normal way under the Consumer Rights Act.If the company isnrsquot trading while itrsquos in administration, yoursquoll need to make a claim to the administrator as an unsecured creditor, so it may be unlikely that youll get a refund in this case.Butyou donrsquot submit a claim in writing to the administrators then it is highly unlikely that they will stand to get their money back. We think itrsquos worth at least trying.If you have a faulty item, you could register your claim with the administrators for the cost of fixing the item, or for a refundtheres still time to reject the item.Can I still use my warranty after a company has gone into administration If you bought an item thats faulty and it came with a warranty, you should be able to claim a refund or repair from the manufacturer under the terms of the warranty.You may be able to make a claim on an extended warrantythe cover was provided by a third party .If the retailer goes into administration and the goods are faulty, then your manufacturers warranty should cover you for at least the first year. Check your documentation to seethis is the case.Check the small print carefully to see who actually provided the warranty cover. Often itrsquos provided by a third partyin which case you shouldnrsquot be affecteda store ceases trading.If the cover was provided by the retailer in question, then it depends on what happens at the end of the administration period.If the retailer ceases to trade, then unfortunately you would lose the benefit of the extended warranty.Remember that youll usually get a manufacturerrsquos guarantee with an item that will provide some protection for the first year - sometimes even longer.Can I claim from my card company If you paid for goods that cost less than pound on a credit or debit card, you may be able to claim under chargeback.If youve bought something on your credit card costing more than pound, means the card provider is jointly responsible for any breaches of contract.You can claim under Section  of the Consumer Credit Actthe item is faulty.Write to your credit card company with details of your claim. You can use our template letter to claim a refund from your credit card companya retailer goes bust.Can I claimI only paid a deposit You dont have to have paid the full amount on your credit card ndash the card company is liable evenyou made only part of the paymenton your card.Its the value of the goods youre buying thats key, not the amount paid on the card.Under Section , as long as the value of the product is between pound and pound, then youll be covered, regardless of how much you paid on your card.So, for example,you ordered a new camera and paid a pound deposit with your credit card and paid the balance of pound by cheque, youd be covered for the whole poundthe company went out of business and you didnt get your camera.Can I still use my gt vouchers after a company has gone into administration A number of high street stores have refused to allow customers to use gt vouchers after going into administration. Unfortunately, this is within the law.But,the administrator takes this decision its worth waiting a few days to seeit will change its mind.If your gt vouchers are refused, you need to make a claim in writing to the administrators with proof of your vouchers.You can find the name of the administrator on the website of the retailer that has gone into administration.But theres no guarantee youll get all of your money back, and it could take up to  months to process the claim properly. And, not all administrators will take this approach.If you want to get your money back, you can use our template letter to claim a refund for vouchers from a bust company.Can I make a chargeback claim for gt vouchers If a company is accepting gt vouchers then chargeback claims will not be accepted.If gt vouchers arent being accepted and you bought gt vouchers on your card, you should be able to put in a chargeback request to your bank on the grounds that the vouchers are fundamentally dferent from what you paid for.This is because you expected to be able to exchange the vouchers for goods of a certain value and instead theyre worthless.If the vouchers were given to you as a gt, its trickier to make this argument. The person who received a voucher as a gt cant make a claim.But the person who bought the vouchers could put in a chargeback request to the bank. You can use our letter template to help you make a chargeback claim.Its worth noting though, that theres no guarantee the administrators will accept chargeback claims.Can I get my cashback If you were supposed to get cashback as part of your purchase, it depends on how the cashback offer was set up - you may still receive it.Check the terms and conditions to see whether the offer is backed by the manufacturer , or whether the cashback claim should be made to the retailer.If the manufacturer is providing the cashback, your claim shouldnt be affected.If its the retailer, you could still put in a claim and they would be in breach of contractthey didnt send the cash.If you didnt get the cash, unfortunately, you couldnt take court action against the retailer while its in administration.If at the end of the administration the retailer stopped trading, youd need to lodge your claim for unpaid cashback with the administrators."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-tiers-no-changes-east-lothian-remains-level-2","story":"That means neighbouring Midlothian will remain in Level  Covid restrictions for another week after the First Minister said no changes would be made this week.Speaking to the Scottish Parliament today , Nicola Sturgeon said that good progress was being made in pushing down the spread of coronavirus across Scotland.While East Lothian stays in Level , hopes that neighbouring Midlothian would join it were dashed as the First Minister saidthere was still a need to ldquostrengthen and solidy the progress made.She told MSPs: ldquoThe sacrices everyone is making are making a dference, they are getting case numbers down, reducing the numbers getting ill and needing hospital care, and so protecting the NHS and saving lives.ldquoAlthough we are encouraged by the impact current restrictions have had, the need to strengthen and solidy that progress means we should continue to take care and err on the side of caution.Ms Sturgeon said that no local authority would see a level change this week following a weekly review but indicated changes were likely to be brought in next week.That means Edinburgh also remains in Level  and West Lothian in Level ."},{"url":null,"title":"100-new-affordable-homes-delivered-east-lothian-year","story":"Tenants have been collecting keys to  new council houses which East Lothian Council took ownership of in Haddington in the last few months, with a further  on the same estate due to be handed over by the end of this year.However, the local authority has revealed that despite the closure of construction sites for large parts of the year, it has continued to bring forward affordable housing.SInce September, the council has also taken ownership of seven new homes in Dunbar and  at Pinkie, Musselburgh.And during the year, six homes at Dovecot, Haddington, and  new homes at Limeylands, Ormiston, were handed over to East Lothian Housing Association for social rent.An additional  new extra-care council houses at Elder Street, Tranent, are due to be handed over to East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership.The latest handover of  homes at Letham Mains in Haddington, one of the largest new developments in East Lothian, includes two wheelchair-accessible homes.Justine Holmes, who got the keys to her new home at Letham Mains in September, is delighted and says the move has been le-changing for her and her two children.Justine, , said: ldquoWe have had a hard three years.

What youll need red roses red skimmia pink snowberry red spray rosesScots pine clippings eucalyptus salal tips Usually the pine, eucalyptus, skimmia and snowberries can be foraged from a garden, but you might need to call on your local florist for the roses, which will be the signature blooms.Lay all the stems out on a table youd like to use and prepare the stems by removing any leaves and thorns on the bottom half.Where to startTake a foliage stem in your hand, holding the stem roughly halfway up, and one of your focal flowers. This is the start of your arrangement.As you pick up and add more stems, hold each at a slight angle, so your bouquet starts to build in a natural way.Make it evenAlternate your flowers and leaves, adding a flower stem and a foliage stem, turning the bouquet each time you add one.Make flowers the showstopperMake sure the flower heads are positioned slightly above the foliage, so they really show themselves off.For a really stunning arrangement, add flowers in a triangular pattern. It might sound strange, but this means each flower type is evenly distributed through the whole bouquet.Secure the bouquetOnce youve added all the flowers and foliage, tie the bouquet exactly where youve been holding the stems.Once you have secured the bouquet with string, cut each stem at a slight angle using a pair of sharp scissors or secateurs. Hold the bouquet up to the vase to help you determine how much of the stems you need to chop off.Fill a clean vase with water and pop your bouquet in. You may want to tweak it slightlythere are any wayward stems or foliage that arent quite in the right place, before finding the perfect spot to show off your efforts.For more information visit interflora."},{"url":null,"title":"gardening-give-houseplants-festive-makeover","story":"Gardening: How to give your houseplants a festive makeoverGet into the festive spirit with your indoor plantsLooking at ways to throw your houseplants into the spotlight this festive season  Perhaps you havent got room for a tree and want to make an alternative statement, or maybe you just want to give your plants a chance to shine.\"You can quickly transform your existing plants to make them feel part of the celebrations,\" says Rebecca Stanton, stylist at Dobbies Garden Centres , which has seen a rising demand for new ieties of houseplants.Whether youre part of the growing urban jungle club or have just a few statement plants on display, its easy to give them a merry makeover by adding fairy lights, simple decorations or just repositioning them, says Stanton.Here, she shares her top tips to give your houseplants a stylish festive twist.. Regroup your greensA quick and easy way to make a dramatic display is to gather up houseplants that might usually live in separate rooms of your house and group them together, either in the middle of the dining table or on a hallway side table.Rather than repotting the plants, buy pots which will fit the plant with its existing pot, meaning that when its time to take down the decorations you can simply pop them out andthem to their usual home.. Add some sparkleTwinkling fairy lights instantly add magic and they are the ideal way to bring some sparkle to houseplants. Drape lights around branches and foliage as you would do with your traditional tree, making sure that the set is suitable for your plant.Avoid anything too heavy that the plant wont be able to comfortably hold the weight of. Choose battery-operated fairy lights so you dont have to worry about placing plants near a power source - the battery pack is easy enough to subtly hide below the top of the pot.If you are looking for an alternative tree with eco credentials that wont take up too much room, the Araucarialooks like a mini tree. Unlike the cut iety though, you can keep it all year round as it can go outside through the summer months then brought back in each Christmas.. Wrap it upWrapping paper doesnt need to be saved for concealing gts. Instead, use it to dress your plants and their pots, rather like giving your houseplants Christmas jumpers! Create a cone-like shape around your houseplant to give it a speedy transformation - simple, sleek and stylish, its cost-effective too.. Frame your plantAs well as adding decorations to existing houseplants, you can frame plants to give them a festive look. A wire frame planted over a miniature Christmas tree with added lights will add a Scandinavian vibe. Choose one which is small enough to be easily portable, so you can use it to bring festive cheer to ious parts of your home, from the dining table to your home office desk.. Add festive accessories to terrariumsSelf contained and mess-free, terrariums can be easily updated so they become part of your festive decor. Wrap a ribbon around bottle-shaped containers, pop in a few mini baubles or add a lightweight set of warm white micro lights within the glass dome.The trick is to not over-complicate, as terrariums look best styled more simply to avoid detracting too much from the plants on display inside.. Keep it greenOne of the easiest ways to lt a room is the addition of some greenery. Consider a large plant such as Fiddle-leaf figwhich can grow to more than ft and is sure to make a statement. An all year-round star of the show, it might even be an alternative Christmas tree of choice for unconventional decorators.Mix up plants of dferent sizes, from cheese plantsand overhead hanging plants like Curly Spider, or String of Pearls. For an organic look, accessorise plants with natural colours and materials like wood and rattan. To go the extra green mile, frame windows with a garland of fresh foliage and string lights. A celebration of all things green, your living space will feel like a cosy indoor garden oasis."},{"url":null,"title":"agenda-helping-art-community-help","story":"ESTABLISHED in March by my former art lecturer, artist Matthew Burrows MBE to help artists struggling due to Covid-, in April Artist Support Pledgeannounced that pound million sales had been generated via a new economic model revealing a new ldquogted and egalitarian micro economyrsquo.It has since become a global movement of connected communities committed to an equitable and sustainable economy for artist and makers of all countries, media and ethnicities.The project uses social media  Instagram for artists to post images using #artistsupportpledge giving details of their works and price . If people are interested in buying, they message the artist. Anyone can buy the work and artists donrsquot need permission to join.Each time an artist reaches pound, of sales, they pledge to buy pound of work from other artists. There are no enforcements. It is a system based on trust where everyone at every level can contribute in supporting artists and makers.I have been an active participant and supporter of ASP since its formation and can testy that it has indeed helped me continue to work as an artist throughout this pandemic by selling and buying art works via #artistsupportpledge.I share ASPrsquos commitment to sustainability, a belief that underpins many of the works I have produced throughout the course of this year, which were inspired by and redeploy Boris Johnsonrsquos letter to the nation.Sent in April to all households across Britain to urge them to heed the Governmentrsquos coronavirus guidance and stay home wherever possible, the letter was delivered to  million homes, reaching all  million residents in Britain as part of the Governmentrsquos public information campaign at a cost of pound. million.For me, these letters highlighted the incompetence of the Government in its handling of the pandemic. This was important to me because it is about taking a stance against the Government and Chancellor ishi Sunakrsquos statement about the need for artists to retrain.That statement highlighted the hypocrisy of the Government. These letters cost almost poundm and were a waste of taxpayersrsquo money because most people chucked them straight in the bin the information was already available online and no account was made for the visually impaired. My artworks recycle and repurpose these letters and, by so doing, make a comment on the need for sustainability.Last year the art industry was worth pound billion in the UK, yet the average artist earned less than poundk. Many of the artists who struggle to survive make a considerable contribution to our erse cultural landscape.ASP does not believe it is acceptable for artists to go hungry and live a le of debt and worry to make such a valued contribution. Instead, it believes, as I do, that all artists who make that contribution to our common good should be appropriately supported.ASP believes that an equitable and sustainable future economically and environmentally must begin by examining the cultural values we live by that artists are central to this debate and that all artists are important in maintaining the permaculture that is our global artistic ecosystem.Its vision is for a sustainable economy and supportive community for all artists and makers, in all countries and in all medias and traditions. It is a vision which I support fully."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  Mower is less when it comes to making your garden bloom","story":"DEATH to the lawnmower, dump the leaf blower, ditch the power hose. Such is the controversial message from Francesca Osowska, the chief executive of NatureScot, formerly known as Scottish Natural Heritage. In some quarters shersquoll be preaching to the converted. Gardeners whose summers are ruined by weekly or fortnightly grass cutting, who would rather spend their time dead-heading roses or sipping Pimms on the patio, will surely leap at the idea.Osowskarsquos plea is not for gardens to be left to run wild, but for those of us with a bit of lawn to set aside an area to sprout, untouched by the mower. In these corners, weeds and wildflowers, and the insects, birds and other creatures that live off them will flourish.But her vision is for wilderness or wildness to be embraced more broadly than by devotees of the Beechgrove Garden. If redesigned, urban areas, which contain swathes of parkland as well as private gardens, could also help rewild the country. If parks were kept less like Centre Court at Wimbledon and more like a stretch of meadow or marsh you might find in the heart of the countryside, towns and cities could soon be alive with the sound of birdsong and bees.Osowskarsquos ambition is to spark a radical sht ndash you might call it a renaissance ndash in the way we see parks and gardens. Changing our perspective, she hopes, will not only help wildle but signicantly benefit humankind too. She believes the Covid  crisis, for instance, can be directly linked to the shrinking acreage allowed for nature. As she explains: ldquoThe increasing intensity of livestock farming, deforestation, crop monocultures, globalisation and large urban environments all make viral transference more likely and rapid once viruses enter human populations. Give more room to the wild, she suggests, and as balance is restored, the risk of viruses crossing barriers from animal to human, as in the recent case of Danish mink farms, will be reduced.Whatever the science of pandemics, and the validity of Osowskarsquos conclusions, for most of us the idea of letting things run amok at the bottom of the garden already makes sense. We donrsquot need the carrot or stick incentive of warding against another global pandemic to commit to a bit of scrubland. In fact, the wilding memo has been in circulation among gardeners for decades. Many were fighting a rearguard action against climate change and loss of bioersity long before it became fashionable. This silent army, in fleeces and wellington boots, has been largely unsung, but the rewards have been rich. The abundance of flora and fauna that populated their gardens turned them into a communal space in the widest sense.Reshaping our ideas of civic parks might be a bigger challenge. Irsquove always found immaculate flowerbeds and bowling green grass faintly depressing, a pale imitation of the countryside and its teeming fields and woods. A pale imitation, indeed, of my own garden, where unkemptness has been elevated to an art form. Yet for some, the word park is synonymous with symmetry and order, with every begonia in its place, like an immaculate table setting, and the lawns to be admired but not trodden.Even so, Irsquod say Osowska is pressing on an open door. Formality, in almost every sphere of le, is becoming a thing of the past. The days of parkies yelling at those who stepped off the path now seem almost comical. Most of us, I am sure, would prefer a more casual landscape, less geometrical, more random. How much more relaxing to take a stroll in a place where grasses and bushes sway in the wind, shrubberies are tangled and dense, and the sound of birdsong and of children running through the long grass drowns out the strimmer or chainsaw.Itrsquos amazing how swtly new ideas about outdoor space take hold. A century ago, most peoplersquos gardens were more like allotments, primarily for growing fruit and veg, with flowers and shrubs a decorative indulgence. Lawn for leisure or aesthetic pleasure was a luxury. When the mood changed, and gardens became an outdoor room, the lettuce bed and potato drills were banished. Now, as the pendulum swings back to a point somewhere between the two, awareness about giving nature more space is catching on. Butthe prospect of untamed grass and weeds dismays you, there are countless other ways of nurturing nature.When it comes to green spaces, the climate emergency has opened peoplersquos eyes to the importance of creative mess, of not sweeping and tidying every inch asit were our kitchen, but allowing it to breathe. Something as simple as a heap of undisturbed leaves, a bundle of sticks or wall of logs, allows hedgehogs and other mammals to survive the winter. Rotting foliage and flowers run to seed are a breakfast buffet for birds and insects, who in turn are prey for other hungry wildle. In spring and summer, therersquos nothing richer for flying insects than nettles which, being so quick to replenish themselves, are also good for soup. Or so neighbours tell me.But in case you are about to throw away the key to the garden shed, this is not an excuse for letting nature take over. Some husbandry is essential, to ensure plants and trees thrive to the best of their abilities, and are not overpowered by the thugs of the undergrowth.So the lawnmower is by no means the greatest threat to our future. Itrsquos not something I can get rid of, since we donrsquot own one. Butwe did not have the grass trimmed throughout the summer by a roving gardener whose machine is tough enough to cut a path through heather, it would be thigh-high by the start of June. Green-fingered friends who regularly trim their grass use the cuttings for compost, thereby improving the soil. In other words, all grass is good. And no matter how you let yours grow, whether it is buzzcut or left to its own devices, it is infinitely better than covering the ground in concrete or stone. Soon we will look back on gardens turned into car parks with disbelief. How could we suffocate the land like this  In the meantime, long may your weeds and wallflowers grow ."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-foxed-brush-wildlife","story":"THE world has become a playground for the pals of David Attenborough, with wild otters spotted strolling in Edinburgh city centre.

In any event, it is just not true.ldquoAs far back as April, the Bank for International Settlements advised that the risk of transmitting Covid- via banknotes was low when compared with credit card terminals or pin pads. That view is shared by the Bank of England, which found that lsquothe survival of virus on banknotes is no greatermdashindeed appears potentially lessmdashthan on reference surfaces representative of the many surfaces that people may come into contact with in their routine le.rsquoMr Mundell, former Secretary of State for Scotland said there were fewer cash machines in his ldquo square mile constituency ldquothan can be found on or just off Victoria Street, a few moments from here.

Many people have no bank account or credit card.

I can remember my mother having a little pocket for each billmdashthat is the way not to get into an overdraft. It has always been thus for people on lower incomes.ldquoEven with Covid-, people in deprived areas continue to rely on cash more than those in wealthier areas.

She said: “We have created a snapshot to give a clear picture for the industry where we believe pinch points are.” Laura explained: “I decided to pull my peers together, all the other main contractors that are part of the Construction Senior Leaders Group which I chair. We decided to write one set of questions for the end of UK transition and also share the workload – to go to all those dferent product categories key to construction.“As main contractors we deal a lot with sub-contractors so we need to ensure the message gets further into the supply chain.”The Construction Senior Leaders Group also includes representatives from Skanska, Costain, Murphys, Laing O’Rourke, housebuilders Berkeley and clients including Highways UK and Clarion Housing Group.

Those who have worked tirelessly to make it a reality so quickly, including volunteers for the testing programme, deserve our profound gratitude. “However, attentions must now turn to the practicalities of distributing the vaccine to all corners of the country in what will surely be one of the largest public health exercises in history. It is vital that our islands are not left behind and that appropriate steps are taken to guarantee equal access to the vaccine.“The Pfizer vaccine requires freezer storage and that presents practical dficulties in our island and rural communities.  I was therefore pleased that the Health Secretary was able to give me a categoric assurance that freezer storage will indeed be available in the islands and that priority groups in Orkney will form part of the initial roll out.“Further details about how this process will work in practice, including how any subsequent vaccines might be incorporated in the programme, are obviously needed.

Another would involve a change to soft drink sales.She added: “We have a drinks chiller at the front but were looking at introducing a bar restaurant-style system where fizzy drinks come from mixer taps.“If we could get something like that, we would be saving not just on bottles but also the water used for these which is transported around the country and is another waste.“That is quite a big investment, though, so I wouldn’t be able to consider that without a grant.”Zero Waste Scotland has said it will administer a total of £, in grant funding provided by the Scottish Government and European Regional Development Fund to empower island shops to take the next steps in the war on waste by ditching single-use packaging and moving to reusable options.It says that the new scheme would see cash made available to existing small and medium-sized enterprises in the isles to make the transition to package free dispensers.“My shop is so small, it is not just about fitting in the new stuff but also about moving everything  around so I don’t lose the things that I sell which enables me to pay staff and support the local community,” she said.“We have tried to do what we can within our budget. We do glass milk bottles for people, we have dispensing units for refills for washing up liquid and laundry liquid.“There are things that I have looked at that we can do, and sothey had just given us that money I applied for then I would have been really happy!”The scheme opened on th October, but Nancy stressed that wasn’t a great deal of time for small business owners like her.“It sounds like a lot of time but when you are running a shop it isn’t very long. We had to get three dferent quotes for some of these things,” she said.“I’m in the shop five and a half days a week — and my afternoons off have been spent on the phone and the internet scoping out possible projects. I don’t really have the extra time it takes to do it.”She added: “If I can’t come out with a scheme then we don#t get anything is my understanding at the moment.“I know it is worth putting a bit of effort in, though, becauseit does work I can really make a dference to the shop and the environment.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/kate-forbes.jpg","title":"summit on future of gaelic as a community","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe summit on Tuesday st December, pm, will be co-chaired by Kate Forbes, constituency MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch.

Pancakes and tea for pre-school breakfast, check. School run done, check.Arriving home again just as Mrs B leaves for work, two cats and a dog sit patiently at the door awaiting their morning run in the garden. They#re actually in a queue, not a squabble between them.In the peace and quiet of an hour before work, the fresh laundry which has been gathering in baskets in the hall since last weekend is sorted. Once again there are several single socks. They#re added to the growing lonely socks club pile. Two more loads of washing are underway. A little of the old normal penetrates the new. There#s no concrete developments on the who#s visiting who over Christmas saga, but the options might just have been reduced by one to make things easier.Mouse trouble is escalating at my sister-in-law#s house. The queue to visit her is getting short.Three casualties upstairs, two in the kitchen in the past couple of days.She doesn#t help herself by googling the mating habits of mice and finding out that they breed up to ten times a year, and do so all year round. She#s getting a calculator out to work out the mathematics of the situation and how many more traps she needs to buy before she can find a cat and posting the results on the family whatsapp group to a response of several vomiting emojis. We all decide thatwe do have to visit, we#ll be off to the shop for a packet of elastic bands to keep the trouser legs tight.The Galaxy Caramel minis have overtaken the Snickers in popularity as the tub of Celebrations continues to diminish. I#ll have to wait until Christmas before I get my hands on a Malteaser or Twix then.Just when I think the drama of le is something happening where today, a crisis develops with an SOS message from Belfast. We have a mobile phone down. And -year-old lad without a phone is a crisis to behold. A crack in the screen has quickly developed into a full blown disintegration. It#s going to be a ring round all the repair shops I can find to seeany are open.They should be deemed essential shops, Rowan laments. Several phone calls later I find one. He can probably see it from his flat just off the Lisburn Road. The gods can stop their chuckling.Later, the kitten and the dog square off over the last sausage roll. The dog foolishly sets it down to bark in triumph. The kitten snatches it, races around the kitchen and shoots off up the stairs with her prize. I#m reminded of a certain eye-gouging Game of Thrones scene fans may recall. Gloating doesn#t pay, but at least there was no death involved this time. The dog hunts forlornly around the sofa in the hope she hid something there before. Her hidden treasures have long since been removed. All she can do is stand at the bottom of the stairs and bark her disapproval. To think we used to pay for dinner and a show.

Education Minister Peter Weir has nevertheless insisted that schools will remain open as planned until December .Several high-profile principals have, however, urged the DUP man to urgently reconsider his stance and for the Executive to bring the closing date forward to next Friday, December .That call has been supported by SDLP Education spokesperson Daniel McCrossan, while Justin McCamphill from NASUWT, the teachers# union, said that the suggestion has merit.Diane Dawson, Braniel Primary School principal, told the Belfastthat Mr Weir would be like the Grinch who stole Christmas for any teachers or children who were unfortunate enough to contract the virus in the scheduled last week of school.Graham Gault of Maghaberry Primary School, meanwhile, said parents are worried they won#t be able to spend Christmas with their loved onestheir child is forced to self-isolate following a positive diagnosis.On Tuesday Mr Weir, in a statement, said: It is disappointing that despite my clear statement on November  that schools will not close early, there continues to be widespread rumours about this matter. I will once again stress that there are no plans to extend the Christmas holidays for schools.Mr Weir reiterated that message in response to a Belfastquery.But Ms Dawson told this newspaper that she believed schools should close on December .Schools need to close to pupils and staff on December  as any confirmed cases in school after that date could and would result in pupils and staff having to self-isolate over the Christmas holidays - and even on Christmas Day, she said.December  is a day we have longed for to see loved ones and be with family, a day to play with toys Santa has brought and to show them to grandparents, a day we have just longed for even more so than ever in this pandemic.Ms Dawson said teachers aren#t asking for time off and suggested remote learning from December  to .Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePrincipal Diane Dawson FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":truePrincipal Diane Dawson We just want us, and our pupils, to have Christmas, she said.My staff, my pupils and their families need Christmas more this year than they need five school days at the end of term that would be normally filled with Nativity and Key Stage performances, Christmas art, a DVD morning, parties, etc, and that will allow confirmed cases to arise in that time.The primary school principal said Mr Weir#s refusal to close schools early could put teachers and pupils at risk of missing Christmas.Should the Minister#s current stance of no early closure remain and, confirmed cases from December  cause staff and pupils to isolate up to or on Christmas Day, it appears that #The Grinch who stole Christmas# may very well be the Minister this year, Ms Dawson said.And she urged him to reconsider closing early in these unprecedented times so that no one is denied ChristmasLet#s look carefully at when those doors should open and close this year so families can enjoy the festive period, she added.Mr Gault, who is president of the National Association of Head Teachers, said parents were worried about potential disruption to their Christmas plans in the event of children testing positive for Covid in the last week of term.Understandably, the main concern voiced by many of our parents is that they won#t be able to spend Christmas with their loved ones should their child be identied as a close contact, he said.We have been telling them that Minister Weir has claried that schools will not be closing early before Christmas.Mr Gault also called on the Ministers of Health and Education to make a joint statement so that families can have certainty over the holiday season.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePrincipal Graham Gault FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":truePrincipal Graham Gault I have written to the Minister of Health to askhe foresees any risk to the Christmas plans of families andhe can make a joint statement with Minister Weir with regards to this so that families can have certainty in respect of expectations over the holiday season, he said.Mr Gault also praised school children for having been amazing throughout this pandemic and have made their principals so proud.In response to the Belfast , a Department of Education spokesperson said schools should not change or extend their Christmas holidays or close early this term.Children should continue to attend school until the last day of term unless they have been told to self-isolate.

Two weeks ago I raised the issue of Ian McCrea#s non-attendance at meetings of the Loughs Agency since October , something which I established from the minutes of the board, during questions on a ministerial statement by Edwin Poots, Mr Allister said.The Agriculture Minister dodged the matter but I followed up with a number of written questions.By doing so I established that in spite of not attending a single meeting, Mr McCrea has been paid a total of £,. over the past two years for his membership of the agency.Furthermore, while there is no obligation on members to attend meetings, the North-South Ministerial Council can dismiss members.In light of the fact that Mr McCrea has not attended a single meeting in two years, I think it is reasonable not only to ask why he has not been dismissed from the board, but also to enquire as to whether the money which has been paid to him over the past two years will be recovered to the public purse.I have tabled questions to Minister Poots on both these points and await his response with interest.Mr Allister said the situation was extraordinary and added: It is indefensible to be paid over £, of public money for a role which he seems to have devoted littleany time.Agriculture Minister Mr Poots did say that the North-South Ministerial Council had the power to dismiss a personhe or she fails without reasonable excuse to discharge his or her s for a continuous period of three months.Mr Allister said that he has now asked Mr Pootshe will ask that body - made up of Stormont and Oireachtas ministers - to dismiss Mr McCrea from the board.Of the  current board members,  have attended at least six of the  board meetings held over the past two years.All, apart from the vice-chairman, who receives a higher sum, have been paid the same amount.There is currently no board chairman, the position having been vacant for over two-and-a-half years.The agency has also been operating without a chief executive for over three-and-a-half years.The Loughs Agency was set up as one of the cross-border bodies under the  Good Friday Agreement.It is responsible for the conservation, management, promotion and development of the fisheries and marine resources of the Foyle and Carlingford areas.The Belfasthas attempted to contact Mr McCrea for a response.Belfast Most ReadBangor#s green post box mystery solved as Royal Mail explains colour changeCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Most lockdown restrictions to be lted next weekNorthern Ireland#s Hollywood Hills: Millionaire pumps entire fortune into row of dream homes near Bangor£k payout for ex-Queen#s student in discrimination caseWhere will Northern Ireland be six months from today  Three experts make their predictionsLatest NewsConfusion over Covid closure rules after PSNI order garages and car washes to closeUlster University worker recognised for helping put out fire#Absentee# DUP man#s Loughs Agency pay queriedPensioner to contest ferry chargeChristian perspective of legacy issues is examined,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

While restaurants will reopen, she said social distancing of two metres will be in place along with an pm curfew as nothing is done without risk.Giving an example of how the family gathering rules would work, she explained that she was currently in a support bubble with her mother.This means they will be allowed to come together with two other households at Christmas.Asked about the latest disappointment for wet pub owners, Mrs Foster said the decision had been based on evidence, but that details of a new support scheme worth £.m would be announced next week.It#s very important that we support those people who we have had to close because of the medical advice but I think overall most people will welcome the fact that non essential retail will be open again, that our churches will be open again.Reacting to the news, Horatio Group boss Stephen Magorrian said he was disappointed for #wet# pub owners but welcomed news of financial support.It needs to be adequate because those guys haven#t been open all year and they#ve invested a lot to be open, and it needs to be timely because they are desperate and they need support now, he said.Mr Magorrian said more clarity was needed on the need for two metres social distancing inside hospitality venues.I#m disappointed with the curfew... because we have a real fear that people will leave and go to house parties.He said financial support for the hospitality sector so far had not been adequate. While grants were announced at the start of the recent lockdown, he said businesses lost money through the new furlough scheme.So for us for example with  employees, it#s costing us £, a week to keep them on furlough so I#ll be glad to get them back next week and try get some funds in, he said.Belfast Most ReadBangor#s green post box mystery solved as Royal Mail explains colour changeCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Most lockdown restrictions to be lted next weekNorthern Ireland#s Hollywood Hills: Millionaire pumps entire fortune into row of dream homes near Bangor£k payout for ex-Queen#s student in discrimination caseWhere will Northern Ireland be six months from today  Three experts make their predictionsLatest NewsParts of Britain wake up to snowy scenesConfusion over Covid closure rules after PSNI order garages and car washes to closeUlster University worker recognised for helping put out fire#Absentee# DUP man#s Loughs Agency pay queriedPensioner to contest ferry charge,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

IRA and he used his position as a lawyer to act as a contact between suspects in custody and republicans on the outside.“Let’s remember also his brother broke out of the Maze and there is somebody on this board and in this roomwho also was involved in that activity.“And our thoughts are with the James Ferrisfamily, who lost his le as a result of being stabbed and subsequently had a heart

brought upon others.”Mr Kelly branded Mr Storey’s comments an “absolute disgrace”.“He should apologise to the family.“He has often talked about victims here.“And yet he has no such sensitivities when it comes to the Finucane family and he is adding to their distress by saying what he said and he is only saying it because a person who has passed away cannot be defamed in law or libelled.“I am astounded that he would say that.”Mrs Kelly urged Mr Storey to “reflect” on his remarks.The SDLP representative was also highly critical of Mr Lewis’s handling of the Finucane case.“I really do object to Mervyn’s comments,” she said.“We want to see all victims to get to the truth and justice that they campaign for and that which they deserve.“And we regret the fact, very much so, that the police have been brought in once again by the Secretary of State into the Finucane inquiry and the failure of the British government to uphold its international agreements and obligations, as the Supreme

This oversight was rightly corrected, but we now find ourselves back in the same situation.And they said that their link lecturers from Queen#s don#t attend placements because it is deemed too unsafe.In response, the Department of Health said: A joint statement from the Nursing and Midwery Counciland the Chief Nursing Officers across the UK on November ,  explains that students, at this time, will not be put into paid placements, as happened earlier during the pandemic.Rather, employing trusts will protect their status as supernumerary students and continue to support them through high quality placements, which is a fundamental aspect of pre-registration nurse training. During the period of the pandemic, in addition to tuition fee  bursary support, they are entitled to travel free on public transport and free car parking at HSC sites.Belfast Most ReadBangor#s green post box mystery solved as Royal Mail explains colour changeCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Most lockdown restrictions to be lted next weekNorthern Ireland#s Hollywood Hills: Millionaire pumps entire fortune into row of dream homes near Bangor£k payout for ex-Queen#s student in discrimination caseWhere will Northern Ireland be six months from today  Three experts make their predictionsLatest NewsConfusion over Covid closure rules after PSNI order garages and car washes to closeUlster University worker recognised for helping put out fire#Absentee# DUP man#s Loughs Agency pay queriedPensioner to contest ferry chargeChristian perspective of legacy issues is examined,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The man bringing the stout-fed trees to your door is Aaron Cleary, who runs FirTreeNI in Belfast.I#d normally have spent the year managing an events company, but all that has been very thin on the ground because of Covid, he said. The events industry and festivals have been gutted.But when I was askedI#d be interested in getting involved in tree deliveries, it was an easy choice. You need something to keep you going.The trees are grown on a farm in Co Wicklow, and when you see them there#s no comparison. You know they#ve been fed on good stuff.He added: There must be something magical in the Guinness - but the only swaying they do is in the breeze before they#re delivered.You always hear old tales of pregnant women being fed Guinness in hospitals to help them stay strong and healthy. There must be a bit of truth in it. And who doesn#t like a good feed of Guinness at Christmas It produces a beautul tree, though - sturdy, lush and green.I don#t think there#s any others out there to match them.And in further proof that the cream really does rise to the top, they have been named as the #Best Trees in Ireland# by The Irish Christmas Trees Growers Association. Aaron added: They#ve been delivered around the Republic of Ireland for the last eight years or so.I#d been asked a couple of times beforeI#d be interested in handling them in Northern Ireland, but usually by the end of November the year has been so busy that I just need a rest. This year has been a little dferent, though.His Guinness-fed trees have already found homes at some local hotels, including The Culloden in Holywood and The Harrison in Belfast.They#re proving really popular, and they#re in the right placethey need a top-up, added Aaron.They#ve also won fans in Northern Ireland football legend Gerry Armstrong and we Debby after they turned up at Rockport School in Cultra to play Santa and Mrs Claus for the kids.Aaron#s Covid-secure delivery and installation team have been putting the trees in place and making sure they don#t #tip-sy# over. When the festive season ends they#ll make sure you don#t end up with a post-Christmas hangover by collecting your tree for recycling.And with Covid closing pubs across Ireland, the trees have been drinking in an extra helping of the famous beer.Since the start of lockdown the Guinness Brewery at St James#s Gate in Dublin has been taking back unsold barrels and redistributing the contents to Christmas tree plantations.Aidan Crowe, the brewery#s director of operations, estimated that hundreds of thousands of kegs had been ed, with the black stuff finding a new role in the soil.Basically, what we#ve been doing is taking all the keg beer back and we decant it and we disperse the product through a number of environmentally sustainable routes, he said.The vast majority of the beer goes to willow and Christmas tree plantations, it#s used as nutrients in those farms.We#ve also erted some product through to anaerobic digesters, where it produces a bio-gas. Actually, we#re quite optimistic that, in the long-term, that bio-gas can be a suitable fuel source for us to use here in the brewery.Anyone who does go down the Guinness-fed, environmentally friendly tree route will also be helping a homeless charity, as the business has paired up with Extern Ireland to support its important work in local communities.Grace O#Neill of Extern said: In the last year Extern has supported over , people in Northern Ireland who have been living with or facing homelessness, and provided over , bed nights for people in our temporary and emergency accommodation. Since the first lockdown in March our staff has continued to work tirelessly to ensure that our doors are never closed. Sadly, we are also seeing on the ground that many people are facing rising poverty and homelessness as a result of the impact of the current pandemic. We are immensely grateful to FirTreeNI for their support, because this year, as well as delivering beautul, sustainable Christmas trees across Northern Ireland, they will also be helping Extern to deliver hope.Visit firtreeni for further details  Belfast   Related ContentNorthern Ireland PremiumTyrone farmer Finnegan is making the cut with his Christmas tree businessDeep in the heart of Tyrone, you should know, there#s a magical place where the Christmas trees grow.

The first vaccinations had been scheduled from December  but Health Minister Robin Swann said this could ‘come forward by a few days’. The approval for the Pfizer BioNTech coronavirus vaccine was issued by the Medicines  Healthcare products Regulatory Agency . A number of other vaccines are at ious stages of development while another is currently being considered by MHRA. It is planned to roll-out vaccination from this month, with the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationdetermining which population groups will receive the vaccine first. googletag.cmd.push Completion of roll-out will take up much of . Health and social care workers – including care home staff - will be amongst the first priority groups as will care home residents. Further groups will then be added to the programme throughout  based on age and clinical vulnerability factors. Forty-one new Covid- cases in Derry City and Strabane yesterday bringing the total to ,. Only Belfast has had more cases with ,. The seven day rate of infection per k of population in the council area, ., is twice that of Belfast at .. Four more deaths were reported across NI yesterday. googletag.cmd.push The local death toll now stands at . Altnagelvin Hospital has  Covid inpatients, three of whom are in the Intensive Care Unit . Responding to news that the UK has approved the use of the Pfizer BioNTechcoronavirus vaccine, Dr Tom Black, BMA Northern Ireland council chair, said: “This is most welcome and marks an incredible achievement of modern science, given less than a year ago we hadn’t even heard of Covid-, never mind a vaccination against it. “It offers hope that we will finally start to bring the pandemic to an end, but we have never tried to deliver a vaccination programme of this size, and at this speed,and there are many practical hurdles to consider and overcome.     “It’s hugely important that frontline healthcare and social care workers – at the forefront of fighting this terrible virus - are given every opportunity to get the vaccine as quickly as possible, with those at most risk getting it first. “There is no doubt that rolling this vaccine out will be a challenge for our already stretched health service but just as everyone has worked above and beyond for the last few months I am sure that staff will now put as much effort into the vaccination programme rolling out in Northern Ireland. “We will need as much support and unity of purpose as we can muster to ensure that it is a success.” Dr Alan Stout, BMA-NI GP committee chair, added: “Today is a signicant step towards overcoming Covid- and GPs share in the optimism of the rest of the nation as a future beyond the pandemic comes more clearly into sight. “Already practices across Northern Ireland have begun preparation to make sure they can deliver the vaccination to the wider public as soon as it is feasible to do so. “We are working with the Department of Health to make sure that we have clear guidance form them as to how we can best deliver a successful programme across Northern Ireland.” He continued: “We would urge the public to be patient, this will not be delivered overnight and in the meantime we would urge everyone to continue to be vigilant in terms of social distancing, washing hands and wearing a face covering. “This news is not a signal that Covid is over, it is just the beginning of the next stage in our fight against it.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Annemarie Bell’s father, Hugh, died suddenly while showing a worker from The Resource Centre his famous Christmas garden on December , . He was  years of age at the time and had experienced a tough year with infections but remained fit. Hugh loved to decorate the family home at Moyola Walk in Shantallow at Christmas time where there was a ‘real sense of community’. He became known for his impressive festive displays and was hailed as the ‘King of Christmas’. googletag.cmd.push  Just prior to his death, Hugh taught daughter Annemarie how to wire the plugs but, she says, ‘little did I know, I would have to do it again so quickly’. He was well-known in the local community for his walks to Knock and charitable work with the Foyle Hospice, and also helped to organise the first Derry marathons. Annemarie said: “My daddy has been the king of Christmas from I can remember. “When we were young my mother and father smoked and they wrapped fag packets up with wrapping paper and hung them up on the tree. “That’s the tradition that I grew up with and shoe boxes at the bottom of the tree for fake presents. googletag.cmd.push “Our crib was always the centre piece of our home and the main focus of our celebrations.” When the family moved to Mount Vernon in Culmore, Hugh became even more invested in the Christmas season, lighting up hedges and setting up inflatable reindeers in the garden. “I’ve just followed suit now and added new features the past two years,” Annemarie explained. As a youth worker in Pennyburn she erected the Christmas tree as soon as Halloween ended. The spiritual side of Christmas is of most import to the family and as such they would have attended a Christmas nativity event at Thornhill.     The year Hugh died they had around  nativities but Annemarie continued gathering and now has  around the house. A nativity picture is the oldest item in the family’s collection. Sadly, some decorations have been consigned to the past, Annemarie explained: “We had this big inflatable snowman and it was really, really strange. “A big fat giant snowman, we must’ve had it for at least  years and my daddy died on the th and that just went kaput on the st. So, it was strange, it was probably one of his first.” This year, Annemarie says, many people have experienced hardship in the city with a further announcement this week of job cuts. She believes it is important for everyone to get back to basics and think about family and the true meaning of Christmas.  With the pandemic it felt strange for children to be locked indoors all day long. Annemarie reflected: “I think this Christmas is going to be more special for people, we’re more used to living with one another during the pandemic, and young people won’t be looking to run here, there and everywhere. “I’d imagine this year will be more traditional, that family board games will come back. “And people won’t want their children going to other houses. “When you look at the row of houses lit up in Shantallow right now, that is community. “I was driving around after work last night and you see houses lit up that weren’t before and you think to yourself, isn’t that so beautul, so much hope and joy in the community. “For me, that’s why my daddy wanted to do it, to spread some joy.” She added: “The wains are at school at the minute but the binmen were shouting to me, ‘your garden is class, I’m so glad you followed on in your daddy’s footsteps!’ “Those kind of comments from someone out doing his job, that’s what it’s all about.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Annemarie Bell’s father, Hugh, died suddenly while showing a worker from The Resource Centre his famous Christmas garden on December , . He was  years of age at the time and had experienced a tough year with infections but remained fit. Hugh loved to decorate the family home at Moyola Walk in Shantallow at Christmas time where there was a ‘real sense of community’. He became known for his impressive festive displays and was hailed as the ‘King of Christmas’. googletag.cmd.push  Just prior to his death, Hugh taught daughter Annemarie how to wire the plugs but, she says, ‘little did I know, I would have to do it again so quickly’. He was well-known in the local community for his walks to Knock and charitable work with the Foyle Hospice, and also helped to organise the first Derry marathons. Annemarie said: “My daddy has been the king of Christmas from I can remember. “When we were young my mother and father smoked and they wrapped fag packets up with wrapping paper and hung them up on the tree. “That’s the tradition that I grew up with and shoe boxes at the bottom of the tree for fake presents. googletag.cmd.push “Our crib was always the centre piece of our home and the main focus of our celebrations.” When the family moved to Mount Vernon in Culmore, Hugh became even more invested in the Christmas season, lighting up hedges and setting up inflatable reindeers in the garden. “I’ve just followed suit now and added new features the past two years,” Annemarie explained. As a youth worker in Pennyburn she erected the Christmas tree as soon as Halloween ended. The spiritual side of Christmas is of most import to the family and as such they would have attended a Christmas nativity event at Thornhill.     The year Hugh died they had around  nativities but Annemarie continued gathering and now has  around the house. A nativity picture is the oldest item in the family’s collection. Sadly, some decorations have been consigned to the past, Annemarie explained: “We had this big inflatable snowman and it was really, really strange. “A big fat giant snowman, we must’ve had it for at least  years and my daddy died on the th and that just went kaput on the st. So, it was strange, it was probably one of his first.” This year, Annemarie says, many people have experienced hardship in the city with a further announcement this week of job cuts. She believes it is important for everyone to get back to basics and think about family and the true meaning of Christmas.  With the pandemic it felt strange for children to be locked indoors all day long. Annemarie reflected: “I think this Christmas is going to be more special for people, we’re more used to living with one another during the pandemic, and young people won’t be looking to run here, there and everywhere. “I’d imagine this year will be more traditional, that family board games will come back. “And people won’t want their children going to other houses. “When you look at the row of houses lit up in Shantallow right now, that is community. “I was driving around after work last night and you see houses lit up that weren’t before and you think to yourself, isn’t that so beautul, so much hope and joy in the community. “For me, that’s why my daddy wanted to do it, to spread some joy.” She added: “The wains are at school at the minute but the binmen were shouting to me, ‘your garden is class, I’m so glad you followed on in your daddy’s footsteps!’ “Those kind of comments from someone out doing his job, that’s what it’s all about.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dr Anne Kilgallen, Chief Executive, said the Trust is preparing to roll out the COVID- Vaccination Programme – Phase , which is for Health and Social Carestaff. The plan at the moment is to begin on December . The programme is for HSC employees, plus workers in the Independent Sector, Domiciliary Care, Nursing Home Staff, Care Home Staff, Community Pharmacists, Opticians, Dentists, Hospice, GPs and staff. Dr Kilgallen said: “We will be using Pfizer ‘Courageous’ vaccine which requires two doses to be administered. googletag.cmd.push “We will operate from  venues: Foyle Arena and the Leisure Centres at Omagh and Enniskillen, but not every venue will operate every day. “Our plan is to deliver the vaccination programme using  vaccination teams, operating  days per week, excluding Christmas and New Year and to have both doses administered by the end of January .” ‘HUGELY SIGNIFICANT’ Seeking to assure the public about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride and Chief Scientic Advisor Professor Ian Young released a joint statement today. They said vaccines have changed our world andexplained that they have been successfully deployed against a wide range of diseases including smallpox, polio, measles and flu. googletag.cmd.push Dr McBride and Prof Young commented: “They have saved many millions of lives. “So the confirmation of the UK’s first regulatory approval for a Covid- vaccine is hugely signicant. “The decision by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agencyhas only been taken after rigorous assessment of both safety and effectiveness. “The decision on the Pfizer BioNTech coronavirus vaccine was made with advice from the Commission on Human Medicines , the government’s independent expert scientic advisory body. “As the MHRA has emphasised strongly, public safety has always been the overriding priority. “It is important to stress that the MHRA is globally recognised for requiring high standards of safety, quality and effectiveness for any vaccine.”     They added: “The pace at which Covid- vaccines have been developed is unprecedented. That’s a reflection of the global emergency which the virus caused – and the scale of the response from scientists, supported by massive public and private investment. “We were already living in an age of unparalleled and rapid technological advancement. The scientic community has just raised the bar even further. “An unprecedented vaccination programme can now begin, involving a massive logistical exercise that will span many months.” LARGE CENTRES Strict conditions on vaccine deployment will be set by the MHRA, while the JCVIwill guide on which population groups should receive the vaccine first. The roll-out will take up a large part of . The JCVI recognises there will have to be some flexibility in terms of operational constraints, due to the characteristics of inidual vaccines. The Pfizer BioNTech vaccine poses particular logistical challenges and is likely to be best suited to large scale vaccination centres, the medical chiefs said. Forthcoming alternative vaccines should be more suitable for mobile unit deployment to inidual care homes. They continued: “Our advice to the public is to look to the future with a mixture of optimism, determination and patience. “The vaccine programme will take time and we will all have to wait our turn, as priority groups are given their place. “As we do so, we must all redouble our efforts against the spread of the virus. Please keep following public health advice – this is just as essential now as it was when we first heard the word Coronavirus. “ has been an incredibly dficult year and the first half of  will require more sacrice and more disruption to our daily lives. “We can get through thiswe all keep doing the right thing – to look after each other and protect the health service. “Better times are ahead – let’s get there together.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Essentially, the reason for this dichotomy boils down to nationalists wanting a United Ireland and unionists wanting to stay within the United Kingdom. Back in , Northern Ireland’s population split was roughly % Catholic and % Protestant. Nearly a century later official statistics show a very dferent demographic. Catholic pupils, from nursery school through to sixth form, for example, now amount to % of all pupils enrolled in Northern Ireland schools and colleges. This changing picture could be perceived to blow wind into the sails of those advocating Irish unity. googletag.cmd.push However, before anyone loses the run of themselves, a component woven into the  Good Friday Agreement described as an un-intended outcome cannot be dismissed. A new identity called ‘Northern Irish’ emerged from the Good Friday Agreement, which for the first time in the history of these islands permits people born in Northern Ireland to choosethey want to be British, Irish or both. Something  that can’t be dismissed is the changing attitudes amongst those born into emerging peace. The young appear to be rejecting rigid national and religious identities. It would, therefore, appear the old assumption that all Catholics support re-unication and all Protestants support the Union no longer holds water. googletag.cmd.push This evolving mind-set is borne out by a recent LUCID TALK poll, which found % of Sinn Fein voters and % of SDLP voters would vote for a united Ireland while % of DUP and % of Ulster Unionist voters would vote to remain in the UK. Analysis of these October  statistics entitle the pollsters to comment: ‘neither those advocating Irish Unity or those advocating the status quo had anything close to a majority.’ While accepting opinion polls are never an exact science and, on occasions, can be all over the place they still serve, to some degree, as a barometer for public mood.     Moreover, by observing prevailing demographic trends in tandem with the results of ious polls, it must to be reasonable to assert a united Ireland in the near future is anything but a done deal. But, despite having access to all the pollsters predictions and awareness of a very dferent population structure, one side looks asit’s in a hurry to alter the constitutional landscape of Northern Ireland while the other side seems content to bury its head in the sand. Nationalists want to talk about little  while unionists prefer not even to mention the elephant in the room. Neither position, to be fair, is either acceptable or desirable and could, in the end, serve to weaken the ability of a devolved administration in Northern Ireland to mature. More now than ever, both traditions should be working as partners to make Northern Ireland the kind of place that makes le on earth worth living the kind of place that enables people to grow in hope and build a better future, regardless of their creed or culture. The hard-won peace, in place since , represents a sweeter music that is superior to the discords of ision. That being so, nothing should be hastily brought forward that risks putting our widely celebrated peace process in jeopardy. Change is often a slow fuse. So why rush  The quick fix, the short-cut, the on-the-spot-solution could, in the long run, turn out to be detrimental. Choosing to take the time to appeal to the nature of our better angels would, according to Charles Dickens, point out how the shadow of our own desires can eclipse the brightness of our better angels and this could adversely affect future outcomes. Beyond all reasonable doubt, there is a need for both the Orange and the Green to go beyond what comes easily and to live in a way that’s more enlightened. Dr King, in his letter from Birmingham jail, reminds us how we don’t walk the journey of le alone. None of us is an island we are all part of something bigger, which means there should, at all times, be a unity of purpose and a willingness to work for the greater good of all without fear or favour. French philosopher Albert Camus got it so right when he said: ‘Don’t walk in front of me I may not follow. Don’t walk behind me I may not lead. Just walk beside me and be my friend.’ This ought to be the aspiration of every Member of the Legislative Assemblyat Stormont. Showing to themselves, the electorate and the world their determination to progressively build bridges of co-operation and friendship across frontiers of memory, grief and pain. At some point in the future, when it becomes clear that a mandatory coalition of erse political figures are selflessly committed to making government ‘work’ for everybody in the Six Counties, regardless of where they live, how they pray or who they love. Then, and only then, should consideration be given to cautiously stepping out onto a road less travelled to begin exploring potential models and possible permutations for north, south, east and west relationships.    --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Education Minister Peter Weir tweeted a picture of the paintings after he visited the school last week, and the portraits quickly went viral, appearing on BBCs The View programme. Titillated Executive ministers praised the childrens artwork on social media, with Justice Minister Naomi Long adopting the painting as her Twitter profile picture. The Alliance MLA felt the work captured her essence perfectly. “I love my wonky eyebrow! It looks like Im a bit cross about something which I usually am! Fantastic work and say thanks to all the young artists!” she said. googletag.cmd.push Finance Minister, Sinn Feacuteins Conor Murphy, took time to write to the pupils and express his gratitute, saying the painting was an improvement on the real thing. Mr Murphy also told the children that one of their local heroes had held pride of place in Stormont for years. “The late Martin McGuinness, who was Deputy First Minister, had in his office a large photograph behind his desk in Stormont Castle of someone who attended your school,” he wrote. “It was of the  All-Ireland winning captain, Henry Downey. In an office which had photographs of world leaders including Nelson Mandela, the photo of Henry Downey of Lavey had pride of place.” googletag.cmd.push After the paintings were beamed around the airwaves, requests began to make their way to South Derry and the children have been busy. The Blame Games Tim McGarry, Jake OKane and Colin Murphy got the full treatment from the Mayogall Monets, along with local councillor Sean McPeake, who helped arrange the visit. Principal Mary OKane said the paintings, and associated publicity, had created a great feeling of positivity around the school. “Its created a great buzz, which is very important at this time,” she said. “Following lockdown and the long period of absence from school, its important that children get a wee boost now.     “Its important for the whole school, but particularly those children who are getting a real buzz out of it at the moment. They see themselves as being pretty famous artists.”  Another famous local artist, Kilreas Conor Larkin, agreed to give the childrens paintings a professional artists scrutiny for us this week – and he was very impressed!  Aoe and Charley Arlene Foster: The artist has captured Arlenes ‘lockdown cofure’ – a large, thick plumage of black hair. Arlene is looking away from the viewer, maybe deep in thought or dreaming of an easier time. They have captured a fantastically sombre and meditative state that many artists strive for!  Lisa and Maria Michelle O’Neill: The subject has been caught in a moment of contemplation or reflection. She appears to be gazing just below the viewer’s eye-line. Thinking hard and remaining very tight-lipped, giving no clue to her inner-thoughts. Her hands are clasped, asplaying her cards close to her chest.  Isabelle, Christopher and Charlie Naomi Long: The artist has gone for a bold palette of contrasting colours. The subject is looking a little bewildered or deflated. She appears to have one hand behind her back, asnot wanting to show the viewer her crossed fingers. Or have we purposely been left wonderingNaomi’s hands are tied   Ella, Shannon and Dara Nichola Mallon: The subject appears very happy or comfortable in her own skin. She stands up straight with her hands by her side, portraying a certain pride. This could be the Mona Lisa of political portraits, with her confident gaze following the viewer around the room.  Serena and Chloe Caraacutel Niacute Chuiliacuten: Simple and effective brush strokes have been used to capture the subject’s vibrant hair and expressionless face. The subject stares directly from the canvas, almost straight through the viewer. The artist has done well to capture this moment of determination.  Anna, Riacutean and Molly Conor Murphy: The artist has captured this subject well, leaving the viewer wondering ‘what has he just been asked ’. His bottom lip juts out in a moment of deep concentration, staring past the viewer in search of an answer, as the viewer begs to know what exactly the question is.   Emily Rose and Isla Diane Dodds: A subtle palette of greys has been used to portray the subject’s face, perhaps an indication as to how she is feeling. The subject appears to be smiling, but also looks panicked as she scans her surroundings.  Charley, Don and Seamus Oacuteg Peter Weir: This subject is portrayed as being happy and almost laughing, leaving the viewer asking ‘what is so funny ’. But, looking behind the glasses and gazing further into his eyes, the viewer soon realises there is no joke here.  Amber and Riacuteonach Robin Swann: The artist has really taken the time to depict someone under extreme pressure. His fists are clenched tight, his mouth opened wide asshouting for someone to listen. But, his eyes look sad and his cheeks tear-stained. His gaze is directed straight at you, asto say ‘I have more bad news.  Johnny, Callum, Cathal and Conan Edwin Poots: This painting shows someone who appears to be very happy with themselves, but look deeper into the subjects eyes and you can see that one eye is looking hard at the viewer for approval and the other is looking back at himself in some doubt.  Sean, Conor and Donnacha Sean McPeake :The Artist has captured the subject wide eyed, maybe in disbelief. The pale hue used for his lips, blend into his skin tone – perhaps the artist is sending the subliminal message that the subject is lost for words. The silvery grey hair gives the subject a ‘worldly wise’ appeal.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In my view, the little magician was the greatest footballer the world has ever had the pleasure of watching. Its as simple as that. But, he was more than a footballer. He was an icon and it was fitting when the worlds greatest ever team, the New Zealand All-Blacks, recognised that. They carried out a black number ten jersey with his name emblazoned on it before last weekends meeting of the nations. Its just a pity Peter Shilton, a world-class goalkeeper in his own right, didnt have the same class. Yes, Maradona cheated with his hand of God goal against the England stopper. Some might say honesty is the best policy, but there is a time and a place to twist the dagger. And last week wasnt that time. googletag.cmd.push He may have had his problems off the pitch, but sporting stars should always be judged for what they do in the colosseums in which they perform. Maradona wasnt born with a silver spoon in his mouth. Of the nine mouths that needed fed in their home in the Villa Fiorito area of Buenos Aires, his father was the only earner, allowing his family to focus on study. It was Diegos ability to control the ball like it was an extension of his body that alerted the scouts of the local Argentinos Juniors. And so the roller-coaster was taking off. He bagged goal after goal and soon he was in the blue and gold of Boca Juniors. In their La Bombonera stadium, which shook with sheer atmosphere on game day, he led them to the Primera Divisioacuten. But, after just  games he was off to Europe as Barcelona came calling. googletag.cmd.push The fact that he moved to one of the Catalan giants, who were Mes Que Un Clubwas one thing. What defined him for me, was how he carried the national team. That wonder goal against England in  was a letime in the making. If you watch footage from his time at Napoli, that was the perfect grounding. Diego dragged an unfancied horse to two league titles, Italian and UEFA Cups, he was kicked black and blue. As he was in that  clash with England. Like the streets of Buenos Aires, Naples was the school of hard knocks. He literally had to dance his way around potential leg-breaking tackles and making a mockery of England was a by-product of it all.     Maradona is just one of those players that youd love to watch in the flesh. The viral video on social media of him juggling the ball is part of his legacy. He was just at one with the ball...oozing class. I remember trying to watch the  World Cup Final from a distance in the Bushtown Hotel. On the way home from the Port, we called in for grub. I pleaded to get away from the table. By that stage, the Germans had levelled the game at -. Maradona huffed and puffed all during the game, but he made the crucial play. His through ball played in Jorge Luis Burruchagafor the winner. Its that type of instinct that separates the good from the great. And the thing about it, much of that craft is self-taught away from the training field. I was chatting to Dermot Heaney during the week, for a feature in next weeks paper. His ball-winning ability was honed from endless hours kicking the ball against a gable wall. Unbelievable – like legend - is an overused word. It should only be used for occasions like last Sunday to describe Joe Cannings four sideline cuts over the bar. For all the great coaching hed had access to, Id say it was perfected on the family farm or at Portumna pitch. Eoin Bradleys goal in Derrys  qualier clash with Down. Owen Mulligans wonder goal against the Dubs the same year. All moments of magic. I remember chatting to a defender who had played against Glenullin one evening. How was he supposed to know what Skinner was going to do next, when the man didnt know himself. Thats the x-factor that makes all the dference. It was encouraging chatting to Damian Cassidy this week about the new proposals for Derrys coaching plan. In particular, it was the committees research around Go Games and making them five-a-side for the very young. Why  To promote decision-making and flair. Alleluia. This is what we have been missing. Back to the days of jumpers for goalposts and playing in the back field until either it got dark, or somebody huffed and went home with the ball. Once you realised that the big boys were going to kick you instead of the ball, it was time to figure out a wat to play around them. The great players learn on the job, away from regimented systems where they are forced to play with one hand tied behind your back. Thank God for Maradona. For those too young to remember him, the constant barrage of footage should inspire the next genius.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Former Glee star Damian McGinty is currently singing with globally successful group Celtic Thunder and lives in America with his we. And although he hasnt been back to Derry in a year due to the ongoing global pandemic, the city remains close to his heart and he is donating all the money from the sales of his popular calendar to St Vincent de Paul . The charity helps distressed people by visiting them in their homes and giving them money, clothing, food, fuel, furniture or electrical items. googletag.cmd.push Damian explained: Something that has been really on my mind recently, is families putting food on the table over Christmas. Covid has hurt millions, whether it be in terms of health, or financially. I think a really serious issue moving forward is going to be hunger, and it absolutely breaks my heart to think of parents lying awake at night worrying about feeding their kids the next day. It breaks my heart to think of kids going hungry, and Santa being something that is simply not on the cards. It’s not fair. As well as selling the calendar Damian asked his fans to donate what they could afford and has raised just under pound,. googletag.cmd.push This will go a long, long way, said Damian. We can make a families Christmas a little bit better, and that’s a light the world needs right now. I wanted to try and use my  to make a dference as it’s been a tough year for so many and my followers helped me do that and I want to say thanks, so, so much. Last week, Damian joined Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Cllr Brian Tierney, for hislatest of his Covid- video appeal. Ive been really concerned to see the number of Covid cases across Derry and Strabane in the last few months – its really worrying, and the threat hasnt gone away, he commented.     I havent been home since Christmas and for me thats been quite dficult because I have never gone that long without visiting home in my le, and I miss it a lot. I know the community back home is full of amazing people that care about each other so Im appealing to everyone to do what they can to get us back to where we were and where we will be again. Mayor Tierney said that Damian is one of many people making sacrices for the greater good. I was delighted thatDamianjoined me in this message and has shared his personal experience to show why its important that we all follow the guidelines in place. Hehasnt been able to come home and visit his family since last Christmas, which, naturally, is incredibly dficult. Its just one example of many people and businesses who are making sacrices to protect our community and keep everyone safe, so alongsideDamianI am asking that everyone makes those sacrices worthwhile by doing all they can to reduce our cases numbers and stop the spread of Covid-.

The pensioner fell in the Greenwalk area of Creggan on Friday evening. Local people and family members who came to her aid did not want to move her, so they tried to keep her warm and dry after calling for an ambulance. However, local independent councillor Gary Donnelly said it took two hours for ambulance to arrive. Cllr Donnelly described the scene as shocking. He added that residents in Greenwalk have been trying to get improved street lighting for years but without success. googletag.cmd.push The family of the local woman said she suffered a broken shoulder in the fall. After being contacted by the Derry News, a NIAS spokesperson apologised for how Fridays call-out had been handled. “We apologise for any distress or discomfort suffered as a result of her prolonged wait for an ambulance,” the spokesperson said. “NIAS seeks to provide the quickest possible response to meet the clinical needs of any patient who contacts us as a result of having suffered illness or injury. “However, regrettably some patients are currently waiting longer than we would wish due to the demand for our service and the impact of the Covid- pandemic on our staffing levels.” googletag.cmd.push The NIAS spokesperson said the call in relation to the Creggan incident was received at .pm on Friday. “Based on information passed to ambulance control, it was prioritised as a Category  call with a performance target of  minutes. “A crew did not arrive at this scene until : which was  minutes outside of the target response. “NIAS recognises the distress and discomfort a wait of over two hours for an ambulance is to an elderly patient who is lying in the cold and wet, or to those who are caring for her at that time. “The delay in this case was as a result of crews in the area responding to calls which were more pressing in terms of clinical need.     “NIAS regrets that the patient had to endure this delay and once again offers a sincere apology. “We would have liked to have provided a more immediate response, particular given the age of the patient and the conditions in which she had to wait.” The NIAS spokesperson said they receive more than  calls each day through the  system. “To enable us to target our resources to those whose clinical condition is most urgent, each call is triaged and categorised accordingly. “Against each of the categories is a performance target for response times which NIAS aims to deliver. “Category  calls are those calls which are immediately or potentially le-threatening and to which NIAS seeks to despatch an immediate response with an average performance target of  minutes.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Breandaacuten McNally, from Greenlough, died last week and many tributes have been paid to him since. Fr Seamus OConnell told mourners at St Oliver Plunketts Church that the -year-old was a proud Greenlough man. “Brendy was quiet, good mannered, good looking and liked fun,” he said. “Brendy was born in Greenlough, baptised in Greenlough, went to school in Greenlough and played football with Greenlough boys. “Were celebrating the funeral mass of a Greenlough man, where he was well-respected and had fun.” Local GAA club, St Oliver Plunketts GAC, led the tributes paid to a sorely missed club man. googletag.cmd.push “Brendy as we all knew him liked nothing more than lining out for the wee reds on a Sunday afternoon and was a regular on the scoresheet for our reserve team too,” they said. “His passion and infectious smile will be sorely missed but never forgotten by all involved with Greenlough GAC. “We would like to pass on our sincere condolences to the McNally and Downey family circles at this sad time.” The widespread nature of the tributes paid to Breandaacuten highlighted how many les he had touched throughout the world. Breandaacuten celebrating success with Wolfe Tones GAC, Melbourne. He spent time in both Australia and America, and local GAA clubs with whom he was involved posted messages of support for the family on social media. googletag.cmd.push St Pats Donegal GFC in Philadelphia said there was deep sadness within the community following news of his death. “It is with deep sadness that we learn of the passing of Breandaacuten McNally. Brendy had a great summer in Philadelphia in  and enjoyed some great times with the club,” they said. “We extend our deepest sympathy and condolences to Brendan, Patricia, Ruairiacute, Aoe and extended family and friends at this sad time.” Wolfe Tones GAC in Melbourne, where Breandaacuten starred for their football team in , also extended their condolences. “Everyone at Wolfe Tones has been saddened to learn of the passing of one of our former players, Breandaacuten McNally,” they said.     “Breandan played for the Wolfetones men’s team last year and was a huge part of the team and all their success throughout . “On behalf of everyone at Wolfe Tones GAC we would like to extend our deepest condolences to all of Breandans family and friends.” The McNally family business, B McNally  Sons Car Sales, are former sponsors of Watty Graham GAC, Glen, who also sympathised with the family. “Watty Grahams are saddened to learn of the untimely passing of Breandaacuten McNally, son of our former senior football team sponsor, Brendan,” they said. “Condolences to Brendan, Patricia, Ruairiacute, Aoe and the entire McNally family at this very sad time.” Everywhere he went, the young Greenlough man has touched lives, Fr OConnell told mourners at his funeral mass on Friday. After Breandaacuten travelled to America to receive treatment for his condition, he made such an impression on the hospital staff that they kept in touch. “The trip brought a host of new friends, real, caring people and was unbelievable the care that the family received and especially their son,” said Fr OConnell. “It was delightful, so delightful that the nurses and one of the surgeons kept in touch, so impressed were they by Brendy and his family, and his mother in particular.” Mourners heard how family was so important in Breandaacutens le. Fr OConnell also paid tribute to Breandaacutens familys devotion to him at his funeral mass last Friday, and described them as extraordinary. “All of them were in America at one time or another, supporting one another. Thats how the family became known. “As far as Im concerned, his family were pretty normal people. They did ordinary things and did them well, but truthfully, they had become extraordinary.” The night before his funeral, Breandaacutens sister Aoe appealed to friends and family to write down their memories of him along with any photos to be posted in a special memory box at the chapel. Fr OConnell ended his homily with a story that summed up the relationship between the McNally siblings. “Wed a concert one time in Greenlough. There were all kinds of people involved and Patsy was there with this wean on her knee,” he said. “Low and behold, when her brother appeared on stage, off she went like a scalded cat, leaving granny wondering where she was going. “Where did she go  She didnt settle until she got onto the stage and claimed her brother. Aoe was that wean. “She now claims him even more than ever. Family is important. Family is signicant,” he added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The deferral by Causeway Coast and Glens Councils planning committee is to allow an alternative application to progress to the same stage so a decision can be made. The controversial proposal would see a single storey McDonalds restaurant with car parking and drive through facilities erected at a section of the existing Asda site alongside the towns Ring Road. Representatives of the Lodge Hotel, which backs onto the proposed site, have stated their objection to the application. After the initial application was deferred at Octobers Planning Committee meeting, a second application was lodged showing the location of the restaurant on the East side of the car park. googletag.cmd.push At a meeting of the Planning Committee, Causeway Coast and Glens councillors heard objections from a representative of the Lodge Hotel which is situated close to the proposed site. The spokesperson said noise and disturbance from the development would have an adverse impact on residents at the hotel and the knock-on effect could cause the hotel to go out of business. Representatives of the Lodge Hotel have raised objections to the proposal. The points were echoed by some councillors, with Alderman William Duddy citing anti-social behaviour arising from the existing McDonalds site in Coleraine. “Some residents have told me they can hear the revving and the music, and some of those are three quarters of a mile away,” said Alderman Duddy. googletag.cmd.push “We cannot leave the hotel out of this. Its  years in operation and is the only tourist asset we have in this town in regards to accommodation. “We have an obligation to secure and maintain that as a planning committee. The noise, the smell, the fumes, the litter and the strong likelihood of anti-social behaviour taking place in that car park. “The police have yet to be able to resolve the issues at Riverside, which has been ongoing for years. It is imperative to take into account the impact on those using the hotel.” The committee have voted to defer the current application until the alternative planning application reaches a stage where both can be reviewed at the same time.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

People Before Profit councillor Eamonn McCann was speaking after new documents revealed by the Derry News this week showed that there are currently no engineered controls preventing potentially dangerous substances at the Mobuoy site from leaking into the adjacent River Faughan. The River Faughan provides water to , local homes and businesses. The Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairshas issued a consultancy tender asking companies to put forward plans to clean up the Mobuoy site where an estimated .m cubic metres of waste is located. googletag.cmd.push The tender is worth up to pound.m. Cllr McCann said the Derry News had done the environment a favour in publishing the government documents dealing with the dangers emanating from the dump at Mobuoy Road. “The documents confirm in stark terms what many environmental and community groups have been arguing for years. – that the dump contains dangerous substances with a potential to pollute the Faughan river, which provides water to , premises in the Derry and Strabane area - and that current arrangements for containment are not adequate. “The Department of Agriculture, the Environment and Rural Affairsis at least now admitting what the environmental network The Gathering has been insisting for years now – that the Mobuoy dump poses a threat to health and well-being in the North West and must be dealt with as a matter urgency.” googletag.cmd.push Cllr McCann said the information published in the Derry News this week was telling. “But there’s a lot more we need to be told,” he said. “The process of obtaining and evaluating bids for the consultancy business will take months. “This is what we have become used to in campaigning on the Mobuoy issue - delay, and then more delay.” Foyle SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin said that this week she had submitted a number of questions to DAERA Minister Edwin Poots on the current situation at Mobuoy. One of the questions asked for the Ministers assessment of the risk to drinking water, river quality and wildle from the lack of ‘engineering controls’ at the Mobuoy waste dump.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

One local councillor described the news as a Christmas present for Derry City and Strabane District Council. Details of the financial support secured were outlined during a meeting of the councils Governance and Strategic Planning committee on Tuesday. At the meeting, Alfie Dallas, the councils Lead Finance Officer, presented a report on the situation faced by the council in the first half of this financial year from April  to September . Mr Dallas said the councils planned budget for   was poundm, with % of that money coming from rates collected. googletag.cmd.push However, Mr Dallas said the councils finances had been very signicantly impacted by the Covid crisis. He said that the council had lost approximately pound.m during the first half of the financial year. These losses included: - pound.m as a result of the closure of council facilities, including leisure centres- pound, due to the closure of council-run car parks- pound, as a result of the loss of building control income- pound, loss of income from cemeteries due to non-charging during the pandemic Mr Dallas said the council had also faced huge unplanned costs as a result of having to respond to the pandemic. googletag.cmd.push These included health and safety costs, costs associated with new working arrangements, communications and IT costs to enable home-working. However, Mr Dallas said that thankfully the councils losses had been completely mitigated by the financial support received from a number of government departments. He said the council had recouped pound.m of its losses from the Job Retention Scheme Furlough. He said the Department of Finance had provided support of pound.m as part of a package for all  councils in Northern Ireland, while the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs had allocated pound, to the council for waste management losses. Mr Dallas said the government had also provided pound.m to cover the losses at City of Derry Airport which means that this financial burden will not fall on the council.     Government support has therefore been critical in ensuring Council finances have remained stable and has enabled signicant decisions around services to be avoided, said Mr Dallas. However, he added that there remained signicant risk and uncertainty over the councils finances because of its reliance on rates income for its annual budget. Speaking at Tuesdays meeting, Sinn Fein councillor Mickey Cooper said that back in March April of this year, the situation had been scary in relation to the financial situation facing the council. Given the government support, he welcomed that the council could continue to look at major infrastructure projects that had been planned pre-Covid. DUP Alderman Hilary McClintock said given the doom and gloom earlier in the year, the news that the councils losses had been completely mitigated was like a Christmas present. This is an absolutely fantastic outcome, she said. SDLP councillor Martin Reilly paid tribute to the council officers for their efforts in recent months. It is such a good position to be in in comparison to where we thought we would be six months ago, said Cllr Reilly.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

One local councillor described the news as a Christmas present for Derry City and Strabane District Council. Details of the financial support secured were outlined during a meeting of the councils Governance and Strategic Planning committee on Tuesday. At the meeting, Alfie Dallas, the councils Lead Finance Officer, presented a report on the situation faced by the council in the first half of this financial year from April  to September . Mr Dallas said the councils planned budget for   was poundm, with % of that money coming from rates collected. googletag.cmd.push However, Mr Dallas said the councils finances had been very signicantly impacted by the Covid crisis. He said that the council had lost approximately pound.m during the first half of the financial year. These losses included: - pound.m as a result of the closure of council facilities, including leisure centres- pound, due to the closure of council-run car parks- pound, as a result of the loss of building control income- pound, loss of income from cemeteries due to non-charging during the pandemic Mr Dallas said the council had also faced huge unplanned costs as a result of having to respond to the pandemic. googletag.cmd.push These included health and safety costs, costs associated with new working arrangements, communications and IT costs to enable home-working. However, Mr Dallas said that thankfully the councils losses had been completely mitigated by the financial support received from a number of government departments. He said the council had recouped pound.m of its losses from the Job Retention Scheme Furlough. He said the Department of Finance had provided support of pound.m as part of a package for all  councils in Northern Ireland, while the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs had allocated pound, to the council for waste management losses. Mr Dallas said the government had also provided pound.m to cover the losses at City of Derry Airport which means that this financial burden will not fall on the council.     Government support has therefore been critical in ensuring Council finances have remained stable and has enabled signicant decisions around services to be avoided, said Mr Dallas. However, he added that there remained signicant risk and uncertainty over the councils finances because of its reliance on rates income for its annual budget. Speaking at Tuesdays meeting, Sinn Fein councillor Mickey Cooper said that back in March April of this year, the situation had been scary in relation to the financial situation facing the council. Given the government support, he welcomed that the council could continue to look at major infrastructure projects that had been planned pre-Covid. DUP Alderman Hilary McClintock said given the doom and gloom earlier in the year, the news that the councils losses had been completely mitigated was like a Christmas present. This is an absolutely fantastic outcome, she said. SDLP councillor Martin Reilly paid tribute to the council officers for their efforts in recent months. It is such a good position to be in in comparison to where we thought we would be six months ago, said Cllr Reilly.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

You enjoy playing and you take any opportunity you can get.ldquoI was nervous going into it but I probably had one of the best games I ever played. I was going out an expressing myself and I was named player of the match.However, her world came crashing down when she suffered an injury while playing for the NI U- team when what looked like a normal stress fracture in her foot was to keep her out of action for four years.ldquoIt should have healed naturally within eight to  weeks and I kept getting told it would heal with rest, she recalled.ldquoIt came to a year but it hadnrsquot healed fully, so I got a second opinion and the consultant said I should have had surgery straight away on it.ldquoI had the operation and went through the full rehab period, but I was still having quite a lot of issues, so I had a second surgery and it was back to square one.Caragh recalls ldquocrying day after day at the prospect of never playing football again and said every time she took a step forward ldquoit felt like five steps back again.She went on: I had thought about going to England or America when I left school, but being injured at that age there was no point trying to chase that.ldquoHaving a lot of success at a young age, I just didnrsquot know le without football.Caragh made herto action almost four years on from her injury and after a year with Glentoran she spent a season in Iceland with Fylkir.She says Reykjavik was an ldquoamazing place to play and live and after being introduced to CrossFit in her rehab, it was in Iceland her interest in the sport grew.ldquoI was totally hooked on it and progressed quite quickly in it. I started to do a few local competitions and for a while I was balancing the two.ldquoBecause I enjoyed CrossFit so much, my love for football waned slightly. I got to the point where I didnrsquot have the same desire as before.She ed to Glentoran after her year in Iceland, lting the Irish Cup with the east Belfast side and representing Northern Ireland before halting her time in the sport to focus on CrossFit.In her break from football, Caragh said her priorities changed away from the pitch when she married her husband, Michael, in .At the turn of  she was set to compete at high-level CrossFit competitions in Asia, Egypt and the Netherlands before the Covid- pandemic intervened.ldquoI hadnrsquot planned to come back to football. Gail Redmond at Glentoran heard the competitions were scrapped and saw it as an opportunity to get me back playing, she explained.ldquoInitially I was a bit hesitant but she said about the Glens challenging for the title. I think that pulled on my heart stings a bit.Caragh netted four goals in six Womenrsquos Premiership matches to set Glentoran on course for the title before an ldquounexpected call from NI manager Kenny Shiels saw her reintroduced to the international fold.ldquoKenny was watching out first game against Cltonville. After being away from football I donrsquot think he knew who I was but I got  minutes at the end and must have impressed him.Shiels invited Caragah to train with the senior squad and was named as a stand-by for Northern Irelandrsquos trip to the Faroe Islands in Septemberrsquos Euro  qualier.She was drafted into the squad when midfielder Marissa Callaghan pulled out and made her internationalas a second-half substitute in a - win.Despite her sensationalto the NI set-up, Hamiltonrsquos season was ended prematurely by a knee injury sustained days before the victory away to Belarus.She adds that while she is disappointed to be on the sidelines, she is thankful to both Glentoran and Shiels for their support to keep her involved in club and country as much as possible.She admits she is undecided whether she will focus on CrossFit orto the football pitch after her recovery.ldquoThatrsquos the million dollar question, she said. At the minute I am focusing on getting as fit as possible to make sure Irsquom able to do the best that I can in whatever I do.ldquoI want to be healthy and injury-free so I will make that decision closer to the time depending on how things are going.Going into last nightrsquos crunch tie, Northern Ireland were hoping to secure a play-off place in the European Championships for the first time.Despite her absence for the remainder of the campaign, Caragh says she has no doubts Northern Ireland can secure second position in Group C and make history.She credits manager Shiels with instilling a strong belief in his side. ldquoHe has brought out something that was always there but a lot of it is belief and confidence, she said.ldquoPreviously we would have played within ourselves to avoid defeat, but now there is an attitude that we can go and win this game.ldquoThere is a hunger and desire to push on.

The concerts are due to be broadcast on Sunday, December , and Tuesday, December .News of the concerts comes after festive lights were switched on in Downpatrick last weekend, with others due to be illuminated over the coming weeks at local towns and villages including Ballynahinch, Newcastle, Killyleagh, Saintfield, Crossgar, and Castlewellan.Both Downpatrick and Newcastle will have articial trees, with a cut tree erected in Ballynahinch with the local authority illuminating festive lights at up to  sustainable Christmas trees across the district as well as  so-called street trees.Council chairwoman Laura Devlin said that Christmas  will be like no other.She said the local authority wants to acknowledge the impact that Covid- has had on so many peoplersquos lives and sharing a message of light and hope for better times ahead.ldquoWhile we couldnrsquot hold our traditional Christmas events and light switch-ons, we still wanted to come together as a district and I hope many will join us from their own homes to watch the upcoming light and hope concerts, she continued.ldquoI am delighted we have secured artists of such calibre and proud of the homegrown talent from Newry, Mourne and Down on display.Cllr Devlin said that as the Christmas lights are switched on across the district, she wants to acknowledge the particular dficulties faced by the retail sector this festive season.She added: ldquoFollowing the latest restrictions announced by the Northern Ireland Executive, our lsquomake it local Christmas campaign will now be launched at the safe and appropriate time.ldquoThe message from council is always to shop local and shop safely and this will be emphasised during the campaign..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd December 2020 Down(1).jpg","title":"Down have title in sight  ","story":"ldquoWErsquoVE been knocking on the door for years now, and it is really exciting that we may finally do it.Those are the words of Down captain Karen McMullan ahead of Saturdayrsquos clash with Antrim in the All-Ireland Intermediate Camogie Championship final at Breffni Park, Cavan.Down were beaten finalists two years ago, before making the semi-finals last year. Once more they have gone right to the business end of the competition, but this time they are determined to carry off the silverware.ldquoFrom a neutralrsquos point of view, it should be a really exciting match, the Castlewellan woman said. ldquoIt is also great for Ulster camogie that two northern teams are in the final.ldquoWersquove been so close over the last few years and it would be great to be able to get over that final hurdle now.With Down teams performing strongly at schools level in camogie for a while, it was always felt that would ultimately translate to success higher up the age groups. And so it has proven to be. McMullan says a number of factors have come together to allow Down to prosper, including manager Derek Dunnersquos influence.ldquoDerek has been brilliant for us, she said. He is passionate and committed to the team. In his preparation, he leaves no stone unturned. He has definitely gone above and beyond the call of duty for us.ldquoHe has brought the best people into the off-field team around us, and he has invested in us. When someone does that, it makes you want to repay their faith by bringing success. It is a time-consuming role for him too, he does a lot as well away from the matches and the training ground, so the fact we have made it to the final is brilliant for him too.In what has been a year when sportsmen and sportswomen have been left unsure about what would happened because of the coronavirus, Karen and her team-mates are revelling in being able to anticipate the excitement around an All-Ireland final.ldquoWersquore delighted to be there, first and foremost. We are buzzing with excitement. And the other thing is too, especially with the dficulties that so many people are going through, we are able to feed off the excitement of others.ldquoSo many people have been affected badly by Covid-, but you can see the dference sport can make.It can help communities come together and that is certainly something we can feel heading into this game.Down booked their spot in the final with a - to - semi-final success against Meath in Clones. It was a match where the Mourne girls looked fairly comfortable and had a gear or two to spare.McMullan concurs, saying they could have racked up an even more convincing winning margin.ldquoWe should have scored more, and could have done. But Meath held out well, and then it became more of a case of seeing the game out and protecting the advantage. We knew Meath are a very dficult team to overcome.ldquoBefore the match, we spoke about how close we had come before going all the way. We absolutely did not want to experience those feelings again. A lot of players, to be honest, were not over last yearrsquos loss to Westmeath. It hurt a lot.ldquoSometimes it can take you to lose a game of that importance to toughen you up, make you ready to go that bit more the next time. There is no doubt the girls have the hunger and are driven to win this now. As for the challenge posed by Antrim, the Down camp are certainly not under-estimating the task at hand, as Karen admits.ldquoItrsquoll be a tough one against Antrim. They are a very young, very fit, quick team. They have some of their top players from the likes of Loughgiel and Ballycastle. Itrsquos a local derby which obviously adds a bit more spice to things. Honestly, on the day, it is anyonersquos game.Anyonersquos game indeed, but Down will know they have weapons in their team that they will look to on the day to make the dference between the pain of coming runners-up again, and the glory of being crowned All-Ireland champions.Paula OrsquoHagan is someone the team will certainly be looking towards to presenting a threat in front of the Antrim goal. She was a constant thorn in the side of Meath in the last four, accounting for seven points.Sarah-Louise Graffin is also a threat going forward. She ably dovetailed with OrsquoHagan in the last four, weighing in with three points. When those two click going forward, they can be a handful for even the most miserly of back-lines.Fionnuala Carr is the glue that held that line together so well in the success over Meath, and no doubt she will be the bedrock that Down will try to build their success on again.As well as that, Dougan has the team well-drilled in defence. And ahead of them, they have a midfield prowess that can take a grip on a game against the best. Niamh Mallon is a constant danger to the opposition, full of busy running and creativity. Alongside her, Saoirse McCartan is another wily operator.Undoubtedly, Down possess the tools in their armoury to carry off the title this time around. In terms of talent, and the experience of being there before and knowing what to expect on the big occasion, they know the drill.Now Dougan, and the players will be hoping they can shake off the lsquonearlyrsquo tag and be crowned camogie queens of Ireland.The throw-in for Saturdayrsquos final is .pm. It will be broadcast live on the RTE News Channel and also on the RTE Player International. It will be preceded at .pm by the Premier Junior final between Armagh and Cavan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd December 2020 Downpatrick.jpg","title":"Downpatrick charity hosts presentations  ","story":"THE Le Change Changes Lives charity which helps those affected by mental ill health or addiction problems made a number of presentations to its service users last week.The Downpatrick group held a socially distanced ceremony at the St Patrick Centre, just a short distance from its Market Street base where it ed to recently after the easing of coronavirus restrictions.Eight of the charityrsquos participants were presented with their Level One ICQ certicates in hospitality skills funded by the the Asset Recovery Community Schemewhich is managed by Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership.Certicates were awarded to Janet Smith, Natalie Mussett, Sarah Taylor, Michelle Quinn, Clare Higgins, Colm Young and Sonya Craig.One of the certicates was awarded posthumously to Marie Magee mdash who sadly died earlier this year mdash and was accepted by her husband, Mark.

In these strange and dficult times, even the strongest and most resilient among us are not exempt from occasionally feeling weary and despondent.During the early months of lockdown back in the spring, how many of us enjoyed the slowing down of the hamster wheel of le and took time to enjoy nature at its finest and to reflect on what our priorities really are It all seems much harder this time around as people face the harsh reality of a huge economic downturn and the virus pandemic takes on a dferent guise.We need all the help we can get to keep ourselves as positive and hopeful as possible. This is where mindfulness can come in. It is a term that has become popular in recent times and often is wrongly used.It can get a bad press and seem shrouded in mystery mdash something that requires a knowledge of Zen beyond the reach of lsquoJoe Publicrsquo while others claim it to be some kind of panacea that can cure all ills. It is neither of these things.As a practitioner for several years and a Mindfulness in Schools Project trained teacher for five, I can honestly say it is a tool that can help some peoplefocus on the present and not let the mind wander into unnecessary places, whether that be worries or distractions.The analogy of thoughts being like buses is one I like. We donrsquot need to jump on every single one, instead just watch them pass by.An example of a mindful experience could be when a musician is playing a piece and sensing the music, rather than reading the notes.It is flowing completely naturally and no thinking is involved. Sport is another great example. Novak Djokovic and Jonny Wilkinson are two advocates of mindful practice and both claim their focus and steady performance can be attributed to the discipline.Interestingly, two of the most mindful sports are golf and cricket. Being at one with the little white ball as it gets smacked about the greens is said to be as good for mental health as much as physical.Our own Rory McIlroy summed it up well when he said: ldquoIrsquom not about to go and live with the monks in Nepal or anything like that, but Irsquom making sure that I centre myself and put my head in the right place.Cricket is similar.When you are bowling an over, the focus is on the line of the ball, the position of the field and the feel of the wicket under foot. The batsman is equally focussing on the ball and the fielders woe betide they lose their concentration.The halcyon days of local cricket as a mainstream sport appear to be over at the moment and there are multiple reasons offered for the demise mdash schools having less time for summer sports in the final term, the attention span of young players not being what it was and fewer people willing to commit to what could be a full day.Which leads me nicely back to the beginning.Remember those lovely, slower days of lockdown when we realised being busy wasnrsquot necessarily all it was cracked up to be and that many of the things on our mental lsquoto dorsquo list are not that important after all Maybe we really need to take time to smell the autumn leaves, the way we did for the daffodils of spring. Maybe we need to slow it down and find things to hope for.Local cricket clubs donrsquot have the crowds around the team boards any more on a Thursday evening after the selection committee when the team lists were pinned up.There isnrsquot that excitement of ldquodid I make it from the thirds to the seconds   or for me, ldquowhere am I serving the sandwiches It is a dferent era for the game, but those who love it, really love it. If anyone reading this has their whites from a bygone time hidden in an attic somewhere, why not retrieve them and dust them down for next spring If you played a bit at school and just feel like revisiting the sport for a bit of exercise and a bit of craic with new people, then please do it.Evenyoursquove never played, but have walked down the Strangford Road and loved that beautul setting, then it might be worth a go.We all need things to look forward to and we all need hope. Downpatrick Cricket Club needs that hope too.Maurice Irvine, a dear friend and colleague and master of cricket at Down High School, is also a former player for the school and the club.He strongly recommends anyone to take up the bat again or try it out whatever level you are at.When I asked him how he felt at the possible closure of Downpatrick Cricket Club, he said:ldquoIt is with great sadness that I learn of this possibility.

One of the walking trails will be for people with greater access needs.There will be iations in the material used on the trails, and gradient iations, to provide ying levels of dficulty for dferent abilities.The trails will remain unlit to ensure bats and nocturnal wildle are not affected. Some trees will be removed to make way for the trails.During consultation, the main concerns expressed were between walkers and cyclists and the impact on wildle and ecology. The council officer told the committee that these ldquowere all addressed within the application. There were no objections to the plan from residents or statutory bodies.The council planning report stated: ldquoAll material considerations have been assessed and the proposal complies with regional planning policy and is considered a good quality design which is sensitive to its countryside location.ldquoThe proposal would not adversely affect residential amenity or bioersity and will ensure the viability and sustainability of this outdoor recreation site within the Borough. Approval is therefore recommended.The project will receive funding from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs.DUP Councillor Alistair Cathcart said:ldquoI think it is always a dficult balance when you are providing public access to nature, and protecting nature as well. I was very pleased with the conditions laid out, to preserve the place as much as possible, and even enhance it with the boxes being installed for animals. I look forward to visiting when it is completed. out of  councillors voted for the proposal, with one against and two abstentions.The  hectare site has woodland that was once part of the Clandeboye Estate and is important locally for its conservation value and landscape features in North Down.It rises to an altitude of m, and has a wide range of birds, and red squirrels in the wooded areas near the adjacent hill fort.It has existing informal walking trails, but redevelopment started earlier this year with upgrading the car park and a new toilet block."},{"url":null,"title":"non essential retailers to reopen but dismay as wet pubs must remain shut ","story":"Read More:Hugging family and friends over Christmas #an extreme risk#"},{"url":null,"title":"truth and intrigue behind one our best loved ballads ","story":"NI Baptist Church opens despite coronavirus rules   NI Weather: Met Office issue yellow status weather warning for parts of NI - Snow, sleet and widespread forecast for coming daysNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutChristmasCarsHomes and GardensCoronavirusFarmingPuzzlesChristmasPublic NoticesNewsOpinionThe truth and intrigue behind one of our best loved ballads“As beautul Kitty one morning was tripping, With a pitcher of milk from the fair of Coleraine.”By THE ROAMERThursday, rd December , : am  \"       \"  \"Kitty Weeps as Barney McCleary Tries to Console HerThus begins the well-known ballad ‘Kitty of Coleraine.’But who was Kitty  The question has piqued Mitchell Smyth’s curiosity since he was a reporter in the Northern Constitution in Coleraine  years ago.    \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...\"A kiss then he gave her . . . as Kitty of Coleraine Weeps for her Broken Pitcher of sweet buttermilkBallycastle-born Smyth, now retired after a career as reporter, editor and columnist with the Toronto Star, has done some sleuthing in the matter, and although he hasn’t been able to establish who Kitty was, he has unearthed some interesting information. Among other things, the back story links Kitty to Bing Crosby, the Blarney Stone, and a duelling barrister and wit from County Clare. Smyth says a veteran newspaperman in Coleraine once told him that Kitty was a real woman. She lived, he said, at The Cutts, near a salmon-leap cataract on the River Bann, on the western outskirts of the town. \"Bing Crosby Finds Love in Ireland, with Ann Blyth, in Top o The MorningThe smashed pitcher of ‘sweet buttermilk’ that is a central part of the story, is reported to have been a true incident, one witnessed by Edward Lasaght Lysaghtwas a barrister and poet in County Clare. What he might have been doing in Coleraine is a mystery, but most folksong historians agree that he wrote it originally as a poem. We don’t know when he wrote it, but it was put to music and published in , the year Lysaght died. For over a century the song was performed in the music halls of Ireland and at ceilidhs and church socials all over the island, but generally stayed under the world-wide radar. Until , that is, when Bing Crosby, then arguably the most popular singer on the planet, introduced it to the world. He did it in the movie, ‘Top o’ The Morning’, in which he plays a New York insurance detective sent to County Cork to investigate after the Blarney Stone is stolen. The local Garda sergeantthrows him jail, and from behind bars he picks up a concertina and entertains Fitzgerald and his constablewith ‘Kitty of Coleraine’. Now the whole world knew the song!The film, of course, had nothing to do with Blarney - it was filmed on a Paramount Pictures’ backlot, with Hollywood’s version of what an Irish village should look like, with locals talking in awful Irish brogues . Ann Blythplayed the sergeant’s daughter, with whom Crosby naturally falls in love. It has been speculated that ‘Pleasant Ned’ Lysaght, as he was widely known, might have been witness to the broken pitcher incident when he was in Coleraine as a barrister involved in a court case. He mentions ‘haymaking season’ which suggests he might have been appearing at the Autumn Assizes. Pleasant Ned seems to have been more interested in writing poems than in the law. In his later years, one biographer says, he came to live “for little beyond poetry and pistols, wine and women”, a reference to his extra-marital dalliances and to his having fought some duels. Another biography describes him as “brave, brilliant, witty, eloquent and devil-may-care.” And he was a spendthrt - in the end he lived within the confines of Trinity College, Dublinto avoid arrest for debt.Unfortunately, much of his humorous poetry and original manuscripts have been lost to posterity.He died, penniless, in , aged only . It’s a measure of the esteem in which he was held that an appeal for funds to aid his widow and two unmarried daughters raised £, Yes, an interesting character.How did ‘Kitty of Coleraine’ end up in a Hollywood movie  There are a couple of new songs in the filmbut the producers told screenwriters Edmund Beloin and Richard Breen that they wanted a real Irish song, too. Breen, whose parents were Irish immigrants to Chicago, remembered his dad singing ‘Kitty of Coleraine’, so he wrote it into the screenplay. Crosby loved it! You can watch a clip from ‘Top o’ The Morning’ featuring Bing Crosby, by Googling ‘Bing Sings Kitty of Coleraine.’Here’s a reminder of Lyaght’s full poem, told in the third person. Some versions give it in the first person, supposedly in Barney McCleary’s words: “As beautul Kitty one morning was tripping,With a pitcher of milk from the fair of Coleraine,When she saw him she stumbled, the pitcher it tumbled,And all the sweet buttermilk water’d the plain.Oh! What shall I do now, ‘twas looking at you now,Sure, sure, such a pitcher I’ll ne’er meet again.‘Twas the pride of my dairy, Oh, Barney McCleary,You’re sent as a plague on the girls of Coleraine.He sat down beside her and gently did chide her,That such a misfortune should give her such pain.A kiss then he gave her, and before he did leave her,She vowed for such pleasure, she’d break it again.‘Twas haymaking season, I can’t tell the reason,Misfortune will never come single ‘tis plain,For very soon after poor Kitty’s disaster,The il a pitcher was whole in Coleraine.”  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most Popular\" data-s-el\"\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-index\"\" href\"https:www.newsletter news politics sam-mcbride-dup-man-pockets-ps-board-role-doesnt-go-any-meetings-and-four-other-things-we-learned-assembly-week- itm_sourceparsely-api\"\"Sam McBride: DUP man pockets £, for board role – but doesn’t go to any meetings NI Weather: Met Office issue SECOND yellow status weather warning for parts of NI - widespread frost and sub-zero temperatures expected over coming daysHeartbreaking Christmas appeal for four children whose mother Allison died days ago - ‘no amount of money can ever ease their heartache’IRA is armed and still gathering intelligence on opponents, says leaked MI-PSNI assessmentCharges against RUC involved in  hayshed fatal shooting being considered by PPSMost PopularFinucane killing: Dodds lists eight terror attacks linked to other legal figures that get little attentionLATEST: NI road now reopened after Air Ambulance and two Emergency crews tasked to morning collision and one casualty rushed to Royal Victoria Hospital - road had been closed for hoursFears after highly sensitive RUC information ulged by Coroner’s OfficeWhopping pro rata £, a year salary of interim Head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service revealedLord Maginnis facing suspension from House of Lords for bullying MPs and security guard                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\" ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-lhVmIH sc-bYSBpT cqvPrG\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     LestyleEating OutChristmasCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlesCoronavirusGetting outMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessPublic NoticesFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

When a bubble is formed it is fixed, and must not be changed or extended further at any point.bull Each Christmas bubble can meet at home, at a place of worship or an outdoor public place, but existing, more restrictive rules on hospitality and meeting in other venues will be maintained throughout this period.It is important that everyone respects and abides by the rules of each nation wherever they choose to spend the festive period.Where there are any iations in our approach, these will be communicated by each administration accordingly.Further guidance will be provided in due course.The winter holiday period is a time often spent with family and friends, with schools and offices closing and people travelling over the bank holidays.Many have already begun making their plans, and we are today providing clarity to help people make the right choices for them, and enjoy time with those closest to them while staying within the rules to protect us all. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I wouldnrsquot be surprised to see a spike in cases as a result of this decision.All pub and bar owners that spoke to the Penarth Times said they are concerned about what happens after the next review on December , with the majority saying they do not believe pubs will be able to serve alcohol until January.Health minister Vaughan Gething said he understood why companies in the industry are upset, but admitted there is \"no perfect balance\" between protecting public health and businesses.Health minister Vaughan GethingBut Brains CEO Alistair Darby told the Penarth Times he feels the government has got the balance wrong.Brains pubs including the Windsor and the Star Inn in Dinas Powys will close on Friday.ldquo, people have come through our doors since the start of the pandemic ndash seven staff members have tested positive in that time and test and trace have contacted us five times, said Mr Darby.ldquoI wonrsquot question the science behind the government decision, but it seems to me wersquove shown what wersquove done has worked.ldquoWersquove worked tirelessly to make sure people are as safe as possible in our pubs, and people have been safe. Our findings show that.ldquoThe scarring effect this will have on the economy will be brutal and long drawn out. We have already been operating at a  per cent deficit compared to .ldquoWersquore a business that is well run, looks after its workers, pays its taxes and contributes a lot to the economy to support the NHS.ldquoIrsquom aware there has to be a balance. But itrsquos imperative we donrsquot crush our economy in the process. I think this time that balance has not been achieved.John Bassett, who owns The Golden Lion on Glebe Street which will also be closed, said: ldquoAre they going to say we can open for Christmas after this  Irsquod be surprised.John BassettldquoIrsquom resigned to an awful period financially ndash my only focus now is to try and keep all  of my staff. I havenrsquot laid any of my staff off yet, and donrsquot intend to, but this is really becoming testing for us now.ldquoYet again we received hardly any notice before this comes into effect. I would question how the whole industry has been treated throughout this period.ldquoMark Drakeford says he talks to stakeholders ndash yet I know nobody who has ever had a conversation with a representative of the Welsh Government on this issue.Natasha Rees, new landlady at St Fagans on Windsor Road, has worked tirelessly since she took the pub over in the autumn to make it a family friendly place. She says she is most concerned about the impact on her customers.Natasha with her family before they left the Station Hotel in Cogan earlier this yearldquoIrsquom going to do everything I can until Friday to make sure we wave them off for Christmas in a way that keeps their spirits up, she said.ldquoI have no choice but to close, and I think wersquoll be closed until January. Itrsquos horrible, wersquore right in the heart of the town and I feel wersquove made great strides to bring a community feel back here. Itrsquos a big blow for me but I feel mostly for them .ldquoMost of them come to have a chat, not to drink, but the reality is we wonrsquot be able to sell enough soft drinks to warrant staying open.The Railway Hotel also confirmed it will be closing until further notice.The Welsh Government were contacted for further comment but failed to respond.The Christmas edition of Gin s Penarth Gin is a small batch edition they have produced for the festive season.
