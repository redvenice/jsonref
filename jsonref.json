Meghan\u0027s first four patronages represent a key step for the duchess, who is still in her first year as a newbie royal.According to the royal family\u0027s website: \u0027Royal patronages add status to an organisation, and visits and involvement from a royal patron can often bring much-needed publicity.\u0027Meghan will have been inundated with requests from charities asking for her support since marrying the Duke of Sussex in May. Members of the royal family each receive hundreds of pleas each year.Most royals tends to limit their patronages to a manageable number to allow them to devote enough time to each.The Duchess of Cambridge has 17 and has focused on early intervention for children.The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have more than 1,000 patronages between them, many of which were inherited from previous monarchs.According to he royal family\u0027s website, the most influential member regarding patronages is still the Queen.\u0027The Queen\u0027s patronage carries the most weight, and Her Majesty receives the most requests for patronages of all the members of the royal family,\u0027 the site says.          Diana, Princess of Wales, made a shock announcement following her orce in 1996, when she ended her links with more than 100 charitiesIn 2016, following her 90th birthday, the Queen stepped down from 25 patronages, including the NSPCC, which was taken over by the Countess of Wessex, and the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, which went to Kate.          The first recorded patronage was George II\u0027s involvement with the Society of Antiquaries in the 1700sNow she has handed two over to Meghan, with the duchess becoming patron of the National Theatre and the Association of Commonwealth Universities.But the monarch - the nation\u0027s longest reigning sovereign - still has 599 patronages or associations. Philip stepped down as patron or president of more than a dozen organisations when he turned 90 in 2010.He was patron, president or a member of 785 organisations at his retirement in 2017, and continues his association with them behind the scenes.Diana, Princess of Wales, made a shock announcement following her orce in 1996, when she ended her links with more than 100 charities.She resigned her position as patron or president from all but six - Centrepoint, the English National Ballet, the Leprosy Mission, the National Aids Trust, London\u0027s Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children and the Royal Marsden Hospital.Those she stepped down from included Help the Aged, Barnardos, Relate and the Parkinson\u0027s Disease Society.The princess - William and Harry\u0027s mother who died in a car crash in 1997 - said she made her decision \u0027with great sadness\u0027, but wanted to concentrate her efforts on fewer causes.The first recorded patronage was George II\u0027s involvement with the Society of Antiquaries in the 1700s.The organisation was concerned with architectural and art history, conservation and heraldry.It still exists today and and the Queen\u0027s cousin, the Duke of Gloucester, is its patron.Patronages generally reflect a royal\u0027s interests, such as the Duchess of Cornwall, who is president of the National Osteoporosis Society after both her mother and grandmother died due to the brittle bone disease."},{"url":null,"title":"Vigilantes use metal plate tattoo Por Rata Rat suspected oil thiefs back","story":"    A man suspected of stealing oil from residents near Mexico city was punished by vigilantes who placed a hot metal plate over his upper backThe suspect fuel thief appears in the video laying face down on a street in Ecatepec, a town north of Mexico City, according to Mexican news outlet Criterio Hidalgo. His head is covered with a black hood and his hands are handcuffed.The suspect lets out a loud moan as the vigilante presses the hot metal plate over his upper back for a period of 18 seconds before the video cuts off.Is this Australia\u0027s most bizarre burglary?

I do not expect that to be renewed at all.\u0027Ms Rudd was using her first major welfare speech on Friday to try to allay fears about the roll-out of UC.She will say: \u0027As it stands, from February 2019 the two-child limit will be applied to families applying for Universal Credit who had their children before the cap was even announced. That is not right.\u0027These parents made decisions about the size of the family when the previous system was the only system in place.\u0027So, I can today announce that I am going to scrap the extension of the two-child limit on Universal Credit for children born before April 2017.\u0027All children born before that date will continue to be supported by Universal Credit. This will help approximately 15,000 families a year.\u0027The two-child cap limits support for families through tax credits, housing benefit and UC to the first two offspring.Subsequent children, except in special cases, are not entitled to the \u0027child element\u0027, which is currently £2,780 a year.Ms Rudd\u0027s move came as the Commons Work and Pensions Committee branded the plans to retrospectively extend the cap to children born before it was brought in \u0027cruel\u0027.The committee expressed fears about the impact of such a move on the levels of child poverty.

Harry and Meghan (pictured above) are moving into Frogmore Cottage It was the very happiest time for the Sussexes. Their much-wanted baby was conceived in mid-to-late July. Possibly the most-watched couple in the world at that point — just weeks after their Windsor wedding — they still managed to keep the pregnancy news, and their joy, perfectly private.Towards the end of the summer, they adopted a second dog in addition to Meghan’s rather ancient rescue beagle, Guy.The black Labrador puppy accompanied them on a visit to their friends George and Amal Clooney in Sonning, Berkshire, who are also dog-crazy and have two rescue dogs.So what does this house say about the royal couple and their galaxy of celebrity friends? Principally, it says that their life revolves around these Hollywood and millionaire types.For this is an area that teems with celebs.The Beckham family have a barn conversion there and are regular weekenders at Soho Farmhouse. As is fashion designer Stella McCartney and her clan. (It was Stella that Meghan chose to make her dress for her evening wedding reception.)No wonder the 37-year-old former actress feels right at home here.So who else is to be found nearby?Actor Johnny Depp has rented an Oxfordshire cottage while filming in the UK. Star Trek actor Sir Patrick Stewart has a house thereabouts.Model Kate Moss is not far away, either, and a host of young British stars such as Oscar-winner Eddie Redmayne, who was at Eton with Harry, are known to drop into Soho Farmhouse to party.          The property is in Great Tew in Oxfordshire, a small village with a population of about 150 Over the summer, Meghan brought members of her own American-Canadian crowd to hang out at the club, including the actress Priyanka Chopra and her husband, singer Nick Jonas, and Meghan’s great tennis player friend Serena Williams and her tech millionaire husband and their young daughter.The duchess’s long-time friend, Canadian stylist Jessica Mulroney, also paid a visit. Apparently, they took the time to plan Meghan’s outfits for her visit to Australia and New Zealand.Naturally, her mother Doria Ragland also spent time with the couple in Oxfordshire. Those rolling fields around the golden barn could hardly be more of a world away from the noisy streets of Los Angeles where Doria lives.          The village of Great Tew, Oxfordshire, with the pub, The Falkland ArmsSources suggest that Meghan’s mum went a couple of times, in July and September, and had dinner with the duke and duchess in ‘The Shack’ — a single-storey wooden building in Soho Farmhouse which is lit by a multitude of flickering candles.It has a kitchen area with a huge open fire and rotisserie, and a small, entirely private dining room attached which has been put at Harry and Meghan’s disposal.Meghan is reported, too, to have attended a couple of fitness classes at the club — Pilates and spin cycling. She and Harry have also been seen in the first-floor child-free eating area.A regular told me: ‘Meghan is very nice, polite and respectful to the staff — which is noticed because not all celebrities are!’Of course, the royal couple have entertained ‘at home’ too. Their house has a vast kitchendining room and stunning views over the countryside.So who is in the duke and duchess’s elevated social set? Central are the Beckhams. Victoria’s bond with Meghan has been very publicly stated with Meghan wearing Mrs B’s designs over recent months, including a calf-length navy dress costing £1,250, with matching £2,250 coat, £1,250 boots and £1,550 handbag.For his part, Harry is close to David Beckham, who he has known for many years through charity work.Meghan’s best friend, Markus Anderson, who works for the Soho House group, is a key member of the new royal’s support team and he has been around, too. Originally, he invited her to join Soho House when she was still a TV soap actress in Toronto, and it was Markus who facilitated all of Harry and Meghan’s early dates in London and Oxfordshire.          Meghan Markle had her hen party at Soho Farmhouse (pictured above) He also arranged her low-key hen weekend celebrations — at Soho Farmhouse, of course, and encouraged her to attend the launch of a new Soho House last year in Amsterdam. Markus is very good friends with New York-based fashion designer Misha Nonoo, who is said to have introduced Meghan and Harry to each other.Both Markus and Misha spent time with the royal newlyweds at their country barn last summer, staying for extended stretches.Others who have stayed or visited include Princess Eugenie and the Clooneys. That followed Harry and Meghan taking a mini-break at the Clooneys’ house on Lake Como in Italy in May.          Priyanka Chopra and her husband, singer Nick Jonas (pictured) have also hung out with Meghan MarkleThe similarities between the couples are striking. Two previously long-time bachelors, both significantly less well-educated than their career-minded and very successful wives, who they married after whirlwind romances.Both wives have expensive tastes in fashion (Meghan favours Givenchy, Amal loves Prada) and both have ambitions to establish themselves as humanitarians on the global stage.Barrister Amal, who grew up in Buckinghamshire, fostered the friendship after being introduced to Meghan by mutual friends at . . . Soho House. She then recommended to Meghan a starry list of contacts — from hair stylists to interior designers and key staff members.The Clooneys wanted to host Barack Obama’s wife Michelle — a mutual pal — with Meghan and Harry for a dinner party in December, but it was cancelled because of the funeral of former U.S. President George Bush.This Cotswolds — Soho House by Royal Appointment — crowd are a tight-knit group who socialise with each other and mirror each other’s tastes and interests.Indeed, many of them have used the same interior designer, Vicky Charles, to copy the battered but deluxe Soho House chic in their own country homes.It was Vicky who oversaw all the club’s interior design for 20 years before setting up a private client business. She has interior designed for the Clooneys (in three of their houses), the Beckhams and chef Gordon Ramsay.          Meghan’s best friend, Markus Anderson (left) works for the Soho House groupIt is said that her firm, Charles \u0026amp Co — partly run by comedian James Corden’s wife Julia — has lent a hand with refurbishing Harry and Meghan’s barn.It would be no surprise if the suggestion is true, since the duchess relishes Soho House’s trendy ethos, and instinctively chimes with its modern, very luxurious way of doing things.As a lifestyle blogger before marrying Harry, Meghan was relentlessly enthusiastic about finding the best crystal glasses, the best chilli sauce, and the most perfectly mixed cocktails.          Soho Farmhouse, Great Tew, Oxford. An exclusive members clubOf course, none of this is the traditional way of Cotswolds life, which locals say normally means draughty rooms, muddy animals, broken tractors and cornflakes from Tupperware boxes for breakfast.Meghan is certainly rather Californian about food, favouring fashionable rather than traditional dishes such as Gloucestershire Old Spot pork roasts.Harry has reportedly been encouraged to cut back on his drinking by his pregnant, health-conscious wife and is said to have been teetotal for three months.          The Beckham\u0027s (pictured above) will be neighbours of Harry and MeghanIt’s quite an achievement for a man who was notoriously lairy in his youth!She is also said to have encouraged him to cut back on his meat consumption. Before they met, Meghan was in the habit of eating mostly vegetarian in the week.Above all, their Cotswolds house has been a safe haven for Harry and Meghan, and also somewhere to start anew, with new friends and new priorities.In Kensington, Harry’s long-time neighbours were his brother William and wife Kate.Regardless of talk of a rift between the two women, it seems Harry was keen to get away from the shadow of his older brother and his wife.The Cambridges’ country home in Norfolk, near Sandringham, is, by comparison, a safe choice which respects tradition.For their part, Harry and Meghan have felt freer to mix with wealthy, fun-loving, en vogue, globally famous do-gooders.This new circle have staff, and charity projects, but also have a different way of doing things. Privacy and luxury are watchwords, rather than a tradition of polite and dutiful self-sacrifice.But however much they want the Cotswolds as a bolt-hole to escape the halogen gaze that’s directed at the Queen’s family, there is always a reminder — for those who seek it — of royalty’s chequered history.For it wasn’t too far from Harry and Meghan’s barn conversion that, during the Civil War in 1646, a Royalist army marched through the area desperately seeking to join up with Charles I in Oxford and was forced into a battle so fierce that ducks were said to be ‘able to bathe in the pools of blood that formed on the street’.Back then, the Royalists were defeated. Today, the royal newlyweds are in the ascendancy. "},{"url":null,"title":"As ANDY MURRAY reluctantly prepares bow true champ won greatest victory all","story":"    Andy Murray (pictured above at the 2013 Wimbledon singles title) has announced the end of his playing career          Andy and Jamie Murray (pictured above).

The brattish behaviour of the young Murray was likened to John McEnroe, another tennis genius with a short fuse.Monosyllabic, sullen, ungracious were the kindest of epithets. When he casually remarked that when it came to football he supported anyone who played England, even the most patriotic of tennis fans were outraged.But winning brought about a transformation, smiles replaced scowls and almost overnight he won over those critical fans.          Following the announcement Andy Murray took to Instagram and posted a picture of him and his mother Judy MurrayHe might have retired two years ago when his hip problem first flared, forcing him to pull out of big tournaments. He had amassed a fortune, received a knighthood, and with one daughter and another on the way with wife Kim, a family life to cherish. But right to the last Murray, 31, wanted to be a winner, to bow out on a high.What was it that drove this young man to such heights? And how without tennis, which has been part of his life since the age of three when he first picked up a racquet, will he fill his days?The story of Sir Andrew Barron Murray OBE is not just about the incredible mental strength that has made him one of the greatest sportsmen Britain has produced — according to some yesterday ‘our greatest sportsman ever’ — but also about a tougher struggle to overcome the traumas of childhood — and to be liked.This, remember, is a man who, when he was just eight years old, hid behind a desk as a deranged gunman rampaged through his primary school in the Scottish border town of Dunblane, slaughtering 16 children and a teacher in March 1996. Two years later he was coping with his parents’ orce and then at 15 he tore himself away from home to live alone in Barcelona to take advantage of better coaching facilities.As a professional player, he has pushed himself to the limits of human endurance during training, living like a monk before major tournaments — and making countless other sacrifices to be the best.For the past decade he has carried the nation’s tennis hopes on his muscular shoulders, winning three Grand Slams (two Wimbledon and the U.S. title), two Olympic gold medals, and securing Great Britain’s first Davis Cup triumph since 1936 virtually single-handedly.          Andy Murray poses with his medal at the 2012 OlympicsIt has brought him career prize money of £48 million and a raft of lucrative endorsement deals that have boosted his wealth to £83 million, according to the most recent Sunday Times Rich List.And Murray has achieved all this in an era that has produced the finest crop of players ever to grace the game — Roger Federer, Rafa Nadal and Novak Djokovic. It certainly places him at the very heart of our sporting pantheon and his star shines more brightly when we remember his inauspicious beginnings, and the self-destructive flaws, that threatened to sabotage his success.When Murray started playing, tennis was very much a middle-class, Home Counties sport and its administrators never imagined a champion might emerge from the far North.But with his exceptional talent and an unswerving self-belief that saw him yelling instructions at his much older club doubles partner when he was eight, he has completely changed the tennis establishment’s mind-set, so that now every talented child, regardless of background, has a chance.That is certainly a legacy he can be proud of. But along the way he put many a nose out of joint. He didn’t just curse at umpires, like McEnroe, he let rip with volleys of foul-mouthed abuse.He soon started collecting criticism for his stroppy on-court posturing — ‘like some second-rate Caledonian cage-fighter,’ as one Wimbledon figure put it.          Andy Murray married Kim Sears in 2015Yet perhaps he was owed some understanding from critics, a realisation that this was a youngster shaped by a difficult upbringing, acquiring, in the process, a certain dourness.Murray has rarely spoken about the deaths of his classmates. But he did open up about the harrowing event in Dunblane ahead of his first Wimbledon win in 2013.‘At the time, you have no idea how tough something like that is. As you start to get older you realise,’ he said. ‘The thing that is nice now, the whole town, they recovered from it so well.‘It wasn’t until a few years ago that I started to research it and look into it a lot because I didn’t really want to know. It’s just nice that I’ve been able to do something the town is proud of.’During the early years he did revel in his status as the poster boy of Scottishness, not Britishness. Wimbledon, remember, was still basking in the nearly career of Tim Henman who epitomised tennis’s Home Counties tradition.Beating Federer for the first time in 2006 and ending Henman’s seven-year run as British No 1, began to change things — although he came to regret joshing with Henman over who he’d be supporting during the 2006 football World Cup and thus revealing his anti-England prejudice. It certainly damaged Murray’s image with the public and media for a time.That began to change in his early 20s. The architect of this metamorphosis was a new manager, pop-impresario Simon Fuller, the creator of the TV show Pop Idol.His influence saw Murray photographed by Mario Testino for Vogue and later winning plaudits for his self-deprecating turns for Comic Relief.Of course, there was always another far more important figure in the Murray corner — his formidable mother Judy. It’s no secret that for many years she was the person he listened to more than anyone. If Murray disturbed Middle England, his mother sitting in the players’ box, jaw set, eyes aflame and fists pumping, positively affronted it.          Judy Murray (pictured above) had dreams of becoming a pro tennis star The truth of their relationship is complex. Murray’s autobiography, Hitting Back, revealed that Judy, a star amateur player, ‘hated the whole birth thing’ and found the early years of raising Murray and his older brother and fellow tennis professional, Jamie, difficult. Gone forever were Judy’s dreams of making it as a pro herself. ‘I felt completely trapped,’ she says. ‘I was stuck in the house with these two little tiddlers, and it was an absolute nightmare.’And she, too, lived through the terror of Dunblane. ‘I was one of hundreds of mums queuing at the school gates waiting to find out what had happened, not knowing if your children were alive or not,’ she later recalled.Divorce from her sons’ father, Willie, a retail manager in Dunblane, soon followed, and it wasn’t until the brothers began showing a talent for tennis that Judy seems to have discovered the true joys of parenthood.To some extent, she may have simply been transferring her ambitions to her children.Murray broke into the world top ten in 2007 and reached his first Grand Slam final a year later, losing to Nadal at the U.S. Open.By now he was the darling of the Centre Court crowd. So-called Henman Hill at Wimbledon, where there are TV screens for fans to see the action on Centre Court, was now dubbed Murray Mount. Then in 2012, in a splendid summer of British sport Murray became the first man to reach the Wimbledon final for more than seven decades.It was the year of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee and it seemed odds-on certain that the stars had aligned so that Murray would prevail.But he lost to Federer, sobbing on court in defeat. His breakdown endeared him even more to the public and a month later he returned to Centre Court to beat the Swiss and win an Olympic gold medal. It seemed to be a turning point. Later that summer he won his first Grand Slam with a dramatic five-set victory over Djokovic in the U.S. Open.A year later came sporting history and a Wimbledon hoodoo was finally broken as he beat Djokovic in straight sets to become the first British man to win Wimbledon since Fred Perry in 1936 and the entire nation celebrated with him.By now there was another, more glamorous figure in his corner, Kim Sears, leggy, blonde daughter of player-turned-coach Nigel Sears.Her peaches and cream complexion and stylish presence completed Andy’s transformation to darling of SW19.She changed his wardrobe, tamed his hair and yes, even got him to smile.They shared a £5 million, six bedroom house in Oxted, Surrey, with two adorable border terriers, Maggie May and Rusty, to whom they were devoted. Their engagement was announced in 2014, nine years after they started dating, and the following year they were married at Dunblane Cathedral, the reception held at the nearby Cromlix House hotel which Murray had bought for £1.8 million in 2013.More success followed with the Davis Cup and then in 2016 a second Wimbledon title.But following his knighthood last year, his hip problem worsened. After limping out of Wimbledon last summer, he decided to undergo surgery in a bid to save his career — but, it seems, to no avail.What now then for our greatest ever tennis player? Family life will be central. He and Kim, an illustrator, have two young daughters, Sophia and Edie, and he described the birth of his first child in February 2016 as ‘the best moment of my life’, later admitting, as his family grew, that ‘for the first time ever, tennis is probably more of a distraction from my home life than the other way around’.His hotel purchase, meanwhile, has shown, he is an aspiring businessman. With two partners, he has also set up 77 Sports Management, an agency designed to mentor and manage budding stars across the sporting spectrum.But as that emotional press conference made clear what Sir Andy really likes to do is hit balls across a net — and win.‘I’m not really too sure what I love about tennis. I just enjoy winning. Winning is the most amazing thing,’ he once said.Now he needs to find something to replace it. As for the rest of us summer will never be the same again.  My brave pal Andy must play one final Wimbledon By Boris BeckerThis is a heartbreaking moment — not just for Andy and the tennis-crazy Murray family, but for the entire world of tennis.What makes him so special is that not only has he competed at the highest level of the game, but he has won again and again and again.Yes, he is the greatest British player since Fred Perry. But he’s also one of the greatest players of the past decade.          Boris Becker (pictured above) said Andy Murray needs to play one last Wimbledon final Andy has had the misfortune — although I hope he’ll eventually come to see it as a privilege — to play at a time when tennis has been dominated by two of the greatest players the game has ever seen — Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal — with a third, Novak Djokovic, not far behind.That’s why, for me, his greatest achievement was his 2016 end-of-season win over Djokovic at the ATP World Tour Finals which made Andy the world No 1.It was a very painful moment for me, because I was Novak’s coach. But it was a stunning and richly deserved triumph for Andy.          Roger Federer is one of the greatest tennis players the world has ever seen, according to Boris Becker As we now know, though, it was an achievement that came at tremendous physical cost.For while the muscular Nadal punched his way to the top and the elegant Federer finessed his way there, Andy had to fight all the way, contesting every point with blood, sweat and those famous Murray tears.He played that way because he had to. I say this with the utmost respect but the truth is that he isn’t the most naturally gifted player. Yet he has a massive heart and, after a great deal of gym work, the physical strength of a lion. Unlike players who rely on their serve, Andy’s game centres on his speed and footwork.That is why he needs to be 100 per cent fit. It’s no good for him to be 75 per cent.          Rafael Nadal rose to the top of tennis through his playing Andy — ‘Sir Andy’, as I call him when I want to tease him — plays up to his image as ‘boring’ but, in fact, he’s anything but. In private, he’s funny, tremendously well liked and a man of principle.It shouldn’t be forgotten that he was the first top male player to employ a female coach — the French former world No 1 Amelie Mauresmo — and that he’s been a consistent champion of gender equality, campaigning for equal prize money for male and female players.But now Andy has reached the awful moment that all top sportsmen and women dread, when they realise that their worn-out body will no longer allow them to compete at the very top level.Every one of us has only one body. And we must look after it. I retired after breaking my ankle at the same age — 31 — as Andy is now. In hindsight, I should have stopped earlier but, in the heat of the moment, I always wanted to play the next round or the next event. Today, I’m paying a heavy price. I have two new hips. My right ankle isn’t perfect. I have a limp. These are my battle scars.As for Andy, as a three-time Wimbledon champion myself, I offer him one bit of serious advice:I realise that your body is hurting and your spirits are desperately low. But please resist, if you possibly can, any thoughts to call it a day immediately.Instead, cut right back on your tournament schedule, look after that poor, pain-wracked body of yours, but don’t quit right away.As I did 20 years ago, it is vital that you play your last match at your spiritual home, Wimbledon, the scene of three of your greatest tournament triumphs.Your legions of fans need to say an emotional goodbye to you. And you, too, must bid farewell to the game you have loved on the square of grass that you have graced so wonderfully: Centre Court. If you don’t, you will regret it for the rest of your life.So what next?There will be a painful period of adjusting to not playing. Let your lovely wife Kim take care of you, while you also take care of her and your two daughters.After that, the media will be clamouring to employ you for decades to come, but, knowing you and the sort of man you are, I think you will want — and possibly need — a more serious job as well.He may be bowing out as a top player but, take it from me, the Andy Murray story is far from over. "},{"url":null,"title":"Ocado boss moved lingerie model gets set 23m bonus","story":"    Tim Steiner (pictured with Polish lingerie model Patrycja Pyka) is set to receive a long-term bonus worth up to four million sharesThe boss of online supermarket Ocado will bag a £23million bonus two years after his big money orce was finalised.The £116million fortune Tim Steiner made from Ocado was dented after a court battle with his wife of 14 years, Belinda.The 49-year-old got together with his new partner, Polish lingerie model Patrycja Pyka, who is 20 years his junior, after his marriage ended.Under the settlement with Belinda, 48, the father of four ided his £116million fortune with her.

The loan has been paid back and Ocado said this week that he did not sell any of his shares to fund the settlement.Last summer he was reportedly living with Miss Pyka, 29, in an £80,000-a-month rented mansion near the former family home.His girlfriend, a dental hygiene graduate from humble beginnings who grew up in south-west Poland, is only 11 years older than Mr Steiner\u0027s oldest son.Ocado has become a stock market darling in the past year thanks to its pioneering technology such as stock-picking robots and state-of-the-art warehouses, earning it the nickname \u0027the Microsoft of retail\u0027.Ocado declined to comment on the share scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"Boris Becker Sir Andys legions fans need carry on","story":"    Boris Becker (pictured above watching Andy Murray at 2016\u0027s Wimbledon)That’s why, for me, his greatest achievement was his 2016 end-of-season win over Djokovic at the ATP World Tour Finals which made Andy the world No 1.It was a very painful moment for me, because I was Novak’s coach.

Two-day-old rolls have even popped up on eBay for £12.50.And Greggs is reaping the rewards of jumping on the vegan bandwagon, this week raising its 2019 profit forecast to £88 million.Russia\u0027s media watchdog accuses BBC of spreading \u0027terrorist...\u0027I thought I was going to die\u0027: Base jumper, 27, who broke...Share this articleIndeed, at my local branch in South-East London, where 180 vegan sausage rolls go on sale at 6am every day, they\u0027re sold out by 9am. I manage to nab the last one. Eating it is no problem — in fact, I\u0027d struggle to tell it apart from the meat version — but finding out what\u0027s in it proves a challenge.Like the mystique that\u0027s surrounded the \u002711 secret herbs and spices\u0027 in KFC\u0027s chicken for more than 50 years, Greggs is closely guarding the recipe. The ingredients aren\u0027t listed anywhere on its website — and when I contact the company for details, a spokeswoman tells me: \u0027I\u0027m afraid we can\u0027t share any further information on ingredients or processes.\u0027So, with the help of sausage manufacturers and vegan nutritionists, I set out to uncover the truth... what is in a Greggs vegan \u0027sausage\u0027 roll?          Made from faux \u0027meat\u0027 encased in dairy-free pastry, the new vegan \u0027sausage\u0027 roll costs £1 and was launched in response to a 20,000-strong petition by animal welfare group PetaFILLING OF FUNGUS The filling starts life as a mouldy fungus. Fusarium venenatum was discovered in fields near Marlow, Buckinghamshire, in 1967, as part of a scientific study to find alternative protein sources for food.From the same group of fungi as truffles and morels, it\u0027s made up of a web of finely spun strands.Today, it\u0027s still extracted from soil, where it occurs naturally, but is grown in commercial plots.After much experimenting, the fungus finally made it to market in 1985 as the filling for a vegetable pie, under the brand name Quorn.Before it\u0027s safe to eat, it is fermented in vats to make a product called \u0027mycoprotein\u0027. After five weeks, the mixture is stirred, so denser fungus sinks to the bottom, where it\u0027s heated to 64c, filtered off and dried.STARCH TO BIND ITThe mycoprotein resembles breadcrumbs so a binding agent is required to help it resemble something more \u0027meaty\u0027.In most Quorn products, egg white is used, but in its vegan range (launched in 2011), potato starch — from the root of the potato plant — is added instead.Not only does this bind the mycoprotein granules together, but it acts as a thickening and moistening agent, giving it the consistency of wet dough.FROZEN FOR TEXTUREVegans\u0027 biggest complaint about meat substitutes is their consistency. Many are crumbly and fail to live up to the texture of a tender chicken breast or medium-rare steak. \u0027Mock meats are a great way to cut down meat intake,\u0027 says Rose Glover, a nutritionist specialising in plant-based food. \u0027However some people still crave the taste and textures of meat.\u0027Mycoprotein is praised for its authentic \u0027meaty\u0027 consistency.This is achieved in a three-stage process: steam cooking it for 30 minutes, chilling and shaping it (to look like a burger patty or a meatball, for example) and then freezing it — a crucial part of the process as the ice crystals push fibres together, creating bundles that give it its meat-like texture.What\u0027s left is a substance that looks and feels like the real deal.PALM OIL PROBLEM Greggs says the vegan sausage roll contains the same \u0027unique seasoning\u0027 as its regular version. Given that was recently found to contain just 18 per cent pork, the herbs and spices are pretty significant.Debbie Keeble, co-founder of North Yorkshire-based sausage company Heck, tasted the vegan roll and analysed it for flavour. \u0027It has quite a sour taste,\u0027 she says. \u0027There\u0027s a slight chemically flavour.\u0027I think they use garlic powder, onion powder, sage, parsley, salt, white and black pepper — and yeast, which gives it that savoury, cheesy nuttiness.\u0027The texture is a little pappy and soft, as the sausage doesn\u0027t have a skin to hold it all together.\u0027          The filling starts life as a mouldy fungus, extracted from soil and grown in commercial plots So what does Greggs say? After a protracted email exchange, the bakery chain finally discloses more details on its \u0027bespoke recipe\u0027 — which includes wheat flour, thickener, dehydrated onion, pea fibre, rubbed sage, rubbed thyme, rape-seed oil and potato protein.There\u0027s also one contentious ingredient — palm oil — which may explain its reluctance to share. Palm oil has been linked to deforestation, animal cruelty and indigenous rights abuses in countries where it\u0027s produced, with many customers boycotting retailers using it.96 FLAKEY LAYERSGreggs says its vegan sausage roll is encased in 96 layers of flaky puff pastry, made the same way as the traditional version. We know it contains vegetable oil, not butter — but there are no details on how the pastry is made.More information can be found in a response sent to a customer in 2013, after she asked for an ingredients breakdown for its vegetable bake. A spokeswoman said Greggs\u0027 pastry was made from wheat flour, vegetable margarine and shortening (solidified fats), water and salt.Layers are created by a process known as \u0027lamination\u0027, which involves folding sheets of pastry and fat over one another.Finished products are frozen at Greggs\u0027 Newcastle HQ before being shipped to 950 of its 1,950 branches and baked (for 25 minutes at 220C) on the day of sale.A BIGGER BITE The vegan sausage rolls are longer — six millimetres — than their pork equivalent. Greggs says this means they equate to ten \u0027mega-bites\u0027. On my taste-test it was more like seven.SWEET AND SALTY So is the vegan version healthier than plumping for pork? It contains marginally fewer calories — 311 compared to 327 —less fat (19g versus 22g) and more protein (12g versus 9.4g).However that\u0027s still more calories than a McDonalds cheeseburger, which contains 301.          The new vegan sausage roll (left) also contains more calories than a McDonalds cheeseburgerStudies have also shown mycoprotein helps regulate blood sugar levels and can make us feel fuller for longer.There is, however, more salt in the vegan roll (1.9g compared to 1.6g) and it contains nearly a gram of sugar per serving, while the original has none.IS IT \u0027GREEN\u0027?there\u0027s no doubt swapping your lunchtime sausage roll for a vegan alternative has a positive impact on the environment.As well as preserving the pig population (animal cruelty is the main reason many adopt veganism), fake meat has a smaller carbon footprint and needs less land and water than rearing livestock.The carbon footprint — the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere — of mycoprotein is ten times lower than that of beef, while its water footprint is on average 20 times lower.ALLERGY ALERTAccording to the Food Standards Agency, one in every 100,000 people may be allergic to mycoprotein — another reason Greggs is being urged to publish its ingredients list.Dominika Piasecka of The Vegan Society says \u0027the vast majority\u0027 of vegans don\u0027t have a problem with the product, unlike soya or gluten, but Rose Glover says \u0027many find it hard to digest\u0027.\u0027In sensitive iniduals it can cause nausea, bloating, diarrhoea and, in rare cases, a severe allergic reaction,\u0027 she adds.Other symptoms include vomiting, hives and potentially fatal anaphylactic reactions."},{"url":null,"title":"Russell Group university courses providing six hours week face face","story":"    Leding university courses are providing less than six hours a week face-to-face teachingHistory students at Bristol receive an average of five-and-three-quarter hours a week of face-to-face teaching by academics.

The installation looks every bit the modern political campaign headquarters, with bold logo, open-plan office and sessions including “mindfulness” breaks for the staff.“With this piece you either program or you are programmed,” says Lund. “You need to learn how different algorithms can get your attention, or how Instagram is deeply manipulative in its reward system by triggering dopamine.”Lund believes that in the current climate, with the UK poised to leave the EU after a referendum dominated by misinformation and falsehoods, we have a stark choice: either “inform yourself or become a slave to the systems that control us”.“The level of profiling and modelling that Facebook and other data-gathering operations enable I find deeply problematic,” says Lund. “It would make George Orwell turn in his grave because it’s far more dystopian than 1984. How much data have we been tricked to give up? Facebook is the greatest surveillance apparatus ever made.”What about the idea that this is the cultural elite trying to spread its leftist views? “I’d say it’s not that,” he counters. “It’s trying to unmask the mechanisms that are being used and abused by both sides – left and right. Also, if you had a problem with that, wouldn’t you have a problem with the Leave campaign using actual illegal strategies to win a campaign?”The somewhat tongue-in-cheek conceit masks the true aim of Lund’s work, which is to provoke questions about and interrogate the ways the British public was manipulated during the campaign and in the two years since the referendum.“There’s a risk of coming off as arrogant, as the person who is going to fix it all. The defence is, it’s not necessarily about Brexit, it’s about the tools and mechanisms. And these are available to everybody.”As the vote on Theresa May’s Brexit deal approaches next week and the repercussions of the UK’s orce from the EU start to be realised, perhaps there’s no better time to get to grips with the technology that made it possible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be3d7d0ae71c539136b8efeebf7f71732c6eeb5d/0_115_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=205dcae4516b60d7f21abc4aa1b5c784","title":"wales in bid to save banksy mural in port talbot","story":"Artwork prompts influx of visitors as Welsh government hopes to secure its futureIan Lewis was scrolling through Facebook when he saw an image of a new Banksy artwork on a plain garage wall. He thought it looked a bit like his garage – and was shocked when it transpired that it actually was.The arrival of the work has since transformed the Welsh town into a cultural destination, prompting an influx of visitors from as far as Australia and creating a cottage industry in souvenirs devoted to the piece.But soon, Lewis, who built the garage in the 90s to protect his car, said he was having sleepless nights over the popularity of the work. Local concerns began to grow that Lewis could sell it to an out-of-town collector who might whisk it away from Port Talbot.Residents, business people and politicians have come together to campaign to save the piece, with the Welsh government on Friday saying it was paying for security to protect it and was in talks to try to secure its future.The Banksy appeared just before Christmas in Taibach, close to the Tata steelworks. From one angle, it shows a child in a bobble hat with a sled, apparently enjoying a snow shower and trying to catch the flakes on their tongue. But from another, it becomes clear that what is actually falling on the child is a shower of ash.Banksy confirmed the work was his by releasing a video of the mural accompanied by the Christmas song Little Snowflake. The camera rises above the garage and shows Port Talbot’s rooftops and the billowing chimneys of the steelworks and other industrial buildings.Lewis was amazed when visitors began arriving in their droves and realised that he had to find a way of protecting the piece. The community chipped in. A local operatic company paid for it to be protected in plastic and the actor Michael Sheen, who went to college in Port Talbot, stepped in to pay for security.Lewis was feeling the pressure and not talking on Friday, but Bethan Sayed, Plaid Cymru South Wales West assembly member, who had spoken to him, said he wanted it to remain in the town.He told her: “I want it to stay in Port Talbot, to stay in Wales. It’s brought attention to the town and I want to support that. They’re making Banksy mugs, coasters, T-shirts and stuff in the town to sell to the tourists. We’re getting 2,000 people a day visiting the garage, from as far away as Australia. I think someone wants to write a play about it. I can’t keep up with all the messages.”Sayed, who is chair of the culture committee in the Welsh assembly, said the town had had its fair share of challenges – from previous job losses at Tata to anger over plans to build a “super prison” and an ongoing row over plans to close its motorway junction.As the Banksy piece highlights, it also suffers from poor air quality. “The Banksy is very positive for the town. It’s turned into an amazing tourist attraction,” Sayed said. She suggested one solution could be that the piece is sold, loaned back to the town and set up in a more central location where it can be protected.The Welsh government said it was taking over the cost of security and looking for a long-term solution. A spokesperson said: “We support a number of organisations – including the National Museum of Wales – to preserve culturally significant artworks and keep them in Wales for the benefit of current and future generations. We are in discussions to explore what we are able to do to assist.”In the town centre, Faye Morgan and Mary Jones, who had just treated themselves to Banksy souvenirs – images of the work etched on to a piece of plastic – at the indoor shopping centre, agreed it should stay.“He’s captured the place perfectly,” said Jones. “This is a proud town, a hard, industrial place but also somewhere with a sense of humour. I think he’s summed us up brilliantly.” Morgan said: “The most important thing is that it stays here. This is its home. It makes sense here and nowhere else. I think Banksy gave it to the town, not to one person.”There is no doubt Banksy has gripped the imagination in Port Talbot. The poet Derek Davies has written an ode to it: Port Talbot’s got a Banksy. One man, Ricky Langdon, had a tattoo of the artwork on his chest.At Kickstart motorcycles in Taibach, owner Paul Reynolds had put up a “Banksy must stay” poster in his window.“I was born and bred a stone’s throw from it,” he said. “It’s been brilliant for the town. The chip shop ran out of potatoes, the baguette shop out of bread, so many people were visiting. This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance for the town. We have to keep it.”The nature of Banksy’s work means that the long-term future of his pieces often provokes debate and causes upset."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53adbc1a6911f1758f6b3dbe643599aec15b26b1/0_376_1581_948/master/1581.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c4a18edc76807a66a5cd728c46293f1","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from the last two weeks, just a small selection from the bumper crop of end of year lists that you’ve posted over the holiday period. The breadth and depth of reading on display has been most impressive. Plenty of wisdom has also been garnered from those books, as Rick2016 demonstrates:Of the 45 books I read this year (which most people think is a lot but pales in comparison to many of the people in this forest!), the standouts were the following (roughly in order):Vikram Seth - A Suitable BoyRichard Powers - The OverstoryDavid Park - Travelling in a Strange LandGraham Greene - The Quiet AmericanMargaret Atwood - The Handmaid’s TaleJL Carr - A Month in the CountryJohn le Carré - The Spy Who Came in from the ColdSomerset Maugham - Of Human BondageLima Barreto - The Sad End of Policarpo QuaresmaEdward St Aubyn - Never MindTatiana Salem Levy - The House at SmyrnaPenelope Lively - Moon TigerLooking at my reading this year, I learned three things:1. It’s good to make the time to read those long novels that I keep meaning to read. Some, like A Suitable Boy would have been worth it if they had been twice as long.2. Having a perception of an author’s style through hearsay, or even reading only one of their books, isn’t the same as actually reading them properly. Greene, le Carré, Atwood, Dickens and others turned out to be far richer experiences than I expected.3. TLS is an absolute goldmine for recommendations. I knew that already but there are several books that I loved this year that I would never have read if it weren’t for you folks’ advocacy. So thank you so much.Here’s another 2018 summary, from interwar:Putting together my annual list was a great reminder of so many hours well spent. My 20 ‘most rewarding reads’ of 2018 include fiction only, and I’m well aware that some of my choices directly contradict others’ judgements. Note that by ‘most rewarding’ I don’t necessarily mean most enjoyable. Mostly these were books that made me think and stretched my imagination.Four were re-reads:Wilkie Collins, The MoonstoneE M Forster, A Passage to IndiaR K Narayan, The World of NagarajOscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian GrayTen were translations:Shusako Endo, VolcanoWolfgang Hilbig, Old Rendering PlantIsmaiil Kadare, The Traitor’s NicheWalter Kempowski, HomelandLaszlo Krasznahorkai, The World Goes OnAyiyujo Nosaka, The Cake Tree in the RuinsOrhan Pamuk, SnowAhmed Saadawi, Frankenstein in BaghdadJose Saramago, The Elephant’s JourneyMario Vargas Llosa, The StorytellerAnd the rest:Elizabeth Bowen, The Last SeptemberRoland Camberton, Rain on the PavementsGabriel Jiosipovicii, The Cemetery in BarnesPhilip Larkin, A Girl in WinterWilliam Maxwell, The Folded LeafAlex Pheby, LuciaI could have included dozens more lists of similar quality – although. it should also be said that plenty of contributors didn’t catalogue their reading or didn’t read quite such vast numbers of books. One of the great things about TLS is that it takes all sorts – and all are welcome. On that note, I also enjoyed these spy and crime recommendations from beerbart:I got the Xmas present that I wanted, the latest Ben Macintyre The Spy and The Traitor. My love for his work can only continue as this is another top class non-fiction thriller brimming with interesting facts from the late Cold War. However, being hardback, it is far too big on my commute. So I have a Maigret mystery in the bag, Maigret and the Minister which I’m rifling through. I mainly read these for the unique atmosphere Simenon invokes. I also have another part of Deighton’s Samson series on the go via Audio. Spy Hook. I’m not yet in love with this series but I’m too invested in the characters to drop out.Meanwhile, dothebathosphere has already finished their book of 2019: The Faint-hearted Bolshevik by Lorenzo Silva:It’s a “punk” book, the first sentence has the narrator describing his soul being located in his nether regions and it pretty much stays in that register. The narrator seeks revenge on a woman who he ran into the back of at a traffic light. He starts with prank calls and stalking but then sets eyes on the woman’s 15-year-old sister, revenge is off the table the narrator sets his mind to being a “child abuser”. (I use quotes only because he has second thoughts in the course of his lechery before he’s tried anything physical).Well, the book is both repellent and very funny. It’s a cult hit in Spain and astonishingly often recommended to pupils as secondary school reading.Ellie Rose has also just “devoured” Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine by Gail Honeyman:I started reading it on the train, walked around my house reading it, made dinner reading it (the meal suffered slightly, I must admit) and finally finished it about 9pm, feeling like I’d taken a punch to the gut. I found it unbearably sad, but darkly funny too, and sweet and overall very human. As a first read for 2019, it augurs good things for the year, I think!Finally, a challenge from vermontlogger following a “re-re-reading” of Charles Dickens’ Great Expectations:I thought I would just read the first chapter or two. Then of course there was no stopping. No matter how well we know the story, Dickens’ writing is irresistibly vivid and inventive – and is there any other book that can make you laugh and tear up on the same page?I can think of a few government policy documents that have made me feel that way, but that’s maybe not the same thing. Any better suggestions?If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

Another epic political week has passed in off-brand Westeros, a septic isle from which there is no real escape, only a bloodstained booth where Chris Grayling is offering to sell you a ferry ticket.Every few days I change my mind about what I’d pop in the time capsule to explain to future generations just how inspirational this era was. This week, though, the choice could only be Wednesday’s parliamentary exchange between House of Commons Speaker John Bercow and Tory MP Adam Holloway, which I have lightly edited for space reasons.Holloway: “We’ve ALL noticed in recent months a sticker in your car making derogatory comments about Brexit. NO, THIS IS A SERIOUS POINT. HAVE YOU DRIVEN THAT CAR WITH THE STICKER THERE?”Bercow: “THAT sticker, on the subject of Brexit, HAPPENS to be affixed TO – or in the windscreen OF – MY WIFE’S CAR! YES!”Kill me now. And when you’ve done it, consider that exchange as our Statue of Liberty, and bury it in the sand for Charlton Heston to find at some unspecified point in the future. We are maniacs. We blew it.To watch that photon-weight fight, and indeed all the auto-parodic scenes of parliamentary sovereignty this week, is not to wonder how this country ever managed its many past victories and immense cultural and scientific achievements. It is to wonder how, in a very real sense, it has managed to even get its own pants on and leave the house at all for at least a decade.I’ve seen Holloway-Bercow five times now, and I believe it is possible to draw a clear and fairly short line between it and a mad-eyed UK finally deploying Trident to kill the third of British sheep that a Defra paper suggests will need to be slaughtered in the event of no deal, in order to maintain market integrity.Until then, in her latest ironicidal gesture, Theresa May wants Bercow to explain himself. The feeling’s mutual. Indeed, Dominic Grieve’s amendment means that when the prime minister’s withdrawal deal is voted down next week, May will have to come to the house to explain her so-called plan B within three working days. I assumed that was about a year in parliamentary time, but it turns out it’s actually the following Monday. However, No 10 says the plan B debate will only be allocated 90 minutes, which feels quite a symbolic stretch of time.It’s difficult to decide on the precise football match to which it will be analogous. But there was a lower league Nigerian game in 2013 in which Akurba FC lost 79-0 to Plateau United Feeders. Seventy-two of those goals were scored in the second half, in case that affects any plan to bring on Grayling at some point.As for the specific details of May’s plan B, it is believed to be a variety of tinned goods and the contact details for Ray Mears. It’s her bad deal or no deal, kids – and no deal is no longer better than a bad deal, even if she told you for way more than a year that it was. Given how well that strategy went, it’s intriguing that May should have spent this week veering between suggesting that no deal was more likely, and suggesting that no Brexit was more likely. She’s good cop AND bad cop. Playing more than one character in a movie is fairly excruciating when Eddie Murphy does it when a performer of the calibre of May attempts it, it is less watchable than gamma rays.As for her conviction that now is the moment to reach out to Labour leavers, a cool 19 months after her Darwin award-winning election, it is once again only possible to rationalise if you realise that the prime minister has been experiencing reality on a massive tape delay. On these calculations, May will wait until February 2020 to wish the England squad good luck as they head to Russia to kick off their World Cup campaign. For now, she remains the comic character pointing the gun at their own head and warning: “one false move and I’ll shoot” – even as the timer she so foolishly set clicks down to zero.Amid such desperately chaotic scenes, suggestions of a temporary “national unity administration” prompt an involuntary laugh. These feel like suggesting that Mordor might benefit from a couple of months of technocratic government. I suppose so. But things are quite … far gone down there, now? As for that self-styled Frodo, David Cameron, we are still unable to quantify how wrong his plan to destroy the ring has gone, other than to say the Shire is now primarily a vast Orc brothel.In the end, you only needed to watch the news for 15 seconds this week to surmise that most of our political class is not up to the job, and hasn’t been for years. In fact, the very calling of the referendum was an admission of that. We live in a representative democracy. Though it may have been subconscious for Cameron, if he’d been a politician capable of finessing the internal Tory politics of the situation, he wouldn’t have thrown the entire question open to the floor.But he did. He took what he thought would be an easy shortcut to an easy life, and we will all be living with the difficult, long-term implications of it for so many years to come. Cameron remains cocooned in his 25-grand shed, apparently still working on his memoir. What can you say? Other than: would you like me to come over and help you with the ending, dear? Failing that, I hear there’s a winter caretaker job going in a Colorado Rockies hotel – perhaps you’d consider applying and trying to finish it there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9e57c14fe0136db232b01e1e5f54784fc690d63/1_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24cb992b75a791de1735760aab2bb4ec","title":"john finnis oxford university academic freedom law","story":"This isn’t a question of ‘academic freedom’. The law professor’s writings dehumanise many of his studentsThis week, along with other students, we started a petition to stop Professor John Finnis teaching at Oxford University. As anticipated, the petition has been criticised on the grounds that its proposals would undermine academic and – though Finnis himself says his views are “strictly philosophical” – religious freedom. We were called “snowflake” students who were simply incapable of arguing against opposing views. We believe these criticisms miss the point.Here are some of the reasons for the petition: in a 1995 paper Finnis sets out that the judgment that homosexual conduct is “evil” can be defended. He draws an analogy between the “copulation of humans with animals” and homosexuality. In a 2011 article, he laments restrictions on the discussion of “the reversibility of sexual orientation or the relation if any between sexual orientation and child-abuse”.We’re not incapable of arguing against these views they are poorly reasoned and incoherent. Instead, our argument is that students should not encounter them from their teachers. Our petition argues that we should draw a line when professors dehumanise disadvantaged groups. Apparently, some critics think that this is too radical.Some accept that Finnis’s views are discriminatory. However, they argue that they are nevertheless protected by “academic freedom”. This response is simplistic. Rather than reciting cliches these critics would do better to explain what academic freedom is and what its limits should be.We think the petition sets a reasonable limit. Academic freedom is not best judged in the abstract. It is about students and staff. It is about power dynamics and systems of disadvantage that affect the quality of that freedom in the real world. By teaching at Oxford, Finnis comes into contact with students and staff who are part of the groups he dehumanises. If a professor who is known for the above argument concerning homosexuality and evil teaches a seminar, it’s not ridiculous to suggest that LGBTQ+ students may be intimidated, stop contributing and learn less effectively.At this point, “academic freedom” seems to be a label that some academics use when they don’t want to address these underlying issues. Glossing over them – by labelling counter-positions “ludicrous” and “preposterous”, as some professors have labelled our petition – shuts down discussion in exactly the way that critics allege “snowflake” students do.What about the argument that even if Finnis’s views are discriminatory, they are permissible because he hasn’t said them to particular gay students in his seminars (as far as we know)? We think this misunderstands the nature of discrimination. When Finnis writes or talks about homosexuality and evil, or draws comparisons with bestiality, he is targeting LGBTQ+ students and staff. When Finnis is writing about a group, he is necessarily writing about its constituent members. Now, we accept that harassment can encompass more direct forms of discrimination, those arising in smaller scale, person-to-person interactions. But it does not follow from this that Finnis’s discrimination should be permitted because it takes place on a larger scale. We do not accept that more generalised (and more public) forms of discrimination do less damage.The desire that discrimination be understood more accurately is what drives our call for policy change. We have seen academics defend Finnis online, in part, by appealing to how kind and gracious a person he is. Oxford University, meanwhile, responded that “vigorous academic debate does not amount to harassment when conducted respectfully and without violating the dignity of others”. Let’s clarify this.In a seminar, if Finnis were to call being gay “evil” or liken it to bestiality, would that be done respectfully and without violating gay students’ dignity? The obvious answer is no. What about if Finnis says it politely and in suitably intellectual language – would it then be OK? We think the answer is still no. Those who argue otherwise seem to care more about the way people say things than the content of what they say. Such “respectability” arguments allow academics to hide behind intellectual language. If an employee at your local shop can be sacked for using discriminatory slurs, why should academics be able to get away with it because they use longer words?The final objection to the petition is made on the grounds of religious freedom. This raises questions about how universities should address the promotion of religious views that say LGBTQ+ people are morally bad or inferior. We think religious ersity is essential to academia. We also think that religion shouldn’t be used as an excuse to call LGBTQ+ people “evil” or suggest that it is “destructive”.

His claim in history was to be Britain’s first Wimbledon men’s singles champion in many decades, a feat he achieved in 2013 and 2016. He won two Olympic golds and is the only person to have been voted BBC Sports Personality of the Year three times. He was also the first British tennis player to be knighted. But these achievements, remarkable as they are, don’t make him a revolutionary.Three things make him a man who really shifted the dial. The first is the way he changed how he himself was seen. When he first came to notice, Mr Murray was a gifted but introverted player who found it hard to win over the public. His outsider’s awkwardness was often contrasted with the establishment entitlement of his predecessor as British number one, Tim Henman. Mr Murray was Scottish and had not risen through the system, training in France. “Tory Tim”, as some commentators dubbed him, was blazered and southern – and rose through the very traditional Lawn Tennis Association.Mr Murray didn’t try to reinvent himself. Instead he became a champion by doing it his own way. He made himself stronger and fitter, and honed his backhand into a lethal weapon. He began winning, which was a welcome change for a victory-starved British tennis public whose annual hapless shout – once dubbed the three most depressing words in the English language – was “Come on, Tim”. He took over because he was better and more ruthless, but without compromising his less privileged background, his Scottishness or his determination to succeed on his own terms. Nationalists like Alex Salmond were desperate to have his backing for independence in 2014, a tribute to his status. But after victories Mr Murray has draped himself in both the saltire and the union jack.Mr Murray didn’t just change his image. He also changed his attitudes. As he developed as a player, so he developed as a human being. He allowed his emotions to show more, as he did again with the media this week. He urged men to open up about depression. He admitted that fatherhood made tennis seem less important. He discovered an eloquence with words as well as with the racket.Above all, he has reflexively treated women as equals. His mother shaped his early training. Later he appointed Amélie Mauresmo as his coach. He supported equal prize money. He criticised Wimbledon for not scheduling enough women’s matches on show courts. All this was done with great ease and naturalness. “Your voice for equality will inspire future generations,” said Billie Jean King on Friday in a tribute. “You always fight in our corner,” tweeted Heather Watson. “Have I become a feminist?” Mr Murray wrote recently. “Well, if being a feminist is about fighting so that a woman is treated like a man then yes, I suppose I have.”Finally, Mr Murray changed British tennis. Before him, tennis in Britain was mostly played and run by posh people. Even the great Fred Perry – triple Wimbledon champion in the 1930s (and son of a Labour MP) – was kept at a distance by the LTA most of his life. Mr Murray may struggle, on his own, to reverse the calamitous decline in tennis facilities in the state school sector. But what a platform he now has. And at least his successors – the current British number one Kyle Edmund, for example – are no longer likely to end up as plucky losers in the first week of championships. For that, they will thank the determined young man from Dunblane who, for many of us, is the best British sports star of our era."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83c369a4661a25881bab6a1cab008a45fcf74205/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4c08b8a3c1ce3561650256e2830d959","title":"the guardian view on universal credit flawed calculations","story":"The four single working mothers who took the government to court over the way that universal credit payments are calculated should be applauded. That two high court judges have ruled in their favour is further evidence of flawed judgment at the Department for Work and Pensions. Ministers must now decide whether to appeal, or make a new set of adjustments to the stuttering benefits system, as they prepare for a scaled-back roll-out in July.The problem at the heart of these women’s case was the automated assessment of monthly income. Because of accidents of the calendar, such as paydays falling on weekends, in some months they were paid twice, and in others not at all. The effect was wildly fluctuating payments and lost allowances, leading in one case to a woman giving up work. While the details are technical, the lesson is straightforward. Their example is just the latest in a long series of illustrations of how universal credit’s design fails to match the lives and needs of real people.Secretary of state Amber Rudd, who took up the post after Esther McVey’s resignation in November, is the fifth work and pensions secretary since 2016, when the scheme’s architect, Iain Duncan Smith, resigned in a row with the Treasury over cuts. She has already gone further than her predecessors in admitting to difficulties. She knows that migrating existing benefits claimants over to the new system is going to be very painful, which is why she announced on Friday that she has decided to hold off until the arrangements have been tested on a sample group of 10,000 people. She also said the freeze on working-age benefits should be lifted next year. The two-child limit on the tax credit element of the benefit will now only apply to children born after the cap was announced, while efforts will be made to ensure that payments are made to a family’s main carer, usually a woman, following concerns that abusive partners could use the family budget as a means of coercive control. A mechanism will be looked for to pay rent to landlords directly, as under the previous housing benefit regime.Last year’s scathing National Audit Office report laid waste the case the government has made for universal credit, yet also warned that, so far down the road, it would be too complex and too expensive to stop. Outstanding problems include the inflexibility of the computerised system, and wishful thinking with regard to the level and kind of support that is needed by people facing an upheaval in their circumstances which they didn’t ask for, and may not be able to manage. The very least that this ill-conceived and faltering project needed, after Mr Duncan Smith left, was someone else to own it. Instead, there have been repeated changes of cast. Ms Rudd, two months into her new job, has at least acknowledged problems. But the changes she has so far announced, though welcome, are utterly inadequate.

Last year saw the third successive annual increase, which ministers acknowledge is a concern, though they point out the numbers are still far fewer than the peak 10 years ago.Education secretary Damian Hinds is due to appear before the education select committee next week when he is expected to be quizzed about rising exclusion rates, ahead of the publication of the government’s review into school exclusion, chaired by Edward Timpson, which is expected in the next few weeks.According to Gill, the most vulnerable children with the most complex needs are disproportionately affected by exclusion, and London has large numbers of them.“Exclusion is correlated with multiple and overlapping layers of disadvantage,” she said. “Growing up in a low-income household, but also having other strains on a child outside of the school gates, like criminal exploitation, grooming and gangs. We know that’s a particular problem in London at the moment.”With mounting concern about the increase in knife crime in the capital, there have been reports that some gangs are giving knives to pupils in order to get them excluded, thereby making those children more vulnerable to gang pressures.“I don’t think it’s fair to say that London has some of the least inclusive schools, but I do think in some local authorities where PRU and AP populations are high but quality is low, we need to seriously prioritise both improving AP quality and reducing school exclusion.”Gill’s new charity will launch a Teach First-style fast-track career programme on Saturday, inviting applications from top quality teachers to train for leadership roles in the sector serving excluded pupils. Successful candidates will spend two years in some of the capital’s best schools for excluded pupils, returning to mainstream with new skills to support vulnerable pupils and reduce exclusions.Sir Tim Brighouse, architect of the London Challenge, will be among those speaking at the launch. “The greatest challenge facing schools is the pandemic in mental ill health among young people,” he said.“The Difference leaders’ programme will create a new generation of school leaders with skills to support the city’s most vulnerable learners, and to reduce school exclusion.”The Department for Education said since 2010 it had taken decisive action to empower teachers to tackle poor behaviour in schools. “Permanently excluding a child from school should only ever be a last resort, but it is wrong to assume that all children in pupil referral units and alternative provision have been excluded from other schools,” a spokesman said.“The department firmly believes that all children, regardless of the setting, should receive a good education and that is why we have committed to reforming alternative provision. We have already made progress and have launched a £4m AP innovation fund which is delivering projects to improve outcomes for children in alternative provision.”Dré Clinton-Barnes, 15, was just 23 minutes into his introductory day at Mossbourne Community Academy in Hackney when he fell out with a teacher and was asked to leave. It was an inauspicious start.He and his mother met with staff the following day and Dré returned to classes, but his school career at the celebrated London academy was beset by detentions and isolations. “I talk a lot. I like to have the last word all the time.”His home life was complex, with periods in foster care. He kept running away and ended up being placed in a care home in Ashford in Kent where he cried himself to sleep every night for two weeks. “After that it was calm.”Dré was home-schooled, then got a place at a local secondary school which lost patience with him when he got into a fight. After he was robbed at knife-point, his mother brought him back to London where he struggled to find a school that would accept him.He is now a student at Wac Arts college in Camden, north London – an alternative provision free school for 14- to 19-year-olds, specialising in creative arts and media – and is thriving.“The schools I’ve been to don’t really have patience,” said Dré. “They have a thousand other kids to deal with.” He doesn’t blame them. “I was distracting the class,” he said. In any case things have ended up well.“I live by a philosophy – everything happens for a reason. Here it’s nice. They have more time for students because there’s less students here and teachers explain the work more.”Giulianna Barbosa, 15, has had a similarly disrupted education. She comes from a complex background and has dyslexia. She went to four different primary schools and her time in mainstream secondary school was spent mainly in isolation.“My family says that trouble finds me. I come out of class and there’s a fight. I’m the one that gets isolation for it and I’ve got nothing to do with it,” she said. “I had big arguments with teachers. I kept on being accused of stuff that was nothing to do with me.”Like Dré, Giulianna was never permanently excluded but was the subject of a managed move to Wac Arts college, which suits her interest in creative arts and provides a more flexible approach than mainstream.College principal James Fornara says the rise in exclusions is directly linked to the way schools are now measured through school league tables, which means teachers are under pressure to focus on tests and getting pupils through qualifications. “Young people like Dré and Giulianna who have complicated and challenging lives can’t fit into those boxes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/239181261ca47e51d2da90d2c87621d2aad5ca87/0_1540_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=790e61ce079e2f8f3338c8e5b24b7240","title":"horror scene the man who found the sidmouth fatberg","story":"Charlie Ewart discovered the 64-metre lump and will be part of the team breaking it up Charlie Ewart, a 51-year-old father of two from Plymouth, has been battling blockages in the sewers of south-west England for 15 years.But even he was not prepared for the dreadful sight, and smell, of what he found lurking beneath the elegant seafront in the regency town of Sidmouth when he scrambled through a small manhole.“I saw it and thought: ‘What on earth?’ It was completely unexpected,” Ewart said. “It’s really eerie in that bit of the sewer and it does look like something out of a horror scene, all congealed and glossy and matted together with all kinds of things.”Happily for Ewart, it was not a monster risen from the depths or from outer space but rather a fatberg – a mass of congealed oils, grease wet wipes and other nasties measuring the size of six double-decker buses.Sidmouth’s fatberg, which has been gathering beneath beneath the Esplanade for years, has provoked interest around the world. Visitors have arrived in Sidmouth to examine the spot and try to pick up a whiff. South West Water is opening a pop-up shop to explain what is happening and warn people of the dangers of dropping things they shouldn’t down the toilet and sink.Meanwhile, Ewart and his hardy colleagues have the job of getting rid of the 64-metre-long object.“The sewer will be active while we carry out the removal, so depending on the flows, we could be wading through a lot of muck,” said Ewart.“We are going to be using small shovels and something called a mattock – this is like a lighter version of a pickaxe so we won’t tire as quickly. We also have special high-pressure sewer jetting equipment and something to suck it out in bits.“I think this fatberg is going to be soft on the outside but hard in the middle. I’m not too sure what is within it yet, there’s a lot of wet wipes and sanitary wrappers, but I’ve tried not to look at it too closely yet, especially as I’m going to be staring at it for eight weeks.”The team will have to wear breathing apparatus when they are underground. The smell is not pleasant, a heady combination of rotting meat mixed with the odour of an unclean toilet. Yet despite admitting to having a phobia of rats, Ewart said he was relishing the challenge.“It’s not a job for everyone but I take a huge amount of pride in what I do. People don’t think about it when they put things down the loo or sink, but someone has to deal with the consequences.”The tale of the Sidmouth fatberg provides an insight into the changing nature, good as well as bad, of the UK’s attitude to sewage – and the nation’s toilet habits.It nestles in what was a large holding tank built in Victorian or regency times. In those days, the town’s raw sewage would be held in the tank and simply released on an outgoing tide. After the privatisation of the water industry in 1989, South West Water introduced its £1.5bn Clean Sweep programme designed to improve the quality of sea water for bathers.As part of the project, a large pumping station was built at the end of the Esplanade. Sewage now flows through the holding tank where the fatberg resides and is pumped up to a treatment works inland at Sidford. After being treated it is piped back down to the sea and treated effluent is discharged into an offshore outfall. It is now safe and enjoyable to bathe off Sidmouth.So far, so good. But in recent years some people have begun to put more and more objects down the toilet and continued to pour oil and fat down the sink.South West Water’s director of wastewater, Andrew Roantree, said the industry had become accustomed to dealing with condoms, nappies and sanitary products. But then came the wet wipe.“The proliferation of wet wipe-type products has started to generate a real problem,” said Roantree. “The wet wipes tend to create a matrix that all these other things get caught up in.” In a kind of snowball effect, the wet wipes congeal with fats, oil and grease, gradually forming a hard mass.But why did nobody notice the Sidmouth monster forming? For a start, the network is huge – South West Water looks after more than 10,000 miles of sewer pipes. And the size of the tank under the Esplanade, up to three metres high in places and as wide as the street, meant that sewage and discharged water was not blocked by its mass. The waste carried on reaching the pumping station at the end of the Esplanade and no alarm bells were sounded.The fatberg is estimated to have had two years to develop before Ewart found it, close to the yacht club and RNLI lifeboat station. Its removal is expected to cost £100,000 and some south-west residents have questioned why they should have to pay for a Sidmouth problem.But Roantree said the company spends about £5m a year on clearing blockages of all shapes and sizes from across its region. “We have 8,500 blockages a year. It happens right across our region.”South West Water is keen to get over the message that only the “three Ps” – poo, pee and paper – should end up in a toilet.The last word should surely go to the heroic finder and, hopefully, vanquisher, of the fatberg.“I’m married and have two girls,” he said. “I have made sure to educate my family on what they put down the loo and sink. My elder daughter loves makeup, but she knows not to put wipes of any kind down the toilet.“We even use cheap toilet roll, which goes down the loo much easier than the thicker stuff. When you see the consequences like I do, you make sure to do all you can, even if it’s just so you don’t block up your own pipes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a38a97eb7e6bdd31f9bd304ce1a54638655c7f59/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d5ef15384b6ec7801e96f72b1c1ba34","title":"frozen history climate change greenland ice sheet in pictures","story":"Buried deep under the Greenland ice sheet is a unique archive of life on Earth 40,000 years ago.

It’s too bad for moraleThe trickiest dress code to get right isn’t smart-casual, it’s smart-cold. Smart-cold doesn’t get printed in invitations, but it is an unspoken dress code with which you will almost certainly have to grapple over the next two months. One can’t neglect standards just because the mercury dips. It’s too bad for morale.It goes without saying that keeping warm is the most important issue here smart-cold is never about shivering or wearing fewer clothes. But if you abandon all sartorial coordinates and dress only for warmth, piling on random layers and hats and scarves and gloves, you end up lumpy and bundled and chaotic.

There is plenty of gloom and darkness at this time of year. Black can be chic, but when dark scarves and coats and boots are layered together, the overall effect becomes unhelpfully apocalyptic.

In 2009, seven-year-old Sasha in a flamingo pink coat with coral scarf and gloves nailed smart-cold from the off. Can you do it? Yes, you can.

And Politico tweeted: “How does Elizabeth Warren avoid a Clinton redux – written off as too unlikable before her campaign gets off the ground?” And so on.Ironically, in 2016, Warren was perceived as “infinitely more likable than Hillary”. But now she has thrown her hat into the ring, commentators are lining up to remind us how uncomfortable they are with powerful women, and also how uncomfortable they are with admitting it – since their doubts are invariably couched in terms such as “there have been questions about …” In other words: “Many people say …”It got me wondering about what makes a character in the movies likable or unlikable. After all, an entire screenwriting manual, Save the Cat by Blake Snyder, is named after “the scene where we meet the hero and the hero does something – like saving a cat – that defines who he is and makes us, the audience, like him”. And no, I don’t think Lt Ellen Ripley would be nearly as popular a character if she had left Jones behind in the Nostromo to get blown up. But on GamesRadar’s list of 50 Most Likable Movie Characters, only seven are women, and of those seven, only Fargo’s Marge Gunderson strikes me as a genuinely likable person, as opposed to irritant, doormat or nanny. Yes, Mary Poppins has many fine qualities, but being likable isn’t one of them.Recently, we have been seeing a new wave of unlikable female protagonists. It kicked off with 2016’s highly isive Nocturnal Animals, starring Amy Adams as a character who was “not easily likable”, in the words of film critic Barry Wurst. And not everyone, it turns out, is a fan of Yorgos Lanthimos’s The Favourite. Sure enough, reasons given include (and I didn’t have to dig deep for these examples) “Not liking any of the characters” “wholly unlikable female characters” and “everyone in this film is a varying shade of unlikable”.Yet I would contend that The Favourite’s three leading characters are likable – in small and volatile doses. None of them saves a cat, but we start off by automatically siding with Abigail (Emma Stone) because she is an underdog, and, from Oliver Twist to The Karate Kid to Harry Potter, we have learned to root for underdogs. Abigail’s likability is only confirmed when palace servants (with whom she is billeted) play a vile trick on her – we’re used to sympathising with victims. We are on safe ground here: Abigail is shaping up to be a traditional heroine. And we like her even more as she finds cunning ways to insinuate herself into the queen’s favours, because, from Elizabeth Bennett to Jo March to Hermione Granger, we are accustomed to siding with heroines who are clever.Yet that cleverness eventually curdles, until we are faced with the possibility that Abigail may not be so likable after all. Similarly, Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz) veers between likability (she seems genuinely fond of the Queen) and steely-eyed ambition – a quality perceived as anything but likable in a woman, as Clinton and Warren have discovered.Even Queen Anne (Olivia Colman), initially depicted as capricious, self-absorbed and ridiculous, is shown to have suffered devastating heartbreak – and just like that, we find ourselves liking her more. In the end, much of The Favourite’s deliciousness as an entertainment stems from our emotional allegiances being tugged this way and that by women who are not simply good or evil but flawed, multifaceted human beings. Just like real people.If you think Abigail, Anne and Sarah are unlikable, get a load of Erin Bell in Karyn Kusama’s Destroyer. Our first view of Bell is pink-rimmed bloodshot eyes squinting out of sun-damaged skin. She is a Los Angeles detective ravaged by alcohol, cigarettes and traumatic memories of an undercover assignment gone horribly wrong, and Nicole Kidman plays her with the sort of fearlessness (and help from makeup designer Bill Corso) that makes her Oscar-winning fake nose for The Hours look like a party trick. The days of Jane Fonda being able to pass as an alcoholic in The Morning After (1986) just by mussing her hair are long gone. “You look terrible,” says a colleague of Erin’s, and so she does. And Kidman’s transformation is more than just grandstanding – her ruined face reflects her character’s story.In Destroyer, Kidman sacrifices one of the strongest weapons in a film star’s arsenal – her good looks (deemed more essential for actresses than actors), and with it a shortcut to securing our sympathies. According to innumerable studies, including this 2011 Harvard-related one, we are conditioned to see beautiful people as more likable and for every Hunchback of Notre Dame or Small Soldiers (1998), making your good guys ugly still amounts to a subversive act. Still, we think, Bell may look like a wreck, but surely she will win us over with her caustic wit, or by saving a cat? Nope. The kindest thing she does is give a handjob to a terminally ill man, and even then it is not an act of charity but a peculiarly sordid way of wringing a name out of him.While Melissa McCarthy isn’t as conventionally glam as Kidman, she brushes up nicely for chatshows and red carpets. So it is a little disconcerting to see her in a dowdy wig and unflattering specs in Can You Ever Forgive Me? She plays the real-life writer Lee Israel, whose career had slumped so much by 1992 that she began to support herself by forging literary letters and selling them to dealers. Even before the opening credits are over, this prickly, self-pitying alcoholic has already told a work colleague to “fuck off”, and stolen an overcoat and two rolls of toilet paper at her agent’s party.While Israel doesn’t save a cat, she does share her apartment with one her criminal career is launched when the animal gets sick and she needs money to pay the vet. This definitely makes her more relatable, and it is hard not to sneakily admire her refusal to clean up her act and play the literary game (unlike Tom Clancy, whom she dismisses as a “jackass”). McCarthy makes us feel for her without softening her anti-social abrasiveness, but likable? Hell, no.Like Destroyer, Can You Ever Forgive Me? was directed by a woman – Marielle Heller. “Lee was flawed and complicated and fascinating,” Heller told Variety. “If she were a male character, nobody would bat an eye, but because she’s female, it feels radical.” The screenplay was co-written by Nicole Holofcener, while The Favourite was co-written by Deborah Davis. Many people say (see what I did there?) that one result of getting women’s voices out there, making more movies, means that audiences will get used to seeing female characters who are less likable, more human. And who knows?

This will forever be a fixture haunted by memories of the bitter rivalry between Don Revie and Brian Clough and revived some of the dirty tricks detailed in David Peace’s The Damned United.Earlier in the day Derby announced that police had been called to their training ground on Thursday following reports of a man equipped with binoculars, wire cutters and camouflage clothing hovering suspiciously on its boundaries.Bielsa admitted he had sent a member of his backroom staff to spy on Lampard’s preparations, revealing it was a ploy he had deployed ever since his days in charge of Argentina and Chile.Unimpressed, Lampard indicated that he believed it was no coincidence that, shortly before his side lost 4-1 to Leeds at home earlier in the season, a man was spotted lurking in the bushes beside their training complex.“I don’t think that, at any level of sport, it’s right to send men to break into private property,” said Derby’s manager afterwards. “It’s a cultural thing but I was very surprised by it – and by the frank admission he’s done it before. Cheating is a big word but this is over the line. I spent 15 hours watching tapes of Leeds game this week and that’s what the best managers do. I was a fan of Bielsa’s from afar but I’d rather not coach than send people undercover on their hands and knees in the undergrowth.”If MI6 are unlikely to be poaching the “agent” Bielsa dispatched to Derby any time soon, it rather begs the question as to how many other Championship rivals have been spied on since August?Not that Lampard’s defence could use such dubious tactics as an excuse. That quartet should have conceded a penalty following Andre Wisdom’s foul on Ezgjan Alioski but, although the referee pointed to the spot, a linesman had already flagged – controversially – for an offside against Alioski.It was, though, merely a stay of execution. When Scott Carson could only punch Pablo Hernández’s corner towards Jack Clarke, the latter proceeded to sweep beyond Craig Bryson and deliver a superb right-wing cross. It found Roofe in the right place at the right time to lash a first-time volley home.Lampard stared at the ground. His players could barely get out of their own half and frequently seemed overwhelmed by the relentless tempo of Leeds’ high pressing game. At times it was easy to imagine that Bielsa’s team had a couple of extra players on the pitch.Derby were failing to work out the home side’s highly fluid formation – one minute 4-1-4-1 and 3-3-3-1 the next – and kaleidoscopic, opponent perplexing, positional rotation. Alioski not only alternated between left-back and midfield but occasionally centre forward too.His side doubled their advantage at the outset of the second half. Once again Clarke provoked panic on the right and, once again, Carson made less than perfect contact as he misread his looping cross. The goalkeeper’s weak punch travelled only as far as Alioski who played it back in for Harrison to score from close range.Spy-gate may be boiling up but Leeds show few signs of burning out. “I would accept any sanction the club or federation make against me,” said an unrepentant Bielsa. “I respect the morals of the country where I work but I won’t say I won’t do it again. I don’t think I’m a person that cheats. I have done this practice for many years. It’s legal in South America – and England, too, but it doesn’t provoke indignation in South America.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45ccb9e20ecdab57671159f625bf51894eac0b97/0_190_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c6e7363c927b96a6b0f5d53b005880c","title":"tell us who do you share your home with","story":"As part of a new series in the ’s Weekend magazine we are looking for interesting pairs who live togetherWe’re looking for unusual partnerships – two people who live together in a way that shows the changing nature of the traditional household – for our new series that seeks to reflect how the place we call home can now include extended family, friends and even strangers.In the first piece in a series talking to pairs of people who live together we met the McPhersons, a grandmother and grandson living together who tell us their story.

Like Nike, So We Flow’s clothes favour earthy tones, such as “olive” and “grit”.Brogawear – as the yoga branch of sportswear is commonly known – is also creeping into fashion, designed to be worn on and off the mat. So We Flow combines “the understated aesthetic of British workwear with a purpose firmly committed to movement and utility”.Will Wheeler, the founder of Level Six yoga studio in Peckham, south London, said: “We are definitely seeing an uptick in the number of men joining our classes. There’s a rise in yoga as a stretchy complement to high-intensity workouts. A class can be just as sweaty as gym training.”The “physical and mental benefits” of yoga have also been cited by the men’s yoga clothing brand Ohmme. Its yoga vests and dharma pants (soft and loose but with slim-fit ankles) challenge “preconceived ideas of masculinity”. It is perhaps this that is the driving force behind the male uptake in yoga after all, a gendered New Year resolution hardly feels very 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44375a65f889654ebd5419b4b067384873d9c9ee/0_42_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad9cb80143b1d74f67f2866e2bde1724","title":"fiona bruce proves safe hands with national treasure question time","story":"The presenter’s sharp interventions impressed critics and audiences“Welcome to all of you here, and of course all of you at home. It’s lovely to be here.” And with that, and a knowing smile to the camera, Fiona Bruce swept away 25 years of David Dimbleby’s Question Time and claimed the nation’s highest-profile political programme absolutely as her own.Bruce had confessed to feeling uncharacteristically apprehensive before her debut on the BBC One programme on Thursday night, chairing a panel that comprised the Conservative deputy chairman, James Cleverly, the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, columnist Melanie Phillips, comedian Nish Kumar and Jo Swinson, the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats.But she gave no hint of nerves during a performance that won widespread praise for her “millpond calm” but “focused, thorough, journalistic approach” (The Times) and “calmness, clarity and dry wit” (Daily ).On social media, too, there was widespread appreciation. “Ooh ... I like her. She’s keeping them on track to answer,” tweeted businesswoman Deborah Meaden. “Fiona Bruce is doing an amazing job on Question Time, bravo,” said Jonathan Ross. And from the actor Sanjeev Kohli: “Fiona Bruce REALLY needs to bring this fire \u0026amp sarcasm to the owners of antique forks. Outstanding performance.”There were sharp interventions (telling Thornberry the audience were laughing at her as she outlined Labour policy) and quotable quotes (to Cleverly: “If this is the government being in control, what does out of control look like?”) and even a viral-worthy hashtag when Twitter users responded enthusiastically to a #ladyinyellow outlining why she did not feel sorry for Theresa May.A sigh of relief, then, for BBC bosses: the safe hands Bruce brings to the dusty relics featured on Antiques Roadshow had proved no less assured when handling this particular national treasure.The view was shared by Caroline Lucas MP, who was a guest on Dimbleby’s final episode in December and knows well the lurching feeling as the opening credits roll (“It’s when you hear the music. It’s the most terrifying thing you ever do, and many politicians will say the same thing”).“What I liked about Fiona Bruce was that she had a quiet authority,” says Lucas. “She was able to keep order and assert herself as necessary, but she did it in quite a light-touch way. She wasn’t letting anyone get away with anything, but it didn’t feel obtrusive, it was just helpful. Politicians, when they go on that programme, need to be held to account, and I think she did it very well.”Was it significant that Bruce is the first female presenter in 40 years? “These panel programmes where women in the past have been marginalised, it’s so good to see a majority of women and a female chair. But I don’t think there was anything gender specific about the way she was conducting it.”“I don’t know if it was because it was the first one, but I thought everybody just behaved a bit better she didn’t let people get away with the normal shenanigans where the strongest voice and the most confident person can trot out soundbite after soundbite.”For a programme that pulls in around 2 million viewers and finishes close to midnight, Question Time retains a curious place in the national consciousness – disliked by many as an angry bear pit, but still, even after almost 1,400 editions, appointment-to-view television for many. “It’s a programme people love to hate, don’t they?” says Lucas. “Even the people who hate it watch it so they can say they hate it.”It is also one of the few occasions where ordinary people can regularly challenge those in power on their performance, “and surely our goal should be to make that normal again,” notes Polly Mackenzie, the chief executive of the thinktank Demos, who has also appeared on the panel. “I like Question Time. If it was the sum total of all political accountability in our national life, it would obviously be a disaster, but it’s just a show.”As for having a woman in charge after four decades, “it’s great,” says Mackenzie. “But what would be really brilliant would be for it to be unremarkable.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d418a17c78118ef9f4a99317572841cf5c1b975b/23_0_6432_3859/master/6432.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a02cf337cfeb90932db78ba176011050","title":"guardian to be first national newspaper with biodegradable wrapping","story":"The change aims to reduce plastic waste, following readers’ feedback’s print edition will no longer be sold in plastic packaging, becoming the first national newspaper to switch to biodegradable wrapping.The Saturday edition of the paper contains a large number of supplements which are currently packaged in polythene to meet the demands of retailers and ensure they reach readers.From this weekend, the Weekend magazine, the Guide, Feast, and Review will instead be wrapped in a material based on potato starch, which readers are encouraged to compost or put in their food waste recycling bin.

Whether you’re a teacher, student, academic, social worker, policymaker, parent, and wherever you are in the world, we want to hear from you.Alex Beard, author of Natural Born Learners, and one of our panellists for this podcast, says:“Most schools today are not teaching kids how to learn. We lack a common understanding of what education is and what purpose it serves. We set national targets and arrange institutions and organise people so that they can deliver on those targets. This managerial thinking has been around for 100 years. But by standardising things in this way across classrooms, you undermine the efforts of educators.”In an increasingly interdependent world, it’s vital that we strive to understand not just what it is that makes other societies tick, but how others – be they British, Japanese, German or Argentinian – endeavour to solve the same problems that we all share. In this month’s podcast, we will be focusing on the issue of education, and how we as a global community can improve standards of education for children of all nationalities, genders, ethnicities and economic backgrounds.What are the techniques and methods we can all use to reform education models? How far are they needed, and how far can they stretch? Wendy Kopp explains the extent of the issue in her article ‘It’ll take a village to reform global education’:“More than 60 percent of primary school children in low- and middle- income countries do not reach a minimum proficiency in reading and math. We’re even further from ensuring the world’s children gain the competencies and dispositions necessary to shape a better future for themselves and all of us.”One thing is clear: the learning crisis is severe. But the conversation on education still needs to shift towards an understanding that this is a crisis that needs fixing – we know where we want to get to, but we don’t yet know how to get there. Of course, what works in one country might not work entirely in another, but recognising that there are other ways to do things might be a good place to start.What are the common issues we all face? What approaches have you seen implemented, or helped to implement, and what beneficial changes have been brought about in the systems you work in?On a macro level, should we be trying new methods to engage leaders? Are there aspects of schools and teaching that you believe are outdated? Are there any good alternatives to excessive tests and exams? How can we plan long term or indeed collaboratively within education? How can we better prepare our children for life in the modern world? How can we incentivise more people to teach, and have the space to adopt more creative techniques in their teaching? Looking more locally, what can communities do to change how schools are run in their area – to create a level playing field for children and improve access for those from poorer backgrounds?As Beard eloquently puts it: “In general, I think people don’t fundamentally understand what it means to learn – and to teach. Most policymakers don’t, and I certainly don’t think that people outside of education really do. Our society imagines that teaching means standing at the front of a classroom and talking about ideas. If we want to begin to create a better system, we all need a much deeper understanding of the nature of learning: the science of learning.”To contribute, you can fill in our encrypted form below.

Parliament may have broken with tradition to sit on a Friday to debate the EU withdrawal bill but MPs weren’t going to let that spoil their weekend. Brexit, what Brexit? The Commons chamber was more like an echo chamber. You get a bigger crowd for an adjournment debate on the illegal trade of seahorses.Sajid Javid certainly didn’t look best pleased to be called upon to resume the debate. The Sajid has his eyes on becoming prime minister one day in the not too distant future, and an early morning, end-of-the pier gig in front of a barely conscious audience of a few dozen had not been part of his planned career trajectory. He should have been doing stadium tours by now.The home secretary languidly uncoiled himself to take his place at the despatch box. If no one else was going to make an effort, then why should he? So rather than deliver a new speech, making the case for accepting Theresa May’s deal, he chose instead to go through the motions by making much the same one he had given when announcing the government’s immigration policy several weeks previously. Only he managed to do it worse. An achievement of sorts. When he comes to look back on today, The Saj will be grateful so few MPs were there to witness his performance.Most people had voted to leave the EU because they wanted more control over immigration, he began, apparently unaware that many Conservatives who were backing the prime minister’s deal had argued the exact opposite the previous day. Luckily they weren’t in the chamber to correct him.The country needed a policy that would simultaneously ban and welcome immigration, he declared. Not for the first time, Schrodinger’s Brexit was being presented as credible government policy. The Saj was going to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands by not allowing anyone into the country who earned less than about £30,000 but would still keep the NHS and the hospitality and agriculture sectors running by letting people in who earned considerably less. Suck on that.What made this still more depressing was that The Saj clearly knew he was talking bollocks but didn’t much care one way or the other. And nor did anyone else. We have reached the point where no one really expects a minister to be coherent about Brexit any more. Minds have long since been made up and MPs are at liberty to construct their own alternative realities.Diane Abbott being a prime example. Her reply was a classic of the genre. First she appeared to have printed out her speech in the wrong order, frequently ignoring huge chunks of text by turning over several pages at a time. Perhaps the early start had also caught her on the hop. Or maybe she had decided that, on reflection, she too was a bit bored with talking about Brexit.Then she went full Ukip by citing an intelligence report by former MI6 and defence chiefs that had ended with the suggestion the UK would be better off leaving the EU with no deal. It was almost as if she had no idea of Labour’s Brexit policy. There again, few people do.The most heartfelt speech was made by the Conservative Nicholas Soames, who has spent the past 35 years trying to channel the ghost of his grandfather, Winston Churchill. Only without ever achieving quite the passion or the plausibility. Soames insisted the public wouldn’t forgive the Commons for any delay – one wonders what he imagines May has been doing all this time – and that a vote against the deal would be a vote for chaos. Because everything was going so smoothly now …Thereafter it was a matter of MPs using the time to wind down the clock with their favourite Brexit soundbites. The war. Maastricht. Vassal state. The war. Second referendum. Few people bothered to interrupt, mostly because no one was listening. This wasn’t a debate so much as a procedural formality. The Commons had promised it would fill the time and that was one promise everyone would keep.Nor did the closing speeches offer any enlightenment. Because there had been so few Labour MPs in the house, Emily Thornberry was able to name-check each and every one of them without ever giving any real indication she was entirely sure she knew why she was there. She could have sworn she was meant to have been at lunch. In reply, Jeremy Hunt kept things short and sweet. The bad deal was the best deal because it was the only deal. The government had been consistent on this. Consistently inconsistent. Would that do? Under the circumstances, it would."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0fcb7de17b1e759fd8e2ac32646e33200dba28e/0_234_4877_2928/master/4877.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c50a18cd47ada2b7ec19f0f34f7eba2","title":"juncker hints at helping out theresa may over brexit deal","story":"But EC president remains sceptical over PM’s chances of success in next week’s voteJean-Claude Juncker has signalled that he will offer a last-minute helping hand to Theresa May in her bid to get her Brexit deal passed by MPs – but hinted at deep scepticism in Brussels at her chances of success.A letter from the European commission president is expected on Monday offering further reassurances to MPs that, should it be triggered, the Irish backstop would keep the UK in a customs union only temporarily.Speaking in Bucharest, Juncker said talks with Downing Street over the content were ongoing. But he said every effort would be made to find a way to convince parliament to support the withdrawal agreement when it votes on Tuesday.May’s Brexit adviser, Olly Robbins, has been in Brussels this week to try to secure a meaningful document that could unlock some votes in parliament, but has been faced with officials on the other side of the table who are doubtful anything can be done.Juncker stressed the limitations the member states had imposed on him at the last summit in November, when they insisted they would not even provide a legal interpretation of the deal to help May, let alone unpick any of the terms of the backstop.Under the withdrawal agreement, to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, the UK would stay in a customs union with the EU unless there was an alternative arrangement, such as a trade deal, that could solve the problem.Juncker, who was in Romania for the start of the country’s six-month presidency of the European council, called for space to allow him to work out a formula that would suit the prime minister, saying: “Laissez-moi faire.” or “Let me do it.”“We, the commission and I, are in touch on a constant basis with No 10 Downing Street and we will see what happens between now and Tuesday,” he said.“We will see what the British legislature decides to do with the texts that have been put forward. I still hope that here will be a deal. I do not like the prospect of a no deal, which would be a disaster, I think, for our British friends and for the continent of Europeans. And every effort needs to be made between now and Tuesday afternoon perhaps to ensure that this important issue can be resolved satisfactorily.”Asked about the substance of the letter that is expected to emerge from Brussels, Juncker played down expectations of a game-changing intervention.He said: “What we have said very clearly in council and commission, in full harmony, was that there can be no renegotiation, there can be clarification. But that’s all we are discussing with Downing Street what these clarifications might amount to, that should not confused with a renegotiation with regards to the backstop. Aside from these remarks I think it would be unwise to go into the ongoing discussions.”In a sign of the sensitivity of the moment, Juncker added: “I could become highly prominent from one hour to the next if I were to enter into the detail of your question – and it is not your concern to have me become less popular on different islands. I will resist the temptation.”At his weekly press conference in The Hague, the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, voiced the concerns of leaders of countries that would be most affected by the UK leaving the EU without a deal.“The ball is rolling towards the ravine and everyone is watching it without putting their foot in the way,” Rutte said.There has been speculation in Brussels of a Brexit summit in late January should the deal be voted down, to see if leaders can offer May a way out of her predicament.EU officials did not deny that this could be a next step, but suggested they would be led by Downing Street should the deal be voted down. Officials declined to comment on the substance of the assurances, simply reiterating that the deal could not be cut across, but adding: “There is something.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/936d5ae100f6e678b5cd75dec3690e267b6db62f/81_51_4614_2768/master/4614.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=081d782f9bd217834033310785591226","title":"peoples vote backers biding time force labour hand brexit","story":"Campaigners believe best moment to win over Corbyn will come after Commons voteBacking for a second Brexit referendum in parliament is unlikely to be tested until after next week’s meaningful vote, as campaigners weigh up the best moment to try to win over the Labour leadership.The Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston has scrapped plans to table a “doctors’ amendment” calling for the public to be allowed to exercise “informed consent” about Theresa May’s deal.Wollaston said she would wait until after Tuesday in the hope that “Labour will by then be honouring its commitment to back a ‘people’s vote’”.Labour strategists had been discussing how the party should whip its MPs, in the event of an amendment being brought to the vote on Tuesday, and had not ruled out giving a free vote, reflecting varying views in the shadow cabinet.But they are unlikely to have to make a decision until after Jeremy Corbyn has tabled a no-confidence vote in the government, which colleagues say he will do “expeditiously” after Tuesday’s vote, with May’s deal expected to be defeated.Speaking in Wakefield this week, Corbyn stuck resolutely to Labour’s party conference line of first pushing for a general election, after which all options would remain on the table, “including campaigning for a public vote”.His allies are keen to stress that even if May survives a no-confidence motion next week, backing for another referendum would not follow automatically. But Corbyn would come under intense pressure from the party’s membership, which is overwhelmingly anti-Brexit.Downing Street is still hoping for concessions from the EU27 on the Irish backstop, to present to MPs before the vote. A spokeswoman for the prime minister said: “I think in terms of the assurances that the prime minister has said will be forthcoming, that will happen in the lead-up to the vote.”May will be urged to open talks with Labour if MPs vote down her deal. She has already spoken to key union leaders, including Unite’s Len McCluskey, and to several Labour MPs, and has offered to accept an amendment on workers’ rights tabled by John Mann.Another Labour MP, Jim Fitzpatrick, who represents Poplar and Limehouse, said on Friday he was edging towards backing May’s deal, adding: “I’m not quite there yet, but I’m not far away.”Gareth Snell, the Labour MP for Stoke Central, who was part of a group, mainly from leave constituencies, that met the prime minister in Downing Street, has said the workers’ rights amendment could be a “starting point”.However, disparate groups of backbenchers appear unlikely to deliver the scores of votes the government would need to overturn what looks likely to be a significant majority against her deal, and cabinet ministers including Amber Rudd have hinted the prime minister may have to open cross-party talks.Any move to seek an accommodation with Labour would infuriate rightwing Brexiters, but several cabinet ministers would probably prefer working with the opposition over pressing ahead without a deal.The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said on Friday he believed parliament was “committed one way or another to try to stop no deal”. But May’s spokeswoman said: “The default position is that if the deal is not voted for, the UK will leave without one, and the only way to avoid that is to vote for her deal.”Extending an invitation to Corbyn to enter negotiations about how best to navigate through the next few perilous weeks would present a dilemma for the Labour leader.One close ally has warned he could be caricatured as “Ramsay MacCorbyn”, if he entered any kind of formal arrangement with May – after Ramsay MacDonald, the Labour leader who was reviled by colleagues for entering a national government with the Conservatives in 1931.“We have no confidence whatsoever that she’s capable of working collaboratively on a so-called soft Brexit,” said one shadow cabinet member. But Corbyn has offered to support May if she offers a customs union and stronger promises on environmental standards and workers’ rights.The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, widely regarded by Labour MPs as being warmer towards the idea of a people’s vote than some other members of the shadow cabinet, has suggested Labour would be willing to talk to MPs from other parties about the best way forward."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c02d66033ec91b08037359a7e138d74e61e831c5/23_110_3655_2194/master/3655.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f27afe021bef5c5afdde86603213cf64","title":"what is going on in brexit and what might happen next","story":"Your no-frills primer to the UK’s departure from the European UnionConfused by the latest developments in the UK’s fraught departure from the European Union? Here’s your no-frills primer to what’s going on in Brexit – and what might happen next.Two-and-a-half years and a fraught series of negotiations after the UK voted to leave the EU, the two parties finally managed to sign their two-part orce deal late last year.The first part of this is the 585-page withdrawal agreement covering the rights of EU citizens in the UK and British nationals on the continent, the sum Britain must pay the bloc for past commitments, and a mechanism (the “backstop”) to avoid customs and other border controls between Northern Ireland and the Republic.The second part is a much shorter political declaration on the shape they would like their future trading relations to take, which is vaguely worded enough to allow for almost any outcome, from a close Norway-style relationship to a more distant free trade arrangement like the EU has signed with Canada.In theory, this whole package must now be approved by the British parliament so the necessary legislation can be passed to allow the UK to formally leave the EU as planned at the end of the two-year article 50 exit process on 29 March.Britain would then enter a 20-month transition period, during which nothing much will change and the future relationship will be negotiated, before finally stepping out into the big, wide world in December 2020 (or a bit later, depending on how long it takes to do the trade deal).Essentially because the withdrawal agreement – and particularly the backstop, which will come into force if the detailed terms of the future trading relationship do not manage to avoid that hard Irish border – does not have a majority in parliament.MPs in favour of Brexit fear it could leave Britain a perpetual Brussels “rule-taker”, potentially trapped in the EU’s regulatory orbit forever. Those opposed to Brexit say the deal risks leaving the country economically weakened, with no say in EU rule-making, and worse off all round than staying in the EU.The opposition Labour party rejects the deal, as do a large number of Conservative hardline Brexiters. The Democratic Unionist party, on which the government relies for its majority, also object, leaving the government facing a crushing defeat in the House of Commons.That is why Theresa May, the prime minister, pulled the Commons vote on the agreement that was planned pre-Christmas, rescheduling it for 15 January in the hope she could persuade the EU to come up with concessions or guarantees that would win her opponents (or enough of them) over.Good question. The EU hasn’t budged (it can’t, to any great extent: the agreement is legally binding, approved by 27 countries, and will not be reopened), and it is hard to see what supplementary assurances it could offer that would satisfy the Brexiters.Parliamentary resistance has not weakened, and the government has been reduced to trying to cut side-deals – in the form of amendments to the deal – with various different interest groups to try and peel off some of the objectors. Few observers think this tactic will work.In the meantime, the prime minister’s opponents in the Commons are waging a procedural guerilla war, tabling – and winning – amendments aimed at wresting more and more power over the process from the government and giving it to MPs instead, particularly if a no-deal Brexit looks likely.The problem is that while there is no clear majority for May’s deal, there is no clear majority for anything else either: not for a second referendum, nor a fresh election (Labour’s objective), or no deal (which almost all economist and business groups say would be a catastrophe), or a mooted “Norway-plus”, single-market style deal. And the clock is ticking.Assuming May is defeated on 15 January, many think it increasingly likely that the government may have to ask the EU27 for an extension to the two-year article 50 deadline to allow it – or more accurately, given the current mood, parliament – to look again at the existing deal, or try to develop an alternative Brexit approach it can agree on.Brexit, in other words, is far from over yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/deaafcb5ff96e670e7ba29fc7359945614603a88/0_116_3411_2047/master/3411.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34bb940d02bf89870092333e5ad9fa36","title":"andy murray finish tennis surgery hip","story":"• Murray expects to have surgery after his last match• ‘I was in too much pain, I wasn’t enjoying it any more’Andy Murray, a complex man in search of simple pleasures, is resigned to hobbling away in pain from the sport that has been his life for more than two decades. But, as he contemplates what may be his last appearance on a tennis court – against Roberto Bautista Agut in the first round of the Australian Open on Monday – the manner of his leaving still consumes him.He has two stark choices: replace the hip that has turned him into a walking target and dream about another improbable comeback in the distant future, or have what is known as re-surfacing, a midway solution that would rescue at least some of his athleticism, if not enough for him to play professional tennis.For months Murray fought against the notion that soon the modest inscription on his Twitter biography – “I play tennis” – would be as redundant as his rackets.“My hip needs to be replaced at some stage,” he admitted on Friday in Melbourne. “It’s badly damaged. But I’ve dealt with the feeling for a very long time. I’d say: ‘If I can reduce the pain, it’s something I’ll be able to compete with.’“I would want to go and play football with my friends or go and play 18 holes of golf – whereas now I can’t think of anything worse than going and playing five-a-side football because I can’t kick a football.He pretty much made his mind up that his career was over after a wretched third practice session with Fernando Verdasco in Miami in early December. The pain shooting through his right hip went straight to his heart and he told his team: “This is it. I need to know when this is over. My hip is killing me.” Murray recalled: “I had tears in my eyes. I said to them: ‘I shouldn’t be continuing to go through that for nothing any more.’”He has consulted his wife, Kim, and spoken to his mother, Judy, and brother, Jamie, who were on their way to Melbourne, he said, where they would more fully take on board what he is going through.“I’d imagine they are pretty gutted for me. They know everything I have gone through – well, to a certain extent they do. I have spoken to them a lot, probably my mum more than my brother. They know this isn’t a decision I want to take but one I feel I have to. You guys all have loved ones as well, you know what it is like.“Look, at the end of the day, it is only tennis. It’s just a game, whatever. There is more to life than that. But for many reasons it’s been more than that for me. Stopping the way it’s happened doesn’t sit particularly well with me. It’s not how I would want to finish playing. I don’t think any athlete wants that. They want to go out when they decide, not have their body telling them that is the case. That’s the hardest part of it.”Murray doubts he can ever replace the excitement that engaged him on court. “You can’t. Well, maybe you can by taking certain substances, but you cannot recreate the high of winning Wimbledon or winning a Davis Cup. As much as the lows of losing here for a fifth time hurt, I always had that as a motivation. It was something that gave me drive, to get up and work hard. I don’t anticipate being able to replace that. That’s something that maybe when I finish I will be happy about, living a more stable life.”And what have been the biggest highs?“Two things stand out to me: the second Wimbledon and carrying the flag at the Olympics. That was an off-court thing. There are not loads of things off the court that relate to my tennis. They don’t for me come anywhere close to that.”The man who did more than any of his coaches to transform Murray into the fully fledged champion he became was Ivan Lendl.Lendl said on Friday: “As Andy looks to wind down over the coming months the world of tennis will lose a great competitor but he will leave a measure of true grit that we all can learn from. Andy always left it all out on the court and I will look back with great feelings about the years we worked together. They were a lot of fun times filled with excitement. I am honoured to have been part of his team and to have been able to help him achieve as many of his lofty goals as possible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa22a99023fb83ea6a2a650fb2c844eca34380e8/0_136_3346_2007/master/3346.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fdf3fb0531f07c8595dce585975cbaec","title":"gloucester munster european champions cup rugby match report","story":"Gloucester did not so much bow out of Europe last night as sink without trace on another bruising evening for English self-esteem. Munster may not be quite the force of old but they were still comfortably too strong for the Cherry and Whites, this bonus-point victory all but ensuring the Irish province a place in the tournament’s last eight.Long before the end the hosts had been chewed up and spat out by their visiting tormentors in spearmint green, whose outstanding fly-half Joey Carbery contributed 26 points including two of his side’s five tries. If Johnny Sexton’s sore calf does not clear up swiftly, Ireland have a ready-made pedigree alternative as if his all-round game was not impressive enough, the 23-year-old has now landed every one of his last 17 kicks at goal.Danny Cipriani, sent off in the reverse fixture at Thomond Park and just back after a month out with a pectoral muscle injury, could only look on wistfully behind a retreating pack. Gloucester could conceivably have lost by even more, with Conor Murray enjoying an armchair ride at scrum-half. Tadhg Beirne had another influential game in the Munster second row and, in the back row too, this developed into another Irish masterclass around the tackle area.The wing Andrew Conway scored one try, this time from a deft left-footed Carbery chip, and almost collected another before his outside-half rounded off a classy night with a 60-metre interception try. In terms of close-quarters physicality and killer instinct, Munster were a cut above as they registered the most points Gloucester have ever conceded at home in Europe. The home side were slightly weakened by injury and their coach, Johan Ackermann, with his available players looking increasingly battered, would love to have had the same freedom to rest players as Munster did last weekend. The message to Eddie Jones’s England, heading to Dublin for the opening round of the Six Nations in three weeks’ time, was clear enough.Despite the atmospheric buzz around the stadium for a game the hosts simply could not afford to lose, Gloucester were forced to play catch-up from an early stage. Three psychologically important scrum penalties to Munster plus a glaring dropped high ball by Charlie Sharples did little to boost morale and gradually Munster’s pack began to exert more consistent pressure. A prolonged spell of possession ended with Murray throwing a lovely pass to allow Carbery to skip over unopposed after 23 minutes and worse soon followed.The visiting loosehead Dave Kilcoyne, already enjoying himself opposite Fraser Balmain, put in a fine tackle to down his opposite number Josh Hohneck and, when Gloucester were subsequently pinged on the floor, Carbery’s long penalty put his side 13-3 up after 27 minutes.The odd neat touch from Cipriani was never going to be enough. Before half-time Munster strung together another brutal 26 phases before Rory Scannell, cutting back against the grain and spinning out of Sharples’s tackle split the home defence with ominous ease. The interval scoreline of 20-3 did not entirely reflect Gloucester’s efforts but Munster’s ceaseless commitment deserved its reward.This was their sixth successive win over Gloucester and on each occasion the margin has been at least 12 points. Even when the Cherry and Whites did finally score their first try of the evening, after 52 minutes through Ollie Thorley, the wing’s sharp finish was rather less memorable than the 35 phases it took to construct the score, Munster’s defence close to their own line bordering on the extraordinary.Typically Munster, despite losing their captain, Peter O’Mahony, with a popped rib which might threaten his availability against England, went straight back up the other end to create a score for the ever-reliable Keith Earls. A consolation try for Balmain was nowhere near enough to save Gloucester from the European scrapheap along with their compatriots Bath, Wasps, Leicester and, potentially, Exeter and Newcastle as well. Saracens could well be the only Premiership survivors in the last eight, food for thought for all connected with the English club game."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af7f59ac18afcfa803e70f7bd5ff0006ab40c9c6/0_25_1641_985/master/1641.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e15dff5e0147db37b3dd76a81656d4f5","title":"feminism andy murray global icon tennis amelie mauresmo","story":"Once the empty feeling subsides and the lump at the back of his throat stops threatening to leap from his mouth, perhaps it will console Andy Murray to consider how much he means to people from all walks of life. Even at this early stage of the healing process, with the emotions swirling and his heart shattered as he contemplates how brutally his body has given up on him in the past two years, it might raise his spirits to know he is showered with affection not only for his achievements on a tennis court but also for what he represents on a human level.In an era of ugly public debate it is important to remember that Murray’s most endearing qualities – his sense of morality, his ability to separate right and wrong, his sensitivity and intelligence – have made him more than a tennis player. To appreciate him fully, to get to the root of why it hurts to see one of Britain’s sporting greats announce that his career is all but over, you have to understand that the connection many feel with him is explained by more than admiration for his skill and grit.It runs deeper than Wimbledon titles and Olympic golds, because Murray belongs to a select group of athletes who have managed to transcend their sport through their integrity away from the heat of competition.Above all it is the unapologetic feminism that has turned the 31-year-old into an unlikely global icon. The Scot’s championing of female athletes has elevated him above his peers – witness the American comedian Sarah Silverman raving about him on the Ellen DeGeneres Show – and makes him a fine example of what masculinity should be in 2019.Many bad judges of character have sought to portray Murray as a misery guts down the years. Yet criticisms of his supposed surliness could not be wider of the mark. In reality he is funny and kind, thoughtful and brave, scarily resilient with a racket in his right hand but never reluctant to weep in public.Watching him struggle to blink back the tears during that painful press conference in Melbourne, the thought occurred that the phrase “man up” should be replaced by “Murray up”. Even though it was the lowest moment of his professional life, there was something quintessentially Andy about this ferocious competitor’s lack of self-consciousness.Along with quashing the idea that big boys don’t cry, Murray has led the way in showing how men can stand up for women. Influenced by his mother, Judy, another tireless force of nature, he has used his position of power to start difficult and vital conversations. He has argued for equal pay in tennis and refused to listen to the sniffy comments that greeted his decision to hire a female coach, Amélie Mauresmo, in 2014.He has said Wimbledon should schedule more women’s matches on Centre Court and his comments have been a breath of fresh air, promoting inclusivity and equality, demonstrating that emotional maturity does not equate to weakness.At 6ft 3in Murray is physically imposing but there is nothing macho about the way he carries himself. He has gone to war against the misogynistic attitudes that still thrive in the tennis world and has also not hesitated to challenge casual sexism. Two years ago he was praised for correcting a journalist who said Sam Querrey was the first American to reach a grand slam semi-final since 2009. “Male player,” Murray said, highlighting the fact that Serena Williams had won a fair few women’s titles in that period at SW19.“I do not think there is a woman player who is not totally supportive of Andy Murray,” Serena Williams said. “He has spoken up for women’s rights, especially in tennis, forever. He has such a wonderful mother, who has been such a strong figure in his life and he has done so much for us on our tour. We love Andy Murray.”That episode followed a familiar pattern, as John Inverdale knows all too well after declaring in 2016 that Murray was the first person to win two Olympic gold medals in tennis. “Well, to defend the singles title,” Murray told the BBC host. “I think Venus and Serena have won about four each.”No wonder he has a fan in Billie Jean King, the former grand slam champion and a relentless defender of women’s rights, who used Twitter to urge Murray to remember that his “greatest impact on the world may be yet to come”.King’s words are a reminder that while Murray does not deserve to endure such a cruel ending, another story could be about to begin. The world needs more men like the shy boy from Dunblane."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80e5a1c12521a64d3cea857c1fac9bf31f03c908/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=645\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2397d6326b9126ef45a818fadc25b6d5 645w","title":"the ultimate vegan friday night feast","story":"You’ve made it through the week, and now you want to celebrate with some good food. Vegan Miranda Larbi shares her tips for creating an indulgent Veganuary feastThere really is nothing quite as wonderful as logging off at 5pm on a Friday knowing that you’ve got no plans or dates with anyone except your sofa and Netflix.Back in the day, you may have thought that anything short of spending Saturday with a banging hangover was an abject failure but, in these busy times of hyper-connectivity, having a little down time during peak socialising hours can be seen as the ultimate luxury.And it’s especially welcome if you’re taking part in Veganuary. After all, the best way to kick a habit is to simply not engage. So rather than dining out and being tempted by a plate of ribs or raclette, you’re much better off staying in with a truckload of vegan treats.For me, that tends to involve a three-course feast of simple but delicious goodies.First up, non-dairy cheese (just because you’re a vegan, it doesn’t mean you can’t still have a cheese-fest).Cicioni cheese is incredible. It’s made from cashews, almonds, salt and water and tastes like goat’s cheese. Slice some up, stick it on a plate of Kallo rice cakes with some spicy chutney on top and you’re golden.And if that’s not enough cheese for you, there are always more options.A classic wintry pass-the-elasticated-joggers dish is mac and cheese, and I have a vegan version that will send you into the most glorious of carb comas. My recipe is both delicious and nutritious. It’s rich in vitamin B12 (notoriously hard to get from a plant-based diet) and has good fats. Here’s what you’ll need …Mac and cheeseSoak your cashews for a couple of hours (I tend to leave them soaking when I go to work) and, once swollen, throw into your food processor along with a glug of olive oil, a pinch of salt, the lemon juice, garlic and a generous dose of the nutritional yeast. The more yeast, the stronger the cheese flavour.Next, cook your pasta.In a separate pan, fry your onion and garlic before adding your chopped chestnut mushrooms and kale. Give the mushrooms a chance to brown a little and then once they look done, add your torn-up spinach and mix into your drained pasta. Drench in the sauce and sprinkle extra yeast on top. If you have any of the Cicioni cheese left, crumble some over.Obviously it’s not an indulgent night in without pudding …Nothing beats a tub of Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s to kick back with on a Friday night. Vegan Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s is the only plant-based ice-cream I’ve tried that tastes as decadent as the dairy version – in fact, I don’t think I’d be able to tell the difference.Want to make it even more indulgent? Then I suggest throwing a packet of Livia’s Kitchen Nugglets Raw Cookie Dough into the mix (this is especially good with Chocolate Fudge Brownie ice-cream).Livia has some fantastically simple recipes (all vegan, gluten-free) on its website that are worth giving a go. I made an indulgent chocolate pie a couple of weekends ago, which was perfection personified with a dollop of ice-cream on top. I did have to lie down afterwards to deal with the sugar rush, but it was more than worth it.If you do Friday nights in right (more food, less boozing), you may even find that you’re curiously light on your feet and awake enough to make it to your 9am yoga class the next morning.See, Veganuary could be just the beginning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8bc71bface7ef6903bde9854f48c8988b922630/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f948dcdbaf8026e4e43892e7df17b71a","title":"theres never been a better time to be vegan","story":"With restaurants, chefs and well-known brands introducing more vegan options than ever, sticking to a plant-based diet is now both simple and indulgent, says Club Mexicana’s Meriel Armitage A decade ago, when I decided to go vegan for ethical reasons, the word “decadent” was one you’d never have used to describe the food available. More often than not, it fitted the joyless stereotype of lentils, quinoa and tofu, with the occasional Linda McCartney vegan sausage to liven things up. Now, though, ask a vegan what they ate last night and they’re likely to say anything from pizza topped with gooey melted “cheese” to crispy fried “chicken” or pulled jackfruit burritos. The vegan scene has truly exploded, introducing food that’s exciting, colourful and indulgent, whether you’re vegan or not.When I launched my pop-up, Club Mexicana, in 2012 I wanted to challenge the boringly virtuous chickpea and chia seed perception of veganism. Inspired by my travels in the US, where vegan food is innovative and delicious, I wanted to prove that being vegan doesn’t mean missing out.I realised the joy of Mexican food doesn’t stem from the meat, but the bold, punchy flavours created by salsas and pickles – the meat is just a carrier for those flavours. We try to be as creative as possible with our dishes, which include tacos with baja “tofish” – tofu fish – and roasted cornbread with pecan mole, smoked soya yoghurt, pickled pear and smoked tomato. When we first started holding supper clubs, a lot of people didn’t even notice the food was vegan, which is what I wanted.Over the past few years, vegan ingredients have evolved rapidly, which has helped vegan cooking to become as exciting as it is. Vegan cheese used to be terrible, but now you can buy everything from vegan blue cheese and camembert to cheddar and ricotta – all tasting as piquant and decadently creamy as the real thing. At Club Mexicana, we serve deep-fried “mozzarella” sticks made with coconut oil, which are crispy on the outside and oozingly melty in the middle.People also often wrongly assume that going vegan will mean depriving themselves of indulgent desserts and treats, but that’s no longer the case either. The naughtiest dish we offer is deep-fried ice-cream doused in chocolate sauce – it really doesn’t get more indulgent than that.More and more restaurants are offering innovative vegan menus. Supermarkets now stock an amazing range of vegan food that’s expanding all the time. Brands, such as Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s, are constantly bringing out new vegan products that are causing a buzz outside, as well as inside, the vegan world.There’s never been a better time to be vegan, or just to introduce more plant-based alternatives into your everyday diet. With so many amazing colours, textures and flavours on offer, you never need to feel you’re depriving yourself of the food you love."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45c72d5042cf63ee2c720d714238911f247a7e26/0_373_5597_3358/master/5597.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4b8aac52d5ac3a0c96c1d44a7f8009e","title":"the ultimate vegan baked alaska recipe","story":"This indulgent, retro dessert just got a vegan makeover, thanks to non-dairy ice-cream and aquafaba meringueServes 8Prep: 1 hour 20 minutes, plus 4-5 hours for freezingCook: 25-30 minutesFor the cake:125g dairy-free baking spread150ml dairy-free milk2 tsp white wine vinegar125g caster sugar1 tsp vanilla extract175g self-raising flour1 tsp baking powderFor the filling:500ml tub Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s non-dairy ice-cream3 tbsp jamFor the meringue:1 x 400g can chickpeas1⁄4 tsp xanthan gum1⁄4 tsp cream of tartar1 tsp vanilla extract100g caster sugarPreheat the oven to 180C (160C fan)gas 4.

But not content with a Japanese-style heated seat and auto cleaning and drying systems, the US toilet maker Kohler has shoved Amazon’s Alexa into its new loo, too.The Numi 2.0 Intelligent Toilet promises a “fully immersive experience” with fancy “dynamic and interactive multicoloured ambient and surround lighting”, built-in speakers and voice control. A snip at about $7,000 – or $9,000 if you want it in black.“Alexa, flush for me.” What could possibly go wrong?What if your smartwatch used you as a human battery so it never needs charging? That’s precisely what the Matrix PowerWatch 2 promises, sucking heat from the wearer’s skin to generate electricity, alongside a hidden solar panel for good measure.Electronic gadgets come in many forms, including tools for pleasure. Although not, apparently, at CES when developed by an almost all-female team using patent-pending technology in micro-robotics, biomimicry and engineering.Osé, an intimate massager that “mimics all of the sensations of a human mouth, tongue and fingers” to feel “just like a real partner”, was originally selected as a CES 2019 Innovation Award honouree but was then dumped and banned from the show for being “immoral, obscene, indecent, profane”.CES’s organisers are now facing accusations of gender bias, given sex dolls for men were launched at the event last year and pornography has been featured in its virtual reality booths for years.Apple, notorious for blocking others from using its technology, has not only started licensing its AirPlay 2 media streaming system to TV manufacturers including Sony, LG and Vizio, but has also announced that an iTunes app will be available on its arch-rival Samsung’s smart TVs.Expect an Apple TV streaming service to launch this year, then.The Korean car company Hyundai has unveiled a car that can walk. The Elevate is capable of both “mammalian and reptilian walking gaits” using four articulated robotic legs that extend out from traditional wheel arches but that can fold back down and drive like a regular car.At least that’s the theory. Experts are sceptical that Hyundai’s “limitless” design will actually work. But if it does, the car that “can climb a 5ft wall, step over a 5ft gap, walk over erse terrain and achieve a 15ft wide track width” will apparently be brilliant for emergency services and rescue vehicles. Not everything at CES requires electricity. Impossible Food launched the second iteration of its meat-free Impossible Burger. It claims its soy-based meat substitute looks, tastes and feels like a beef patty it even “bleeds” and was convincing enough to make one vegetarian reviewer heave.The Impossible Burger 2.0 “delivers all the taste meat lovers crave – without compromise to nutrition or the planet”, according to the company’s COO, David Lee. It is now on sale in a few fast food restaurants in Las Vegas, with a US rollout scheduled for later in the year.Have you ever wished for a Nespresso machine but for beer? LG’s HomeBrew might be the answer to your prayers.Pop in one big and three smaller Nespresso-esque capsules and hit the button. The HomeBrew will then produce five litres of beer from a choice of American IPA, American pale ale, stout, pilsner and Belgian witbier. It even cleans itself at the end.The catch?

Its QuietComfort Road Noise Control system aims to suppress road noise, using a series of accelerometers and microphones to cancel out unwanted sound waves using the vehicle’s sound system.Conventional systems simply pack the doors and floor with insulation but the problem is much bigger for electric cars, which lack the ambient sound of a combustion engine to mask the irritating roar of rubber on road.Science fiction has long been filled with gadgets that automatically apply makeup. At CES, Procter \u0026amp Gamble turned sci-fi into reality with a wand that scans the face and then precisely applies makeup.The Opté Precision Skincare System detects the colour and pigment of skin using a camera, detects blemishes and then covers them with the exact amount of makeup needed to seamlessly erase them. The system prints makeup on to the skin using tiny inkjet-like nozzles.

Then the bubble burstUntil 2016, I ran an advertising agency in London. At our peak, we were highly successful I had a team of 35 people, a £3m turnover and a Covent Garden office. When the agency folded, I decided to invest in bitcoin.Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, a type of electronic cash that allows people to spend or trade via a peer-to-peer network without the involvement of banks or other intermediaries. It is a cheap, efficient way of transferring funds or holding value, which can be converted back into sterling at any time. I had used it before to buy treatment online for my mother after she was diagnosed with cancer. I had also dabbled with investing in it in 2013, and made and lost some money: bitcoin is prone to sudden fluctuations in value. But the market seemed to have moved on, and I decided it could be a good way to make some profit on my savings.At first I deposited £5,000 at the time, January 2017, bitcoins were about $600, so I bought seven or eight and spent the rest on other cryptocurrencies. But over the next few weeks I became hooked and ploughed in a large chunk of money – £23,000 in all. I remember telling people, “I really think the value of bitcoin could rise to $2,000 this year.” I could never have predicted it would peak at 10 times that. By the middle of spring 2017, my investment had risen to about $300,000, and by the summer it was at half a million. Media interest in bitcoin was growing and friends kept asking how they could get into it, so I started a Facebook group, then a website and finally a podcast devoted to the subject. As excitement built, more and more people got involved, forming the conditions for a bubble but many of us were too caught up in the hype to exercise caution.At the end of 2017, bitcoin had reached almost $20,000 and my portfolio had ballooned to about $1.2m. That is when I got a little out of control. I have always been an entrepreneur, and since I was a kid I had dreamed of buying my local football club, Bedford Town, becoming chairman and getting them into the league. I thought the project might cost £5m, so that was the figure I decided to aim for. I estimated I could get there within six months.By this time I was travelling the world doing interviews for my podcast, taking friends out to expensive restaurants and buying extravagant gifts for my family. I am not the kind of person who puts everything away for the future, and though I donated £6,000 to my local hospital, much of my spending was quite frivolous. It might have been more sensible to buy a couple of houses, but I became overambitious. This felt like my one shot at achieving that childhood dream.At the end of January 2018 the bubble burst and bitcoin’s value suddenly fell. There had been a few drops during 2017 but it had bounced back, so I was not too worried. But over the rest of the year, I watched it sink lower and lower, along with the other cryptocurrencies I had invested in, all the time thinking, “Well, there’s no point selling now…” That was my attitude throughout last year, as bitcoin’s value continued to fall. Pretty much everything I had built up was wiped out.There are many who invested a lot more than I did and ended up with far greater losses. I wish I had taken everything out before the bubble burst, but I do not waste too much time on regret. I have earned money in the past through hard work and enjoyed it more. At the moment, I am enjoying making my podcast, which provides more than enough money to live on. I have sold most of my bitcoin, which is currently worth about $4,000 apiece, to give me a cushion in case the business has a bad month. But if I had to choose between the $1.2m and the podcast, I would let the money go again – I love what I do now.I still believe that bitcoin is a force for good. I recently interviewed Alex Gladstein of the Human Rights Foundation, who was explaining how it helps people living in authoritarian regimes to prosper – for example, women in Afghanistan who are not allowed to open bank accounts can still work and get paid in bitcoin. It is a step in the right direction. My main focus now is exploring how bitcoin could help stabilise an increasingly volatile world.As told to Chris Broughton• The headline of this article was amended on 11 January 2019, for clarity.Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article.Do you have an experience to share?

According to Ars Technica and the Wall Street Journal, an 18-page court filing contains three pages that were supposed to be blacked out because they contain “sensitive discussion of Facebook’s internal strategic analysis of third-party applications”, Facebook said in other court filings.But while the sensitive discussions were masked with a black bar, the underlying text was not removed from digital versions of the documents, allowing it to be uncovered.That text reportedly shows Facebook staff discussing how to use access to user data to extract higher advertising spend from major clients, in emails dating from 2012 and 2013. The conversations occurred at roughly the time that Facebook decided to change the way third-party developers could access user data, which had the effect of closing the hole through which Cambridge Analytica partner GSR had managed to extract the personal information of millions of Facebook users.In the filings, the Wall Street Journal reports, one employee proposes blocking access “in one go to all apps that don’t spend … at least $250k a year to maintain access to the data”.Elsewhere, the filings suggest that Facebook offered to extend the length of time Tinder could continue using the old, more permissive terms of access in exchange for a licence for the dating company’s trademark on the term “Moments”.There is no suggestion that Facebook acted on the proposals, and the company has always maintained that it tightened the restrictions on what could be done with its public access for privacy and security reasons.The filings are drawn from a set of Facebook emails obtained by Six4Three in the discovery portion of its lawsuit against the social network, subsequently sealed by the Californian court. On Sunday, however, the UK parliament seized copies of the emails from Six4Three’s chief executive, and quoted from them during its grilling of a Facebook executive on Tuesday.During the hearings, Labour’s Clive Effort asked whether “apps were shut down on the basis that they could not pay a large sum of money for mobile advertising”, and whether apps were “whitelisted” based on their advertising spend. Richard Allan, Facebook’s head of public policy in Europe, said no to both.In a statement, Facebook’s director of developer platforms and programs, Konstantinos Papamiltiadis, told the : “As we’ve said many times, the documents Six4Three gathered for this baseless case are only part of the story and are presented in a way that is very misleading without additional context.” Facebook declined a request to provide the  with the emails in their additional context, saying: “Evidence has been sealed by a California court so we are not able to disprove every false accusation.”Papamiltiadis added: “That said, we stand by the platform changes we made in 2015 to stop a person from sharing their friends’ data with developers. Any short-term extensions granted during this platform transition were to prevent the changes from breaking user experience.“To be clear, Facebook has never sold anyone’s data. Our APIs have always been free of charge and we have never required developers to pay for using them, either directly or by buying advertising.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49ed7c3780560d452da6159acd2688f2867a3590/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54d89c54a42b82e756001f6a922cc1d7","title":"the internet but not as we know it life online in china russia cuba and india","story":"Scroll to continueScroll to continueScroll to continueScroll to continueScroll to continueScroll to continueScroll to continueScroll to continueScroll to continueScroll to continueScroll to continueScroll to continueScroll to continueScroll to continueScroll to continueScroll to continueScroll to continueScroll to continueScroll to continueScroll to continueIn Cuba, internet access is limited. But if you can’t get to the internet, there are ways of bringing it physically to you.It’s known as “el paquete semanal” or “the weekly packet”, an external drive loaded with thousands of hours of media content that is delivered to customers by enterprising ‘suppliers’ like Alberto Jorge.“With el paquete you choose what to watch and when to watch it,” says Jorge, 34, as he walks the cracked paving slabs of west Havana delivering the drives.This week’s edition features showbiz news from Spain, Big Brother from the US, and an episode of Celebrity Masterchef broadcast just days earlier on BBC One.Alberto hands a one-terabyte drive to each household to copy, before returning the next day to collect it. He charges the equivalent of two US dollars a week for the service.Upon connecting the hard disk, subscribers are presented with more than 50 folders. There are Spanish-language editions of magazines such as Forbes and GQ, scanned in pdf format, apps that users can copy to their phones, and a file giving offline access to “Revolico”, the island’s main classified website which is intermittently blocked online.While tolerated by the authorities, it is unclear who heads up this hazy enterprise. Rumour has it that a network of entrepreneurs pay database administrators to download content using fast internet connections in their state jobs.On the other side of Havana, Elena Llera, 52, plugs a memory stick with The Bride of Istanbul, a Turkish soap opera, into her television. El paquete is now her main source of home entertainment, and she only switches to state TV for the evening news.Despite having a public wifi park just 100 metres from her apartment – one of more than 700 to have opened since 2015 – she connects only twice a week to video call her aunt in Miami. It costs the equivalent of one dollar an hour to use the internet, around the same as a day’s wage.“If I could, then I’d use the internet for all its functions, to learn about politics and culture. But I can’t. It’s very expensive,” she says.Alejandro Pol, 28, a dentist visiting Elena’s flatmate, uses el paquete to watch Vice News and reviews of the latest iPhones.“We know it doesn’t work like this in the capitalist world,” he says, “but it’s a way we have of staying connected.” For the first time in history, more than half of the world\u0027s population is online. But this source of information is not the same for everyone. When you consider the ways the internet shapes the way we see the world how it affects our idea of reality, these differences are more than digital window dressing — they have the power to influence what we think is true. These illustrations are intended to show how the experience of being online can vary from country to country. They are just a handful of examples. Diverse economic, political and technological conditions mean there is huge range in the quality and freedom of internet access across the world.

She said “the issue of war and peace” would be the main focus of her campaign.Her office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Gabbard is popular with some liberals in the Democratic party but will have serious competition in what is expected to be a crowded primary field before the November 2020 election.The US senator Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, on 31 December announced she had formed an exploratory committee for a presidential run. The Democratic field could eventually include Senators Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand, as well as the former vice-president Joe Biden. Julian Castro, Barack Obama’s former housing secretary, also formed an exploratory committee in December.In the race to pick a candidate to run against Trump, Democrats will grapple with the tension between the party’s establishment and liberal wings that flared during the 2016 state-by-state nominating contests between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, an independent senator who ran under the Democratic banner.Gabbard made headlines in 2016 by quitting a leadership post at the Democratic National Committee over the party’s decision to limit the number of debates between Clinton and Sanders. Analysts believed fewer debates benefited Clinton. Clinton ultimately won the Democratic nomination but lost to Trump.The congresswoman then endorsed Sanders for president, becoming one of the few members of Congress to do so.Gabbard has also drawn criticism for secretly meeting with Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, during a 2017 trip to the war-torn country.

She fled her family while visiting Kuwait and flew to Bangkok, where she barricaded herself in an airport hotel to avoid deportation and grabbed global attention by mounting a social media campaign for asylum.Her case highlighted the cause of women’s rights in Saudi Arabia, where several women fleeing abuse by their families have been caught trying to seek asylum abroad in recent years and returned home. Human rights activists say many similar cases go unreported.Qunun is flying to Toronto via Seoul, South Korea, according to Thai immigration police chief, Surachate Hakparn.The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, confirmed his country had granted her asylum. “That is something that we are pleased to do because Canada is a country that understands how important it is to stand up for human rights and to stand up for women’s rights around the world and I can confirm that we have accepted the UN’s request,” Trudeau said.Several other countries, including Australia, had been in talks with the UN’s refugee agency to accept Qunun, Surachate said earlier in the day. “She chose Canada. It’s her personal decision,” he said.The decision is likely to exacerbate Canada’s already poor relations with Saudi Arabia, which last year barred the Canadian ambassador to Riyadh after Ottawa criticised Saudi authorities for detaining women’s activists.She thanked everyone for helping her, he said, and added that the first thing she would do upon arrival in Canada would be to start learning the language. She already speaks more than passable English, in addition to Arabic.The office of the UN high commissioner for refugees welcomed Canada’s decision. “The quick actions over the past week of the government of Thailand in providing temporary refuge and facilitating refugee status determination by UNHCR, and of the government of Canada in offering emergency resettlement to Qunun and arranging her travel were key to the successful resolution of this case,” the agency said in a statement.Phil Robertson, the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, cited Qunun’s “courage and perseverance,” adding: “This is so much a victory for everyone who cares about respecting and promoting women’s rights, valuing the independence of youth to forge their own way, and demanding governments operate in the light and not darkness.”Qunun was stopped on 5 January at Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi airport by immigration police who denied her entry and seized her passport. After barricading herself in an airport hotel room, her social media campaign attracted enough public and diplomatic support to encourage Thai officials to admit her temporarily under the protection of UN officials, who granted her refugee status Wednesday.Qunun’s father arrived in Bangkok on Tuesday, but his daughter refused to meet him. Surachate said the father, whose name has not been released, denied physically abusing Qunun or trying to force her into an arranged marriage, which were among the reasons she gave for her flight.Surachate said Qunun’s father wanted his daughter back but respected her decision. “He has 10 children. He said the daughter might feel neglected sometimes,” he said.Canadian officials were reluctant to comment further until she landed safely in Canada.Qunun’s plight has emerged at a time when Riyadh is facing intense scrutiny from western allies over the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and the humanitarian consequences of its war in Yemen.Qunun had previously said on Twitter that she wanted to seek refuge in Australia.The Australian foreign minister, Marise Payne, met senior Thai officials in Bangkok on Thursday and later said Australia was assessing Qunun’s resettlement request."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43ef740529dc2212b236e2543611911fb3442c32/0_6_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc0c9e123a353860677cad231091b0a1","title":"canada pipeline indigenous trudeau treaty","story":"The territory of the Wet’suwet’en in British Columbia was never ceded by treaty and hereditary chiefs say they retain authorityJustin Trudeau was in campaign mode this week, striding around a school gymnasium, shirtsleeves rolled up and brow suitably furrowed as he addressed voters’ concerns at one of his annual town hall-style meetings.A day earlier and nearly 800km away, another face of the federal government was on display as dozens of police – some heavily armed – stormed a makeshift barricade, arresting 14 indigenous protesters and prompting others to flee for safety on snowmobiles.The protesters in northern British Columbia had camped out for days amid bitter cold and deep snow, manning a checkpoint to prevent construction vehicles from entering the territory of the Wet’suwet’en nation.Their demonstrations, part of a fight against a multibillion-dollar natural gas pipeline, galvanized supporters across the country, and at his town hall meeting, the prime minister was forced to contend with a barrage of angry questions.The standoff ended on Wednesday night, in a temporary truce between leadership and police.But the dramatic scenes highlighted a broader issue for Canada in 2019: swaths of territory – never signed away by treaty or seized in war – still belong to indigenous nations who are fighting back against resource projects they say they never consented to.Unlike the rest of the country – where relationships between indigenous groups and the state are governed by treaties – few indigenous nations in British Columbia ever signed deals with colonial authorities, meaning the federal government still operates in a vacuum of authority on their lands, said Gordon Christie, a scholar of indigenous law at the University of British Columbia“What I see is a long history of the Canadian government doing its best to avoid acknowledging the existence of other systems of government,” he said.“The Crown has itself acknowledged that the way it gets authority over territory is through the making of a treaty,” said Christie. “So this is their problem.”In recent months, tensions with indigenous peoples have flared across Canada as energy companies seek to construct projects on and through indigenous lands. Both TransCanada, which is attempting to build the Coastal GasLink pipeline and Kinder Morgan, which was pushing the TransMountain pipeline, have faced fierce opposition from indigenous groups.Much of the current uncertainty surrounds who companies should consult with when they begin to plans projects which would enter indigenous lands.While elected indigenous officials from communities along the route of the proposed Coastal GasLink pipeline have signed benefit agreements with TransCanada, five Wet’suwet’en hereditary chiefs oppose the plan. The chiefs, who are unelected, argue they retain authority over the sprawling 22,000 sq km of the band’s traditional territory.Christie agreed, saying the hereditary chiefs legal claim to rightful control is “airtight”.“The goal has always been the same for Canada and indigenous people: it’s to remove us from our land and have access to the resources,” said Jennifer Wickham, a member of the Gitdumden, one of five clans making up the Wet’suwet’en nation. “That storyline has never changed.”TransCanada says it has had more than 15,000 “interactions and engagements” with indigenous groups as part of the consultation process. The outcome between protesters and police was “not the one we wanted”, the company in a statement.The events of the past week have cast a shadow over the Trudeau’s image of a political leader seeking reconciliation with Canada’s marginalized and often mistreated First Nations. While he lamented the arrests, his government will maintain its course, arguing the resource projects must be built.“Justin Trudeau has said that reconciliation is a priority for him. I would have to say to him, is this what reconciliation looks like?” said Wickham, whose sister Molly was arrested on Monday when police raided the protest camp.The site was first occupied by indigenous protesters in 2009 and now hosts a complex of buildings, including a traditional healing lodge.Freda Huson, who has lived there for nearly a decade said that for generations the community has lost land to farming and resource development and now fears that the pipeline could taint the only available drinking water in the area.“I shouldn’t have to be dragged into the courts to prove that I own land that I know is ours. Our people owned these territories since time immemorial,” she said. Trudeau pledged to overhaul the framework guiding relations with indigenous communities nearly a year ago. But in areas where no treaties were signed, the courts have often become the arbiter of land claims. In 2014, the Tsilhqot’in people in British Columbia won a longstanding battle over title rights at the country’s highest court – but at a cost of more than $10m.Both Huson and Wickham believe Canadian law is inadequately equipped to handle land claims fights with the government.In 1997 the supreme court put an end to one of the longest-running legal battles in Canadian history, ruling that the Wet’suwet’en had effectively demonstrated clear title to their land.The plaintiffs exhausted more than an estimated $25m on legal fees – only to have a retrial called, leaving uncertainty around their claim.“It doesn’t matter which route we take. We took this to the highest court in the Canada and it was ruled in our favour,” said Wickham. “Even when we follow their western law, it doesn’t do us any good.”Both the federal government and British Columbia have pledged to implement the United Nations declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples (UNdrip).But Christie argues that until there is a fundamental shift in government attitudes, similar feuds will continue erupt.Huson said: “We’re in the right. We’re not doing anything wrong. This is my home. This is my land. They want to break down my door.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a3a49ca23a681bf9983a897f215909dc6b1a2f7/0_134_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18826215b54ca68aa986383717c3ef24","title":"macedonias parliament votes to accept new name","story":" Country will become Republic of North Macedonia when Greece ratifies agreementMacedonia’s parliament passed an amendment to the constitution on Friday to rename the country Republic of North Macedonia in line with an agreement with Greece to put an end to a 27-year-old dispute.The two countries struck the deal on the new name in June, but Macedonia will start using it only after the parliament in Athens also ratifies the agreement.Eighty-one deputies in the 120-seat parliament voted in favour. Representatives of the opposition VMRO-DPMNE, who opposed the agreement with Greece, boycotted the vote.“A new historical chapter in our statehood has been written this evening,” the Macedonian government said in a statement. “It makes absolutely plausible two of our biggest state interests - membership in Nato and EU.”The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, called his Macedonian counterpart, Zoran Zaev, to congratulate him, his office said in a written statement.Greece blocked its neighbour’s aspirations to EU and Nato membership over the use of Macedonia which, it said, implied territorial claims to a Greek province of the same name.The implementation of the agreement, named after the bordering town of Prespa where it was signed, is intended to end the dispute.The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, and the EU commissioner in charge of enlargement, Johannes Hahn, hailed the vote.“Nato strongly supports the full implementation of the agreement, which is an important contribution to a stable and prosperous region,” Stoltenberg wrote on his Twitter account.“My sincerest congratulations to political actors and citizens of the hopefully soon to be North Macedonia on parliament’s vote on the constitutional changes,” Hahn tweeted. “(I) hope that this historic decision creates a positive dynamic for reconciliation in the whole western Balkan region.”Several hundred people have protested against the deal in front of the parliament building in Skopje over the past three days. Macedonian opposition parties and nationalists say changing the name of the country and national symbols is too high price to pay for Nato accession.The opposition VMRO-DPMNE party has asked for an early election. “The vote on constitutional amendments that changed the name, identity, history and culture was done against the constitution. It was illegal, violent and done in a criminal way,” its leader, Hristijan Mickoski, told journalists after the vote."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3682d30b228020e0088e59845fbdd7026ed37485/0_68_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3fc94030a757672f636ab6a24bf4a90","title":"venezuela maduro juan guaido assume presidency","story":"Juan Guaidó said he has constitutional right to assume leadership because Maduro is an illegitimate ‘usurper’The head of Venezuela’s opposition-run parliament has thrown down the gauntlet to his country’s embattled leader, Nicolás Maduro, declaring himself ready to assume the presidency, in a rare and potentially destabilizing challenge to two decades of Bolivarian rule.Juan Guaidó told a rally in Caracas that Maduro – who began his second six-year term as president on Thursday amid a tempest of international condemnation – was an illegitimate “usurper”.The 35-year-old politician claimed that he therefore had the constitutional right to assume leadership of the country until fresh elections were held.“We are going to change things in Venezuela,” Guaidó told hundreds of cheering supporters in a speech he called his “declaration to the Venezuelan people”.“We aren’t victims. We are survivors ... and we will lead this country towards the glory it deserves,” Guaidó added, calling on the people, the international community and, crucially, Venezuela’s armed forces to support him.Guaidó, who became president of Venezuela’s national assembly last week, admitted there were no “magic solutions” to an economic crisis fuelling what the UN calls one of the greatest exoduses in Latin American history.But he called a day of nationwide demonstrations for 23 January to intensify pressure on Maduro before concluding by shouting the rallying cry: “People of Venezuela: can we, or can’t we?” “¡Sí, se puede!” the crowd roared back. “Yes we can!”The opposition took control of the national assembly in 2015 although it was effectively neutered by Maduro’s controversial creation of a constituent assembly in 2017 that sparked deadly protests.Yesiret Méndez, a 20-year-old student who was in the crowd, said she had come to hear Guaidó’s plan for the future: “And I’m ready to take to the streets again if necessary.”Carmen de Jesús, 70, said she hoped Guaidó would be able to take control. “Maduro is usurping the power and the president of the national assembly should take over as an interim president.”There was international support for the move too, with the head of the Organisation of American States tweeting: “We welcome the assumption of @jguaido as interim President of #Venezuela in accordance with Article 233 of the Political Constitution. You have our support, that of the international community and of the people of Venezuela #OEAconVzla.”But there was also apprehension Guaidó’s audacious move might backfire, triggering a renewed crackdown on regime opponents.“It’s almost certainly going to generate some sort of response from the government,” said David Smilde, a Venezuela expert from the Washington Office on Latin America advocacy group.Addressing a sympathetic audience of Latin American leftists on Friday afternoon, Maduro mocked his challenger, claiming most Venezuelans did not even know who he was. “It is a show … a Hollywood-esque show,” Maduro said, adding: “The Venezuelan right is hopeless.”Venezuela’s chavista prison minister, María Iris Varela Rangel, tweeted a more sinister message: “Guaidó, I’ve already prepared your cell and your uniform, I hope you name your cabinet quickly so I know who is going down with you.”Smilde said Guaidó’s unexpectedly bold challenge to Maduro was a tactic the most radical members of Venezuela’s opposition had been pushing for. “But the problem with that is that they have no actual real power: they don’t control the institutions, they don’t control the guns and they don’t control the money.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3754883.1547218909!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"bradley casts doubt on peace project funding in event of no deal brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNorthern Ireland secretary of state Karen Bradley (centre) with young people involved with the work of Youth Action NI during a visit to its offices in Belfast on Friday. Photograph: David YoungPA WireNorthern Ireland secretary Karen Bradley has cast doubt on whether £300 million (€334 million) of UK government funding for peacebuilding in the North could be delivered if there is a no-deal Brexit. The secretary of state said the proposed withdrawal agreement provided the “legal basis” to offer the financial support to reconciliation initiatives in a joint-funding model with the EU and Irish Government.In the exit deal, the UK and EU have committed to maintaining, up to 2027, funding streams that were first established in the mid-1990s to support projects in Northern Ireland and the Border counties in the Republic.Asked if the £300 million commitment announced by the government on Friday was dependent on the ratification of the withdrawal agreement, she said: “The legal basis upon which this can be delivered is the withdrawal agreement.“It is set out in there and if we leave the European Union without a deal, we will have difficulties in finding a way that the EU and Irish government can spend money jointly with the UK Government in Northern Ireland on these important projects.”The proposed “Peace Plus” scheme will succeed the current peace programme, which was designed to help promote economic and social progress in Northern Ireland and the Border region.The peace programme has been running since 1995 with funding from the UK, Ireland and EU, and will end in 2020.Last May, the EU set out its plan to make £109 million in funding to continue peace projects post-Brexit.The overall funding commitments, if rolled out, will enable work to continue on the construction of almost £1.8 billion worth of projects in both Northern Ireland and Ireland.Among the projects to have received funding to date has been the £14.5 million Peace Bridge in Derry, which was opened in 2011 and links Derry’s communities across the River Foyle.Youth Action NI in Belfast is one of the organisations that has benefited under the existing scheme.The group used the money to set up the Youth Network for Peace, a regional project involving 10,000 young people in a range of social action projects on a cross-community and cross-border basis.Ms Bradley visited Youth Action’s office in the city on Friday.The Northern Ireland secretary did not go so far as to say the government would stop funding the projects in a no-deal scenario, but she stressed that it would be difficult to find a way to do it.“As a government, to spend public money you need to have a legal basis to do so. The withdrawal agreement sets that out.“If we leave without a deal the question will be how do you legally do these things and I am saying to people we have a way of doing it legally – it’s the withdrawal agreement.“That’s why we should vote for the withdrawal agreement on Tuesday in the House of Commons.” - PA"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

These can result in companies being fined up to $525,000 (£291,000) and the poster being fined up to $105,000 (£58,273).Asked about whether the government was considering the Australian model, Baroness Williams said: “One of the things that we always do is look to see what other countries are doing and certainly we are looking into it in the white paper.“Nothing is off the table in terms of what we are looking at in terms of the white paper.”Her comments come as the minister also said social media companies needed to do more to stop people with facial disfigurement and visible conditions being abused online.The charity Changing Faces, which campaigns for people visible differences, said many had experienced abuse online with some having their picture taken in public so they can be mocked on social media.Baroness Williams, who is working with the charity on the issue, said: “I think the responses (from social media companies) are sporadic. Just because something doesn’t meet a legal threshold there are still the terms of user conditions that they have.“Also I think for the social media companies there is a reputational risk here. Social media was actually developed for very positive reasons and we don’t want it to become a platform which certain people can’t go near because of some of the bile that is spat out with a cloak of anonymity.”Becky Hewitt, the CEO of Changing Faces, said social media could be a positive place for people with visible conditions, but that abuse was putting them off.That charity has found that a third do not use their photo on their profile and that some people had had their online photos taken and turned into hurtful memes.She added: “One of the things that people often talk to us about is people taking their photos and without their permission when they are out and about.“So one of our champions talks about a time that she was in the car with her brother and her mum and someone stuck a phone in to get a photo of her and then that can be used on social media as a form of bullying. It is those kind of things that are quite common.”There have been some positive steps taken by social media companies to combat the abuse, such as by Twitter, which has now given Changing Faces special status to report incidents.However Ms Hewitt said many people facing abuse still felt a sense of “resignation” when it came to social media companies taking action.The charity is calling for the government to officially recognise abuse against people with visible conditions in the white paper.Natalie Ambersley, a 36-year-old PA from London who has the skin condition vitiligo, told the : “People don’t realise how damaging and upsetting it can be for that person, so social media platforms should make it a priority.“It can have a really negative impact on how people see themselves.”Department for Culture, Media \u0026amp SportPlease review our commenting policyNo Brexit is increasingly likely, Jeremy Hunt warns as billionaire Leavers say they have given up hopeWhat does a \u0026#39no-deal Brexit\u0026#39 mean - and how would it affect the daily life of Britons?Will Theresa May resign if she loses the Brexit vote?

No one talked about football.Or, if they did, in England, they only made passing reference to the FA Cup matches. But, of the fervent attention normally devoted to the Premier League, there was not a mention.Saturday and Sunday were cup days. And without the Premier League, they felt quite flat as a result.It’s incredible, just how tight is the Premier League’s grip on the national psyche. From a standing start in 1992, it’s grown to become Britain’s most successful brand. You don’t believe me, you’re not that interested in football and you’re attributing my claim to the hyperbole that surrounds the elite of the beautiful game?Mahabis collapse should give other firms pause for thoughtA Populus poll found that far and away the most recognised British brand in the world was the Premier League. They tested 20,000 people in 20 countries with 10 of our best-known names – and the Premier League dominated, miles ahead of the likes of BBC, Rolls-Royce, Jaguar Land Rover, and yes, even the royal family.Hard to imagine, given the stacks of souvenirs for the House of Windsor on sale to tourists in the gift shops, the crowds that flock daily to stand and stare at Buckingham Palace, and the coverage heaped upon Prince Harry’s wedding to Meghan Markle, but, overall, more folk worldwide are interested in the outcome of Man City v Liverpool.Remarkably, as well, reports GlobalWebIndex, the consumer profiling firm, a bigger proportion of the population watches Premier League matches on TV in Thailand, Egypt and Indonesia than in the UK. According to Simon Chadwick, professor of sports enterprise at Salford University Business School, interviewed by Mat Snow for managmenttoday, the clever bit was in making the Premier League competitive.The Premier League has successfully tapped in to consumers’ desire to be part of the creation of a product – ‘co-creation’ or ‘prosumption’ to use the vogue wordsAll the Premier League members have a share (the bottom three are replaced each year by the three coming up) and nobody has more muscle than others. This means that relative to rival leagues overseas, the difference in financial reward between top and bottom is actually fairly small (£150m to the champions Manchester City last season, £95m to bottom-placed West Brom). Because the playing field at least in this regard is reasonably level there is a chance, always, of an upset – that lesser clubs can afford to buy good players and give a decent account of themselves. They can, witness Leicester City, with a fair wind over an entire season, go on and win the thing.Of course, such largesse does not extend to the depth of the owner’s pocket or the strength of support and size of the stadium. So Manchester United, Liverpool, Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham enjoy the advantages of additional wealth and spending power. But at least where a share of the TV rights is concerned, the spoils are distributed more evenly.What every Premier League team needs in the January transfer windowIt’s this competitiveness that makes the Premier League so appealing. Says Chadwick: “On holiday in Sicily in 2012, a group of Swedish guys were watching Barcelona on TV. I was saying how wonderful they were to watch – Messi, Iniesta and so on – but they said, ‘No, this is terrible: it’s just pass, pass, pass. We like the Premier League – it’s fast and intense, a battle between big aggressive guys and quick, skilful little guys.’ It’s basic and primitive. Premier League football is about competing – to survive, to protect our identity, to ward off hostile forces.”What the Premier League\u0026nbsphas mastered also is the art of consumer involvement. Ironically, it’s the aspects that English football used to be so criticised for, says Chadwick, that have become its advantage. “I cannot advocate a sanitised, quiet, perfectly civilised afternoon, a tea party where we kick a ball around. A lot of the Premier League’s strengths, the speed of the game, the tribalism, the passion, are all caught up. If people were not irrationally involved it would not be the great league that it is.”The Premier League has successfully tapped in to consumers’ desire to be part of the creation of a product – “co-creation” or “prosumption” to use the vogue words. Other corporates need to take a look at the Premier League’s success. It’s easy to mock the hype surrounding the league: the vast payments from TV and sponsors, the cost of tickets, the stars’ enormous earnings. But these, along with the breathless excitement of radio phone-ins, Match of the Day, and Sky, complete with its pioneering computer-generated graphics and Gary Neville’s technical analysis, all add up to a compelling package.Involving consumers, giving them a say, listening to them, explaining the product, taking it apart, inspiring loyalty, talking about it – these are all key ingredients in the enticing Premier League mix.The days when customers were encouraged to stay apart, to remain detached, and to take a back seat are long gone. Fans need, and want, to be engaged, to be asked about the business, to feel as though it belongs to them, that they somehow part-own it, and are responsible for its development and evolution.This means taking them with you, communicating to them treating them as equals, and not speaking down to them, not hiding or obfuscating. A tall order, but one that others have managed, not just the Premier League. Richard Branson steered Virgin to heights because he made passengers feel they were sharing in the airline’s journey.The Premier League is back this weekend. I can’t wait. See, that’s the effect it has\u0026nbspthat’s its achievement.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Forsman\u0026nbsphad been working as a photographer for a while, but\u0026nbspshe had only had a few stock images listed on Getty, one of the biggest stock photo agencies. In 2014 she learned\u0026nbspabout Stocksy,\u0026nbspa platform co-operative, which puts the photographer in charge of their own work.\u0026nbspWhy co-operatives could be the answer to the UK\u0027s social care crisisThe design secrets of the UK’s biggest cooperativeThe sharing economy is failing because people can’t be trustedProfessional photographers find it much harder to make money out of stock photographs as smartphones and social media have opened up the field to amateurs. Many aspiring photographers now sell stock photos at a loss to try and make a name for themselves. Agencies have a steady flow of this under-priced content, making it harder to professionals, who are stuck in one-to-one relationships with little bargaining power, to command worthwhile fees.“Photographers can\u0027t act as a group for their interests against exploitative agencies,” Forsman says. “The co-op model makes the photographers organised as an agency, which means that there is nobody to exploit them.”\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialMike Cook, acting chief executive of Stocksy, says putting the workers in control of the business was “a no-brainer”.“Why don’t all businesses work this way?” he says. Stocksy has high-standards for artists that means it can command higher fees, avoiding a race-to-the-bottom in the industry. At Stocksy, photographers get between 50 and 75 per cent of the proceeds when their stock photos are used, significantly higher than the 30 per cent or less offered by other agencies.Forsman says: “This makes it much easier for me to depend on stock for revenue, because the co-op does not exploit contributors but instead seeks to make their work financially sustainable.”Co-operatives have been around since the 19th Century, but technology has opened up new possibilities for how they are run. Next-generation platform co-ops, which bring together global communities of traders in an industry, have been seen as one answer to the problematic gig economy. They are an alternative to top-down platforms like Uber and Airbnb, where executives profit from gig workers who may lack the security of a proper contract and benefits like holiday and sick pay.Platform co-ops are growing in popularity in the UK. In December Equal Care Co-op, or Eccoo, started recruiting care workers in the Calder Valley for a new kind of social care, where those receiving and giving care are in charge of the business, including how much they work and for how long. Rather than changing a commission and extracting value from the workers and those receiving care, Eccoo provides a platform for workers and those receiving care to choose one another and gives them control over how how and for how long they are supported.Eccoo is offering a vital alternative to care agencies that pay minimum wage to employees who have little say over their hours and may be fired on a “one strike and you’re out” system. “The biggest issue for me was having the reassurance of getting enough work and having theright amount,” says Fran Watson, a founding member of equal care and an independent care worker. “I know of no independent care workers who do 15-minute slots. You just can’t do it. The options are either to go with an agency or go it alone.”Forsman, a London-based photographer (Courtesy Photo)In 2017, New Internationalist, a magazine dedicated to social justice and equality, raised £704,114 through community shares, offering its readers the chance to own the magazine in return for securing its future. The editorial staff are still hammering out the processes that readers will contribute to decisions at the magazine.\u0026nbsp“The feelings range from anxiety about what ceding control would look like to excitement about what that represents,” says Hazel Healy, an editor of New Internationalist. “I think it would be hugely beneficial to us and a great experiment to deepen the democracy further but it’s going to need to be cleverly done.”\u0026nbspNew Internationalist has been talking to Stocksy about proprietary software it uses to support decision-making among artists from all over the globe. When Mike Cook first joined Stocksy, the business was making decisions the old-fashioned way, by members submitting motions that were voted on at an annual general meeting.\u0026nbspThis model had its limitations for members that were based in different timezones and speaking different languages. So Stocksy created a system where a contributor can submit an idea, however vague, into a forum for discussion. Members are sent an email to vote if the idea should be advanced. When a minimum quorum of 10 per cent of members have voted yes to a proposal, it is advanced to the board where it can either be approved, or go to a vote.\u0026nbspThe system has already been used to give members the say on whether the membership cap at Stocksy should be lifted. Cook says the decision was one of the most contentious the co-operative had ever faced. “We have customers who love our content but tell us that we don’t have enough. We have worked with our members to create more content where we can, but we have a bell-curve of members, from stay-at-home parents who take photos part time, to full time photographers, make their living from stock.”The membership cap of 1000 artists was forcing Stocksy to prioritise more productive photographers. “It’s hard to say you must produce more or we cut you off,” Cook says. “This is what the cap was making us do, we realised when we got close to the cap we might have to replace some users with more productive ones.”\u0026nbspAt the same time, longstanding Stocksy contributors were worried that lifting the cap would “open the floodgates” of contributors, Cook says, watering down the agency’s reputation for quality. Sara Wager, a hobbiest astrophotographer who creates one or two images of the stars each month, joined Stocksy in 2017. She worried that lifting the cap might stop photographers with a smaller output from contributing. “I reached out to the Stocksy folk and they understood that I have niche images that can take many months to complete and so my uploads will be sporadic,” she says. “They really put my mind at rest that I was as valued a member as anyone else.”Sara was also able to participate in forums discussing lifting the cap. When the proposal was voted through, the board reached a compromise where members could vote to freeze membership each year, depending on how many contributors have been added. “This combination of informal talk, transparency and more formal processes of voting means that I feel a belonging and co-ownership to the co-op,” says Forsman.\u0026nbspStocksy, which employs 29 people at its base in British Columbia and several more in the US, sells photos to larger agencies, tech companies and other business. It had revenues of $10 million in 2018, making it much smaller than standard industry agencies like Getty and iStock. But its business model means that the photographers can command a fairer price than they might at much larger agencies. Cook says that while their decision-making processes might take longer, the transparent process means that photographers feel a sense of loyalty and community at Stocksy that is missing elsewhere.“I realise in the wrong company I’ll sound like a raving socialist,” Cook says. “But the reason we have a business is the contributors, so why shouldn’t they fairly profit from that? It’s not socialism, it’s fairness.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The probe is shown adjusting its altitude, speed and pitch as it seeks to avoid obstacles on the ground.\u0026nbspResearchers hope that low-frequency observations of the cosmos from the far side of the moon, where radio signals from Earth are blocked, will help scientists learn more about the early days of the solar system and birth of the universe\u0027s first stars.\u0026nbspThe far side has been observed many times from lunar orbits, but never explored on the surface. It is popularly called the dark side because it can\u0027t be seen from Earth and is relatively unknown, not because it lacks sunlight.\u0026nbspThe pioneering landing highlights China\u0027s ambitions to rival the U.S., Russia and Europe in space through manned flights and the planned construction of a permanent space station.Additional reporting by Associated PressBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They’ll be mid-flow and she will cock her head and drain all the interest from her face. “What\u0027s the most political thing that\u0027s ever happened?” she asked Robert Peston, who did his best to answer with a straight face. Co-producer Charlie Brooker\u0027s fingerprints are everywhere in the way Morgan\u0027s vain, poorly informed, easily distracted Cunk operates within a ruthlessly satirical production, which sends up the tropes and cliches of every dodgy documentary and history programme. She might not be the comic creation we need, but she is the one we deserve right now. You either love Julia Davis or think her sick filth ought to be banned. Sally4Ever proved yet again that there is nobody working today – or at least nobody with the same platform – with a blacker sense of humour. Sally (Catherine Shepherd) was already surrounded by monsters: her loser of a boyfriend (Alex MacQueen) and tricky colleagues played by Julian Barratt and Felicity Montagu. Then Emma (Davis herself) arrived, a tornado of sex and bad intentions. Beneath the shagging, drugs, excrement, manipulation and malice were pockets of tenderness, but you had to look pretty hard to see them. Luckily there were also gales of laughter. N.b. If you have yet to see it, please do not watch it with your parents or children on Boxing Day and then write in to complain.This was a spiritual successor rather than a sequel to The Night Manager. It was still a Le Carré adaptation on the BBC sprinkled with famous faces, but the differences were as pronounced as the similarities. Park Chan-Wook, the Korean auteur, directed with a high sense of style. Florence Pugh was dazzling as the ingenue actress Charlie, recruited for a dangerous mission across Europe, ably supported by Alexander Skarsgard and Michael Shannon as her spook handlers. Some viewers switched off after the first episodes, which took time to set the scene. They missed out on a vivid, beautifully told thriller. Hugh Grant… can act? That was the first surprise in this smooth, stylish BBC retelling of the Jeremy Thorpe scandal. He burst convincingly out of the charming fop mould he has slept in so comfortably for thirty years. What have we been missing all this time? The other shock was remembering how recent it all was. The government is still up to a lot of nonsense, but the days of this kind of cover-up, for these reasons, is surely over. Or is it?Edward St Aubyn\u0027s Patrick Melrose novels have the kind of precisely drawn interiority that makes any kind of adaptation seem doomed to fail. Instead, the Sky Atlantic series brought them convincingly to life. It is not a happy tale. In flashback we saw Patrick\u0027s childhood in the shadow of his monstrous father David (Hugo Weaving), and the decades of self-loathing and substance abuse that followed. At the centre of all this was Benedict Cumberbatch, as good as he\u0027s ever been. His Patrick could be brilliant, witty, cruel and pitiful, sometimes in the same smack-addled sentence. Weaving, Jennifer Jason Leigh as David\u0027s wife Eleanor and Pip Torrens as his ghastly friend Nicholas Pratt all put in memorable performances, too. At an age where most of us are long past doing anything, David Attenborough is still changing our expectations of what a nature documentary can do. Like The Rolling Stones, he has been on his farewell tour since about 1970, but unlike Jagger \u0026amp Co, the returns are not diminishing. Is he fuelled by anger at the world\u0027s response to climate change? Or simply driven by some massive internal dynamo, a soul-quest to improve our ability to relate to penguins? Whatever the motivation, Dynasties was wonderful, telling complex stories of the animal kingdom with beautiful photography. It\u0027s unusual for a TV writer to attract more attention than the stars or director. Perhaps the world is changing. Or perhaps it\u0027s simply that the writer of Killing Eve was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, star of Fleabag, Star Wars and one of the country\u0027s outstanding new talents. Here she turned her hand to a spy thriller, an adaptation of Luke Jennings\u0027 novels about a beautiful assassin, Villanelle (Jodie Comer), and the MI6 agent given the task of hunting her down, Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh). Both leads demanded attention: Comer the magnetic murderer, Oh the harassed but brilliant spy. The script swerved between comedy, action and drama often enough to keep everyone guessing.  Yes, the national team have played on television in a World Cup before, but I\u0027m including this because the outcome, an England penalty shoot-out victory, was so unusual as to count as a whole new format. At a time when we all watch things at different times, here was something unmistakably live. We watched Gareth Southgate\u0027s men knowing that the rest of the country was, too, poised in living rooms and pub gardens, ready to bury their heads in a sofa or throw their pints in the air. No other TV programme sold as many waistcoats. The ageing patriarch and his scheming children. Not an original concept. Trust, the drama about the last days of Getty family, proved that it was possible for a series built on this premise to have actors, scenery, direction, script, etc etc, and still somehow fall short. Succession, by comparison, felt alive. If US production values and ambition gave it its scale, its heart was dark and British. We can thank Jesse Armstrong, co-creator of Peep Show, and his all-star line-up of British writers, including the Lucy Prebble, Tony Roche and Georgia Pritchett. They made the Roy family expats themselves, and you could hear the old aristocratic froideur in every withering put-down. But we cared for them, too. One of the many TV professionals I consulted for this list thought Succession was so much better than everything else this year that the top 10 should just have it listed in bold and then nine blank spaces. I wouldn\u0027t go that far but it\u0027s certainly at the top.Lennie James\u0027s missing-child thriller Save Me looked as though it might be a paint-by-numbers affair. Instead it was a gripping start to Sky Atlantic\u0027s impressive run, with James taking the lead as Nelly, the womanising bum who gains a new lease of investigative energy when his estranged daughter Jody vanishes. A smart script kept us guessing right up to an ending that denied us the closure we had expected.

It both deepens the mystery and offers a potential opportunity to finally understand what might be throwing out the burst from a galaxy billions of light years away.Fast radio bursts have been speculated to be the result of everything from exploding stars to transmissions from aliens. But they have remained entirely mysterious, with little evidence at all of where they might be coming from.The flashes only last for a milisecond but they are flung out with the same amount of energy the sun takes 12 months to produce.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialProbably most exciting of the new bursts is one that scientists saw repeat six times, apparently from the same location. Of the more than 60 fast radio bursts detected so far, only one of them has ever repeated.\u0026nbsp“Until now, there was only one known repeating FRB. Knowing that there is another suggests that there could be more out there. And with more repeaters and more sources available for study, we may be able to understand these cosmic puzzles—where they’re from and what causes them,” said Ingrid Stairs, a member of the CHIME team and an astrophysicist at UBC.Seeing two repeating signals probably means that there exists – and that humanity will probably find – a\u0026nbspsubstantial population of repeating signals, the researchers write in one of the two papers published in\u0026nbspNature.Having two sets of repeating bursts could also allow scientists to understand what distinguishes them from single bursts, helping them understand more about their source and watch for future blasts.Nasa finds strange alien planet hiding outside our solar systemIn all the researchers spotted some 13 of the bursts in just a three week period, offering a vast new trove of data for the scientists hunting for their source. Together they could offer some evidence of the extreme or unusual environment they are coming from – or the mysterious technology that some claim alien civilisations could be launching them into space with.“Whatever the source of these radio waves is, it’s interesting to see how wide a range of frequencies it can produce. There are some models where intrinsically the source can’t produce anything below a certain frequency,” says team member Arun Naidu of McGill University.The blasts were discovered by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment in British Columbia. Some scientists had worried that the range of frequencies it can pick up would be too low for it to receive the FRBs – but it found far more than expected, and scientists expect it to identify even more.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

It was one of those beams of light, thrown out from the quasar, that happened to pass near a galaxy that happened to bend and magnify the light, sending it towards us and allowing it to be seen today by Nasa-sponsored researchers.Black hole spotted by Nasa provides new insight into mysterious bodiesIf it weren\u0027t for this makeshift cosmic telescope, the quasar\u0027s light would appear about 50 times dimmer, said Xiaohui Fan of the University of Arizona, who led the study. This discovery demonstrates that strongly gravitationally lensed quasars do exist despite the fact that we\u0027ve been looking for over 20 years and not found any others this far back in time.Scientists were able to take observations of the light from the Gemini Observatory, along with data from other observatories, and understand where it had come from.When we combined the Gemini data with observations from multiple observatories on Maunakea, the Hubble Space Telescope, and other observatories around the world, we were able to paint a complete picture of the quasar and the intervening galaxy, said Fan.The light came soon after what is known as the Epoch of Reonisation\u0026nbsp– when the very first light came about.This is one of the first sources to shine as the Universe emerged from the cosmic dark ages, said Jinyi Yang of the University of Arizona, another member of the discovery team. Prior to this, no stars, quasars, or galaxies had been formed, until objects like this appeared like candles in the dark.Quasars are very intense sources of energy that are fuelled\u0026nbspby black holes, and are thought to have been around in the very first galaxies in the universe. They are so bright and distant they can offer a unique glimpse into the beginnings of the cosmos, as in this case.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

People will choose their provider often because of a cheap introductory deal and then stay for the content offering.“However, you shouldn’t accept getting a bad deal, there are potential savings to be made for those who take the time to haggle and even bigger savings for those who switch.”A Sky spokesperson\u0026nbspsaid: “Just like Which? Magazine, we have a range of offers for both new and existing customers. We encourage all of our customers to join Sky VIP – a loyalty programme that says thank you to customers for their time with us, with exclusive offers and experiences.”Digital minister Margot James said: “It is outrageous for loyal customers to be penalised like this and I’d encourage them to always shop around for the best deal once their initial contract ends.“We’ve strengthened Ofcom’s powers to better protect consumers, and will continue to work with Which? and others on a fairer and more transparent system that helps people save money.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The withdrawal agreement sets that out. That’s why we should vote for the withdrawal agreement on Tuesday in the House of Commons.”Mr Lloyd said: “Karen Bradley is showing that she will do anything to push through the prime minister’s botched deal.What is the position of the big trade unions on Brexit?Article 50 set to be extended even if May wins crucial Brexit voteCabinet ministers ‘should resign’ to stop no-deal Brexit, says GrieveTop Brexit donors predict Britain will stay in EUMPs have power to stop no-deal Brexit, says Jeremy Hunt“She is willing to use the peace process in Northern Ireland as leverage and some kind of bargaining tool.”The row comes after the Democratic Unionist Party, which has 10 MPs, rejected Ms May’s plea to rethink its determination to vote against the deal on Tuesday.Because Sinn Fein refuses to take its seats at Westminster, no other Northern Ireland party will have a vote – despite polls suggesting strong public support for the controversial Irish border backstop.The funding would enable work to continue on the construction of almost £1.8bn worth of projects in both Northern Ireland and Ireland.\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As late as Friday morning the prime minister’s official spokesman told reporters any delay to Brexit is not government policy.But the admission that more time will be needed even if the PM wins the vote, let alone if she loses as expected, means Brexit could be knocked back deep into 2019.MPs have power to stop no-deal Brexit, says Jeremy HuntEarlier on Friday, a\u0026nbspsenior minister told the Evening Standard: “The legislative timetable is now very very tight indeed.“Certainly, if there was defeat on Tuesday and it took some time before it got resolved, it’s hard to see how we can get all the legislation through by 29 March.”Mr Hunt appeared to pull the rug from under Ms May’s warning’s that MPs voting against her deal were pushing the country closer to a no-deal Brexit, when he said it was “highly unlikely” that MPs would not find a way to thwart a disorderly exit\u0026nbspif they wanted to.In a dramatic intervention, the foreign secretary also warned that voting down Ms May’s deal next week could actually prevent Brexit, saying it would bring in “Brexit paralysis” with the “possibility in sight” of the UK remaining in the EU.\u0026nbspSpeaking about no deal, Mr Hunt said: “We’ve seen from this week that parliament has the ability to assert itself and to shape outcomes. I think after this week the idea that parliament is going to do nothing at all is highly unlikely.”He said thwarting Brexit would be “potentially very damaging” and warned that it was now a choice between Ms May’s deal and no Brexit. This marks a shift in tone, as the prime minister has repeatedly set out a choice between her deal and no deal.Government insiders are expecting some kind of extra help for Ms May from the European Union by Monday, which they hope will allay some of the concerns that her critics have about the “Irish backstop”. But it is unlikely to be a legally binding guarantee that the UK can exit from it unilaterally, which is what many Tories and Ms May’s DUP partners in government want.Either way one\u0026nbspBBC analysis estimates the government is heading for defeat on Ms May’s withdrawal blueprint by a crushing margin of 228 votes next week.In that even she would have to come back to parliament within three days with a plan for what she does next, with MPs\u0026nbspin a cross-party coalition aiming to put forward proposals at that point for other potential options.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Monday 21 could be parliament’s last chance to avoid the cliff edge. The decision on a people’s vote can’t be put off any longer.”Sarah Wollaston, a leading Tory Final Say supporter, said it was time for the prime minister to concede a fresh referendum on Brexit without delay.“Because parliament has reached an impasse, the right thing for her to do is say ‘parliament can’t decide, I’m going to take it to the people direct’,” she said.Created with Sketch.

It’s wake up time – we have a very short time in which to sort this out.”But Jacob Rees-Mogg pointed out it did not have legal force, saying: “Parliament can pass motions saying the moon is made of green cheese, but that doesn’t mean it’s legally binding.”A total of 17 Tory MPs rebelled, including Ken Clarke and Final Say supporters Justine Greening, Sam Gyimah, Jo Johnson, Philip Lee and Anna Soubry.The fresh setback for the prime minister came as she put herself on another collision course with Brussels, after toughening her stance on the Irish border backstop.The government accepted a backbench amendment that could give the Commons a veto over entry into the backstop – even though it would be legally bound to do so, under the terms of the withdrawal agreement.Furthermore, if the backstop is implemented, the government would have “a duty to have an agreed future relationship or alternative arrangements” with one year, so it “ceases to apply”.Both contradict the orce deal, under which the UK agreed the backstop was the default option if a trade deal is not in place by the end of 2020 and that it should apply indefinitely.The move risked the EU’s wrath while being clearly designed to win over Tory MPs posed to vote down the prime minister’s deal next Tuesday.But it was immediately dismissed by one leading Brexiteer, former minister Steve Baker, who said: “This flimsy rubbish will only persuade those who have decided to be persuaded. Most of us have made our decision.”Until the Grieve defeat, Ms May was only required, after losing on her deal, to make a statement on what will happen next within 21 calendar days and then allow a vote in the Commons within seven sitting days.That subsequent motion was not expected to be amendable until Mr Grieve’s victory, last month, which meant MPs would be able to put forward their alternatives – but only for indicative votes.Before the defeat, Tory MPs raged at Mr Bercow for more than one hour, raising numerous points of order to vent their fury, in the closest the Commons comes to a riot.David Natzler, the Commons clerk and expert on parliamentary procedure, was believed to have advised Mr Bercow that the Grieve amendment should be struck out, because it clashed with standing orders.If the government does table the required motion within three working days, it could come very late on 21 January, postponing any debate until the following day.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In March 2015, Yemen’s Sunni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi was forced into exile after a Shia-led insurgency. A Saudi Arabia-led coalition has responded with air strikes in order to reinstate Mr Hadi. It has since been accused of committing war crimes in the country.Women who supported the Women2Drive campaign, launched in 2011 to challenge the ban on women driving vehicles, faced harassment and intimidation by the authorities. The government warned that women drivers would face arrest. Members of the Kingdom’s Shia minority, most of whom live in the oil-rich Eastern Province, continue to face discrimination that limits their access to government services and employment. Activists have received death sentences or long prison terms for their alleged participation in protests in 2011 and 2012.All public gatherings are prohibited under an order issued by the Interior Ministry in 2011. Those defy the ban face arrest, prosecution and imprisonment on charges such as “inciting people against the authorities”. In March 2014, the Interior Ministry stated that authorities had deported over 370,000 foreign migrants and that 18,000 others were in detention. Thousands of workers were returned to Somalia and other states where they were at risk of human rights abuses, with large numbers also returned to Yemen, in order to open more jobs to Saudi Arabians. Many migrants reported that prior to their deportation they had been packed into overcrowded makeshift detention facilities where they received little food and water and were abused by guards.The Saudi Arabian authorities continue to deny access to independent human rights organisations like Amnesty International, and they have been known to take punitive action, including through the courts, against activists and family members of victims who contact Amnesty.Raif Badawi was sentenced to 1000 lashes and 10 years in prison for using his liberal blog to criticise Saudi Arabia’s clerics. He has already received 50 lashes, which have reportedly left him in poor health. Dawood al-Marhoon was arrested aged 17 for participating in an anti-government protest. After refusing to spy on his fellow protestors, he was tortured and forced to sign a blank document that would later contain his ‘confession’.

Much more can and must be done to protect and assist children.”Children living in countries at war have come under direct attack, have been used as human shields, killed, maimed or recruited to fight. Rape, forced marriage and abduction have become standard tactics in conflicts from Syria to Yemen, and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to Nigeria, South Sudan and Myanmar.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialOver the course of 2018:- In Afghanistan, violence and bloodshed remain a daily occurrence, with some 5,000 children killed or maimed within the first three-quarters of 2018, equal to all of 2017, and children making up 89 per cent of civilian casualties from explosive remnants of war.Unicef photographer captures men bonding with their newborns- Cameroon has seen an escalation of the conflict in the northwest and southwest regions of the country, with schools, students and teachers often coming under attack. In November, more than 80 people, including many children, were abducted from a school in Nkwen, in the northwest of the country and released a few days later. To date, 93 villages have allegedly been partially or totally burned due to conflict in the areas, with many children experiencing extreme levels of violence.- In the Central African Republic, a dramatic resurgence in fighting has enveloped much of the country, with two out of three children in need of humanitarian assistance.- In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, interethnic violence and clashes between security forces and armed groupsmilitia in the Kasai region and in the eastern provinces of Tanganyika, South Kivu, Nord Kivu and Ituri have had a devastating impact on children. The response to the ongoing Ebola outbreak has been seriously hindered by violence and instability in eastern DRC. In addition, an estimated 4.2 million children are at risk of severe acute malnutrition. The situation is compounded by violations of children’s rights, including forced recruitment by armed groups and sexual abuse.Pierre’s mother died after he was born three years ago he now lives with his father in the Central African Republic- In Iraq, even as fighting has largely subsided, four children were killed in November in the north of the country when the truck they were travelling to school in came under attack. Children and families returning to their homes in areas previously impacted by heavy violence continue to be exposed to the danger of unexploded ordnance. Thousands of families remain displaced and now face the additional threats of freezing winter temperatures and flash floods.- In the Chad Basin, ongoing conflict, displacement and attacks on schools, teachers and other education facilities have put the education of 3.5 million children at risk. Today in northeast Nigeria, the lake region of Chad, extreme north of Cameroon and Diffa region of Niger, at least 1,041 schools are closed or non-functional due to violence, fear of attacks, or unrest, affecting nearly 445,000 children.- A recent surge in violence in the border region between Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger has left 1,478 schools closed.- In Myanmar, the UN continues to receive reports of ongoing violations of the rights of Rohingya remaining in northern Rakhine State, which include allegations of killings, disappearances and arbitrary arrests. There are also widespread restrictions on the rights to freedom of movement and barriers to access health and education including in central Rakhine State. Ensuring children have access to quality education and other essential services will avert a “lost generation”\u0026nbspof Rohingya children otherwise they will lack the skills they need to contribute to society.- In northeast Nigeria, armed groups, including Boko Haram factions, continue to target girls, who are raped, forced to become wives of fighters or used as “human bombs”. In February, the group abducted 110 girls and one boy from a technical college in Dapchi, Yobe State. While most of the children have since been released, five girls died and one is still being held captive as a slave.Nawai, 15, during a ceremony to release children from armed groups in Yambio, South Sudan- In Palestine, over 50 children were killed and hundreds more injured this year, many while\u0026nbspdemonstrating against deteriorating living conditions in Gaza. Children in Palestine and Israel have been exposed to fear, trauma and injuries.- In South Sudan, relentless conflict and insecurity throughout the annual lean season pushed 6.1 million people into extreme hunger. Even with the advent of the rainy season, more than 43 per cent of the population remain food insecure. While the promise of a revitalised peace agreement offers a glimmer of hope for children, reports of extreme violence against women and children continue, most recently in Bentiu, where more than 150 women and girls reported suffering horrific sexual assault.- In Somalia, more than 1,800 children were recruited by parties to the conflict in the first nine months of the year, with 1,278 children abducted.Unicef’s research on water predicts one in four children will not have access to clean water by 2040- In Syria, between January and September, the UN verified the killing of 870 children – the highest number ever in the first nine months of any year since the start of the conflict in 2011. Attacks continued throughout the year, including the killing of 30 children in the eastern village of Al Shafa in November.- In eastern Ukraine, more than four years of conflict have taken a devastating toll on the education system, destroying and damaging hundreds of schools and forcing 700,000 children to learn in fragile environments, amid\u0026nbspvolatile fighting and the dangers posed by unexploded weapons of war. The situation is particularly severe for 400,000 children who live within 20km of the “contact line”, which ides the government and non-government-controlled areas and where shelling and extreme levels of mine contamination pose a lethal threat.- and in Yemen, the UN has verified 1,427 children killed or maimed in attacks, including an “unconscionable”\u0026nbspattack on a school bus in Sa’ada. Schools and hospitals have come under frequent attack or been used for military purposes, denying children access to their right to education and healthcare. This is further fuelling a crisis in a country where every 10 minutes, a child dies due to preventable diseases, and 400,000 children suffer from severe acute malnutrition.A doctor measures the arm of Yemeni Ali Mohammed Ahmed Jamal, 12, who is suffering from malnutrition“2019 marks the 30th anniversary of the landmark Convention on the Rights of the Child and the 70th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, yet today, more countries are embroiled in internal or international conflict than at any other time in the past three decades. Children living through conflict are among the least likely to be guaranteed their rights. Attacks on children must end,” Fontaine says.Unicef calls on all warring parties to abide by their obligations under international law to immediately end violations against children and the targeting of civilian infrastructure, including schools, hospitals and water infrastructure. Unicef also calls on states with influence over parties to conflict to use that influence to protect children.In photos: a toddlers recovery from malnutritionConflict in Congo has led to children being recruited as soldiers“Much more needs to be done to prevent wars, and to end the many disastrous armed conflicts devastating children’s lives. Yet even as wars continue, we must never accept attacks against children. We must hold warring parties to their obligation to protect children. Otherwise, it is children, their families and their communities who will continue to suffer the devastating consequences, for now, and for years to come,” Fontaine says.Across all these countries, Unicef works with partners to provide the most vulnerable children with health, nutrition, education and child protection services. For example, in October, Unicef helped to secure the release of 833 children recruited into armed forces in northeast Nigeria, and are working these children to reintegrate them into their communities. Since conflict broke out in South Sudan five years ago, Unicef has reunited almost 6,000 unaccompanied and separated children with their families.

He said: “We won’t see signicant price rises.

And as this carries on day in, day out, we see no nightmare queues of lorries backed up at our ports.In fact, there is no friction at all at the borders even though much of the “just in time” delivery we depend on comes from outside the European Union.We are not told the Civil Service is ready and prepared to handle a No Deal Brexit. This plan is being withheld from MPs and the British people in order to push Mrs May’s withdrawal agreement, which could bind us to EU control indefinitely.Make no mistake, Her Majesty’s Revenue  Customs are ready for a No Deal Brexit. All computer systems will be ready by January  and businesses have been advised about “Trusted Trader Schemes” to keep trade flowing.The EU has announced plans for visa-free travel and aviation rights.The French have installed high-tech scanners at Calais to keep both trade and tourism flowing.Friendly “Open Skies” agreements have been signed with our most important partners outside the EU — the US and Canada.

He knows it is your final one and there won’t be any more forthcoming. But don’t worry. He has passed a motion. And the motion is clear. He completely rules out failing to do a deal with you.I have attended many boring political meetings and witnessed many fatuous ­political acts. Student meetings, tiny party branch meetings, national executive ­meetings of failing political parties, cabinet meetings of governments heading towards landslide defeats.And in all that time I have never ­participated in, indeed never witnessed, anything quite as fatuous or fruitless as voting to insist that we won’t leave the European Union without a deal. It’s not that I’m calm about the prospect of leaving without a deal. Or that I’m willing to support doing so.It’s just that not having a deal cannot be stopped by saying: “I’m against not having a deal”. It can only be stopped by ­agreeing to one.The Tory Nicky Morgan and Labour’s Yvette Cooper and Hilary Benn joined ­forces on Tuesday to make it harder for the Government to let Britain leave the EU without a deal. Their motion was backed by a majority of MPs. But it still has three fairly obvious shortcomings.First, the Government isn’t in favour of leaving the EU without a deal. It agrees there shouldn’t be “no deal”. It has a deal. It is in favour of passing its deal. Second, the Government doesn’t need to be reminded about the damaging ­consequences of leaving without a deal.It knows what they are. Making it harder to prepare doesn’t make the ­Government keener to avoid no deal, because it’s keen to do that already.The third point is the most important one. Among those who argue that no deal must be avoided, there appears little agreement on what the alternative might be. The main sponsors of yesterday’s footling motion in the Commons are admirably open-minded but appear to have no idea how to win the majority of MPs around to their open-mindedness.I suppose these anti-no-dealers think they are warning Theresa May that,her deal is defeated next week, she has to come up with something . But this advice is only sensiblethere is an obvious alternative that stands a ­better chance of passing the Commons. Come on, really, what is that I’ll make a personal point at this stage. I believe that the referendum produced a legitimate outcome that Parliament has a duty to implement. It would be a grotesque failurewe were not able to arrange to leave.I’ve been against a second referendum all along. But even so, I insist that the departure should be orderly. I’m not ­willing to support a calamitous crashing-out, evenit means accepting the shame of failing to implement Brexit.Yet what do the anti-no-dealers offer to someone like me, who ought to be one of their natural supporters  Nothing except the frivolous message that they, too, are against no deal. And a perverse deter­mination to make an ­accidental no deal even worse than it might otherwise be.In those circumstances the only sensible position for me is to back the Prime ­Minister’s deal and urge Morgan, Cooper and Benn to do the same. Let’s look at the options once Mrs May’s deal is defeated in the Commons vote, as it seems it will be.There is the idea that she might be defeated in a no-confidence motion, lose the ensuing election and be replaced by a Corbyn government that negotiates a new deal. Except that a successful no-confidence motion is highly unlikely and there certainly won’t be a new deal, evenLabour got into power.By the way, the Labour Party is now toying with fighting an election, proposing a renegotiation with Brussels which would be followed by a public vote. In this vote, would they back leaving the EU  Or are they seriously suggesting they renegotiate a deal which they then urge voters to reject by recommending we stay in the EU after all Brussels would ­certainly want that. So you would have two sides negotiating a withdrawal ­agreement that both hope would fail. I think we can safely scrub that one off the list of sensible ideas.Next, there is the option of arranging to remain in the single market, in a Norway-style arrangement. This would require support from the Labour front bench to succeed because a lot of Tories would oppose it, evenMrs May agreed to it. But Labour has ­repeatedly resisted this idea. At the moment, a Norway-style deal stands less chance of success than Mrs May’s deal.A more realistic option is that ­Parliament supports a permanent customs union. Shortly after next week’s vote, members of the House of Lords will ­consider the Trade Bill.Peers will almost certainly pass an amendment to the bill, allowing Britain to stay in a permanent customs union with the EU. That creates a showdown in the Commons, where it is quite possible, given the strength of support, that the ­Government would have to agree.This would cause turbulence in the ­Government but, crucially, it would allow Labour to support Mrs May’s dealit wanted to — and to get it through the ­Commons. However, I doubt very much that it will want to. Labour only supports a customs union in which we get to decide on trade deals, which is not on the table.Then, of course, there is the possibility of delaying Brexit with or without a ­second referendum. Labour is still ­resisting this option and,it backs it at all, might do so in a form which is impossible to implement, such as ­insisting its own renegotiateddeal be on the ballot paper.In these circumstances, the chance of us accidentally ending up with no deal is very large. It is irresponsible to hinder any preparations we may need to make.We should be thinking harder about how to manage it. What side-deals do we need on things like air travel  Is there any way of agreeing a short transition   What physical preparations are in place Passing motions against such measures is worse than foolish — it’s positively reckless.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Not just Leavers. Most Remainers do too.They accepted their referendum defeat with a grace that would shame Tories like Dominic Grieve and Anna Soubry, and most of Labour’s MPs,they had enough humility to feel it.Yesterday Bercow let the Commons vote, without debate, to force Theresa May to produce a Brexit “Plan B” in three working daysand when her deal is rejected next Tuesday. The aim is to swtly paint her into a ­corner from which her only escape is the second referendum Remainers optimistically believe would reverse Brexit.Bercow, supposedly the gatekeeper of our ancient Commons procedures, defied his officials’ advice and tore up the rule book to make this happen.Why  Because this supposedly unbiased Speaker deludes himself, like the Remain diehards whose dirty work he enables, that he is the dashing hero of a noble anti-Brexit ­insurgency .That’s right: the first “rebellion” to take back control for London’s rich, europhile establishment elite from a public that demanded change and was promised it by these very same politicians.Bercow has violated the impartiality of a historic office which he still holds solely because Remainers disgracefully ignored serious bullying allegations against him to secure his help.But equally dishonourable are those Tories whose weird religious devotion to the EU would now see them sacrice their own Prime Minister, Government, party and — more importantly — the ­stability of our democracy and country.The same goes for Corbyn’s MPs, who lie about honouring the Leave votes of millions of Labour supporters but would reject ANY deal Mrs May produced for one reason: it would mean leaving the EU.We hope the constituents this dismal rabble are busy betraying will make amends whenever an election is called.As for John “B****cks to Brexit” ­Bercow, his prejudices have skewed his judgment, fatally compromised his role, are directly hindering Brexit and have cost him the trust of half the Commons.Time’s up.A BOY of  butchered in the street. Parts of London looking like a Mexican drug-war zone. What’s the Mayor doing about it Or is he too busy banning fast food ads, blowing millions on fireworks promoting the EU or vacuously boasting “London Is Open”, asit would ever close PR opportunities are all that interest Sadiq Khan.

This means investing more in the benefit so people have enough to live on and don’t have to wait five weeks for a first payment, while also making sure it is paid in a way that works for people’s inidual circumstances.”In February single mum Elise, , who lives near Manchester, moved on to UC and immediately her £ Child Tax Credit weekly payments were stopped, leaving her unable to pay nursery bills for -year-old Lexey and Darcy, .Previously the government had covered around  per cent of her £ a week childcare bills, paying this sum directly to the nursery.Elise, who is currently pregnant with her third child, was able to pay the weekly shortfall of £ out of her monthly £ salary.Under the new system parents are able to claim back up to  per cent of childcare costs - but they must do this in arrears, meaning they need the cash up front to pay the nursery bills.Elise struggled to find the money to pay for her daughters childcare, and when she failed to pay her bills in August, Lexey and Darcy lost their nursery places.I was devastated. Lexey in particular was so settled and really enjoyed going to nursery, said Elise. “Now they are at home all the time, missing out, missing their friends. Its awful, I feel so sad for them.Ms Rudd said this morning: “These parents made decisions about the size of the family when the previous system was the only one in place.“So today I can announce that I am going to scrap the extension of the two child limit on Universal Credit before children born before April .”She said the welfare system should reflect British values of “fairness and compassion” and help people who have lost their way.But she will still press ahead with plans to pilot , people this year onto the new system, and learn from that approach for the other  million who will be transferred later.“It is there to help a person get through a dficult stage in le – it is not meant to be a mode of long term subsistence for those who can work.“I believe that for the vast majority of people it is ultimately work, not benefits, which provides the route to a better le.”The pilot will begin in July this year and over the next  months Rudd will continue to review the system.But it wasnt enough to cover their bills and buy food so they ended up flogging their stuff and taking out payday loans - and now owe over £,.It made us feel so humiliated, worthless, said Kirsty. “Having worked so hard for everything only then to lose it because of Universal Credit, it’s very damaging to a human being.They never know how much theyll get on Unviersal Credit due to Dales job as a HGV driver due to his unpredictible hours and have been hit by the taper rate.If Dale is lucky enough to secure more shts than usual in a month then the familys Universal Credit payment is taxed at a rate of  pence per pound.“It’s making people vulnerable, knowing they have to wait a certain number of weeks to get a payment, she said. People will turn to drugs, prostitution, loan sharks."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT0004606932901.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may brexit deal faces record commons defeat","story":"The PM is on course for an eye-watering defeat by a majority of  during the meaningful vote on Tuesday, research by the BBC found.In a huge blow to No, it emerged that  more MPs have come out to oppose her EU agreement since she delayed a vote on it in December, fearing a catastrophic drubbing.Judging by their public comments so far, a total of  MPs will still vote against it – including  Tories – and just  will back it.It came as Theresa May called Jeremy Corbyn’s biggest union donor – Unite’s Len McCluskey – as part of a new charm offensive to woo Labour backers to her deal.She also called GMB general secretary Tim Roache for the first time in three years as the Government signalled it would back an amendment by Labour MPs to protect workers’ rights.In one ray of hope for the PM, two Tory MPs revealed they had switched to supporting the PM, including her former policy chief George Freeman who said: “We’re playing with fire”.No are hopeful of whittling down the scale of the defeat over the weekend, and as many as  Labour MPs are also expected to declare backing for her.But No aides still fear a three-figure thrashing, with one saying last night: “There is no indication the dam is about to break.

I want to hold you tight.  . . . I want to kiss your lips . . . I love you.”The previous month he is said to have texted: “I love you, alive girl. I will show you with my body, and my lips and my eyes, very soon.”Chopper pilot Lauren, who has worked on Fox News and Extra, reportedly separated from husband Hollywood agent Patrick Whitesell before Christmas.He represents a host of A-list stars such as Matt Damon, Hugh Jackman and Kevin Costner.Lauren, who has three children, was also married to NFL star Tony Gonzalez and was previously engaged to Hollywood actor Henry Simmons. Insiders said she was always popular with men - and knew how to “use her sex appeal”. Lauren is very beautul and talented, so we knew shed go far,” one source told Sun Online. “She was very popular with rich and successful men - especially athletes.“She was so good at attracting these guys we’d refer to it as ‘The Sanchez Method.’She climbed to the top quickly andshe ever had a tough time, she always landed on her feet. “Its no surprise that despite her marriage not working out, shes landed on top.”Another source revealed how the brunette used to outshine everyone in the room by wearing sexy outfits. Lauren knows how to use her feminine wiles - she is always noticed,” they said. “I remember seeing her arrive at a Stuart Weitzman Oscar event wearing the lowest cut dress in the room and stiletto heels. “She always had the best figure, and there wasnt a man in the room that didnt notice.The lowest cut dress and the highest heels possible, that was her style. “She went for powerful rich men and was known for dating whos who in Hollywood. “I remember she went through a period of dating NBA players.”One industry insider recalls seeing Lauren “flirting” with celebrities during red carpet interviews during her time as a TV presenter. While at a Hollywood movie premiere, I remember her on the red carpet relentlessly flirting with Kevin Costner,” the source said. “She was giggling and touching his shoulder and throwing her hair around. It was funny because he was loving every minute of it. She just has that way about her.Lauren knows how to use her sex appeal, but she is always sweet to everyone. You would be hard pressed to find anyone who would say she wasnt nice.At another movie premiere she was working hard to get interviews and was leaning over the fence. “She had the tiniest skirt on and I remember thinkingshe leans one more inch we would have a show.Her marriage seemed strong so it was sad to hear the news. He was the big shot Hollywood agent and they seemed very much inseparable, but I suppose its tough to compete with Jeff Bezos.Lets face it, she hit the jackpot. We are talking prime, Amazon Prime!”The source also recalled how Lauren was so ambitious and eager to succeed in her career she even changed her name from Wendy to Lauren after TV execs asked her to.When she first started working in LA, I remember she was chosen for a very competitive on camera position with little experience - she just was one of those women that stood out,” the insider said. When she was offered a job on Extra her name was still Wendy. “They basically told her, We already have a Wendy and they asked her to use a dferent name. “She used her middle name Lauren. I dont think she was thrilled about doing it, but she has never changed it back. It stuck and it suits her.”Lauren also runs a company called Black Ops Aviation, which specialises in shooting aerial shots for TV shows, movies and commercials.She is believed to have got together with Bezos while her company was shooting aerial video for one of his side ventures, Blue Origin.They were most recently seen together at Amazons Golden Globes party on Sunday.Meanwhile Bezos and we MacKenzie, who have four kids, said they broke up after a “trial separation”.The statement read: As our family and close friends know, after a long period of loving exploration and trial separation, we have decided to orce and continue our shared lives as friends.If we had known we would separate after  years, we would do it all again.It added: “We remain cherished friends.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT0004607044033.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"remainer mps misled voters brexit","story":"Remainer MPs clearly now have no intention of carrying out the majority’s Leave instructions, either from the ­referendum or from last year’s election when both the Tories and Labour stood on pro-Brexit s.If Corbyn gets the snap election he claims to want, what will be the point of either main party’s new manesto  Who is mug enough to believe them Remainer MPs have systematically misled voters, respecting the referendum only when they thought they would win it, then pretending to honour the result while plotting to destroy it.Thanks to their sickening sabotage, Government incompetence and a Commons Speaker gone rogue, Brexit is now fighting for its le.

But the remarkable thing about this row is that it will be based on the assumption that Theresa May has already lost this vote — and lost big.No one is pretending that May is going to win on ­Tuesday night. From No  to the Cabinet, everyone admits that it is lost. The optimists think the right amendments can keep the ­margin of defeat down to ­double digits, but that is as far as their expectations go.The row will be about what to do once the Government has lost. One faction in the Cabinet believes that, in the words of one secretary of state, “the only realistic route to go down is to force it into the EU’s hands”.This would involve devising a motion that made clear under what conditions Parliament would back the deal. Then saying to the EU: If you want to avoid No Deal, this is what we need to address.One Cabinet minister who supports this approach says: “They don’t have the agility or the time to construct that for Tuesday. But they should devise it for ten days’ time and bung it over to Europe.”But another group of Cabinet ministers thinks May can only pass a deal with “signicant Labour support” and so she should invite Jeremy ­Corbyn in for talks after defeat on Tuesday.One champion of this approach tells me: “If she does it well, she can make him take some responsibility.” This secretary of state ­concedes, though, that they don’t know whether May will do this or not, saying: “She is like a train on one track. She doesn’t know how to move.” So, what will Mrs May do Well, one of the few, who can claim to know her mind, tells me: “If the votes won’t come from the Tories, they have to come from Labour. What are the conditions for that going to be ”In other words, vote down this deal and Brexit only gets softer. No  is also deeply pessimistic about getting much more out of the EU than it is already doing. So, May is highly unlikely to go down the route of asking Parliament to show the EU what kind of deal it would agree to.At Cabinet this week, May tolerated some discussion of what would happen next. “No customs union, no second ­referendum. That’s the core for her,” reports one of those present. But will May hold the line on a customs union when that is Labour’s biggest single demand May’s deal is flawed. How could it not be, given the ­failure to prepare properly for No Deal, which has so weakened the UK’s negotiating position, and the loss of the Tory ­majority in Parliament which has hobbled Mrs May But the reality is thatthis deal doesn’t pass, Brexit will only be weakened. The Government doesn’t want No Deal and doesn’t think it could get it through this ­Parliament evenit did.That means it will soften the deal to try to get Commons support for it.The danger for Brexiteers is that voting against this deal could make it worse, not better.EVERY Tory MP needs to remember that a Jeremy Corbyn government would do huge damage to the United Kingdom.Privately, a growing number of Tory MPs who are passionately opposed to No Deal are flirting with the idea of bringing down the Government to stop it,necessary. This would make a Corbyn premiership almost inevitable.Now, No Deal would be disruptive and, given how late in the day the Government has left serious contingency planning, that disruption would be damaging to the UK and its reputation.But this pales into insignicance compared to what a Corbyn government would mean. Labour’s plan to make companies with more than  employees hand over ten per cent of their shares to their workers would do huge damage to the UK’s reputation for respecting property rights.It would contribute to massive capital flight from the UK and inflict lasting damage on the UK as a place in which to do business and invest.But the economic damage that a Corbyn government would do wouldn’t be the half of it. Would our closest allies, led by the United States, really carry on sharing the most sensitive intelligence with us with Corbyn in charge I doubt it. Once unwound, the level of security co-operation between Britain and the other members of the Five Eyes security group would be impossible to put back together.Risking Corbyn becoming PM because you are worried about No Deal is like amputating your leg to prevent your toes getting frostbite.So, let’s consider the events of the past week. The governing parties in Italy have sent messages of solidarity to the Yellow Vests in France, a group who want to remove the French President from office.Italy itself may well already be in recession and with industrial output falling sharply in Germany, even the powerhouse of the eurozone might be going that way.This is a reminder that it would be deeply ignorant to blame every bit of bad economic news on Brexit and that the EU’s problems have not gone away.AT a private meeting with Tory MPs on Wednesday night, Sajid Javid again made clear that he’s a very dferent Home Secretary from Theresa May.Talking about the rise in violent crime, Javid said: “Sadly, we’ve seen a drop in stop-and-search”, before talking about how its use was now increasing again.This was a clear attempt to distance himself from the Prime Minister. For who was more responsible than anyone  for the decline in use of stop-and-search, than the then Home Secretary Mrs May Javid’s comments will do little for the already badly strained relations between the Home Office and No .ORDER is close to breaking down completely in the Commons chamber.Tory MPs are so outraged by Speaker John Bercow’s behaviour that there is a real danger of them simply refusing to accept his authority.On Tuesday’s big vote, there will be a series of amendments – some of which will be designed to help the Government, others not.One influential member of the Government warns that “ he’s openly partisan in his amendment selections then I think there’ll be uproar and he could lose the House”.One secretary of state warns that in these circumstances you could have “ MPs stand up and completely disobey him”. If this happened, Bercow would either have to suspend the session or start chucking Tory MPs out of the chamber.Is it really feasible to have the Speaker eject scores of MPs ahead of one of the most important parliamentary votes in decades The flagrancy with which Bercow has changed the rules leaves him vulnerable to Tory MPs deciding that they, too, are going to flout convention and refuse to sit down when he tells them to.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Villagers have to live in thatch and stick hovels they are at constant risk of infectious disease as they could only collect rainwater to drink. The scarce resources in the village left children with no choice but to walk an hour and a half over a narrow path to attend school in the town of Chapotin.

This year my children will not go to school, said village farmer Wilber Jean in October, as his children played nearby.  Here you pay a ton. There, pointing across the border, the president pays. Youngsters are often asked to collect firewood or graze small flocks of goats and sheep to help their parents.

Tory Amber Rudd admitted parts of the system are not compassionate as she announced changes to the two-child limit, payments to landlords and the movement of millions of claimants. The Work and Pensions Secretary also promised action in the future on inequalities that its claimed hand all the money - and power - to domestic abusers. But with million people set to be on Universal Credit with no transition payments by Christmas, unions, charities and Labour blasted her for not going far enough. So what has actually been announced today, how will it hit you, and where does it fall short  Heres a guide to five big things that have been announced - and five injustices still in the system.  A wicked cut hitting , families a year will be cancelled in a U-turn - three weeks before it was due to take force. Tory welfare chief Amber Rudd announced she is axing an extension of the two-child limit that was set to kick in on February . The policy stops parents claiming Tax Credits or Universal Credit for more than two children - a cut of up to pound, per child. It applies to children born after the cut took effect in April  - but from February was due to apply retrospectively, hitting children born before the cut was dreamed up. That extension has been scrapped, putting poundmillion back in claimants pockets over three years.   BUT HERES THE CATCH: Amber Rudd faced fury for keeping the two-child limit overall - claiming it is fair. The Institute for Fiscal Studies - which has warned the policy would hurl , children into poverty - said the long-term impact will be the same because eventually all children will be born after . By the mid-s, the IFS believes it will cut , families benefits. UNISON general secretary Dave Prentis said: “The two-child limit is morally wrong and should be scrapped for everyone.Kate Henderson, Chief Executive of the National Housing Federation, said: “These families will still be just as vulnerable to falling into poverty as those who are now being exempted. This policy causes real hardship for thousands of people, and we would urge the Secretary of State to remove the cap altogether. Labour shadow work and Pensions Secretary Margaret Greenwood said: “This partial U-turn does not go far enough. She added: The Government must stop the [UC] roll out immediately before more people are pushed into financial hardship.  Changes will be brought in later this year to ensure the UC payment goes directly to a familys main carer more often. Amber Rudd said she had listened to arguments that the one payment per household system punishes women. By paying men in a household, UC can allow domestic abusers to have a financial grip over their partner. Women can never be truly free until they have economic independence, the top Tory said. I am looking at what more we can do to enable the main carer to receive the UC payment. An [I] will begin to make those changes later this year. Womens Aid said it was a step in the right direction to empowering more women to safely escape domestic abuse. BUT HERES THE CATCH: This solution stops short of the automatic split payments that many womens refuge payments have demanded. And Ms Rudd has not actually said what the changes will be, or exactly when theyll be brought in. . More people will have rent paid directly to their landlord  More UC claimants will have their rent paid directly to their landlord out of their benefits through a new online system. It comes after a torrent of complaints that people received too little benefits to pay their rent, and faced eviction. Ms Rudd said: One third of UC claimants in social rented housing have their rent paid direct to the landlord. But in the private sector that numbers only %. People in the private rented sector already face a far higher risk of losing their tenancy. And I know from talking to claimants and landlords that the current system isnt working for some of them. So we need to make it easier for tenants in the private sector to find and keep a good home by giving landlords greater certainty that their rent will be paid. Therefore Ive asked the department to build an online system for private landlords so they can request where necessary for their tenants rent to be paid directly to them. Chris Town, Vice Chair of the Residential Landlords Association hailed the decision. BUT HERES THE CATCH: The online system will only be optional for landlords, we dont know exactly when or how itll launch or what itll be like, and online benefit portals have a history of foul-up and failure. . Youll be able to get paid more than once a month  At the moment, most UC claimants are paid monthly which is meant to mirror the world of work. But after years of complaints, Ms Rudd finally admitted today: For others this approach does not work. Managing their money month to month can be challenging, even impossible. That could cause dficulties for people who are already vulnerable and Im determined to do more to help those claimants. So Jobcentres are now being asked how we can improve the provision of more frequent payments for new claimants, she said. Pilots will start shortly and then rolled out further once we have evidence of what works. BUT HERES THE CATCH: There is, again, no detail of how this help will work. She also referred to new claimants, which raises the question of what happens to people already on UC. . You might not be forced to pay for childcare up-front  UC claimants with childcare costs get % of them funded. But they have to pay up-front - leaving many turning to food banks. Today Ms Rudd admitted: I recognise this can cause financial dficulty, with some claimants struggling to pay up front or report their costs on time. So she has asked Jobcentres to make two changes. First,the first months childcare costs prevent a claimant from starting work, that claimant should be supported through jobcentres Flexible Support Fund. Second, Jobcentres should be flexible when parents are unable to report their childcare costs immediately. BUT HERES THE CATCH: Asking Jobcentres to show flexibility and discretion is a policy thats been fraught with problems in the past. If someones treated more unfairly in Watford than Leicester, could they complain the DWP is being unfair   things that ARENT being fixed . The -week wait for payment ISNT being cut  Amber Rudd rowed back sharply on claims she could cut the five-week wait people face for their first UC payment. She had hoped to cut it back - but today claimed Im satisfied with what weve got. Citing advance loans and run-on payments she said: I think we have addressed some of the key elements. But Im going to keep an eye on it because I recognise the most important thing in Universal Credit is that people have confidence in the system but also they get the money early enough. She added: At the moment Im satisfied with what weve got but Im going to keep it under review to see that we are addressing peoples needs for getting their money as early as possible. . The benefit freeze WONT end early  Ms Rudd said shed like to end the four-year benefit freeze - which has cut almost poundbn a year from families pockets - in spring . But thats just when it was due to end anyway. And she admitted: I havent had any further conversations with the Chancellor so Id better not say anything too definitive at this stage. Campbell Robb, Chief Executive of the independent Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: The benefits freeze continues to be the single biggest policy sweeping families into poverty.If the Government is serious about being on the side of low-income families they will take immediate action to end this freeze one year early. Lib Dem MP Christine Jardine said: Instead of putting the most vulnerable in society through another  months of misery, Rudd should end the benefits freeze immediately.  Amber Rudd confirmed she is delaying a vote by MPs on moving million existing benefit claimants to Universal Credit. MPs will approve only , trial cases for managed migration from this summer, with a full vote to be held at a later date. The Tory welfare chief said: Im not going to be rushed into the mass migration of existing claimants onto Universal Credit. My priority is to ensure the transition is done well. But Ms Rudd has insisted there will be no overall delay.Evenits pushed back, everyone will be moved over by .Secondly, youll STILL move overyou have a change of circumstances - see below... . The number of people on UC will double this year  Therell be million people on UC by Christmas - more than doubling the number on the benefit this year. Of those, hundreds of thousands will be existing benefit claimants who move over because they have a change of circumstances. Unlike the group thats being held back, they wont get any transition payments. Challenged by the Mirror, Ms Rudd was unable to say this decision was compassionate. Instead she said: The overall product that is Universal Credit is absolutely compassionate. . Workers are still being left out of pocket While Ms Rudd was giving her speech, four working single mums won a High Court challenge over Universal Credit. The women argued that a fundamental problem with the scheme means their monthly payments y enormously and they end up out of pocket. Two judges in London announced on Friday that the women - who say they are struggling financially because of the way the system operates - had succeeded in a judicial review action against the Work and Pensions Secretary. The ruling is a huge embarrassment for the government. The women challenged the method used by the Department for Work and Pensionswhen calculating the amount payable when their income changes month to month. Margaret Greenwood, Labour’s Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, said: “It’s a disgrace that four single mothers have had to take the Government to court because of the impact that Universal Credit has had on their lives.“The Tories must stop the roll out of Universal Credit to ensure no more people are plunged into poverty and deprivation.” Asked about the case Ms Rudd said: Youll have to bear with me, Im not going to reply in full to that yet. Im going to have to consider it in the department and then well be coming forward with what our response is going to be.

A group of white supremacists had taken offence at something I’d written, put my address online and told their small band of pointy-hatted followers to pay me a visitthey could spare half-an-hour away from planning the global master race takeover. When the police askedI wanted a panic alarm installed I laughed and declined, mainly because I guessed that rather than come round and shoot me, the sad inadequates preferred to waste their lives eating Pot Noodles in their mum’s spare bedroom. Which brings us neatly to those noble protesters outside Parliament. First, some praise: well done fellas for sourcing extra extra large yellow jackets, for blocking ambulances on Westminster Bridge and choosing such tough targets – Sky’s Kay Burley, who you called “a slag” and Faisal Islam “a rapist” while both were broadcasting.   Oh, and managing to trap -year-old Anna Soubry in a gammonshysandwich, spitting phlegm-speckled abuse into her face and chanting “Nazi” as she tried to go to work. You hard men truly are the patriots I’d like to share a trench with. They resemble the thickest elements of travelling England football fans. I’m surprised there’s no footage of them chanting “ it wasn’t for the English you’d be Krauts” at red tourist buses while urinating on Gandhi’s statue. By the way, they’re not just protesting against Remainers. The xenophobic narrative unleashed by Brexit liberated a thousand cranky right-wing groups who now have a series of demands they believe the “liberal elite” has a duty to grant. Take the Poundshop Tommy Robinson figure, James Goddard, who was the loudest bellower of abuse. He’s on record as saying we should be able to kick every Muslim out of this Christian country. Yes, it’s definitely Soubry who thinks like the Nazis. Following the deferential shytreatment Robinsonwas given by the BBC, narcissistic opportunists like Goddard have been led to believe they are merely a snarling video on their iPhone away from fame, wealth and adulation among their fellow plankton.  Like Yaxley-Lennon, Goddard streams his political stunts on social media alongside appeals for PayPal donations which would finance his continued abusing of MPs like Anna Soubry. Call it a pay-per-spew service. While many people have called for this motley crew to be dealt with by police, certain right-wing commentators have defended their right to intimidate and abuse on the grounds that sshytopping it would take away our hard-earned liberties. Sure, that’s what Dunkirk was all about. But you know what, I’m on their side. The last thing we should do is arrest the likes of Goddard as he is aching to stand outside a court and declare himself a modern-day martyr like his hero Yaxley-Lennon. I’ve learned from helping to see off extreme right-wing groups in my home city that the best method is to laugh loudly in their faces, reminding them how banal they are. So, rather than asking coppers to get heavy with them, why not place dozens of models of The Laughing Policemen around Westminster and set them off whenever these two-bob revolutionaries start to bleat.

She added: This is yet another demonstration of how broken Universal Credit is and why its rollout must be stopped. Child Poverty Action Group solicitor Carla Clarke added: The DWP has designed a rigid process that is out of step with both actual reality and the law. The DWP is considering whether to appeal.

But the sight of a Jaguar, Land Rover or a Mini – that’s a dferent matter. Cars are special, they’re symbolic of a country more than any other goods or product. I’m sure an Italian, seeing an Alfa Romeo on a street in Sydney, will feel the same way. A country’s car industry is also a symbol of the nation’s economic health. The s was a time of enormous industrial unrest and no image sticks in my memory more than the strikes and shutdowns at British Leyland. A broken car company reflected an economy in dire trouble. Almost as bad as uncollected rubbish in the streets.  Today almost all of our car makers are owned by foreign companies. Even Aston Martin, preferred wheels of % British James Bond, is owned by investors from Italy and Kuwait. Jaguar Land Rover is run by India’s Tata. But the important thing is that these companies provide jobs. Accorshyding to the Society of Motor Manshyufacshyturers and Traders, , are employed directly or indirectly in the sector.   And the SMMT says it is these jobs MPs should remember in Tuesday’s Brexit vote. For they could be put catastrophically at risk by a no-deal exit. This week Jaguar Land Rover announced , jobs were going at its UK plants. Brexit’s played a part but the biggest blow is a shocking % drop in sales in China in November. Then there’s the drop in popularity of diesel cars which, since % of its sales are diesel, has hit Land Rover hard. JLR boss Ralph Speth has been one of the most blunt commentators on a hard Brexit, warning it could lead to plant closures and thousands of lost jobs.  In October JLR opened a factory in Sloshyshyvakia which will eventually be able to build , cars a year. It’s likely Jaguar’s Castle Bromwich plant will close in the next few years but I worry JLR won’t be able to sustain the remaining Solihull and Halewood plants and keep the Slovak factory, where production costs are lower, at full capacity. A no-deal Brexit in March would have a substantial and immediate effect, mainly because of the just-in-time method of car production. If parts are delayed and the production line has to be stopped it costs millions.  A few years ago at a small airshyshyport near Peterborough, a surshyshyprising number of helicopters were coming and going. I asked what was going on. “They’re taking brake discs to the Honda factory in Swindon because there’s a supply problem” was the answer. How much does that cost  Less than shutting down the line for a day, that’s for sure. On the day JLR announced job losses Honda said it was closing its Swindon plant for six days in April because of Brexit. It’s one precaution BMW is taking among many. It says: “We’ve had to assume a worst-case scenario.  “We build , Minis a day at our Oxford plant and each car contains around , parts from mainland Europe. “That’s four million parts per day and a lot of lorries. We’re sourcing a team of customs experts, updating our customs IT and looking at extra warehousing.” Companies making relative small numbers of cars: Rolls-Royce, Bentley and Aston Martin, won’t be badly hit because these are not cars that come off the production line like sausages. It takes  hours to assemble a Rolls-Royce Phantom and about  to build a Japanese hatchback. Which brings us to the three Japanese car plants in the UK. Nissan has been hugely successful here but Honda in Swindon and Toyota in Burnaston, Derbys, have never performed as well as hoped.  I worry that their parent companies could use Brexit as an excuse to close UK factories rather than admit their plans hadn’t worked out. A no-deal Brexit means WTO rules and a % tarf on cars crossing the channel each way. UK car buyers face an average of pound, on the price of a new car, says the SMMT. There will also be .% on parts. But it’s not all gloom. Mazda, which doesn’t manufacture in the UK, reckons Brexit could create opportunities. UK boss Jeremy Thomson says: “As a distributor we have always had to account for a tarf in our business model soone is imposed on UK car imports it would level the playing field.”  Whatever happens, moving car plants takes a lot of planning, so we won’t be seeing empty factories any time soon. If you sell a huge numbers of cars in a country, it makes sense to build them there. And British car workers are highly skilled and often the jewel in global companies’ manufacturing. SoI get a warm feeling of pride when I see a British cars being driven abroad, I can’t imagine what it must feel like to see one and know you helped build it.

Mel - who admits she has a high pain threshold - posed for a photo while they waited, before being airlted to hospital.

People are always telling you to take it easy but you just say Im fine. Mel had an emergency c-section on December , , after she was overdue, and she wasnt dilating despite medical intervention. The procedure at Dr Grays Hospital in Elgin seemed to go smoothly, and she was soon home with daughter Nadie, and partner Aidan, an off-shore engineering consultant. She said her surgery wound dressing was inspected before she left hospital, and she was deemed well enough to leave. Her partner noticed two white blobs in the middle of the wound four days after the birth - now thought to be fat - but they didnt suspect anything was wrong.   A day later she was in the shower when she bent down and the wound burst. I had only been in for a couple of minutes and I bent down to get the shampoo, she said. I dont rememberI felt it happen or saw it happen first, but my intestines were slipping out of my stomach. I put my hands underneath to catch it. I realisedI shouted out it would put pressure on my stomach, and thatI shout it will all fall out, so I was just trying to call out calmly to Aidan. He calmly led her from the shower to the sofa in the living room, propped up her feet and fetched a towel to cover her while calling for an ambulance. She said the pair contemplated covering her with cling film, but waited for paramedics who then called the air ambulance to take her to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.   I dont think the woman on the end of the phone believed him really, she said. I was sat there holding my insides the whole time. I darent move my hands. She had surgery and after a couple of days in hospital was home again. The couple said the c-section consultant later speculated he had cut the end of the thread too short while stitching her up, or not tied the knot tight enough. Mel later had daughters Allie, now four, and Robyn, now three, by c-section, despite the traumatic experience with Nadie, now seven. She added: If Aidan had panicked I think I would have too, but he was brilliant and calm. A spokesperson for Dr Grays Hospital declined to comment.

And the couple have made an emotional appeal to find a new organ in less than five weeks, which is how long doctors warn he will survivenothing comes forward. They also joined the Mirror’s Change the Law for Le campaign that will make everyone a potential donor unless they choose to opt out. But they are also acutely aware that as tiny Carter, who is  days old today, will need the heart from a child due to size, that another family will suffer tragedy.Chris and Sarah have already lost one son, Charlie, at two and a half and are praying tragedy will not strike twice.   Chris, , said: “If our prayers are not answered I won’t get to take him home and do what every daddy wants to do: simply raise a son the best he can. “Every day that goes by is a day less I have to find a heart for my son.” Urging others to back our campaign, the John Lewis worker added: “What I have learnt over the last two weeks has brought to my mind the shyimportance of organ donation, how many lives could be savedthe law was dferent.“Unless you are in a position when a loved one’s le depends on an organ donor, I don’t think you will shyunderstand how important it is to make changes to ensure we have a greater chance of saving lives in the future. “I can only hope anyone reading this never goes through what I’m going through right now.” Dance teacher Sarah, , said: “It’s just such a hard message for us to put out.   “For what we call a miracle to happen, someone  will have to go through shysomething terrible to give us that gt.“No parent in either set of shycircumstances wants to be there.” The couple, of South Shields, Tyneside, have been keeping a vigil at their son’s bedside in Newcastle’s Freeman Hospital since he was born on Boxing Day with severe damage to the left side of his heart. He suffered three cardiac arrests within hours of his birth and is now hooked up to a machine to pump blood around his body. Chris and Sarah’s son Charlie died in  after being born with a shycondition that compromised his immune system.It was unrelated to Carter’s illness. The couple have since set up a charity in his name which has helped  families of sick children. But now they need assistance of their own to prevent them having to suffer the loss of another child.  NHS Blood and Transplant, shyresponsible for allocating donated organs in the UK, say there are eight babies under  months on the active waiting list for a heart. The body’s lead nurse for paediatric donation, Angie Scales, said: “We hope Carter gets the heart transplant he so desperately needs. “Hearts need to be matched by size for a successful transplant. For many young children, their only hope is to receive one from another young child. “Losing a child is a tragedy, but we know many parents take comfort in saving lives through organ donation. “There are many children alive today thanks to parents making that decision. “But sadly, hundreds of adults and shychildren die every year due to the shortage of donated organs. We urge people to join the NHS Donor Register.” South Shields Labour MP Emma Lewell-Buck highlighted Carter’s case in the Commons on Wednesday.In response, Theresa May spoke about the new opt-out organ donation system, due to come in next year. It will be named Max and Keira’s Law in honour of Mirror campaign boy Max Johnson, , and his heart donor Keira Ball, nine.  Her dad Joe decided to pass on her organs when she died after a car accident near her home at Barnstaple, Devon, in July . The move helped to save or shytransform the lives of four others. Her parents set up the charity Inspired by Keira, which give aid to sick children and their families. Joe and Loanna played a key role in getting Geoffrey Robinson MP’s private members’ bill through Parliament after the Mirror told their story last February, just days before the vote on passing it into law. The law was due to go forward for royal assent before Christmas. Two suggested shyamendments mean it will now go before the Lords again within weeks. Health Minister Jackie Doyle-Price said: “I am four-square behind this, along with Theresa May. We will work on those amendments though we know the shytimetable is tight. “If there are any shyproblems in this session, we will find a way of dealing with it. I am not going to let anything stand in its way now.” Dan Jarvis, the Labour MP who helped guide the bill through the Commons, praised the Government’s decision to name it Max and Keira’s Law. He said: “This Bill will save lives and give hope to the thousands around our country who are desperately waiting for an organ transplant.” There will be a poundmillion shyDepartment of Health publicity drive to explain what the law will mean once it is in place. There are currently , people on the active transplant waiting list, including  children.

Kerri Rawsons world came crashing down around her after she discovered her father Dennis Rader was actually the BTKmurderer. A seemingly normal dad, he had spent more than  years prowling the streets of Kansas, US, slaughtering  people - including two children. And horrically, he had hidden mementos from his disgusting crimes at his familys home - including underwear stolen from his murder victims. Kerri, who is releasing a book about her shocking story this month, recalls one particularly stormy, thundery night in , when she was just six. I crawled into bed with Mom. I wouldn’t haveDad was home. Slept on his side of the bed, she writes, according to the New York Post.   She adds: Did that sometimes when he was gone. I only remember that night because our neighbour lady went missing. It would later emerge that the neighbour was among those murdered by Rader, who carried out the Wichita murders between  and . A churchgoer and stamp collector, the serial killer slaughtered his first four victims - two parents and their two little boys - before Kerri was born. He hanged one of the innocent youngsters from a drainage pipe. And in subsequent years, he would go on to secretly kill six more people. As well as keeping some of his victims underwear, Rader also hid a business card at his home, with details of his next kill scribbled on it.   But it was only in  that Kerri, who wouldnt go through her dads things, discovered his unimaginable secret - when he was arrested by police. Then aged , the young woman found an FBI agent standing at her door after her father finally slipped up and revealed himself to be BTK. Everything she had known and loved came crashing down, according to her book, A Serial Killer’s Daughter: My Story of Faith, Love, and Overcoming. Scouring the web for information on the previously-unsolved murders, she tumbled into an abyss of despair and terror, the Post reports. Soon, she found herself reflecting on items her dad had once carried or had in their home and wondering whether they were linked to the killings. She also listened to a  call that BTK made after he broke into a young womans home and strangled her with a belt after she ed from work.   A court heard how he masturbated after carrying out the brutal killing. Through the static, in seizing fear, I recognized my dad’s voice — younger, but him, Kerri writes about the emergency call, placed in . ” Rader, now , is serving  consecutive le terms at a Kansas prison. Sickeningly, he gave himself the BTK nickname, which became his infamous signature as he evaded police for more than three decades. He previously admitted having plans to kill an th victim, whom he said he planned to hang upside down in her home before he was caught. His downfall came when he sent a computer disk to a TV station in February  - with an analysis of metadata linking him to the item. Rader pleaded guilty to his crimes, which he recalled in detail in court.   He later worked with Katherine Ramsland, a forensic psychology professor at DeSales University, to publish a book about his crimes - Confession of a Serial Killer: The Untold Story of Dennis Rader, the BTK Killer - with the proceeds going to a trust fund for the victims families. After his arrest, several grieving relatives sued Rader, securing a settlement that agreed he could never profit from his crimes or coverage of them. Today, Kerri has still not reckoned fully with who her father actually is - viewing him as  per cent her dad and five per cent a stranger. But despite acknowledging he has devastated countless lives, she has experienced forgiveness towards him and they have had correspondence.

Krysta Davis, , and, Derek Lovett,  made the heartbreaking decision to donate in order to give hope to other parents who are waiting for le-saving organs for their own babies. Brave Krysta, from Cleveland, Tennessee, was  weeks pregnant when she was told her daughter, Rylei Arcadia, had anencephaly - a serious birth defect which meant she was born without parts of her brain. Doctors told the couple they could induce labour immediately or Krysta could carry to term knowing their daughter could die in the womb, and at best after delivery live for moments or days. Knowing their time was limited, they savoured every moment of the pregnancy from discovering her favourite bands to relishing every kick. And on Christmas Eve, Rylei was born weighing six pounds and miraculously survived a week before passing away on New Year’s Eve in the arms of her parents.   Her short le helped save two other babies after her heart valves were donated, while her lungs went to a research foundation in desperate need of organs. Krysta, an assistant manager, said: “Carrying her to full term would mean we had the option to donate her organs so that other mothers could bring home their babies when we couldn’t. “That sealed the deal for us, for the entire pregnancy the majority of our strength came from her, it was very positive, and we did everything we could like most parents do. “We found out her favourite band was Fleetwood Mac and did a lot of normal parent things, but we also had an extra ounce to cherish that little more. “I knew I had to be happy throughout the entire pregnancy for her, there was no point putting myself or her through that when we had such limited time together. “It was amazing feeling her kick, I didn’t knowshe would move around at all but we found out, as she moved a lot.   “As we got further along into the pregnancy she moved more and more, I could watch her little feet move across my belly. “I had nine months to carry her and fall in love but it was nothing compared to holding her and seeing her, I couldn’t see anything wrong with her when she was born, I was in love. “It was really hard as we never knew how much time we were going to have with her. “After she passed, the surgeon came in and told he us he had not met a family like us in  years. “It felt wonderful knowing that because of her two other kids get to go home, that touched us the most. “Every time I look at the reminders of her, I treasure the moments, I still get a couple of tears coming down they are perfect moments.   “As hard as it is to give away those organs as it is your child, it makes a huge dference to others’ lives who wouldn’t have a second chance.” This was not the first pregnancy tragedy to befall the couple, as they sadly miscarried in September  due to Polycystic Oian Syndrome . While carrying Rylei it was discovered she would be born with serious defects at  weeks following a quad screening – with the hope of organ donation leading them to choose not to end the pregnancy. The parents believe they made the right decision for their daughter and had their cherished time captured by photographer Clarissa Tilley and videographer Autumn Cleek. Krysta said: “We were told there was a good chance she may not make it out alive on her own andshe did she may not survive the cord being cutting as she was living off me. “It really stemmed from the love we have for her, no matter what the outcome we would carry her to term.   During the delivery, another complication arose with Rylei emerging facing the wrong way, despite this dficulty it meant the mum could see her daughter. Photographer Clarissa Tilley, , photographed her short le spending  hours during the little girl’s week of le. Her favourite images showcase the raw emotion when a tearful Krysta sees Rylei for the first time and then the last time the nurse checked her heart rate before putting a monitor on her. Additionally, photographer Autumn Cleek filmed some of Rylei’s final moments to help immortalise the couples time with their daughter. Clarissa who offers this service to parents saying goodbye free of charge, said: “I’m a mother myself so to experience that hit me on a deeper level, it could happen to anybody and the thought of that is heart breaking.   “I treated her how I would want to be treated in that situation when Rylei was born I fell in love too, it was emotional, I fell in love with them all. “Rylei was absolutely beautul, she had her brain exposed but Krysta didn’t see disability or her conditions, she saw her daughter and the pure love shone from her. “The nurse checking her heart was the start of Rylei surprising us even more. “All the nurses and organ donation team were in there for  minutes, sitting there waiting to call time of death and it never happened. “It brings me to tears every time I look at the images, I wasn’t really in photographer mode, they mean a lot to Krysta and me.

Whether you add extra ingredients to it to make it a bit fancier or have it as it is, its a go-to for people up and down the country. But the jars of ready made sauce many of us have at the back of the cupboard for emergencies can be packed full of sugar, and Dolmio maker Mars Food once insisted its sauces are only eaten once a week. Uncle Bens too. But according to Italian American food writer Marcella Hazan, a good pasta sauce is remarkably simple and economical, too. Much cheaper than buying jars.   Marcella, who died in , was born in Cesenatico, Italy, in  and went on to open a New York cookery school and write hugely respected cookbooks. In one of them, Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking, Marcella advises using only three ingredients in tomato sauce: onion, butter, and tinned tomatoes. Thats it. How much butter, you ask  A generous knob. The  recipe is still revered by food writers and cooks alike. No chopping is required. And pasta and tomato sauce is always a hit round the family dining table. Marcellas precise instructions are to put half a peeled onion into a pot with butter and tinned tomatoes and to leave it all to simmer for  minutes. Food publication Delish dubbed the sauce the best in the world. Her husband Victor talked to Epicurious about her efficient methods: Marcella was a genius when it came to taste. She had an immediate understanding about how flavour affects a dish. Marcella Hazan favoured ease and efficiency   She asked herself, Why chop an onion  Why saute  Im going to put the onion, tomato, and butter together and forget about it. Is it really the best in the world  Its a bold claim and a subjective one. But Italians are famous for their simplicity in cooking. Its all about the produce – tomatoes being one of the most important. No other preparation is more successful in delivering the prodigious satisfactions of Italian cooking than a competently executed sauce with tomatoes, Marcella says in her book. Her sauce is very rich. Others favour dferent techniques. Jamie Oliver adds four cloves of garlic and garnishes with fresh basil. BBC Good Food recommends starting with a classic mirepoix base , and scores of top chefs use ious herbs and oils and other trickery to elevate their dishes. Anchovies are good. The sauce is perfect for home cooks with little time   Food writer Felicity Cloake suggests the more classic use of olive oil in tomato sauce. She also puts in a pinch of sugar and some red wine vinegar. The thing to do is experiment. Garlic or no garlic, parsley or thyme or basil or rosemary, as long as the tinned tomatoes are good and theres parmesan on the table, we imagine people will be well fed. One things for certain, though – Marcellas advice is an ideal time-saver and perfect for amateur cooks with busy families. Andyou do decide to put tomatoes on to cook, remember: - dont boil your sauce, simmer it - add a ladle-full of pasta water to the sauce - lots of salt in the pasta water - no need for oil! If pasta sticks, its overcooked - and always add the pasta to the sauce, not the other way around "},{"url":null,"title":"two heads extra legs kenny","story":"Two heads, extra legs and Kenny the ugly tiger - the worlds most unusual animalsThese are some of the worlds most unusual animals, who were born with extra limbs often due to genetic mutationShareCommentsByNick AshRhian Lubin:,  JAN NewsKenny the tiger is deformed because of inbreeding Two-headed sharkFisherman Christian Johnston discovered this two-headed blue shark off the coast of Australia a few years ago.

JonBenet Ramsey was just six when she was found bludgeoned and strangled o death in the basement of her family home on Boxing Day in . And now convicted paedophile, Gary Olivia, is reported to have confessed to killing the six-year-old. The -year-old is said to have admitted to killing JonBenet by accident in letters to a school friend. The young beauty queen was found by her father the day after the family reported her missing. They had received a two-page ransom note asking for , in exchange for the child’s safe . But, eight hours later, her dad discovered his daughter’s body under a white blanket with a cord twister round her neck in the basement of their family home. Her wrists were bound and she had been gagged with duct tape. She had also suffered a fractured skull. What happened on the days before her death and who were the initial suspects   Christmas Day had been an exciting time for the Ramsey family. Father Christmas had delivered a new bike to delighted JonBenet and she tried out her present that day - it would be the last time she rode it. Along with her dad, John, mum, Patsy, and brother, Burke, who was then nine, JonBenet went for dinner at at family friends. The six-year-old was tired after her day of fun and was carried upstairs, sleeping, by her father when the family ed home later that night. This would be the last time anyone in the family saw her alive. Just eight hours later her tiny body was discovred in the basement of the family home. As the only people known to be in the house at the time of her killing, JonBenet’s parents Patsy and John were soon under suspicion.John, a computer executive, and Patsy, a former Miss West Virginia, went on CNN to insist they had nothing to do with their daughter’s tragic murder. Within two weeks of the girl’s murder, police considered her parents were unlikely to have committed the brutal crime. They were cleared of any involvement in  with the help of DNA technology. The ransom note  The ransom note discovered with JonBenets body was handwritten on pages ripped from a notepad her mother had kept by the telephone. Theories circulated suggesting the ransom note was actually written by the little girl’s mum. The sum asked for was the exact amount JonBenets father had received in his work bonus that year. Experts also claimed there was a connection in handwriting style between Patsy and the note-writer. Cina Wong examined the note for three weeks in , comparing it to examples of Patsy Ramsey’s writing. Wong claimed there were over  similarities. Suspects JonBenet’s older brother Burke was nine at the time of her murder. Theories emerged that he could be the killer and that their parents covered up JonBenet’s death to protect their son. He was cleared by DNA evidence. Around the th anniversary of JonBenets death, her brother spoke out for the first time in  on US talk show Dr. Phil. He said: “I dont know what to say to that, because I know thats not what happened.  Theres been people who have said thats not even physically possible for a nine-year-old to do that,” he said. “Like you wont find any evidence because I didnt do it.” John Ramsey revealed later how he tried to hide the allegations splashed across the papers from his young son. The headlines from a tabloid screamed out that Burke had done it, he said in . She [Patsy] dropped her produce and rushed Burke out but the damage had been done.  In  a jury voted to charge JonBenets parents with child abuse that resulted in the death of their daughter. The charges were never pursued and DNA evidence later also cleared them both. Patsy Ramsey died from oian cancer in ,  years after her daughters murder, aged . Burke Ramsey said he chose to finally speak out about his experience because: I know people think I did it that my parents did it. I know that we were suspects. I want to honour her memory by doing this interview. I dont want anyone to forget. He told Dr Phil that “I kinda always just thought it was a paedophile who saw her at one of the pageants, snuck in, who knows ” The district attorny apologised to JonBenets parents in  and exonerated them of any wrongdoing in relation to their daughters death. What other theories are there   DNA evidence taken from under JonBenets nails at the scene cleared both her parents and her brother. It revealed the little girl had probably clawed at her attacker in the strugle. But the DNA did not come from anyone who had been at the scene, her family or anyone who had handled her body. It was from an unknown male. DNA, believed to be saliva, was also found in her underwear. The intruder theory  With all of JonBenet’s family cleared of her murder, another possible explanation was that an intruder forced entry into their house and carried out the killing without anyone hearing the horric crime take place. The CBS documentary examined a broken window, which could have been used to access the basement where JonBenet was found. JonBenet’s dad said he broke the window some time before the murder when he was locked out of the house. Boulder Police Department initially ruled out anyone gaining entry through this window. But on the other side of that broken window was a suitcase, where police found a footprint.Its thought that an intruder could have possibly stepped on the suitcase to get back out of the window, leaving the footprint behind. The footprint was from a pair of Hi Tec boots, which the familys lawyer insisted that is proof that an intruder got into the house. The lawsuit  Burke Ramsey filed a lawsuit against CBS for a docu-series made in ,  years after his sisters murder.He sued the US broadcaster after their programme suggested he killed his younger sister.CBS officials requested the  million case be thrown out but a judge refused.According to Burke, his reputation was ruined after the two-part show - The case of: JonBenet Ramsey - concluded he was JonBenet’s killer.While CBS argued that the programme included a clear disclaimer which said: “The opinions and conclusions of the investigators who appear on this program about how it may have occurred represent just some of a number of possible scenarios.”However, the judge, Michigan rd Circuit Court District Judge David Groner, said that wasn’t enough to throw out Ramseys case.He added: “This Court does not find that the disclaimer at the beginning and end of the program negate the docu-series potentially defamatory meaning.”According to local paper The Daily Camera, the case has since led to courts in the Ramsey family’s hometown of Boulder, Colorado, to request vast numbers of files from the police investigation.The police are fighting the subpoena on the basis that “disclosure of police investigative files will adversely affect the investigation.The case is still in the pre-trial stage. The confession  Convicted paedophile Gary Olivia has reportedly confessed to the killing in letters sent to a former school friend. He is said to have admitted to killing the child beauty queen by accident. The -year-old is serving a -year sentence for child abuse image charges. In one of the letters, Oliva allegedly wrote: I never loved anyone like I did JonBeneacutet and yet I let her slip and her head bashed in half and I watched her die. It was an accident. Please believe me. She was not like the other kids. In another letter, Oliva is alleged to have said: Yet by accident she died and it was my fault. The Boulder Police Department is investigating.

Engineers took  days to print the structures before aligning them together piece by piece. The footbridge could be used for up to  years, said Chen Xiaoming, deputy chief engineer at Shanghai Construction Engineering Machinery Group. The material used passed the quality standard test set by the government and it can also withstand all weather conditions.  Videos emerged showing members of the public standing on the grey arched bridge. The bridge - measuring . metres long, . metres wide and . metres high - passed all pressure tests and loading tests. Mr Chen explained that D printers can create a S-shaped structures which help to consolidate the base of the bridge. Its said that the loading weight per square metre is about  kilograms, which is about the weight of four adults, reported China Daily.   The company stressed that the bridge printing project reduces labour costs and improves civilised construction, they said in the press release. This system is mainly composed of a -axis gantry structure, a -axis high-precision industrial robot, and a high-speed extrusion device , allowing for more accurate and larger D printed structures. It is believed the footbridge will be crowned the worlds longest D-printed bridge, as compared to the one in Netherlands, which measured eight metres long.

optimistic for the year ahead in the face of so many uncertainties including Brexit and the ongoing repercussions of Universal Credit.Helping a broad range of clients including single homeless people, families facing severe food and fuel poverty and increasing numbers of working people struggling to cope with low wages, he said: ldquoOver the years we have seen an ever-increasing rise in the number of people coming to the CAB in desperate situations, often very vulnerable people who simply cannot cope with day-to-day pressures caused through a lack of income or poor housing conditions.ldquoI see nothing on the horizon to indicate there will be a change in the demands on services provided by the CAB which has seen a reduction in its funding.ldquoThe pressure on agencies like us is increasing

executive of New Start Highland, has also highlighted the ongoing challenges for the charity which relies on grants, contracts and trading income.He said Brexit had erted attention from the impact of UK government austerity measures while statistics showing an almost unprecedented level of employment masked the day-to-day challenges faced by many.ldquoDespite the positive messages appearing in the news, New Start Highland has seen an increase in demand for the support we offer to people in crisis, he said.ldquoAt the same time, a number of funders have turned the focus of their investment away

However, there is currently no evidence to support any data breach having occurred during the move.Councillor Kirsteen Currie, who is on the local authorityrsquos care and learning committee, said: ldquoIrsquom pleased to hear that Highland Council has initiated an investigation into this matter as the allegations are not only serious and distressing to those involved but,proven to be true, they would indicate that data protection laws may have been broken.ldquoThe rules around data protection, particularly when it comes to protecting and supporting vulnerable people, simply must be given the respect that they deserve.

The boys were great and made me feel welcome.“Unfortunately I had a bad fall on the shoulder and dislocated it and it needed surgery.“It put a halt on it, but I am looking forward to getting back training and hopefully getting a good second half of the season.“We are using this week for me to integrate back in.“The shoulder is feeling good, although there are a few niggling bits that I am trying to iron out and get sorted this week and next week. Then it will hopefully be ready for the first game back.”Hoban remained in close contact with the Dons and was at Hampden to cheer them on in the Betfred Cup semi-final and final.Hoban said: “It was great to come up and watch the boys and they were unbelievable.“To see them in those games gave me the incentive to push on with the rehab and keep working hard.”"},{"url":null,"title":"reds boss determined to cling on to star man mckenna","story":"Another transfer window, and Dons boss Derek McInnes expects more interest and potential bids for Scotland international Scott McKenna.However, he hopes the Reds, currently in Dubai, emerge from the window with the centre-back still at the club.In the previous two windows the Dons have rejected offers for McKenna.McInnes insists it could be increasingly dficult to achieve the same outcome in future windows as the -year-old continues to improve in stature.Although contracted to Aberdeen until summer  such is McKenna’s standing it is a case of when, not , he moves to England.McInnes does not want that to happen this month.However, when that day comes, he is convinced McKenna’s move south of the border will be to an English Premier League side.Aberdeen rejected bids of £ million from Aston Villa and £.m from Celtic for the defender during the summer transfer window.McInnes refuses to put a price on what would lure McKenna away but admitted centre-backs capable of performing at McKenna’s level “have a value”.As we talked at the Jebel Ali Beach Hotel in Dubai, McInnes said: “It would be naive to think there wouldn’t be interest in Scott.“I have spoken with Scott and we would all want Scott to be here for at least the full season.“Nothing has happened that has given me any indication that is going to be any dferent to that.“He has been better this season than he was in his first year and that is despite having to deal with his injury .“Scott deals with everything no matter what.“Whether he plays a high line or defends his box he deals with it.“It is the samehe plays against quick strikers or strong strikers.“Scott is just getting better and better. Other people will recognise that.”It is understood Premier League side Wolves sent scouts to watch McKenna in action earlier this season.While the Dons were in Dubai this time last year, they rejected a £, bid from Hull City.Having become a first-team regular, signed an extended deal and captained Scotland, his value has rocketed in many multiples since then.But the Dons have not yet settled on an exact number.McInnes said: “There is no figure set.“We value Scott highly and recognise the market that we think he can go into.“I think he can go direct to the English Premier League.“Centre-halves in the Premier League, to perform there as I have no doubt Scott can do – they have a value.”McKenna has been a stalwart of the Dons defence this season, during a time when the squad were rocked by injuries to centre-backs.Mark Reynolds had been out since July having undergone knee surgery for a cruciate ligament injury sustained in a friendly against Cove Rangers.On-loan Watford centre-back Tommie Hoban had been out since late August having undergone shoulder surgery on an injury sustained in scoring in a - draw at Hibs.Centre-back Mikey Devlin had also been out since sustaining a foot ligament injury while training with the Scotland squad in mid November.All three defenders are back in training in Dubai.Winger Gary Mackay-Steven also ed to light training for the first time having been side-lined with concussion.The -year-old was knocked unconscious in the - Betfred Cup final loss to Celtic on December .McInnes said: “It is good to see some of the injured ones coming back, and we also have some of the younger ones out here as well.“Having some of the senior players coming back into things and integrating them onto the pitch is pleasing.“Not all will be available for the Stenhousemuir game but just to get McGinn, Logan, Hoban, Devlin and Mackay-Steven in and around it is really encouraging.“It gives me a huge lt for the second half of the season.”McInnes has  players in Dubai. No new signings made the eight-hour flight out to the United Arab Emirates.Only two were left behind due to injury, with Bruce Andersonand Frank Rossremaining at Pittodrie to continue their rehabilitation.Rising youth stars Ethan Ross and Miko Virtanen took their places on the flight out.McInnes said: “I wanted to bring Frank and Bruce out, but we could only bring  including the two keepers and we’ve already got five or six senior players not able to do anything.“With the potential game here on Sunday we needed to make sure we had enough bodies that were actually able to do work.“Frank is still at a very early stage with his rehab in terms of doing a bit of running and wouldn’t have been able to do any ball work.“Bruce has got a problem not only with his calf, but with his shoulder after Livingston.“Ethan Ross and Miko Virtanen got brought in at the expense of Frank and Bruce because we needed bodies for training and with the game in mind on Sunday.“While we hope there are going to be some boys fit before the game, there’s still a chance they might not be.“Ethan and Miko have been training with the first-team squad for a while now so it was good to get them out here.“We’ve brought younger ones in recent seasons and they’ve always responded well.“So it’s good to have them out here because that enthusiasm from the younger ones can add to the session.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/01/Capture-1-140x78.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"vlog dons in dubai day one","story":"With Aberdeen#s training camp in Dubai under way, Sean Wallace and Jamie Durent reflect on ing faces, an exit and the excellent facilities in the Middle East.Press and Journal sports writer Jamie and Evening Express chief football writer Sean will be sending video updates daily from the United Arab Emirates."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/01/5c344cb99b9489.30894192-940x528.jpg ","title":"looking to get rid of your real christmas tree these north east goats want to eat it1","story":"A north-east woman is on the lookout for old Christmas trees – so she can feed them to her herd of goats.Sarah Pumfrett, , from Oldmeldrum is looking to pick up any real Christmas trees that may be going spare after the festive season.Sarah, who also owns several rare-breed horses, has been driving around the north-east picking up any discarded pines people have no use for.She said her  goats love the trees, which they strip bare before eating the nutritious needles.Sarah said: “They absolutely love them.“As soon as they see the trailer pulling into the yard with trees, they get really excited. It’s phenomenal.“They’re like children in a sweet shop the way that they attack them.“It’s the nutrients in the bark that they love so much, because trees can pick up some trace minerals from the ground that grass and other things can’t.”Specialising in rare breeds, Sarah chose to get bagot goats – one of the rarest in the UK with only around  left in the country – in a bid to clear weeds from her fields.Sarah has been caring for rare breeds for more than  years, in a bid to preserve them for the future.She is on the hunt for real trees that have been used over the Christmas period, but that haven’t been sprayed with anything such as fake snow or articial pine scents.Trees that have been kept close to kitchens will also not be accepted, because of the chance of contamination with food, which could cause an outbreak of foot and mouth.For Sarah, asking for the trees was an easy decision, especially as there is currently a hay shortage.She said: “There’s a huge waste of trees around this time of year, it seems criminal – especially this year when fodder is in such short supply, because a lot of the silage and hay has already been used.”This is the third year Sarah has recycled trees and she has been kept busy trailing across the north-east picking up trees from people.She said: “It’s been absolutely fantastic, I’ve even had some of the village trees that have been standing out in the squares. They’re fantastic because they’re usually quite green.“It’s been a great response from the local community.”Despite the fact the goats don’t eat the wood of the trees, Sarah manages to find a use for it, whether it be for kindling for her wood burner, or passing it on to a lady in the village who makes wooden children’s toys.She said: “Every part of the trees I get is used in some way.“The things I can’t burn, I put out the back to rot for the insects.

When did two players from Mid Argyll help Rangers win the Scottish Cup The answer is # . Local girls Jasmine McPhie and Carla Todd were both key players in Rangers Girls triumphant run in the Girls Under  Scottish Cup.In their run to the final, Rangers played the top four under  girls teams in Scotland beating Aberdeen - in the first round, then Hamilton - and Central Girls - in rounds two and three. A quarter-final tie against Glasgow City saw the Rangers Girls win - to set up an old firm semi-final against Celtic Girls in which the Rangers Girls emerged - winners in a close game.The final was played on Saturday November  at the Oriam Performance Centre in Edinburgh. In a competitive match, Rangers started strong but Hibernian began to come into the game and whilst both sides had chances, the score remained - at half time. In the second half, Rangers took the lead in  minutes but three minutes later Hibernian drew level.There were few chances in the remainder of the second half and at full time both teams were level at -. Rangers took the lead again in extra time with a deserved winner to secure the cup.Jasmine and Carla came through the Lochgilphead Soccer Centre from primary one age to primary seven, playing in local festivals.In   the girls were important members of the successful Lochgilphead Red Star  team which won the DFDL league cup and finished second in their league. At the end of that season they joined Rangers Girls where they are in their second season playing mostly in the Paisley League against boys teams but also in national girls# competitions.Both girls have also been involved in Scotland national squads for their age group and the Soccer Centre is delighted to see them thriving with a big club.With more than  girls now playing football through the Soccer Centre, the success of Jasmine and Carla should be a real inspiration for local girls.So girls, you may live out in rural Mid Argyll but with talent, hard work and the right attitude you could be creating your own football opportunities."},{"url":null,"title":"making the decision to foster","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowArgyll and Bute Council is encouraging people to consider fostering children.One couple from Campbeltown, Moyra and Peter Paterson, gave an insight into the rewards that can be gained from fostering, particularly over the festive period.Moyra said: #We have five grown-up children between us and, although I truly treasure the time we spend together over Christmas, it’s not the same as when they were little.#The Christmas just past was dferent, however, as the couple have become foster parents and have a young child in their care.Moyra continued: #It’s fantastic.

Invited to join Cameron up at the Cruachan dam for the second of his two recent programmes, I was delighted to tramp the mighty mountain with Scotland’s Number one authority on outdoor pursuits.As an author and broadcaster, Cameron always has an eye on a good story, and so as well as asking me about the lack of health and safety regulations at the time the hydro project was being built, he also wanted to knowthere really was a murder during the construction. There was, as I told him, a body – but the body wasn’t identied, no arrests were made, no court case took place.It would be a shamethat construction period went down in history as an invasion of , workmen – #Tunnel Tigers# as they were dubbed – into one of Argyll#s most beautul settings and a possible murder.My book was intended to give the story of the local people whose lives were punctuated by this ambitious construction project. Quite rightly, those Tunnel Tigers had been lauded in a number of publications. The work that was done hollowing out Argyll’s highest mountain to provide electricity for the nation was amazing.The plan for Cruachan – as for the other major hydro projects of the post World War II era – was conceived by Tom Johnston, to whom I dedicated my book. Johnston was a politician who remained true to his ideals of bringing rural Scotland into the modern world. There was no power in the Highlands, and without power there could be no industry and no prosperity. The engineering genius was Sir Edward MacColl, whose biographer Norrie Fraser called him #a maker of modern Scotland#.Cruachan was the first reversible pumped-storage system in the world. During its years of construction from  to , eminent international engineers visited the project to see how the water was pumped between two reservoirs through reversible turbine generators. At off-peak hours, the water was – is # pumped back up to the reservoir you see high up in the corrie above Loch Awe, held back by a dam that is now so much a part of our landscape. The loch itself is the lower reservoir.I had imagined that the scale of such a project – using Scotland’s top engineering companies who shipped in workers from other parts of the UK and Europe – would have been a cause for resentment and protest by local people.That, of course, failed to take account of the vision of the folk of Dalmally, Lochawe, and Taynuilt. Although it took men with engineering experience to blast the  miles of tunnels, hollow out the mountain itself, and construct the dam, there was also a need for a support army. There were clerks and porters, joiners and caterers, folk willing to let out a room, a caravan, a house, serve in a pub where just occasionally it was necessary to keep a baseball bat behind the bar to maintain bonhomie. The project kick started careers, fortunes and marriages, and gave the area good roads and a tourist industry.If you haven’t visited the hollow mountain or walked Cruachan’s slopes, make  the year you do.[In bold please] Cruachan: The Hollow Mountain is available from the Argyll Book Centre in Lochgilphead and all good book shops, along with Marian Pallister#s other books of local interest.PICS:The Pass of Brander before work started. no_aCruachanLe before the project # the Loch Awe Hotel with steamers. no_aCruachanThe Queen opening the project in October . no_aCruachanWorking on the  miles of tunnels. no_aCruachanWorking on the road to the dam, overlooking Loch Awe. no_aCruachan"},{"url":null,"title":"now ewe see him the mystery of tarberts rambling ram","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowA four-legged Houdini running free around an Argyll fishing village has had local people flocking to social media channels.A rogue sheep # a maleof the Scottish blackface breed # was first spotted loose near Tarbert Golf Club around New Year#s Day.There followed a number of sightings around the Loch Fyne village of the scarlet-painted pimpernel, ranging from the harbour side to the Campbeltown road.He was even spotted near Tarbert Parish Church on Sunday January , though it is not clear whether he joined the flock.One Tarbert resident commented: #It#s like now ewe see him, now ewe don#t.#The woolly wanderer#s fun was curtailed early the following week when he was captured and taken to a nearby farm.As the tup sheepishly set off for more secure accommodation, it seemed the online jokers# fun was at an end # puns involving  #ewe#, #horns#, #mint sauce# and even some unfair references to certain football fans were all the rage on Facebook.But that was that, the sheep was gone.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"iceland plans new ayr store","story":"NewsIceland plans new Ayr store as Food Warehouse makes application to open at Heathfield Retail ParkAn application has been made to occupy the former Homebase unit at Heathfield, which was vacated last year.ShareBySarah Hilley:,  JAN NewsThe vacant site at Heathfield \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIceland’s new Food Warehouse store is lining up to open in Ayr.

Fast-growing Home Bargains sells budget toys, household and beauty products, among other goods. The Food Warehouse has a bigger grocery choice than Iceland as well as bulk buys. A planning statement said: “The proposal is not speculative. Unit b will be occupied by Food Warehouse.” The plot is too big for only one shop, according to Heathfield Retail Park operators Ediston. The document added: “The prospects of securing a bulky goods retailer to occupy the whole unit are extremely limited. “Sub-ision of the unit is the only viable option to secure tenants.” Ediston is waiting for a decision from the council on whether food can be sold from the space. The firm has also applied to allow homeware goods to be offered at the plot as part of the Home Bargains proposal, which has yet to be decided. Home Bargains would take up a floorspace of , square feet and the Food Warehouse would span , square feet. Ayr Central owners MG Real Estate objected to the proposals to alter premises conditions at Heathfield. A supporting statement on the Food Warehouse plan dismissed the shopping centre as a possibility. It claimed that “Ayr Central has no units available that could accommodate the proposal.” The document also ruled out the former BHS site on Ayr High Street and the Kyle Centre. It said: “The former BHS unit is the only unit available with any sizeable floorspace but this is too large and would require signicant redevelopment and sub-ision to create a potential unit that may be suitable to the occupier.” Wren Kitchens is a recent addition to Heathfield, along with Poundland.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"man knocked down new years","story":"NewsMan knocked down in New Years Day hit and run as police appeal for witnessesA man was knocked down with the driver of a vehicle failing to stop following the incident in Tarbolton.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN NewsPolice are appealing for witnesses following the incident\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man was knocked down after being the victim of a hit and run attack in Tarbolton.

Vanessa Good, who heads up her own independent firm based in the town’s Newmarket Street, admits travellers need “far more clarity” over Brexit. But she this week laughed off the notion that flights will be grounded – leaving sunseekers stranded – when Britain takes a step into the unknown. It comes as fears grow that a ‘no deal’ Brexit will spark chaos at Britain’s borders and lead to untold problems for travellers. Vanessa, , who bosses the Good Travel Company, said: “There’s no doubt people are on edge at the moment. “Our customers are still coming in to book holidays in the usual numbers, but there is understandable concern. “The problem is we’re seeing so much political scaremongering and it’s hugely unsettling at a time we need far more clarity.” Vanessa, whose firm employs seven across two sites and also specialises in currency exchange, insists her team is trying to issue a note of calm to holidaymakers.

We now look forward to the merriment of Hogmanay! These days in between, traditionally known as the Daft Days, are my favourite of Yule time.Yet not so long ago the most popular focus of festivity was neither Christmas nor even Hogmanay, it was Handsel Monday.It fell upon the first Monday after New Year, although there was some dispute as to the exact Monday it should be celebrated, for some measured the date by the old calendar.This was the case for the country folk in East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire as it was then known. So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred. It was a longed for day off for those who worked hard with little in the way of holidays. It was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and Hogmanay all wrapped into one.And as the day wore into evening, the merriment would build. People made the most of this precious social time together, with stories, dance and song:ldquoSyne sune wi reels, an strathspeys even,\"The wee cot housie dirled,\"As a the blasts o yearth an heaven\"Were gainst its boukie hurled\"Braw lads and lasses lap and skirled.As is always the case with such gatherings, time flew and too soon the day would draw to a close:ldquoBut daffin jigs, an sangs, an tales,\"Sped far too swith the hours on.Sad farewells would have to be made. Mothers and fathers hugged tightly their grown children as they prepared to set off back to their employment. Old and new friends from near and far, who had come to share the day, parted to their duties.They would have to wait another year for the next Handsel Monday gathering. Who knows what fortune and fate would have in store before that time:ldquoFor freends were met whom morrows gales\"Wad waft apart les course on\"Anither year, and maybe neer\"Again while times flood roars on,\"Might they eer meet, or even greet,\"This fickly warls shores on,\"Tho here this day!And yet it was to be Handsel Monday itself whose fate was sealed, as it faded in importance compared to Hogmanay and its traditions of gt giving and family time overtaken by Christmas.It has became part of our Auld Lang Syne, yet its spirit is perhaps now spread over a thankfully longer time of winter festivity.Happy New Year, when it comes.With thanks to Electric Scotland website for the copy of the poem."},{"url":null,"title":"man-caused-disturbance-at-tranent-opticians","story":"Paul Donaghue behaved in a threatening manner and repeatedly shouted and swore at MontgomeryOptometrists on the townrsquos Bridge Street.Donaghue, of Main Street, then began throwing papers around the shop and refused to leave the premises when asked to do so by staff.The -year-old also stole a toy from the Tranent Paper Shop and a quantity of foodfrom a nearby Greggs shop.All the offences took place on November .Donaghue then told police officers his name was James Davidson in an attempt to evade arrest and he was prosecuted for perverting the course of justice.He also pleaded guilty to being in possession of a screwdriver on the same day.Donaghue appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court,where sentence was deferred for reports to next month."},{"url":null,"title":"new-council-houses-planned-for-ormiston","story":"Proposals submitted by East Lothian Council for  new homes in the village will be scrutinised by its planning department.The site, which would be made up of one, two and three-bedroom properties, is off Tynemount Road and forms part of a wider development of the area which includes  new homes by developer Walker Homes.The development would consist of four one-bedroom ground-floor cottages four one-bedroom upper-floor cottages six two-bedroom ground-floor cottages six two-bedroom upper-floor cottages  three-bedroom end-terraced houses five three-bedroom mid-terraced houses one two-bedroom bungalow and one three-bedroom bungalow.A council spokesman said the local authority was investing pound million in new council housing over the next five years.He added: ldquoThis development would provide a mix of dferent house styles, providing high-quality accommodation for families and iniduals, contributing to the outcomes set out in our local housing strategy by increasing the supply of affordable housing.ldquoWhile a small number of the new properties may be made available to a housing trust for rental opportunities, the majority of the new homes built will be offered as council housing.ldquoFollowing a number of applications for market housing on the site this detailed application is for the development of affordable housing on the site.Scott Gillies, chairman of the villagersquos community council, welcomed the potential of council houses being built.He said: ldquoWithout a doubt it is welcome."},{"url":null,"title":"unique-new-features-for-new-elphinstone-playpark","story":"Pupils at Elphinstone Primary School were given a choice of three potential options for a replacement playpark on the villagersquos Buxley Road.A vote was taken, with an option chosen to create a playpark with two features which will be unique to East Lothian.The first of those is made up of three D hexagon structures which have foot and hand-holds and are designed for climbing on.The second is a raised disc which youngsters can run on.The rest of the park is made up of familiar playpark favourites, including swings, a slide, seesaw, flying fox and climbing net.Elphinstone Community Association has been busy working with East Lothian Council on the project for nearly a year.Now they are hopeful the playpark, which it is estimated will cost about pound,, could be in place in the spring.Stuart MacKenzie, chairman of the villagersquos community association, said: ldquoI think it is fantastic.

This apple is magic and is found at the top of a tall ancient tree, which grows deep in a dark forest.ldquoTo get to the tree first you must find your way through the forest. Then you will come to a circular clearing, where there are no trees except the ancient tall apple tree.ldquoThis tree grows in the middle of the clearing and its single fruit, the apple of your dreams, can be seen on its topmost branch.The storyteller looked round his audience.ldquoWill you try to reach it and pick it to make your dream come true  he asked.The children all answered yes.ldquoThen first you must decide what your dreams are.ldquoBe rich, was a common response. The storyteller smiled and nodded: ldquoYes we all have dreams of being rich, but rich in what  Rich in love and happiness, or rich in money and things ldquoItrsquos the same, said one child. ldquoI donrsquot think it is, said another, looking at the storyteller. ldquoIs it ldquoThat is a good question, replied the storyteller, ldquofor sure having too little money is not a good thing. And the world is an unfair place where those who have too much money and too many things keep it to themselves, so those who have too little money never get their fair share, even though there is sufficient for everyone to have enough.ldquoSo I want to be one of those that has too much! declared one member of the class, to laughter.ldquoAndso would you share what you have with others who do not have enough  asked the storyteller.The child paused for a moment for thought: ldquoMaybe some of it.Other children voiced dferent opinions. ldquoIrsquod keep it all, ldquoIrsquod share it, ldquoIrsquod give some to my family and friends.It created some discussion amongst the children.The teacher was going to ask the children to be quiet and listen to the storyteller, but he indicated he was happy with what was happening.ldquoBut then yoursquod end up being poor again, said one. ldquoNo, Irsquod not give it all away.ldquoBut the whole point of being rich is that you can do what you want.ldquoWell, it also means you can help other people.The storyteller listened to the debate for a minute or two, then he beat his drum to regain the childrenrsquos attention.ldquoAnd so, for most here, money will be your dream. I understand that. Nobody wants to be poor. But lots of money is not really your dream.A chorus of: ldquoYes it is!ldquoNo, replied the storyteller, ldquomoney is not your dream, it is what you spend it on, what it might make possible for you that you do not have now, that would be your dream. That is what you must think of before you set out on your quest.ldquoBecauseyou pick the apple of your dreams, but have no dreams for your le, then you will still be poor, evenyou have all the money in the world.ldquoThatrsquos just stupid, said one boy. The teacher was quick to remind him not to be rude, but the storyteller asked him: ldquoWhat is stupid ldquoWhat yoursquove just said, you canrsquot be pooryou are rich, that doesnrsquot make sense. Thatrsquos what I meant is stupid.The storyteller smiled. ldquoPerhaps you are right, but do you think sometimes people can also be poor in things that money canrsquot buy There was silence for a moment. Then a girl said: ldquoYou mean people can be poor in dreams for their le The storyteller smiled and nodded.ldquoPrecisely, said the storyteller. ldquoThe whole issue of getting rich has stopped us thinking about what our dreams actually are.ldquoI want to be a dancer, said one child. ldquoI want to drive fast cars, said another.ldquoI still want to be rich so I donrsquot have to do anything and just play computer games.ldquoI want to make the computer games, said his friend. ldquoYeah, me too, agreed his pal.ldquoI want to be the President! another said.ldquoI just want to be happy!The storyteller beat his drum again.ldquoAnd so before you set off on your quest you must think about your dreams. And let me tell you that dreams can be shared too.ldquoHowrsquod you do that  he was asked.The storyteller thought for a moment: ldquoWell, for some their dream may be to save an animal that is in danger of being extinct.ldquoOr save the planet, called out another.ldquoThatrsquos why I want to be President.ldquoSo I want you to think about your dreams, and once you have you got your dreams you are ready for your quest into the forest, said the storyteller.The children assembled their thoughts and soon everyone had a collection of dreams to take with them to the apple tree.ldquoThere is one more thing I forgot to tell you, said the storyteller. ldquoItrsquos an important piece of information. You see, when you finally get to the clearing you must be very careful, for wrapped around the base of the ancient apple tree there is a ferocious dragon.ldquoIt sleeps, but very lightly. It will wake when you approach the tree. It will hear you no matter how quiet. It will hear your heartbeat. And there is no place to hide in the clearing. The moment you approach the tree, the dragon will pounce on you.ldquoCan the dragon fly  asked one.ldquoYes.ldquoAnd breathe fire ldquoYes.There were murmurings.ldquoAnd so, the storyteller continued, ldquoyou must decide how you will overcome and defeat the dragon. It is there to stop you reaching the apple of your dreams.Some of the children came up with immediate ideas:ldquoIrsquod run as fast as I could in zig zags.ldquoIrsquod distract the dragon.ldquoIrsquod shoot the dragon with a gun.ldquoIrsquod make a giant kite and fly to the apple.ldquoIrsquod take some friends and feed them to the dragon while I get the apple, then dream my friends back again.There were many solutions and the storyteller listened to them with interest. Each child came up with a dferent strategy.The storyteller nodded, explaining the powers of the dragon that it couldnrsquot be killed by bullets or blades or fire, that it was faster than lightning and once it had heard you and seen you it would go for you.ldquoKnowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams They all said yes, refining their ideas.And so once the children had come up with their final strategy, the storyteller asked them to think about what they might need to take with them to defeat the dragon. They will have to carry these things through the forest, or perhaps collect them on the way.Then the storyteller set the children the task of drawing the things they would need and then the dragon and apple tree. In drawing the apple they would have to decide what the apple of their dreams would look like.When this was all done, the children settled down to hear who had the right answer.ldquoI have looked at all the ideas, said the storyteller. ldquoWhat I must say is that le is unfair and so is this quest. For some, the journey through the forest will be longer than others. The dragon will be more dficult to defeat for some than others, as its mood changes. But you have all come up with the same answer, and so you are all right.There were howls of protest.ldquoNo, we didnrsquot we all have dferent answers!The storyteller beat his drum again to calm the children.ldquoWell yes, you all have dferent ideas on how to defeat the dragon and reach the apple, that is true. But you all have the same answer to the most important question.ldquoWhatrsquos that  the children asked.ldquoWell, said the storyteller, ldquoI had told you how fierce and dreadful the dragon could be. And then I asked youknowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams.ldquoAnd you all said yes, yoursquod try to reach your dreams, even though you had a big fight on your hands.ldquoThat, I believe, is the right answer. You may have dferent ideas on how to get that apple, but yoursquore all right because each of you will have to fight the dragon in a dferent way. The most important thing is your determination to get to that apple.ldquoWhatafter all that we fail  asked one child.ldquoYou might, said the storyteller, ldquobut on your journey to your dreams you may find a new path that leads to another ancient tree without a dragon.ldquoTherersquos another magic apple tree without a dragon !ldquoPerhaps, perhaps not. But the only way to find out is set off on the journey with determination in your heart. You might realise on the journey that your dreams are easier to reach than you had thought, or it could be the other way round.ldquoBut the most important thing is to have your dreams and find ways to reach them.The storyteller finished his session. He left the children with their dreams and their strategy to reach them.Happy New Year and good luck in defeating your dragon, and reaching your apple."},{"url":null,"title":"salon-owner-astonished-as-sign-to-be-torn-down","story":"Anna Mather moved her business from grade C listed premises in Gford into a grade B listed building on Haddington High Street last year.The switch has allowed her successful hair stylist team, who were named Scotlandrsquos Hair and Beauty Salon of the Year, to take on larger premises as they moved into the converted George Hotel building in the centre of town.But Ms Mather was stunned when East Lothian Council planners wrote to her to say that her shop sign, which is the same as the one she had at Gford, would be forcibly removed in a few weeksrsquo time.Ms Mather said: ldquoI contacted planners about the sign when we moved in and was told that, because it is plastic, it is the wrong material for the building, even though the shops across the road use the same type of signs.ldquoWe had gone to great s to ensure it was mounted properly to avoid having to screw it into the wall of the building and it is the same as we had at our previous salon.ldquoI appreciate it is a grade B listed building and am happy to meet requirements but when I asked for advice about what materials I could use they said they could not tell me.ldquoI have to apply for planning permission but, without knowing the material I can use, it will just be rejected and cost us money.ldquoNow they have written to say they are coming to forcibly remove the sign on January  and will charge us for the work.ldquoWe are a new business in the town and cannot afford to have these types of expensive bills.

Would he still be playinghe had not put his body through quite so much punishment Ivan Lendl, under whom Murray won all his biggest inidual titles, was the only coach able to consistently ramp up his chargersquos aggression, while tempering the Scotrsquos tendency to allow negativity to overwhelm him.It was no surprise Murray struggled to keep believing when always standing in his way were three of the all-time greats. Four times he lost in slam finals, twice to Djokovic and twice to Federer, before finally breaking his duck in appropriately gruelling fashion against Djokovic at the US Open in .The following summer came his career-defining moment when he ended Britainrsquos -year wait for a male singles champion at Wimbledon, adding a second title three years later then writing his own piece of history by becoming the first tennis player to win back-to-back Olympic gold medals in singles.In the autumn of , with his rivals at last showing some weakness, Murray surged thrillingly to the top of the rankings, clinching the number one spot by winning the ATP Finals in London.What seemed like it might be the start of the Murray era turned out instead to be a glorious swansong. Barely six months later, the first signs of his hip problem emerged and, despite surgery and an extensive rehabilitation and reconditioning programme, there has been no way back to the top.Perhaps even more important than his achievements on the court, the understated Murray emerged as one of the sportrsquos great trend-setters.First there was Murrayrsquos realisation in his early twenties that, rather than just employing a coach, having a team of people around him would help him reach his peak physically and mentally.Then, with a grand slam title still tantalisingly elusive, he reached out to a former great in Lendl, establishing the trend of the super coach. When their partnership came to an end, Murray broke more ground by hiring Amelie Mauresmo, who became the most high-profile female coach in tennis.Most top sportsmen would rather not stick their head above the parapet but, once he became comfortable in the limelight, Murray swam against the tide, speaking out forcefully on issues like equality and doping.He also embraced his role as the figurehead of British tennis, actively supporting and encouraging those emerging in his wake. They could not have bigger shoes to fill."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  MPs should come back from their constituencies and prepare for coalition","story":"But this New Year theres only one forecast that really matters: what will happen with Brexit  As in a war, Brexit will crowd everything off the political agenda in . Like the Ides of March, Britains fate must be sealed on Brexit day in only  weeks time.Will May finally win parliamentary support for her Withdrawal Deal  Will she be ousted in a cabinet coup  Will there be a repeat referendum  Will Britain end up revoking Article   These are the options, broadly speaking. About the only thing that seems pretty certain to me is that there will be no General Election and no ldquoNo Deal Brexit. I simply cannot see parliament or the country accepting the chaos, cost and potential suffering of crashing out of the European Union without any negotiated settlement.True, planes wouldnt fall out of the skies and trade would continue, somehow, but the disruption would create enormous stress. There is a strong possibility of food shortages, and people with medical conditions would suffer needless anxiety over medicine supplies. The fact that the Government is preparing to put the army on the streets and ports testies to the risk of civil disturbance. There would be a hard border in Northern Ireland overnight and a resumption of sectarian tensions. Small firms would go bust and big firms would leave.So, I am confident that MPs and ministers will prevent this happening,necessary by removing Theresa May and forming the equivalent of a wartime coalition. Working back from that the most probable outcomes look like: Revoking Article  or Mays Withdrawal Deal. And, it will be Labour, not Theresa May, the Tory Brexiters or the DUP, who decides which.Brexiters hate the Withdrawal Deal, which they think chains Britain to the EU, and Jeremy Corbyn does too ndash and for rather similar reasons. He thinks the state aid rules would prevent a Labour government nationalising the utility companies, and also believes that a permanent backstop would give Britain ldquono say on any future trade deals. Mays Withdrawal Deal should therefore be defeated by around - votes.Corbyn will then finally table that motion of no confidence in the government which he delayed in December. May will assuredly win that vote, because the last thing Tory MPs and the DUP want is general election, a Corbyn government and an even worse deal. May will now have won confidence votes from her own MPs and from the House of Commons. That will make her immovable ndash at least for the time being.Armed with this she willto Brussels and stage another televised spat with Jean-Claude Juncker. The  will probably have something  up their sleeves . Perhaps Michel Barnier will propose amending the Political Declaration to include a -month limit to the Irish backstop. This was dropped from the final draft of the December communique.The  could also extend the transition period making a commitment that negotiations must be concluded by March . This is already in the Political Declaration, but it could be built into a firm commitment and subject to independent arbitration. The Irish backstop would thus become a last resort and triggered only in the event of a total breakdown of time-limited trade negotiations.This will be the moment of truth for Labour, as Theresa May brings her amended deal back to the Commons in February. The hardline Brexiteers and the DUP will not be persuaded because the legally-binding Irish backstop will still be there in the Withdrawal Agreement. The future will be in Labourrsquos hands. Many pro-Europeans tell me that Corbyn will at this point ldquopivot to a referendum, voting down the Withdrawal Deal a second time, and backing a cross-party amendment for a Peoples Vote.But while he doesnt accept Mays Withdrawal Deal, still less Norway Plus, nor does Corbyn favour remaining in the European Union. Before Christmas, he caused widespread dismay among pro-Europeans by confirming that, evenhe were to win a general election, Labour would still be committed to Britainrsquos departure from the European Union.The Labour leaders instinct will surely be to secure concessions from Theresa May on the future trade negotiations. A closer alignment with the single market and a permanent customs deal, is what he wants. To get her business through, she would surely end up agreeing. Deal done. Britain leaves as planned. Pro-European Labour MPs would rebel, but that would be unlikely to scupper the governments pro-Withdrawal majority.Alternatively,Jeremy Corbyn stands firm and pivots to a referendum, there will be unprecedented turmoil in parliament, not least over what the question should be. Theresa May will stand down and there will be a political vacuum. As the clock ticks down to Brexit day, a new parliamentary party could emerge: the Europe Party, uniting all the pro-Remain MPs, and dedicated to a second referendum. The choice for voters would be Revoking Article  or No Deal. Mayrsquos deal, it seems to me, would be a dead duck by this stage.By Revoking Article  Britain would retain its opt-outs from the euro and its budget rebate and there would be no disruption of trade. It would be asBrexit never happened. Brussels would happily delay Article  for a referendum. However, this referendum would be like an offer voters canrsquot refuse, because MPs in the ldquoRemaniac Coalitionwould have to resign en massethe country opted for No Deal.It would be terrible campaign, exactly three years after the original referendum, with the far right raging about immigration. It would take years, decades for the bad will to subside. But faced with the prospect of a chaotic No DealI suspect voters would back Revoke. There is nothing undemocratic in having a final say. Parliament has failed to find a credible formula for leaving the EU. The only way end this agony and confusion is for Britain to accept that Brexit is just too costly, too dficult, too unpredictable and too all-consuming. The message would be: For Gods sake, lets just stop this madness and get our lives back."},{"url":null,"title":"tv-review-cleaning-up-the-plot-is-as-daft-as-a-loo-brush-but-sheridan-smith-sparkles","story":"***IT is a tough le being an actress.

There has been much written about John Beatonrsquos performance at Ibrox, much of which I do not wish to go into here, just as I do not want to talk about the inexcusable reports about the alleged threats made towards the referee according to Police Scotland.However, the fallout from the game at Ibrox and the questions surrounding the lack of clarity over punishments in Scottish football, in general, has left a sour taste in the mouths of many fans that not even a few glasses of prosecco at New Year could wash away.Something has to give.:Chris Sutton:online pub pics are valid then John Beaton guilty of \"sheer stupidity\"The Judicial Panel is not the brainchild of the SFA but that of the International Football Association Boardwith such  being installed across the world to make sure the laws and protocolsof the game are followed. However, the lack of transparency in the process is the fault of the SFA. While there are good intentions in the creation of a , the lack of scrutiny given to fans must change for the good of the game.Itrsquos only January but I have now lost count of the number of clubs that have come out and slammed the shocking standards of referees and the lsquostrangersquo outcomes from the compliance board. The SFA are pulling the wool over fans eyesthey think that this abysmal standard of governing can continue. Supporters are being let down on the pitch and then assured justice will be served by the much-derided compliance group behind an Oz-like veil that is even less rewarding than following the Yellow Brick Road.But rather than admitting there is a problem and trying to tackle it, the SFA are hoping that this all blows over.And it is their hubris that is preventing the standards of our game from improving.How often have we seen a manager fined for an offence in an interview or a player sent off for a kick only to have a similar incident a week later with no repercussions Itrsquos almost asthe Judicial Panel consists of three lsquoexpertsrsquo asking a Magic  ball and hoping for the best.Can you name any other industry were such major inconsistencies would go unaddressed  Rather than coming up with a fix, the SFA seem to just want to head to the Winchester for a nice cold pint and hope it all blows over.As said previously, the Judicial Panel is not the brainchild of the SFA but admitting that its rollout in Scotland hasnrsquot been as smooth as desired would go a long way with supporters. In my opinion, there is an easy fix. Whatrsquos to stop the findings of the  and the evidence used in a review being published once the case is over  Is there a reason that referee and supervisor reports and marks awarded arenrsquot published after every game While these arenrsquot monumental changes they would certainly help in giving fans a deserved insight into our officials and provide clarity on certain issues.:Celtic hit out at SFA - and call on referee John Beaton to explain Alfredo Morelos decisions at IbroxI canrsquot imagine managers and chairman disagreeing with knowing exactly what chance they have of having a punishment upheld rescinded. So what is the problem in publishing all details of the case once it has concluded  It happens in the court of law, so why canrsquot it happen following a review within the chambers of Hampden Park Any fan can accept a decision going against their teamthey can see the evidence and see the rules of the game are applied consistently, but itrsquos the SFArsquos constant desire to lsquopick and choosersquo when to punish managers and players that irritates so many. Somewhere in the process, something is going wrong, and it needs to be investigated.By being open with reviews and how rules are applied, fans would finally have insight into the whole process. Yes, some would disagree with it but at least they could see the evidence and justication into why such a decision was made.Fans and even some clubs have suggested a review of the governing body for a number of years now, but their calls have been largely ignored. Enough clubs have been critical of decisions this year to surely warrant one or at least to ask why an investigation hasnrsquot been launched The inconsistency of fines and suspensions has to stop. The picking and choosing of rules to applymust end. Hiding behind statements cannot and will not bring about real change.The SFAs inconsistent approach and weak governance is systematically destroying the game and promoting claims of bias at the very top.What harm could possibly come from a little more transparency in the game  What is there to hide Something needs to change, andthis column gets at least one more person calling for a review of the game and the inept governing body then my job has been done.

For arithmetical tasks there is still a calculator. A well-thumbed Filofax houses contacts and appointments. There is a stapler as well. Just as the people who buy tickets for concerts that Regular Music puts on find room for vinyl records alongside music-streaming in their lives, Mark Mackie moves with the times at his own pace, and without letting go of the working ways that make him feel at home.ldquoI suppose I am a creature of habit. I am quite happy with the way things are, he confirms. ldquoPeople slag me off because I have lived in Portobello for  years, since I moved through from Glasgow. I am coming up for my th wedding anniversary next summer, so thatrsquos not changed. And Irsquove kept the same job.ldquoI can see therersquos a pattern emerging, he laughs.Mackie began working for the company that had been founded by Pete Irvine and Barry Wright just a few years previously straight from the University of Glasgow, where his studies for a degree in marine science were overtaken by the fun of putting on gigs as entertainment convener at the Queen Margaret Union. Almost immediately, he moved from organising concerts for touring bands to play for a thousand people to being responsible for Simple Minds playing two days at Ibrox Stadium in the summer of .You can, as they say, take the boy out of Glasgow. Mackie may have been resident in the East for all his working le, but his West of Scotland roots still show. Simple Minds wanted to work with him because he was from their city, he says, and he is still grateful for the trust they put in him then. More recently, Mackie was behind the creation of the ABC venue on Sauchiehall Street ndash and is still hopeful that it may rise from the ashes of the Glasgow School of Art fire which also engulfed it. He is also the mastermind of the Summer Nights season of concerts at Kelvingrove Bandstand in August.When I arrive to speak with him, Mackie is finalising some advertising in the American music trade magazine Pollstar, detailing the history of Regular as a company founded in the white heat of punk rock in . In the upcoming issue, Mackie has been interviewed for the first ldquocity focus feature the magazine has ever run ndash and it is on Glasgow. ldquoThey havenrsquot done Nashville, Memphis, or New Orleans, never mind Manchester and London, he says, delightedly.Ask how Mackie ended up in sole control of Regular and he makes it seem an entirely organic process, with the founders ndash the most high profile of whom was Pete Irvine, author of hip tourist guide Scotland the Best ndash simply moving on in to pursue other interests or in pursuit of a quieter le.ldquoPete left in lsquo after Glasgow City of Culture to do Unique Events and Edinburghrsquos Hogmanay. Then Barry retired ten or  years ago. He stayed involved with the Edinburgh Castle Concerts until a year ago, but hersquos  now and hersquos had enough.ldquoSo it has just been me for the last ten or  years. I didnrsquot buy them out, I bored them out! There is no shareholding, or value on the company ndash in this business it is all about your contacts. I could have walked out the door  years ago and started lsquoIrregular Musicrsquo, free and perfectly legally. There was none of that accounting stuff, I just took more of the responsibility on my shoulders: first there were three, then there were two, then there was me.Not that he is alone in Regularrsquos homely Edinburgh offices. Along with a few long term associates in the promotion business, two of Mackiersquos three grown-up offspring are helping out on the day I visit.ldquoI have staff and people I bounce ideas off there are enough other people in the company. Itrsquos just the way things have worked out and I donrsquot feel lonely here! I guess one day Irsquoll think about what happens when I move on, but there are a few years left in me yet.In fact many folk had written off Regular Music before Mackie joined them. In , Irvine and Wright assembled a huge festival line-up at Ingliston on the outskirts of Edinburgh, with Talking Heads, Van Morrison, and Steel Pulse on the bill ndash and lost their shirts.ldquoPerhaps they tried to run before they could walk, Mackie speculates, ldquobut Scotland wasnrsquot ready for it. The great thing was that ndash in the spirit of punk ndash the industry rallied round in support. Looking back, the financial disaster of Ingliston was the best thing that happened to the young Regular Music because they took it on the chin. And the agent for Talking Heads was also the agent for U . . .Regular certainly broke new ground for stadium gigs in Scotland. As well as Simple Minds at Ibrox, they put on U and REM at Murrayfield, U at Parkhead, REM and Oasis at Balloch and REM, Van Morrison and Bob Dylan at Stirling Castle. These days it is Edinburgh Castle Esplanade that is Regular Musicrsquos regular outdoor venue in Edinburgh, and the coming year sees concerts by The Proclaimers, Paul Weller, and two by Kylie Minogue, a performer perhaps a little less in the usual Regular vein.ldquoSong-based music is what we feel comfortable with. That could be Garbage, Blondie, Ray Davies, Patti Smith or Mogwai. Nick Cave or Christy Moore. Those are artists who seem to be comfortable with us too. Irsquom sure there are nice people in heavy rock but I just donrsquot know them, andI donrsquot know these bands I canrsquot advise them on the right place to play in Scotland.The pop end of the market is also not really Regularrsquos thing, and that also reflects Mackiersquos personal view ndash which is why Kylie looks a little out of the ordinary as a Regular Music promotion.ldquoThe worst development in my time has been the corporatisation of the music industry, and the cynicism of that at the pop end of things. I think a music concert should be a le experience with your pals and there is a side of the exploitation of that that we donrsquot go with. Agents know not to phone us with certain acts because it is not the kind of thing we do. We are not musical snobs, but what we promote has to be something we feel comfortable with.If that ethos has not changed, the actual business of selling tickets has developed radically in Mackiersquos time.ldquoWhen I started it was all stamped addressed envelopes and postal orders. We advertised in the papers at the weekend and the bags of mail would come in on the Tuesday. I got to be able to tell from the steps of the postmen on the stairs how well wersquod done. If they had four, five or six bags we were almost a sell-out, two or three wasnrsquot so good. Thirty years ago no-one had credit cards, but later it was phone-lines with credit cards. Now it is all on email, so in the last  years there has been a lot of change, but it has been gradual so it has not upset my change barometer too much.Few folk no more about the venues of Scotland than Mackie. It was Regular Music that brought Glasgowrsquos Barrowland Ballroom back into use as a rock venue ndash and again Simple Minds were the catalyst.ldquoVirgin Records wanted to a make a video for their single On the Waterfront on a barge on the Thames and the band told them where to stuff that idea and began looking for a warehouse on the Clyde to shoot it. It was while looking that Barry and the Mindsrsquo manager Bruce Findlay stumbled on the Barrowland. We moved the stage to the other end of the ballroom and set up the mixing desk on the place where s bands had played.Regular Music also opened GlasgowConcert Hall in , with two nights by The Blue Nile.ldquoThe council didnrsquot really want us in the new hall because the Queen hadnrsquot come to open it yet. I had a fight to get a foot in the door. Of course, The Blue Nile sold out in a minute, and I put a ribbon across the stage and got the bandrsquos singer Paul Buchanan to cut it.ldquoI love the concert hall it sells very well. People love it and the artists love it, and it is so central. It feels a bit unloved at the moment and could do with a lick of paint, but over the last  years wersquove promoted more shows there than anyone , I would expect.He is also a fan of the SSE Hydro, which he says was designed with promoters like himself in mind.ldquoWhen they were building the Hydro they got all of us down and asked us what we needed. So they built a performance art arena, not one that is based on the footprint of an ice-hockey rink or basketball court. The great thing about the Hydro is that the stage can only be in one place. I really like it and the people of Glasgow love it.Then there is the much-loved, and much-missed ABC.ldquoWhen I saw the ABC, it was an empty shell that could be a good club that holds a thousand people. We needed a city-centre venue and I designed it on the back of a fag packet ndash it was just so obvious how the layout should be. The big stage there was a statement: this wasnrsquot a club for dancing, it was for live music.ldquoAlthough it was sold to the Academy group, Irsquom still a director and the biggest inidual shareholder and we want to rebuild and reopen.In Glasgow at the moment, however, it is Kelvingrove bandstand that is Mackiersquos baby, and the economic model he uses there is exactly the same as the one he used for his earliest gigs at the QM: make the ticket price pay for the artist and earn revenue from the bars and catering. It is the fortnight residency at the site that makes the sums add up.ldquoWe put the village in and do  shows in two weeks and thatrsquos a massive saving. We get the bar take, andthe concert washes its face, the artist has a good pay day and we have income beyond the tickets. We are now in our sixth year and it is getting much easier to programme. Now we are inundated with offers of artists, while I used to have to be very persuasive to sell an outdoor concert in Glasgow to the agents.Mackiersquos fondness for the venue goes back to his time at The University of Glasgow and seeing a student production of a Dario Fo there, and in recent times he has taken Regular Music into promoting theatre as well as music.ldquoI would love to do some theatre at the bandstand. In  it was dilapidated, but thatrsquos when I fell in love with it. It is a great space ndash there is a vibe about it, with the trees and the river. People like being there, it is a magical place.Meanwhile, Regular Music has been working at venues like the Traverse and the Tron and now Glasgow and Edinburgh Kingrsquos through Mackiersquos friendship with performer, writer and director Cora Bissett which dates back to her time as a -year-old from Kirkcaldy in a band. When she, playwright Peter Arnott and performer Angie Darcy created the show Janis Joplin ndash Full Tilt, the director suggested to Mackie that he come on board as the potential audience was surely people who go to his concerts. So it was that the Joplin show appeared between gigs by Rufus Wainwright and Mogwai in a Regular Music advert.ldquoItrsquos all about getting music and theatre audiences closer together, because really they are the same person on dferent days. Itrsquos obvious isnrsquot it  says Mackie.In fact Mackiersquos move into working with theatre producers ndash in particular Raw Material, the new company established by Gillian Garrity and Margaret-Anne OrsquoDonnell who are behind the revivals of Glasgow Girls, which Cora Bissett made with playwright David Greig and composer Hilary Brooks, and Bissettrsquos autobiographical show What Girls Are Made Of ndash is breaking new ground in offering theatremakers a route for making new work without depending on Creative Scotland support.For a man teased for his resistance to change, Mark Mackie has a deft skill for making things happen.Glasgow Girls is at Glasgow Kingrsquos Theatre January - Edinburgh Kingrsquos Jan - Perth Theatre Jan -Feb  Eden Court, Inverness Feb - and Dublinrsquos Abbey Theatre February -. Regular will be announcing the line-up for the th year of Summer Nights at Kelvingrove Bandstand on January ."},{"url":null,"title":"tories-accuse-labour-of-being-in-utter-disarray-on-brexit-after-richard-leonards-remarks","story":"Hours after the Scottish Labour leader had made his remarks on the BBCrsquos Good Morning Scotland programme, Diane Abbott, the Shadow Home Secretary, declared from the Commons dispatch box that Labour was \"committed to honouring\" the  Brexit vote.During the third day of the Brexit debate, the London MP said: \"I want to stress for Members on this side of the House that we are committed to honouring the referendum vote, and, more than that, we understand what moved so many millions of our fellow citizens to vote for Brexit.\"In a keynote speech on Thursday, Jeremy Corbyn called for a general election \"at the earliest opportunity\" to \"break the deadlock\" at Westminster over Brexit.Mr Leonard was asked directly about what the partys stance would bea snap poll were to be called and replied: \"Its not a matter of campaigning for or against Brexit...Our policy on Brexit so far has been to try to secure the best deal.But the Central Scotland MSP then pointed out how the Labour manesto going into an election would be ldquodecided by the Labour Party and weve got a process for determining that.His Labour colleague, the MEP Catherine Stihler warned thatthe party did not oppose Brexit, it would be failing the communities it represented.\"If a general election is called, it is absolutely vital that Labour stands on a  to oppose Brexit,\" she declared.\"It would be calamitousboth the Tories and Labour went into that election promising to facilitate Brexit, particularly in Scotland.Ms Stihler added: \"The Labour Party exists to stand up for the poorest in society, who will suffer the most as a result of a Brexit that will decimate our economy.

In particular the surface choice of the larger pitch is important to the major field sports – hockey, football and rugby – as it can accommodate adult competitive fixtures.”Following consultation with the likes Inverurie Academy, Inverurie Hockey Club, Colony Park Football Club, Garioch Rugby Club and Garioch Sports Trust, the council proposes a ‘long pile rubber crumb’ or ‘mm G’ on the full-size pitch which would be subject to a two-yearly test to ensure its suitability for rugby.In terms of the smaller pitch, a surface suitable for hockey training and multi-sport use is required.Mr Findlay says: “This is commonly known as a ‘sand dressed’ or G surface. This surface could accommodate hockey, netball , tennis as well as general multi-sport.”He adds that the council recognises that this option is not the preferred choice of Inverurie Hockey Club and Garioch Sports Trust, but stesses officers will continue to work with the club to attempt to meet its needs, making use of the new small pitch for local training opportunities.In addition, officers will consider how best to meet the hockey club’s competitive needs at Oldmeldrum Academy including access to changing facilities and adult matchplay opportunities when required on a Saturday.Funding for the two surfaces is included within the approved project budget.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The Inverurie Business Association and We Are Inverurie believe shoppers will stop visiting the town centrethe free parking ends\"  Council urged to keep free parking viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"council urged to keep free parking","story":"Inverurie Business Associationhas been working closely with We Are Inverurie to retain the town#s -minute free parking.The option to remove free off-street parking from the town has recently been under review by Aberdeenshire Council.Both of the not-for-profit organisations have voiced concerns about the latest proposal to remove  minutes free parking from towns across Aberdeenshire, including Inverurie.At the end of November Aberdeenshire Council’s report to the Infrastructure Services Committee indicated that a preferred option of the Working Group was to remove all free parking across the region.Both IBA and We Are Inverurie believe that, as Inverurie’s parking is currently ing a surplus, removing it would effectively result in people having to pay to park in the town’s subsiding other towns, a move the two organisations say is “unacceptable”.A spokesperson from IBA said: “We feel very strongly that the removal of the free parking could have a negative impact on Inverurie’s retail and town centre businesses by reducing trade from local people who pop in to the shops, visit the bank or library, or get coffee and lunch.“Most people do not carry change and the parking app available at the car parks isn’t always the easiest for everyone to use and is dependent on drivers having access to a moblie phone.“We have been canvassing feedback from our social media followers and to-date the majority of people who commented have said that the  minutes free parking encourages them to use local shops, with many saying that they would notthe free parking was removed.”IBA and We Are Inverurie have approached Aberdeenshire Council to request that they reconsider the option to retain the free -minute parking in Inverurie to support the town’s local businesses and encourage people to shop locally.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The three candidates who are contesting for the two Vice President roles within NFU Scotland will speak at the event\"  Inverurie hustings for NFU candidates viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"disney success for ne dancers","story":"Dancers from across the north east took part in the International Gathering of Scottish Highland Dancerecently.The event was held at Disneyland Paris and featured dancers from the Lawrence Dance Academy.Participants performed their own unique Disney-themed, Highland-based choreographies and compete in the annual Disney Magics Highland competition and at the Paris International Highland Gathering Championship.The dancers are also invited each year, such is their ability and stature, to dance through the Main Street of Disneyland Paris in a pre-parade that is watched live by thousands of Disney tourists.This year was no dferent, with over  Highland dancers performing and competing with great enthusiasm.Many awards, trophies and medals were won, but far more importantly each dancer and their families came away with a great experience and more friends.Principal and Director of Lawrence Dance Academy, Rhona Lawrence, said: “It’s such a great opportunity for the dancers.

He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.*WHEN the grey dawn broke over Normandy on June , , Don Mason had already made the first of his two contributions to the momentous events of D-Day. The young airman was part of the six-man crew of a modied Stirling bomber that had dropped  paratroops and their equipment at Ranville under cover of darkness. Heading for home, the Stirling came under fire from anti-aircraft guns on the French coast but ed unscathed to its base at Fairford in Gloucestershire. In the early evening the same crew were back over Normandy, this time towing a glider with more troops destined for the original dropping zone ndash and by this stage, almost  hours after the start of the Allies seaborne invasion, the full enormity of Operation Overlord was clear to see. \"It looked like a scene out of a nightmare,\" Don now recalls.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.\"We had been in No.  Group Bomber Command,\" says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. \"The whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.\"He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. \"We had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogether... it required a lot of dferent techniques.\"And it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore youd got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.\"There developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.\"On one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnt just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.\"That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.\"Obviously we knew something was happening,\" Don says, \"because we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werent aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.\"The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. \"Before that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.\"Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: \"One thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!\"Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Dons chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as \"Piccadilly Circus\" ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.\"We were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place,\" he explains. \"It was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.\"Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. \"They all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.\"In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. \"He released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one,\" says Don.\"There was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnt a great deal of resistance.\"It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crew-mates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: \"The Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.\"You couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnt want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.\"Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  \"Well, everybodys scared ndash I dont care what anyone says,\" he replies. \"If youre not scared you dont perform, but its discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .\"This is rude, I know, but its what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Its a matter of accepting whats going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job youre supposed to do.\"Its not a question of bravery. Im very suspicious when people say, Oh, youre a brave man, or Youve got a lot of courage. You react to circumstances. Its a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.\"And I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when youve got a unorm on and youre acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.\"So Im very suspicious about bravery. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I dont think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I dont know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.\"Don can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.\"I fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhams Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating,\" Don says. \"He had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a mans wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.\"But the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thats what I did.\"He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash \"I went to Arnhem five times during that debacle,\" says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until .He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crew-mates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.\"Although our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand,\" says Don. \"In  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnt got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hed said, Id love to see my old mate again. So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.\"Now you cant explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Its what they call camaraderie. Im still in touch with his family.\"As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash \"theres no doubt about that\". But he adds: \"I regret to say I dont think weve learned any lessons. I dont think we should be doing what were doing now [in Iraq].\"As I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Its not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action. Its a sad reflection on society, I feel.\"We ought to be very thankful that were free, because thats what it was about. We should remember that this country wouldnt be freeit had been overrun by Nazi Germany.\"It was all for a cause. People may say, Oh, thats patriotic nonsense.

Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

Wherever you are in Scotland – all you need is a clear night, a dark place to watch and a dose of good luck!Scottish Natural Heritage are currently running a competition to find the best image of the lights, with budding photographers in with the chance of winning a  Scottish Natural Heritage calendar.Jonathan Swale, who works on Shetland for Scottish Natural Heritage, is a keen watcher of the aurora borealis.“The winter months are the best time of year to see the northern lights and the best time is a couple of hours either side of midnight,# he said.#This amazing spectacle is caused by charged particles from the sun colliding with gas particles in the Earth’s atmosphere. This produces the wonderful patterns of dancing light that we see in the sky.#According to Mr Swale, the colour of the northern lights ies depending on the type of gas particles that are colliding. Most common is a pale yellowish green, produced by oxygen particles about  miles above the earth. Nitrogen gives out blue or purplish-red light, and the rare, all-red auroras are down to high-altitude oxygen, at heights of up to  miles.“The top places to see these magical light shows are areas free from light pollution,# Mr Swale continued.#You need absolutely clear skies with no clouds and your best bet is to stand somewhere where you have a view of the northern horizon. While they have been seen as far south as Kent and Cornwall, you have much greater chance of seeing them here in Scotlandthe conditions are right, as they get stronger the further north you go.““Andyou don’t get lucky and see the northern lights, you will get a fantastic view of the night sky, peppered with stars.”To find out more about the SNH competition, you can follow their social media channels on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram.For aurora alerts and forecasts, try the AuroraWatch UK, Service Aurora Forecast or the Glendale app.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

History books will doubtless capture him in his pomp, roaring and pumping his fists, but his greatest successes were rendered all the sweeter by the memory of the wan, wiry, and squally lad from Dunblane.Murray’s anger was almost always directed inwards. He knew he could improve, and by surrounding himself with a trusted team and sacricing home le for gruelling cardio and weights regimes, he earned a hard-won metamorphosis. It remodelled his body, rebooted his mindset, and allowed Murray to scale the summit of his sport’s most competitive era.With three Grand Slam titles, two Olympic golds, and that memorable Davis Cup win, it is easy to forget the player who came before the one whose identity and unfulfilled promise invited questions about Scottishness and Britishness. That Murray, the narrative went, was a duck out of water the gted yet surly product of a nation with no real history or cultural interest in tennis. But his  Wimbledon defeat of Novak Djokovic changed everything. It confirmed Murray not as our Great Peely Wally Hope, but a champion. A phenomenon. Pejorative characterisations were rarely given voice again, as those who uttered them realised they had misinterpreted a rare and unwavering dedication to success. The transformation was so profound as to defy description, but John Beattie, the former Scotland flanker, came close yesterday, telling Murray: “You have done more for Scottish pride than many folk I can think of.”That sentiment was echoed far and wide after the -year-old confirmed the light was fading on his playing career. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon offered a selection of superlatives: a “legend, a “credit to sport and to the country,” and “one of Scotland’s greatest ever sportsmen.” The best  “An outstanding role model and inspiration for young people everywhere.”Indeed, many accolades acknowledged Murray’s character. Billie Jean King, the  time Grand Slam winner, thanked him for speaking out about gender inequality.“You are a champion on and off the court,” she tweeted him. “Your greatest impact on the world may be yet to come.”It was an insightful tribute which recognised Murray’s legacy will not be measured by titles alone. It will be quantied by the way he helped his hometown see itself anew, with the gold post box in Dunblane High Street a symbol of wresting triumph from tragedy. It will be appraised, for years to come, by the inspiration he instilled in a new generation to pick up a racquet. And it will be appreciated, with some humility, by how Murray confounded the accepted wisdom that Scotland’s sons and daughters must forever be gallant losers in elite competition.‘Will we ever learn to love him ’ one newspaper asked of Murray ahead of his maiden Wimbledon final.

Clinical waste firm Healthcare Environmental Services folded recently with hundreds of workers made redundant after the North Lanarkshire based company lost NHS contracts when it had run up a backlog of waste.

It is crucial that all political parties use the upcoming budget negotiations to correct our country’s course.Just over a year from the passing of the Child PovertyAct and following the damning assessment of poverty in the UK from the United Nations’ Rapporteur, we had high hopes of the draft Budget.The Scottish Government has made tackling poverty a top priority, but platitudes and promises are not always making the transition into real, funded policy to transform people’s lives. Rhetoric does not help youyou are trying to decide whether you can afford to take a bus to work or pay for your child’s lunch.While ministers are right to restate their commitment to building more affordable homes, expanding childcare and helping parents into the workplace, we will not solve poverty merely with reannouncements of existing policy.It’s unacceptable so many children are living in poverty in Scotland – and the forthcoming Budget negotiations must right that wrong.Living in poverty can affect every aspect of family le. In the recent Joseph Rowntree Foundation report into poverty, we spoke to a single mother, Hazel, in Fe who is a care assistant with two teenage children.She told us: “If I compare things to an object it would be a hamster’s wheel. No matter how hard I work and how much I push myself, I still feel I am getting nowhere.”Too many families in poverty are faced with impossible choices, balancing paying the rent with the cost of childcare and being able to get to work, as essential costs rise. Every decision is finely balanced – do you buy fresh food or put the heating on  Everywhere they look, families can be restricted and restrained by poverty – but we know it can and must be solved.: One in four children living in poverty as childcare woes and disabilities biteOpposition parties will now play a key role in shaping the final Budget put before Holyrood and together, the parties must ensure the proposals avoid a step back in its fight against poverty.The Scottish Government now has an increasing range of choices about how it raises and spends money. But local government delivers critical support for low-income families, such as housing provision, local bus services and out-of-school care. To keep these families from being swept into poverty, they need adequate funding. Councils have been faced with continually squeezed budgets for day-to-day spending on existing services with little,any, recourse to tax-raising powers.Council tax reform will rightly be a key area of the budget negotiations. Currently, our evidence shows that falling behind with council tax, and harsh recovery of the money that is owed, is one of the key causes of destitution – where people regularly lack the ability to keep a roof over their head, feed themselves and keep dry and clean. Any reform to the system must ensure that there is a proper anchor for low-income households in dficulty so that they all receive the support they need.There are steps ministers can take now to ease the strain on household budgets. First of all, a quick and much-needed fix would be to increase the thresholds for the council tax reduction scheme in Scotland. This would ensure that working families in poverty are able to keep more of what they earn before they are asked to pay towards their council tax. Doing so could buy the Scottish Government and partners the time they need to develop and implement long-term reforms.: Gordon Brown warns of growing child poverty crisisSecondly, social security is another key tool that the Scottish Government can use to loosen the grip of poverty, and families should not have to wait until  for the income supplement to be paid. We would like serious consideration of delivery of an interim solution that is fully funded by Scottish Government but paid locally, using the expertise of councils in this area. As well as helping people who desperately need a step up now, it would provide genuine insight and learning before permanent rollout in .Finally, our labour market is not working for hundreds of thousands of Scots. There is much that Scotland’s business owners and managers can do to get the best out of their workforce by providing compassion, flexibility and security to allow people to build a le free from poverty. But fair work requires a supporting infrastructure that the Scottish Government must do more to provide.To make progress on labour market equality for women at work and boost their incomes requires further targeted investment in accessible, affordable and flexible childcare that can respond to the realities of the local jobs market, particularly in lower wage sectors. More investment in employability services is vital in breaking down physical and mental barriers, especially for those with long-term health conditions or disability. The Scottish Government also needs to look seriously at whether transport systems and concessions support those who need help the most. We all want to live in a society where nobody is worrying how they will get by from one day to the next. The true test of this Government will not be its words but its actions to support the poorest children in our society.Emma Congreve is senior economist at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4855270.1547217609!/image/image.jpg","title":"alex salmond case how likely is an inquiry into nicola sturgeon s actions","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Nicola Sturgeon could face some of her most dficult days and weeks as First Minister as pressure increases on the SNP leader to refer herself to an investigation over her handling of the Alex Salmond case. Mr Salmond won a signicant legal victory over the Scottish Government earlier this week when a judge at Scotland’s highest court ruled they had acted ‘unlawfully’ in how they handled allegations of sexual misconduct against him. The former First Minister- who has stringently denied the allegations levelled against him – has demanded the resignation of top civil servant Leslie Evans. Instead, it is his successor Nicola Sturgeon on whom most political pressure appears to be – with a bruising First Minister’s Questions session at Holyrood yesterday confirming the strength of feeling among opposition politicians. Labour leader Richard Leonard has written to the First Minister demanding that she refer herself to an independent  to investigate whether or not she has breached the ministerial code. : Sturgeon denies interfering in Salmond probeAt the centre of that call is Mr Leonard’s belief that Nicola Sturgeon acted improperly during meetings with Mr Salmond while an investigation is ongoing. We look at how likely that inquiry is to take place, and what damage it could do to the First Minister. Self-Referral While accepting the recommendation of Richard Leonard might seem like a turkey taking up an offer to vote for Christmas, Ms Sturgeon and her allies might see benefit in referring herself over her meetings. : Salmond refers Scottish Government to data watchdogIf they believe any inquiry from the  on the Scottish Ministerial Codewill clear the First Minister, they could yet see it as a viable strategy. In naked political terms, it will also crucially buy Nicola Sturgeon time, as any report could take weeks or even months to publish. There could, ironically, be a lesson to learn from her predecessor as Ms Sturgeon was deputy First Minister when Alex Salmond referred himself to the . A bitter row over the answers Mr Salmond gave over legal advice his government had received on the EU in the run up to the independence referendum led to a ministerial code inquiry. While Mr Salmond was chastised for the ‘muddled’ nature of his answers, the inquiry ultimately cleared him of breaching the ministerial code. Parliamentary arithmeticAs Nicola Sturgeon stressed repeatedly during yesterday’s testy session of FMQs, referral to the  is considered ‘a matter for parliament’. Richard Leonard himself has given an early indication of his plans should the First Minister refuse to refer herself to the . He told Good Morning Scotland: “If she self-refers, then that starts that process off. If she refuses to self-refer, then I think Parliament will try and take matters into its own hands.”Parliament, as Mr Leonard noted, has more non-SNP MSPs than SNP MSPs, andopposition politicians unite, then Holyrood could establish an investigatory committee. If all  SNP MSPs vote against an investigation, then Labour will have to persuade Conservative and Liberal Democrat support, as well as at least some of the Green group, to back a probe into Nicola Sturgeon’s conduct. If it comes down to a close vote, the position of Mark McDonald, who himself was censured by the parliament after allegations of sexual misconduct, could be crucial. The outcome There is clearly pressure from all sides on Nicola Sturgeon, with the news today that Alex Salmond had reported the Scottish Government to a data watchdog another unwelcome update. Ms Sturgeon could be tempted to seek exoneration by self referral, which again would potentially allow her breathing space as she continues to come in for criticism over her conduct as an inquiry takes up time. That path is littered with pitfalls, as an inquiry could yet find that the First Minister has breached the ministerial code.

Such oppor­tunities don’t come often. They were also seen to catch a seal in the bay at Lund, and photographed by several folk during their progress north, and so hopefully can be identied by the team that are still up here researching the distribution and abundance of killer whales around Scotland.From photographs, it has been established that an orca seen off Cullivoe, north Yell, on the evening of the th July, is a big male known as  or “Bigga”.Next day, the same inidual was identied at hrs heading north through Yell Sound.Some of our showiest plants are in flower just now. “I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows …” wrote William Shakespeare in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”. And indeed I do. There’s a fantastic bank near me where the pale mauve flowers of thyme are pushing through between the bell heather, itself with some plants paler than others.Common heather is not so bold in its colouration, but works in mass production, and will soon be colouring the hills with subtle shades. The third in the trio of obvious heathers is cross-leaved heath, whose compact flowerheads drooping from a single stem are pinker in colour.Changing colour, two striking plants are now in full bloom – angelica and meadowsweet. Although names for meadowsweet in dferent coun­tries all translate as “queen of the meadow”, it seems that its name actually comes from its use in flavouring the drink mead. Also in the days when hygiene was not quite so good as now, the plant with its rather nauseating scent was spread out on the floors of houses to counteract unpleasant odours. A Shetland name is “blackenin-girse”, from its use for dyeing wool.From the showy to the opposite – demure and unnoticed is a little plant with a big name that is very common about gardens, steps and roadsides: procumbent pearlwort. This low, hairless, tufted perennial has its base as a non-flowering rosette. However, the name pearlwort is said to come from the tiny, pearl-like white, long-stalked flowers whose sepals are actually longer than the usually four petals. In folklore it is said to have special powers of protection. So next time you go to pull out this so-called weed, just give it a closer look first.

It is due to reach the KPL facility early next week, although earlier this week it was moored off Ullapool during high winds while the tug ‘Ievoli Black’ sheltered in Gruinard Bay. The rig was still there on Friday .Alistair Philp, secretary of the North West Responsible Fisherman’s Association, praised KPL for the standard of communication with the affected fishermen.He said: “They have been pretty good with updating us. We have been getting passage plans and times and we have been disseminating that information out to the local fishermen. I believe much of the Inner Sound gear has been cleared from the anticipated path of the rig.“I spent a whole day moving my own gear. We can only hope that the rig sticks to the route given. It#s been quite a lot of disruption to many of the fishermen andthe rig deviates even a hundred or so metres there is still plenty of opportunity to foul the moved. and now more-densely packed fishing gear but at least in the area where I am working there has been a -plus metre corridor cleared where the advertised track says the rig will be.“No doubt there are some fishermen who are on holiday or who for whatever reason have not had the opportunity to clear all their gear. However, so long as the OGW sticks to its route damage should be minimised.”Despite the optimism, Mr Philp said he wasn’t sure what “process or policy is in place” in the event of damaged or destroyed gear.He added: “I would suggest that, considering this the first time this has happened in over  years, we assess the outcome from the passage of the rig and then cross that bridge when we come to it. So far, the fishermen and KPL are working together to minimise disruption. Hopefully,there are any issues, they can be resolved in good faith afterwards.“Considering this may become a regular occurrence and some fishermen are dedicating considerable time to moving gear clear and then once the rig is in Kishorn will have to dedicate considerable time to reinstating their gear, it would only seem reasonable in future to consider our options for some sort of compensation for the disruption.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1375347.jpg--.jpg?1546939693000\n","title":"vandals target dunclug play park","story":"A CHILDREN’S play park came under attack last weekend in the Dunclug area.Vandals daubed white paint over the mesh fence with splatters damaging the play surface.Offensive slogans were scrawled along the fence in what locals believe could be in relation to drug activity in the vicinity.The attack is believed to have happened overnight between Sunday evening and Monday morning.One of the slogans read F.A.G while another said D.T.U.S Scum.A local resident said there could be a link between the incident and the supply of drugs which is endemic in the area.The resident said it is believed that children or young teenagers were not the perpetrators.They said due to the size of the letters, which they estimate as being around six foot, it is believed that the unsightly graffiti is the work of adults.

Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups.

For the Kennedys – parents of seven children – found their maisonette home in Divis Flats in ruins when they ed to it just hours before Christmas.Ceilings and walls had been damaged, the bathroom completely wrecked and doors had been pulled off their hinges and were lying on the floor. “I was heartbroken when I saw the destruction,” said Mary as she sat in the home of her mother, Mrs Mary Brennan, in another part of Divis Flats. “The children told me that British soldiers had raided the house almost every day. Once they searched the house from top to bottom no less than five times,” she said. Mary who was interned in Armagh Jail since May last went on to say that the family would have to find a new home.“Our house just couldn’t be lived in now,” she said. As she sat with her husband Billy, interned for the second time in June last, she described how she was called to the office of Amagh Jail Governor Whitaker at  o’clock Christmas Eve morning.“I had no idea I was going to be released. Girls are often called to the office to receive the silliest of messages and I assumed he was going to tell me that a visit to Billy in Long Kesh which I had asked for had been turned down,” she said. “He read me a handwritten letter from Merlyn Rees which told me they were doing me a big favour by letting me out to be with the children at Christmas. I asked about my sister Evelyn Gilroy, who has two young babies, but he said that she was being kept in internment.”n THE milk Marketing Board has warned that all milk being obtained by householders during the present strike by milk roundsmen should be boiled before use.At present milk is being supplied to the area by farmers who are bringing it straight from their farms and the Board has warned that there could be a serious health hazardunpasturized milk is used without being boiled.Milk should be brought to boiling point and cooled as quickly as possible, says the Board. It should not be kept for long periods and bottles and other containers used for collecting milk supplies should be sterilized in boiling water before being used.Bernie to stand for electionBERNADETTE McAliskey is likely to be a candidate for the new Irish Republican Socialist Party in the forthcoming Northern Ireland Convention elections. She is already a member of the temporary executive of the new party.The Irish Republican Socialist Party is a breakaway from Official Sinn Féin. It is led by Wicklow County councillor Seamus Costello who over the years has been a prominent member of the Officials, but in recent times in dispute with the organisation.The breakaway formed itself into a new party following the recent Official Sinn Féin Ard Fheis. John Joe McGirl, recently released from Long Kesh, told a meeting of Leitrim County Council that he was familiar with the thinking of the UVF and the UDA and he was glad to see that many of them were “coming to see the true light”.He said that this was so even though some of their politicians were not serious about peace and were trying to wreck the current efforts to secure a just and lasting peace in Northern Ireland. The Sinn Féin county councillor went on to say that the policy of the republican movement was not to ask England to put up a white flag but simply to request them to disengage from this country.The issue was now in the hands of the British Government and he hoped they would come to the right conclusion.He said he was very pleased that the clergy had become involved in the peace drive and added that nobody desired peace in this country as much as the Provisional IRA. ‘End this evil’ call as some internees are freedAS  internees were released from Long Kesh and Armagh on New Year’s Eve the Association for Legal Justice called for an “end to this evil of internment”.Among those freed this week were three men who had been held as internees since August  . They were Lenadoon man Gerry Maguire, Mickey Donnelly from Derry City – one of the ‘hooded men’ – and Art McAlinden from South Armagh.Mother of two, Mrs Evelyn Gilroy , from Divis Flats, was reunited with her children Coletteand Deniseminutes after she had been released from Armagh Jail where she has been interned since May. She was the only girl internee released from Armagh.Former Sinn Féin TD John Joe McGirl, who was lted on Andersonstown Road as he travelled to Milltown Cemetery from his County Leitrim home for last Easter’s commemoration ceremony was also set free. His internment had brought protest resolutions from local councils throughout Ireland, including Leitrim County Council of which he was a member.In a comment on the releases Andersonstown Central Civil Resistance Committee joined the ALJ in demanding the immediate closure of Long Kesh.Speaking on behalf of Andersonstown rent and rates strikers, the Committee welcomed the releases – but it warned that the strike should continue until the last internees has been set free.The resistance group’s statement said that the spirit with which the internees endured their torture and suffering was admired by all.“There will be no thanks from us, or from the people of Andersonstown, to the British government for these releases. The men and boys in Long Kesh and the girls in Armagh should never have been parted from their families in the first place,” concluded the statement.There has been ied reaction to a plea from Fr Des Wilson that policing in areas from which the RUC is excluded should be put in the hands of local community associations.Andersonstown Central Civil Resistance Committee has described Fr Wilson’s suggestion as “forward looking” but in a statement the Committee goes on to warn that no police service which co-operates with the RUC will have the support of the people of Andersonstown or the Falls. “There is no chance of the RUC ever being accepted in Andersonstown.”Meanwhile, RUC men took advantage of the truce to set up a road block near the main gate of Falls Park on Boxing Day.

Voting began with the opening episode that aired on Tuesday, and John’s performances will be fully broadcast on Tuesday th.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, John said the show was a massive career opportunity.“It’s more exposure than anything,” he said.“It’s a TG show, which is mainly down south, and it’s good coverage because I want to break into the south in a way. This TV show will be a great  to get my name out there and to get heard. “It’s crazy. I’m a big fan of Johnny Brady, he’s super singer and the band that he’s working with are super talented, so to get to work with him is amazing.”He continued: “It has been really good. It was hard getting used to the TV cameras and being involved in the whole makeup thing, but it’s good craic. I was getting slegged about the makeup the whole day, but it was good craic. It’s all part and parcel of the show. “The whole experience has been phenomenal. You really feel like a star in the way that they treat you.”No stranger to competition, John is a three-time winner of our own Best of the West contest, but he insists he is not overly concerned about a victory on this occasion. However, he admits that it“would be a big bonus” and is asking the people of Belfast to give him their support.“For me it’s about networking and the doors it could open,” he said. “There was a girl on last year called Chantelle Patton, she didn’t win it but she ended up in Nashville this year – that’s the kind doors it could open.“If local people support me it would be great. Even winning Best of the West three years in a row was crazy, it really takes you aback when people are voting for you. I would love a wee push on this one. It would be really much appreciated.

This year it was disconcerting to read disclosure of NIO briefings from  refer to friends and colleagues being named along with their organisations.The Committee on the Administration of Justice was the subject of one of the documents, a document we know was shared with MI and Task Coordinating Group. The human rights organisation was described as “biased” and Professor Kieron McEvoy in particular was singled out as being considered “strongly biased and opinionated”.The CAJ highlighted human rights abuses of actors to the conflict, and in particular the state, and were highlighting evident abuses and questioning the lack of remedy avenues for victims. That year the CAJ highlighted, amongst other issues, the signicant questions of state collusion in the killing of solicitor Pat Finucane in  and the summary executions of three men at Sean Graham’s Bookmakers at the bottom of the Whiterock.The questions they raised then have not gone away and that the CAJ and Professor McEvoy are still engaged in the intense efforts to secure remedy for victims of violations is no coincidence.The question of “unsympathetic opinion makers” in West Belfast also taxed the minds of NIO officials prompting them to make a note on people best avoided. Those people included Professors Mike Tomlinson and Bill Rolston and Father Des Wilson. The purpose of the memo was not to state the obvious, but to urge others not to talk to them or engage with their analysis. The memo includes reference to Glór na nGael, Falls Women’s Centre and the Divis Joint Development Committee.This was the era of political vetting. When those included in such memos were not just ostracised from conversations, but were denied access to funding, demonised in the media and ultimately branded as part of a “pan-nationalist front”. This policy was part of the wider militarised agenda of isolating a community, censoring its representatives, and denying community organisations legitimacy.That deliberate approach in turn allowed for wider justication of shoot to kill policies, the use of plastic and rubber bullets, torture and degrading and inhumane treatment of suspects in holding centres and those imprisoned. In  the end game policy of collusion with loyalism was well under way. Loyalists had been armed, provided with information on targets and given cover. Targeting of the nationalist and republican community was based on the distribution of military files, the use of state agents, and these types of briefings.Then Secretary of State Douglas Hurd MP stated that “some community groups, or persons prominent in the direction or management of some community groups, have sufficiently close links with paramilitary organisations to give rise to a grave risk that to give support to those groups would have the effect of improving the standing and furthering the aims of a paramilitary organisation, whether directly or indirectly”.The killing of John Devine, the previous year, whose business had been in Conway Mill, had clearly not mitigated the policy.In any truth process these briefings, their context, their outcomes and all who played the game should be the subject of intense scrutinywe are to really understand our conflict."},{"url":null,"title":"ballymena electrical firm closes 57","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Majority of UUP members loathe DUP and dont want a merger \"In each party you could count the Catholic members on the fingers of your hand, but it will surprise many people that the DUP is ahead of the Ulster Unionists,\" Prof Tonge said.He said it was surprising that the UUP had no programme in place to attract Catholic unionists as most members would like a more religiously representative party. \"Both unionist parties are currently beyond the pale to Catholics,\" he added.Around , UUP members were interviewed by the authors.Prof Tonge said the party was considerably larger than the DUP, boosting a membership twice the size. However, while almost a third of DUP members claimed to be \"very active\", only one in five UUP members did.The partys strength was in Northern Irelands least populated county, Fermanagh, where around % of members lived compared to % of DUP members.Prof Tonge said the UUP urgently needed to recruit in the more heavily populated counties of Antrim and Down. He revealed that, contrary to popular myth, the UUP had recruited young people in recent years.\"Fteen per cent of its members joined in the last seven years. The party has been very successful in Queens and the Ulster University. Where it needs to do better is with ordinary, non-university young people,\" he said.The UUP boosts more women members than the DUP - its % male to the DUPs %. But Prof Tonge said the centralised nature of the DUP meant greater control over candidate selection by the leadership with women heavily promoted.\"The rise of Arlene Foster to become Northern Irelands first female leader is symbolic of the DUPs deliberate attempts to modernise the image of the party in the face of their unionist rivals,\" the book states. \"Whether Arlene Foster would have been able to rise through the ranks of the UUP will never be known, but is still a question worth asking.\"Although the partys politicians are increasingly liberal on the issue, only % of UUP members support same-sex marriage. However, % believe Northern Ireland should have the same abortion laws as Britain.Whereas Free Presbyterians are the largest denomination in the DUP, they account for just .% of the UUP, which is split almost evenly - % to % - between the Church of Ireland and the Presbyterian Church. UUP members are religious with % attending church weekly, although thats lower than the DUPs %. Almost six in  would mind a religiously mixed marriage in the family a little or a lot.The Orange Orders influence in the party is on the wane. Only % of councillors are members compared to % in the DUP, and % of MLAs . Around % of both parties members are in the Orange Order. Just over half of UUP members would transfer to the DUP in elections. A third said they would give a lower preference to the SDLP and % to Sinn Fein.

proposed Withdrawal Agreement provided the “legal basis” to offer the financial support to reconciliation initiatives in a joint-funding model with the EU and Irish government.In the exit deal, the UK and EU have committed to maintaining, up to , funding streams that were first established in the mid-s to support projects in Northern Ireland and the border counties in the Irish Republic.If we leave the European Union without a deal, we will have dficulties in finding a way that the EU and Irish government can spend money jointly with the UK Government in Northern Ireland on these important projectsKaren BradleyFacebookTwitterAskedthe £ million commitment announced by the Government on Friday was dependent on the ratication of the Withdrawal Agreement, she said: “The legal basis upon which this can be delivered is the Withdrawal Agreement.“It is set out in there andwe leave the European Union without a deal, we will have dficulties in finding a way that the EU and Irish government can spend money jointly with the UK Government in Northern Ireland on these important projects.”The proposed Peace Plus scheme will succeed the current Peace programme, which was designed to help promote economic and social progress in Northern Ireland and the border region of Ireland.The Peace programme has been running since  with funding from the UK, Ireland and EU, and will end in .Last May, the EU set out its plan to make £ million in funding to continue peace projects post-Brexit.The overall funding commitments,rolled out, will enable work to continue on the construction of almost £. billion worth of projects in both Northern Ireland and Ireland.Among the projects to have received funding to date has been the £. million Peace Bridge in Londonderry, which was opened in  and links Derry’s communities across the River Foyle.Youth Action NI in Belfast is one of the organisations that has benefited under the existing scheme.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Karen Bradley with young people involved with Youth Action NI The group used the money to set up the Youth Network for Peace, a regional project involving , young people in a range of social action projects on a cross-community and cross-border basis.Mrs Bradley visited Youth Action’s office in the city on Friday.The Secretary of State did not go so far as to say the Government would stop funding the projects in a no-deal scenario, but she stressed that it would be dficult to find a way to do it.“It’s not about the quantum or thesupport, it’s about how you legally deliver it,” she said.“As a Government, to spend public money you need to have a legal basis to do so.“The Withdrawal Agreement sets that out.“If we leave without a deal the question will be how do you legally do these things and I am saying to people we have a way of doing it legally – it’s the Withdrawal Agreement.“That’s why we should vote for the Withdrawal Agreement on Tuesday in the House of Commons.”Gina McIntyre, chief executive of the Special EU Programmes Body , welcomed the funding confirmation.“It’s a fantastic announcement today to have the commitment from the UK and an idea of the quantum that they are planning to commit,” she said.Martin McMullan, assistant director of Youth Action NI, explained how important the continuance of funding was.“We need certainty about where we are going in terms of our programmes,” he said. “We are a youth work-based organisation working with multiple partners on the island of Ireland, north and south, so I think we are really keen to look forward to how do we keep this work going because we still are in the very early days of nurturing young people’s appetite to be involved in politics and youth democracy.“So I think the announcement today is really, really important for our society in terms of moving forward, in terms of being hopeful and optimistic.”The DUP criticised the Mrs Bradley’s comments, branding them a “distasteful bluff”.MEP Diane Dodds said: “Ahead of Tuesday’s crucial vote on the Withdrawal Agreement, it is disgraceful and disingenuous that the Secretary of State should use the issue of peace funding as a bargaining chip aimed at securing more votes for the flawed deal.”She added: “The DUP believes it is wrong that the interests of iniduals, projects and communities relying on peace funding should be exploited for short-term advantage at Westminster.“The Prime Minister must move to clary the Government position and to reiterate all-weather commitments to peace funding in Northern Ireland in all eventualities.”"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit withdrawal agreement best deal for future of union bradley","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

Drivers entering the carriageway northbound also present a danger because they are entering the fast lane.\"The A is the most popular road in Northern Ireland for HGVs, which are limited in the maximum speed they should be doing on dual carriageways.\"Some other drivers, who may be driving too fast, seem not to take into account the dference in braking distances for these -tonne vehicles, which can cause serious accidents.\"A spokesperson for the Department for Infrastructure said a \"signicant amount\" of development work has already been carried out for the A Junctions Phase  road improvement scheme.\"The current phase involves the completion of the preliminary design, review of the scheme cost estimate and the drafting of an Environmental Impact Assessment Report,\" they added.\"The department intends to publish the Environmental Impact Assessment Report and the draft statutory orders for the scheme early this year. Publication of these documents will be followed by a further public consultation which will provide the public with an opportunity to have their say on the updated scheme proposals.  \"A public inquiry may also be required. Progression to construction remains subject to clearing the statutory procedures and funding being made available to the department.The spokesperson also said a number of gaps in the central reservation have already been closed, in addition to the installation of a central safety barrier at three locations on the route, with further barriers to be added in the next few months."},{"url":null,"title":"lord hattersley labour members want party to campaign for fresh referendum","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Nobody would mind paying to use an open, clean facility instead of going behind a tree..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"‘Utter confusion’ at bin collections and overfull skips  ","story":"RATEPAYERS across the district were left confused about alternative bin collection arrangements over the Christmas holiday period, according to a local politician.Mournes councillor Laura Devlin said there was also frustration that household recycling centres struggled to cope with the huge volume of waste and that many were forced to close early.Cllr Devlin has met with Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials to discuss the issue which resulted in what she described as ldquototal confusion over Christmas bin collections.She said she was inundated with queries about alternative household bin collections due to the bank holidays and claimed that residents did not receive direct communication from the local authority, with the onus on householders to check social media or press advertisements.ldquoThis simply wasnrsquot good enough and didnrsquot work, declared Cllr Devlin. ldquoIf the council is serious about recycling and ensuring that its targets are met, as well as delivering a fit-for-purpose service to ratepayers, we need to improve lines of communication with the public.ldquoThis utter confusion in respect of when bins were to be lted had a knock-on effect on the demand at the household recycling centres with skips filling up much quicker than usual and centres being forced to close.Cllr Devlin said staff at the centres in Castlewellan, Downpatrick and Ballynahinch worked very hard.ldquoFor these staff to be placed in the position of having to deal with many irate members of the public who had duly loaded their cars and travelled to the ious sites which were closed as the skips were full is far from acceptable, she continued.Cllr Devlin explained council officials had taken her concerns on board and had invoked what is being described as a ldquolessons learned exercise.A report on how the service can be improved due to be tabled at the next meeting of the councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee.ldquoThe council previously issued collection schedules but these ran out last October. Advising people to check online is all well and good, but we still have many households who donrsquot have access to broadband and people who are not computer literate.ldquoThe council needs to reflect on this and act accordingly and I look forward to seeing these much-needed changes in advance of the next bank holiday, she added.A local authority spokeswoman said Newry, Mourne and Down District Council was aware of a number of issues affecting both the collection of bins, as well as the operation of its household recycling centres over the holiday period.She said the organisation was ldquoactively working to resolve these issues as a matter of urgency..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Aidan’s work to go on display at Down Arts Centre  ","story":"A LOUGHINISLAND artist famed for his colourful and lelike portrayal of animals is holding his first exhibition at Down Arts Centre.Thirty year-old Aidan Sloan, whose work also includes some locally renowned politicians, will have  pieces on display in the exhibition entitled, lsquoThis Wee Place Herersquo.The talented artist can certainly stretch his imagination to determine what kind of surface to paint on. He has used everything from boards, wooden planks, old suitcases, football tops and even an old Belfast sink for his masterpieces.Aidan, who is often seen at home in his studio with a paintbrush in hand and his six week-old baby daughter Siacutene lying across his shoulder, says he has loved drawing all his le.ldquoIt wasnrsquot until  that I took a career break from my job as a civil servant to look after my young family and try to turn my passion for art into a career, he remarked.ldquoSo far it is going from strength to strength. I fit painting and researching my work in between school runs and the daily routine of having four children.ldquoMy we, Deacutearbhla, and our four children are my inspiration, although I can draw creativity from the subject I am painting too. Sometimes other artists and genres inspire me and perhaps inspiration comes from the meaning behind the painting.ldquoTo be totally honest I just go with what feels right to me at the time. I have no training in art or qualications in art history, but rather I have developed my talent from experimenting with paints, canvases and subjects over the years.ldquoI really admire the work of Christian Hook and Angela Bell. They both have created their own wonderful styles that are unique to them and I would say I have created something of my own style too.The painter, who already has one piece of work hanging in the Ulster Museum as part of the annual Royal Ulster Academy of Arts exhibition, described his delight in seeing his familyrsquos artistic gene falling onto the next generation.ldquoMy three eldest children love art too and they have grown up watching me paint and produce art.ldquoMy youngest child, Siacutene, is only six weeks old but I am sure it wonrsquot be long until she has a paintbrush in her hand. My eldest son, Ethan, won the Art Shield when he left primary school, and my daughter, Riacuteoghnach, who has epilepsy and autism, uses art as a therapeutic way to relax.ldquoHaving them watch me paint is also an inspiration and I feel it demonstrates to them that you should follow your passion and dreams, no matter what.Aidan has some of his own favourites in display at the exhibition, including lsquoBlending In, which is an acrylic painting of a hare on an old loft door, and a portrait of the late David Ervine, former PUP leader, which is acrylic paint and pencil on the inside of an old fishing wader.Heavily influenced by farming and all things agricultural, it comes as a surprise to learn the Co Down artist didnrsquot grow up on a farm.ldquoI often help my brother-in-law out on his farm and quite a few of his cows have become the subject of many of my paintings, he said.ldquoThere was something about the characters of animals that I really felt I could utilise in my paintings. Then I began to produce portraits of people with pencil, and my we encouraged me to try painting them a few years ago.ldquoI am Loughinisland, through and through. This has actually inspired one of the pieces of artwork that will be on display. The exhibition gives an insight into my depiction of growing up in Northern Ireland post-troubles.ldquoIt contains many animals from Northern Ireland, but I have also reflected on some things such as landscapes, political figures and events that had some sort of impact on me when I was growing up.ldquoWhen I was in primary school I loved art and I kept a booklet from P where I said that I wanted to grow up to be an artist. It wasnrsquot until I was in my late s, and with a lot of encouragement from my we, that I realised I could make a career out of something I had always done as a hobby.bull Aidanrsquos work can be admired throughout the month of January up to February  at Down Arts Centre and admission is free..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Devlin and Quinn selected by SDLP for upcoming elections  ","story":"THE SDLP has chosen sitting councillors Laura Devlin and Brian Quinn to defend their seats in the Mournes district electoral area at the forthcoming local government elections.Their nomination was confirmed at a recent selection meeting when the party also confirmed its candidates in the Downpatrick, Rowallane and Slieve Croob areas.Candidates for the Newry, Crotlieve and Slieve Gullion area will be selected shortly as the SDLP aims to increase its membership on Newry, Mourne and Down Council.Cllr Devlin said it had been her ldquotremendous honour to serve the people of the Mournes DEA over the past five years.ldquoAs someone who grew up with a strong sense of community and reconciliation, I believe the policies I have pursued during my years on council have adequately reflected that, as have the results, she explained.ldquoThis year will be busy as I am expecting another baby as well as contesting an election. But I enjoy a challenge and I hope that my constituency work on the ground spanning the past  years will stand by me as we approach polling day.Cllr Quinn said there was much more work to be done and he trusted that the public willboth him and his party colleague in the Mournes area to continue with this vital task.He added: ldquoI look forward to continuing to represent the needs of the public at council and ensuring that nobody is left behind.South Down MLA Colin McGrath paid tribute to the ing local government candidates.

Ultimately, that is our goal, the betterment of our society for the common good, he said Mr McGrath.ldquoTo win hearts and change minds to build up a culture of inidual and societal reconciliation.

An engineer explained that a conductor on a transformer, which had probably been smouldering due to a layer of snow or ice, caught fire.Carryduff, the highest point between Belfast and the Mourne mountains, had falls of up to six inches and drts were reported as deep as one and two feet in some areas.Ballynahinch had several inches fall inside an hour and this worsened as snow continued to fall. Dromara got it bad yet again and Comber reported several inches.The Department of the Environmentrsquos snow ploughs were in use at Carryduff, Ballynahinch and Dromara, and gritting machines were needed on many local roads.In Downpatrick and coastal districts there was sleet and heavy rain mdash and roads were made treacherous when this turned to ice yesterday morning. There was a spate of minor accidents as cars slithered through the snow and ice.Roads are being gritted by the DOE, but owing to decreasing fuel and salt they have only been treating priority roads.CROSSGAR mdash Crossgar is taking part in an appeal organised by the BBC programme Blue Peter, which will help provide bicycles for villages in Africa.The campaign, which involves the collection of stamps on Christmas card envelopes, is already well underway and these will be sold to buy bicycles which will help with transporting medical aid in remote African villages.Anyone in the Crossgar area who wants to help with appeal can leave their contributions at the Post Office.DOWNPATRICK mdash Representatives of Downpatrick organisations are asked to turn their backs on the wintry weather and go to the townrsquos library for a public meeting to consider plans for a major Maytime festival.A steering committee, which was born out of ideas kicked around by Down Councilrsquos arts committee more than a year ago, will present good thinking on how a wholehearted three-day festival of family fun will put the town in holiday form as never before.The centrepiece of the holiday weekend will be a pageant with a Patrician theme and possibly a medieval type flavour. Jousting is a distinct possibility and so are a number of other unusual dimensions.Although it will be called St Patrickrsquos Festival, the steering committee believe that a Maytime date would be better favoured by the weather than one on March  and would allow them to provide a much wider range of outdoor and indoor attractions.KILLYLEAGH mdash A Stormont Minister is to be asked to prevent the extension of a caravan park near Killyleagh.The unprecedented step is being taken by Down Council in protest against a recommendation made by planners to allow the development at East Down Yacht Club. The council are unhappy about the reasons given by the planners to allow the development to proceed.NEWCASTLE mdash The International Nile Canoe Expedition mdash which includes  year-old Newcastle man Marcus Baillie mdash is making signicant progress and more than a third of the death-defying trip has been completed.Two signicant firsts have been achieved by the eight-man expedition team which has already reached Khartoum in its bid to complete the longest continuous navigation of the mighty African river.Marcus, a former Down High School pupil, is hoping to complete the harrowing journey within the next three months.No-one has ever canoed over such a long stretch of the Nile and Marcus, who now lives in Liverpool, admitted before he left that the trip would not be easy.Despite many warnings from locals, few crocodiles were seen and the herds of hippopotamus provide much less troublesome than the mosquitos.The team are now battling slowly northwards against a strong head wind towards the famous cataracts and Egyptrsquos Aswan.CASTLEWELLAN mdash A burst water main in the Castlewellan area brought about a dry Christmas for scores of local families.There were also fears the sudden drought could spread to Dromore and Banbridge when the water mains burst between Tullymurray and Mayobridge. Because of the work to rule action by watermen, it meant the problem was not dealt with for several days.As a result families living near Tullymurray were without water since Christmas Day.PORTAFERRY mdash Stage two of a new sewerage scheme for Portaferry is expected to get underway in May and should take four months to complete.The Department of the Environmentrsquos Eastern Division Water Service has announced that the second of three contracts is now being advertised and work will involve the construction of a pumping station.

One of the biggest problems the local authority has to tackle is the hardcore of dog owners who point blankly refuse to clean up after their pets.Details of the new initiative were unveiled a few weeks ago. This week council officials confirmed that the campaign will be officially launched at the end of June.With the rates process well underway to determine the local authorityrsquos budget for the new financial year, councillors have agreed to make provision for new advertising and publicity campaigns as they bid to get on top of the dog fouling problem. Advertising the campaign on radio is also planned.Councillors and local authority officials are becoming increasingly concerned that a number of dog owners are prepared to turn a blind eye to potentially harming children who come into contact with the mess their animals leave behind.With the new campaign aimed at changing minds, dog owners will be reminded that it is their responsibility to clean up after their dogs and that not doing so leaves them open to an pound fine.Councillors say they are frustrated at the ldquoblatant disregard some dog owners and ratepayers are displaying and are keen to finally address the dog fouling issue.With a number of notable dog fouling hot spots across the district, the local authority is determined to do all it can to tackle the problem, given that it does nothing to enhance the districtrsquos image.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who is severely critical of dog owners who do not clean up after their pets, hopes the new initiative will be a success.ldquoThis campaign is long overdue and I hope that the small number of dog owners who break the law by not cleaning up after their pets will get the message that their behaviour is inexcusable, he said.ldquoDog fouling is a problem in many areas, even in my home town of Killyleagh. We are talking about a district-wide problem which we have not yet been able to get to grips with. People should not have to constantly watch their step while out walking and while many dog owners are careful to clean up after their pets, there are those who donrsquot care.Cllr Walker said improving the districtrsquos cleanliness was at the heart of the new campaign.He said that while reminding dog owners to clean up after their dogs was important, one way of dealing with the problem was hitting them in the pocket with a fine.He added: ldquoI have always said dog owners who break the law should be lsquonamed and shamedrsquo and still hold this view. Letrsquos hope that when this new campaign is launched it will be a success and help tackle a problem which is a scourge on this district..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Irish Street traders need consulted about scheme  ","story":"A LEADING politician has backed calls for improved communication with Downpatrickrsquos business community following a series of pre-Christmas incidents.Over  spaces at the Irish Street car park were temporarily unavailable at what is traditionally the busiest trading week of the year after contractors sealed off an area to allow a large lorry to deliver granite paving stones.The move left business owners furious and to compound their frustration, several spaces in Irish Street were sealed off to allow the large lorries to safely turn into the car park.Contractors also arrived in Market Street just days before Christmas to replace a section of granite paving which led to minor disruption, while much of the nearby Lower Market Street car park was under several feet of water due to flooding.The granite paving was being transported to Downpatrick ahead of work starting on Monday on a near pound, environmental improvement scheme in Irish Street.Politicians described the temporary loss of parking spaces just days before Christmas as ldquoextremely unfortunate and insisted that traders should have been told what was happening.This week, South Down MLA Colin McGrath confirmed he has written to business owners in Irish Street traders in the wake of the pre-Christmas debacle.He said: ldquoThe situation which arose in the run-up to Christmas was something of a perfect storm. Part of Irish Street was sealed off, spaces in the nearby car park were temporarily unavailable, contractors were working in Market Street and much of the Lower Market Street car park was under several feet of water.ldquoThere were ious causes for these issues from early delivery of stone pavements for Irish Street works, flood water in the town and emergency work to kerbs, but we must have better coordination between authorities and there must simply be better communication with businesses in the town.Mr McGrath said he has written to businesses and forwarded his contact details should there be further issues as a temporary one-way traffic system comes into operation in Irish Street during work on the environmental improvement scheme.ldquoI have also written to the districtrsquos isional roads manager outlining my concerns. Newtownards, Bangor or Newry would not face public authority road blockages in the lead up to Christmas.

The congestion also blocks access at the crossroads to Kilclief and Ballyhornan.Cllr Enright said the problem had been ldquogrinding on for a number of years and could no longer be ignored.He said it was no longer acceptable to say that roads congestion in Strangford and the problems on the Portaferry side were not the Department for Infrastructurersquos responsibility.He added: ldquoFerry service managers insist that the congestion in Strangford is not a matter for them, but for their roads counterparts.ldquoBoth departments are under the Department of Infrastructure which is why it is vital we meet with the Permanent Secretary to seeheads can be banged together and any budgetary issues resolved.Cllr Gareth Sharvin said there had been many occasions where vehicles queuing to use the ferry service in Strangford had a dramatic impact on the village.He added: ldquoThere is a perfectly good traffic flow system already in place which is not being utilised by drivers. We need to ensure there is enough resource to accommodate ferry traffic flow and demand to minimise the impact on Strangford residents.Cllr Billy Walker suggested the provision of a bridge linking Strangford and Portaferry should perhaps be considered.Cllr Enrightrsquos motion was also supported by Cllrs Willie Clarke, Jill Macauley and John Trainor..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Mahon Cup success for disciplined St Michael’s  ","story":"THE final of the long-standing Mahon Cup was played out before an appreciative crowd in the Drumaness clubrooms just before Christmas.In the final were holders St Michaelrsquos from Downpatrick and Queenrsquos Hall from Newtownards.League sponsor Gary Rodgers conducted the draw for the match pairings, which saw Gareth McKeever up first against Alastair McDonald and Bobby Douglas taking on Keith Lemon.McDonald got into his stride the quicker and soon built up a good lead over Gareth at  points to .

There was no school reputation, no building, no funding, no resources. They were unbelievable and were really pioneering.Naturally delighted with the honour mdash the first in her family mdash Mrs Roulston says that she shares it with a lot of people.ldquoThroughout my career, I have worked alongside so many wonderful and dedicated people, committed to making a dference to the lives of the children and to ensuring that they received the very best possible education in the widest sense of the word mdash teachers, assistants, dinner ladies, caretakers, volunteer parents and members of the board of governors, etc, she said.ldquoSo, on the day that I receive my MBE, I will be paying honour to all the people I have known and worked with and all those from other schools and sectors who show dedication and commitment to the children in our schools.The little people who she had the pleasure of teaching until she retired in  will always have a special place in  year-old Mrs Roulstonrsquos heart.ldquoI would like to thank all the children, those I have taught and also those whom I had the pleasure of knowing for all that they have taught me, for the pleasure they have given me throughout my career, for all the funny things they said or did which brightened up my day, for their kindness to me in all the drawings and little hand-made crafts they made for me.Originally from outside Manchester, Mrs Roulston has lived and worked in the south Down area from the late s after marrying her husband, Mervyn.After teaching practice in England and teaching in two very dferent schools in France, Mrs Roulston taught for some years in Greyabbey and Portavogie Primary Schools, as well as the Rupert Steiner School in Belfast, before taking a career break while raising her three sons mdash John, Peter and Timothy mdash in Kircubbin.ldquoI did a lot of cross-community work at that time as chair of the parent and toddler group, said Mrs Roulston.ldquoI also formed and chaired a community association and did a lot of work together cross community to get facilities for Kircubbin. It wasnrsquot a paid job but it was an important part of everything and I believe itrsquos where I first understood that cross-community work was so important.While working in Portaferry Primary School in the late s, she was fascinated on learning about a group of parents in Carryduff campaigning for an integrated primary school.ldquoI was reading all about it in the local newspaper and it was very interesting to me, but it was hot and heavy as well as there was lot of objection to the school, she said.ldquoI never dreamt that I would apply for it or have anything to do with it.

We initially rented it for six months but ended up staying for two yearsldquoWe were in a very derelict, vandalised, dirty building which we all very quickly had to work very hard get it up to scratch for the children.ldquoWe all had to break down barriers in many areas.Together with P classroom assistant, Mrs Marie Coiley, who still works at Millennium, they began to establish a school with an emphasis on total inclusiveness from the start.ldquoIt was very important to me that the school would be child-centred and the children would have a voice, explained Mrs Roulston.ldquoIt would not only be integrated in the whole Catholic-Protestant area but integrated at every level and it would be highly inclusive and children of all abilities and backgrounds would be welcome.After dficult early years in the Breda Park site, she believed that the school finally turned a corner when it secured a site in Carryduff to build around mobile classrooms in its third year.ldquoI always knew it was going to work, I knew it was needed and I knew that I was determined and the others around me were also very determined, said Mrs Roulston.ldquoIrsquove always been a very determined person and Irsquove alway never liked inequality or injustice of any kind.ldquoIt was very important to me that it happened and I was surrounded by some amazing parents who eventually became the board of governors.Shersquos rightly proud of her achievements and adds: ldquoI know I did good work.ldquoI must say there were days when myself and Mrs Coiley would often look around during assembly at all the children and all of the staff and wonder how did we get here.Now a director of the Integrated Education Fund, Mrs Roulstonrsquos hope for the future is to see a planned integrated school.ldquoIntegrated education is a growth area and I would like to see a situation the Department of Education and the Education Authority actually decide to plan an integrated school and not to be relying on parents having to fight for them.ldquoAll our grant maintained integrated schools have had horrendous journeys to succeed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Tally’s Down torment continues  ","story":"DOWN fell to their second successive McKenna Cup defeat when Donegal proved too strong for Paddy Tallyrsquos side in front of just over , spectators at Pairc Esler on Sunday.The Down manager made several changes from the side that started against Cavan as he continues in his bid to unearth some fresh talent, but it was Donegal and their new faces that impressed.The visitors registered the first score when Niall OrsquoDonnell converted in the first minute.

In addition, unlike the greyhound racetracks in the Republic of Ireland, Drumbo Park received no government funding.No more racing: Drumbo Park Greyhound Stadium is to close with immediate effect.“In the past two years, the directors invested substantial resources in an effort to turn the business around but a decision had to be taken that it was no longer viable.“The  full time and  part time staff were informed on Friday morning.“The directors would like to thank the staff, customers and dog owners for their support and dedication over the past decade.”Commenting on the closure, the Chairman of Lisburn  Castlereagh City Council’s Development Committee, Alderman William Leathem, said: “Lisburn  Castlereagh City Council is disappointed to hear that Drumbo Park Greyhound Stadium has closed with the loss of over  jobs to the local economy. “For over  years the stadium, located at Lisburn Distillery Football Club’s ground, has provided employment and a leisure offering to locals and attracted many visitors to the area. We plan to meet with management to offer any help we can in helping those who lost their job find new employment or seek training opportunities.”According to company director Michael McAdam, the closure of the greyhound racing business will have no impact on Lisburn Distillery FC, which uses the privately-owned stadium for its home games. • Read related report here.Six dead calves found dumped in Co Antrim Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch            ..

about the idea.Miss Ritchie, who led the party for  months during  , was speaking on the BBC political show The View.A week earlier she had appeared much cooler about the idea when interviewed by The News Letter.It has been suggested by an anonymous Fianna Fail source in thethat the ultimate aim is to absorb the SDLP wholesale into the much-larger Dublin-based party.And when asked about the idea of the name ‘SDLP’ vanishing from the political landscape after almost  years, Miss Richietold the paper this “would be a severe matter of regret”.“I joined the SDLP in  and I strongly believe in those social democratic and social justice values of the SDLP, and I’d like to see those values represented in the future,” she said. “I want to be, at this stage, cautious until I see the final outcome or recommendation.”But on Thursday night’s edition of The View, she said: “I think this presents an opportunity it’s not about a takeover.“It’s about a partnership between two parties of like-minded disposition. “It is a positive move for me.”In , she had declared no merger with Fianna Fail would happen “on my watch”.As to what has changed, she said Brexit came along, and Stormont collapsed.She added that “I think people are looking for a new type of politics that demands we do something that’s dferent, but above all delivers for the people”.Drumbo Park closes: Greyhound

Ireland could hinge on the approval of Theresa May#s withdrawal agreement have been labelled #appalling and distasteful# by the DUP.Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Karen Bradley unveiled the new ‘PEACE Plus’ grant programme on Thursday, declaring that the Government had committed to contributing millions of pounds “as part of its unwavering commitment to uphold the hard-won peace in Northern Ireland after Brexit”.But the commitment to deliver new peace funding until  appeared to be tied to the ratication of the Prime Minister’s widely-unpopular Brexit deal in the Commons next Tuesday.Mrs Bradley said the funding package– designed to thesucceed the current cross-border peace-building programme that started in  –was “a clear example of the certainty that the withdrawal agreement provides to the people of Northern Ireland and why it should be supported”.DUP MEP Diane Dodds accused the NI Secretary of using the issue of peace funding as “a bargaining chip aimed at securing more votes for the flawed deal”, branding the move “disgraceful and disingenuous”.And she called on the Prime Minister to clary the Government position and to “reiterate all-weather commitments to peace funding in Northern Ireland in all eventualities”.Last May, the EU set out its plan to make £m available to continue peace projects in Northern Ireland post-Brexit.Mrs Dodds said: “Brussels has also made clear in its no-deal Contingency Action Plan in December that the EU would ensure that ‘current programmes between the border counties of Ireland and Northern Ireland continue in all scenarios’.“For Mrs Bradley to imply that the UK government could choose not to demonstrate similar good faitha deal is not ultimately reached is a distasteful bluff.”In a visit to Belfast on Friday, Mrs Bradley was asked by the Press Association of the £m peace funding was dependant on the ratication of the PM’s deal.She said the proposed agreement provided the “legal basis” to offer the financial support, adding: “It is set out in there andwe leave the EU without a deal we will have dficulties in finding a way that the EU and Irish Government can spend money jointly with the UK Government in Northern Ireland on these important projects.”Drumbo Park closes: Greyhound stadium shuts with loss of more than  jobs Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF

When I woke up whenever and potted and mooched and just saw what the day would bring.Like most people, the demands of work, family, friends, errands and the general stuff of le, mean that at any given moment we can be doing one thing, planning something  and thinking about many more.I get in to grasshopper phases where it feels like there is so much on my lsquoto dorsquo list that I flit and fly between myriad things and sometimes few of them get completed how Irsquod like or indeed completed at all and for those that that do get sorted and sewn up with aplomb, there is no time to take any satisfaction or pride because it is time to crack on with the next thing folks.I read a while ago about a concept that affects your brain around scarcity.The idea that when we feel that something is scarce, be that time, money or something  that we feel is in short supply, it can make us act with less focus and rationality thanwe had an abundance of such.So, in my case, when I feel time is pressured, I am more likely to try to do more with the result that I feel I have less time and my scarcity suffering brain is more likely to forget, to misplace to mess up.And so, knowing this, I am going to set aside the lsquoto dosrsquo and the lsquoshouldsrsquo and curl up on the settee with my utterly wonderful friend and eat and chill and know that with every mouthful of delicious cake, I am doing myself some good. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He decided to put together a calendar of his work together to help raise money for the Alzheimers Society, as his father died from the disease in .The -year-old was encouraged to put together the calendar after posting some of his pictures in a local Facebook group.He said: \"I was surprised by the positive response and all the encouraging comments my first set of photos received, said Phil, ldquoWhen I posted another set of photos people started suggesting putting them together in a book or a calendar.\"Mr Lewis said the idea stuck and he asked the group to vote for their favourite photos which would be included in the calendar, before working with local graphic designer Ceri Legg who designed the layout and Beacon Printers, who printed the calendars.Around  calendars were printed altogether which were on sale in shops throughout the town, but have now fully sold out.ldquoI was really worried at first as the number  was suggested to me by the printers, and as soon as I picked them up I start feeling anxious about how exactly I was going to sell  calendars,\" said Mr Lewis.\"I thought that  would have been a more realistic number. I was completely taken aback by the huge response.\"I had people contacting me from all over the world ndash Australia, Spain, Texas, askingI would post calendars to them. This is on top of the response from local people.\"I spent most of my evenings in that first week doing deliveries all over Penarth,\" Mr Lewis added.Through the sales, Mr Lewis has raised more than pound, for the Alzheimers Society.He said: \"It seemed like the right thing to do really, as Penarth is a very community-oriented town so doing a calendar for charity fits with the outlook of the people of Penarth.\"Now, Mr Lewis is looking at printing more calendars this year to help raise further funds for the charity.\"If the idea of this calendar had never been suggested then my photos would have ended up just sitting on my computer,\" he said.\"Irsquom just glad that this hobby that I really like has ended up being put to good use by raising this money for charity.To get in touch with Mr Lewis about purchasing a calendar, email philip.lewis@live article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Though he had asthma from birth, Tiernan didn’t appear to suffer any attacks until he was aged . While he used the blue Ventolin inhaler, he never used the brown one, which is a steroid, according to his dad Stephen. When Tiernan came to his mum and dad’s room for help that morning, they tried everything to help him but he was gone within  minutes.Tiernan GreenHis tragic passing plunged Lurgan into shock and grief as many of his friends and school mates struggled to come to terms with the death of such a young and energeticman.However, his parents and brother and sister felt the unimaginable pain of his loss most deeply.Mum Donna admits to struggling to deal with the loss of her ’” handsome young son.Donna said: “As the second anniversary approaches of the death of my darling son Tiernan, it really just seems like yesterday.The Green family Tiernan with Mum Donna with youngest son Ryan Dad Stephen , Mise and Stefan“No mother or father should have to lay their child to rest.It should be the other way about.“Over these two years I have seen my family change and, when I say this, I mean we all have changed as people.I can honestly say our lives will never be the same again! “It’s weird how grief works on the mind. One day I might be ok or maybe for a few days.

My husband attends a meeting called Anam Cara and he finds it helps! “I find with me doing all my own asthma awareness and speaking out at dferent events- this, for me, ismy therapy this is what helps me -a mother who has lost her child.“We, as a family, lean off each other through the grief.“When I see my daughter is having a bad day I will speak to her and say THIS is ok. You are allowed to cry. You are allowed to have your quiet days when you don’t talk that much.“I know this is grief because I see it myself. I am the one who witnesses it. I am here for my family and they are here for me so we are all in this together.“I will still continue to raise as much awareness as possible and try and save as many lives as I can. I don’t want any other family to go through what we have.“As long as I am living my son’s name will always live on through others,” said Donna.The familyhas raised around £, for ious charitiessince Tiernan passed away.The first year the family raised funds for Craigavon area hospital buying a special machine for respiratory help costing more than £k.They also raised cash to renovate the Family Room at the hospital with Tiernan’s plaque and new furniture and a TV.Last year they raised money for Anam Cara - a counselling service for families suffering from grief.Stephen attends Anam Cara regularly and it has helped him deal with the intense grief he felt at the loss of his son. Indeed he has become so close to the group that the organisation has asked him to become a spokesperson for them.Donna has dealt with her grief by raising the profile of asthma and campaigning for greater awareness on how to treat the illness so other families don’t have to go through a similar dreadful tragedy.“I have been getting messages from people across the country, thanking me for helping to save their son’s le or even thank you for saving my own le.It’s unreal.“It has brought me great comfort knowing that I have helped,” she said.The family also have organised a truck run over the past two years and are planning another this May. It has raised thousands of pounds.However, on this second anniversary, the Green family will remain close to each other, helping each other deal with the loss of such a beloved son and brother.If you would like more support and information on Asthma, please check out the websitewww.asthma.org.uk get-involved campaigns government northern-ireland If you need help with grief you can contact Anam Cara via their website www.anamcara.ietry catch            ..

According to the latest Real Estate Outlook report from CBRE, there was take-up of , sq ft of office space across  transactions, in . It says that was more than double the figure a year earlier. Some of the major deals completing last year included PwC’s move to Merchant Square, the Northern Ireland Civil Service at  Lanyon Place and Allstate at Mays Meadow. “During an unsettling period of political uncertainty, the local office market is an indicator of the health of the Northern Ireland economy, with the professional services and technology sectors in particular leading the way,” Brian Lavery, managing director at CBRE said. “Currently we only have around , sq ft of grade A office space available fragmented across a number of buildings underpinning the need for more investment in this space. “Alongside this office space growth, we are also seeing the green shoots of demand for residential living in the city centre. We believe this is the trend to track in  and beyond as investors across the UK and globally continue to look for opportunities in this area. “However, on a more positive note, we are seeing strong interest from a wide spectrum of investors for office investments in Belfast which is being driven by growing rents and demand, combined with limited supply of high-quality accommodation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/34344455.jpg","title":"delta air lines buying  new airbus jets","story":"Posted on Monday January  by Ulster Business US carrier Delta Air Lines is buying an additional  part-Belfast made passenger planes, it has emerged. The order for the Airbus A- jets – formerly Bombardier CSs before the firms agreed a tie-up – brings Delta’s order book to  planes. The latest deal could be worth as much as .bn, according to the book price. However its likely the sale price is signicantly less than that. The wings and signicant parts of the aircraft fuselage are made in Bombardier’s Belfast plant. \"Delta has always been deeply focused on the passenger experience, and the A fits perfectly with that philosophy,” Christian Scherer, Airbus chief commercial officer said. \"You just need to take a look at Delta’s cabin on the A to see it’s setting a new standard in short-haul flying. The A will provide passengers with a level of comfort and convenience that makes flying a pleasure again, while meeting Delta’s high standards for efficiency and reliability.” Gil West, Delta’s chief operating officer, said: “These additional A aircraft will continue to strategically enable Delta to refresh our fleet, drive further advances in the customer experience and serve as an excellent investment for our customers, employees and shareowners for Delta into the next decade. “We look forward to taking our first A- in  at the Airbus assembly facility in Mobile, Alabama.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"outlook  uncertain times may lead to a business downturn","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Its already the New Year and economist John Simpson examines whats facing the Northern Ireland business community in the next  months The early weeks and months of  pose more dficult prospects for managing the economy and maintaining and boosting business continuity than key decision makers would either wish for or normally expect. In addition to the uncertainties of managing the economy, which face the Government, there is a huge element of uncertainty about the reliability of the conventional economic forecasts. How disruptive will be the consequences of Brexit implementation  Northern Ireland goes into  with an economy that is growing, but growing only very slowly. While the UK economy has recovered the output levels lost during the recession of the past decade, Northern Ireland in - still has overall output % lower than in . In contrast, the Irish economy has regained a rate of economic growth that is better than the UK and compares well with the EU average.There is now an emerging picture of the UK economy growing more slowly than the EU average and, within the UK, Northern Ireland has one of the slowest regional improvements, lagging behind the rest of the UK. The international prospects for  are now forecast to be less expansionary than last year and the OECD points to slower trade growth in  linked to disruption of international trade partly linked with the more restrictive trade policies of the US and also to tightening changes in monetary and fiscal policies.Northern Ireland’s slower growth is set to continue. Political instability and Brexit uncertainties continue to be a concern. The most recent annual business enquiry, reporting on the outcome in , shows the stark contrasts. In , the non-financial business economy here expanded at a rate of .%: the rate for the UK was .%. All this in the run up to the finalBrexit deal which is widely expected to have a further initial adverse impact and, later, may go either way to give a boost or restrain, further ahead. Brexit, in whatever form it eventually takes, adds a considerable degree of uncertainty. The conventional models to anticipate how the economy will behave are attracting a degree of scepticism well beyond just the margin of error that might be expected. When otherwise well established and well understood agencies such as the Office of Budget Responsibility and the Bank of England attract ill-informed criticism, usually by critics who have little understanding of the inter-action of the main economic iables and the professional competence of the authors, the consequence is a lack of rational measured influence.Critical political comments on prospects for the economy in  are heavily discounting the negative assessments. As the year evolves, the answer to the non-professional critics will lie in the evidence as the unfolding trends confirm that pessimism about the impact of Brexit is well merited.At the risk of being challenged,the conclusion proves misplaced, the prospects for Northern Ireland in  are not reassuring.  In the opening days of ,business decisions can be postponed, chances are that they will. Writing in December for an analysis of business prospects in the following year is, this time, more hazardous than any other recent period. No matter what decisions are made in Westminster, each month in  will reveal a new set of influences each, in dferent ways, recalibrating the economic arithmetic for the months ahead.The real cautionary ideal would be to ‘lock the doors and keep everything inside’ until the external economic environment settled down. Of course that would make a risky situation even riskier. Business managers must manage their business and ‘locking the doors’ is a guaranteed crisis or collapse. Businesses will keep trading, responding to changing market pressures, and hoping that the unexpected economic and political shocks are manageable.The least complicated and most reliable basis for decision making in the early part of  is that there continues to be a major degree of uncertainty about how the economy will respond to events, some of which may have erse implications. Decisions can often be readily postponed. Delay can be less stressful than anticipation of the uncertain.The critical uncertainties include:The final form of Brexit to be agreed by the UK Government and the EU Have the exchange rates for the pound and euro stabilised How will the Bank of England respond: base rate could further increase After Brexit, how will the UK Chancellor respond in the next Budget The answers to these uncertainties are critically important for the UK and, specically, Northern Ireland. To a signicant degree, people in Northern Ireland are not in a position to set the answers. UK politics will be influential. However, that is not an excuse to argue that all responsibility lies outside local control.How will the Northern Ireland institutions respond If there is still no devolved Executive, the ‘no decision’ making drt will be an ever increasing negative influence. If, perchance, the Executive is reformed, how long will it take to regain lost momentum  Capital budgets in particular have slowed gradually as old contracts were finished. New contracts will take time to move from approval ‘to spades in the ground’.Even more critical, the private sector of the economy may be disappointed as domestic consumers continue to take a precautionary stance as they react to an increase in job insecurity and take a more pessimistic view of their expenditure needs.The prospects for  can be summed up either as challenges or opportunities awaiting sensible momentum. Can the negative Brexit messages give way to a more widely supported Brexit settlement  Can the negative impact of the local political stand-points be by-passed as the evidence of mutual gain from an agreed and restored Executive are realised  Is there a will to introduce a constructive programme for Government which really puts the economyfirst  The economic forecasters have good reason for their warnings of a post-Brexit bump. Even critics of the forecasters will have to accept that pervasive and persuasive logic must be acknowledged. It is time to ‘batten down the hatches’ and persevere.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mo_1.jpg","title":"two tech firms setting up in belfast city centre","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Two UK tech firms are setting up shop in one of Belfast’s newly revamped city centre buildings, Ulster Business can reveal.Tech firms CYTI and Firemelon, which are both owned by David Corney, will take on the fourth and fth floors of Moneda House, at Wellington Place.
