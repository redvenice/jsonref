Pratchett’s last request to Gaiman before he died was that he adapt the novel they wrote together Gaiman wrote the screenplay and worked as showrunner on the BBCAmazon co-production, which the Radio Times called “a devilishly funny love letter to the book”.But Christians marshalled by the Return to Order campaign, an offshoot of the US Foundation for a Christian Civilisation, disagree. More than 20,000 supporters have signed a petition in which they say that Good Omens is “another step to make satanism appear normal, light and acceptable”, and “mocks God’s wisdom”. God, they complain, is “voiced by a woman” – Frances McDormand – the antichrist is a “normal kid” and, most importantly, “this type of video makes light of Truth, Error, Good and Evil, and destroys the barriers of horror that society still has for the devil”. They are calling on Netflix to cancel the show.Gaiman responded to the petition on Twitter, writing: “I love that they are going to write to Netflix to try and get #GoodOmens cancelled. Says it all really. This is so beautiful ... Promise me you won’t tell them?”The publisher and science fiction critic Cheryl Morgan tweeted: “Miraculously God has already done it. Don’t tell them She put it on Amazon instead.”Return to Order is based on the writings of the author John Horvat II.

She will be the first woman to serve in the position, established more than 300 years ago.Speaking to the  after the announcement, Oswald said that after a “distinctly unsettling process” she was “very pleased, daunted, grateful to my nominators”.“I look forward to thinking about all forms of poetry,” she said, “but particularly the fugitive airborne forms.”Celebrated for their exploration of nature and myth, Oswald’s nine books of poetry have already brought her prizes including the TS Eliot, Griffin and Costa poetry awards. The former poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy has hailed her as “the best UK poet now writing, bar none”, while Jeanette Winterson has called her Ted Hughes’s “rightful heir”, a poet not “of footpaths and theme parks, but the open space and untamed life that waits for us to find it again”.Oswald’s dreamlike visions of the countryside are rooted in acute observation of animals, plants and the landscape, while her reworkings of ancient stories are filled with humanity and compassion.Born in 1966, she studied classics at Oxford, working as a gardener alongside her burgeoning career as a poet. Her debut, The Thing in the Gap-Stone Stile, won the Forward first collection prize in 1996, and her polyphonic evocation of a river, Dart, took the TS Eliot award in 2002. She teamed up with the illustrator Jessica Greenman for Weeds and Wild Flowers, which won the Ted Hughes prize in 2010, and examined war and death in 2011 with her filleting of Homer’s Iliad, Memorial. Oswald withdrew from the TS Eliot award that year in protest at the private investment management company sponsoring the prize, then took the Costa award and the Griffin prize with her 2016 collection, Falling Awake.The former poet laureate Andrew Motion, who was one of the 167 people to nominate Oswald, declared himself “extremely pleased”.“Pleased because she’s one of the best poets writing at the moment and richly deserves the honour of the position,” Motion said, “because it’s beyond high time that the post was taken by a woman, and because she has some very interesting and energetic ideas for the role.”Established in 1708, the Oxford position is one of the UK’s top accolades for poetry, with former professors including Seamus Heaney, Robert Graves and WH Auden. Candidates must win the support of at least 50 Oxford graduates and be “of sufficient distinction to be able to fulfil the duties of the post”, which include one lecture a term during an appointment lasting four years. The poets Andrew McMillan and Todd Swift also appeared on the shortlist. Oswald received 1,046 of the votes cast, with McMillan taking 210 and Swift trailing with 58.The contest was marred by controversy surrounding Swift, who founded the independent poetry imprint Eyewear Publishing in 2012. Last year the Bookseller reported that the firm’s contracts included clauses forbidding authors from contacting the Society of Authors, with the imprint’s behaviour on social media also attracting criticism. The poets Claire Trevien and Aaron Kent wrote to Oxford University suggesting Swift should be removed from the contest, arguing that he was “unsuitable for the role of Oxford professor of poetry, and the level of prestige it offers”.This year’s election was not the first to become embroiled in scandal. The poet Ruth Padel became the first woman ever elected to the position in 2009, but was forced to resign within two weeks after it emerged she had contacted journalists with allegations of sexual misconduct surrounding fellow shortlistee Derek Walcott.Oswald now promises to create a stir of a quite different kind, focusing on spoken poetry and expanding the role to embrace the city of Oxford as well as the university. Writing in a statement to support her candidacy, the poet outlined plans for “Extreme Poetry Events” including all-night readings, a carnival of translations and a poem circus modelled on John Cage’s anarchic community piece Musicircus.“A book is a wonderfully quiet place,” she wrote, “but I’ve always thought that poetry, if offered the right occasions, will rise to meet them and that one of our tasks as poets is to invent such occasions for ourselves and for others. I’d be delighted if I could tempt schoolchildren to take part in some of these.”Poetry is “an ancient memory system”, Oswald continued, that “asks to be heard out loud or at least read in the manner of a musical score” and “promotes imaginative over rational understanding”, but the medium is currently undergoing radical change.“I see no reason why Instagram poems shouldn’t prove as rewarding as Concrete poems or the visual poems of classical Chinese,” she wrote, “and I’d welcome the chance to invite young poets to engage in discussion about what poetry has been and is becoming.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e21e428c89cf67a8cea652659aeb7b0caf833bbb/0_408_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c785585c21e7ac1a6a4a197f1835968c","title":"game digital agrees to 52m takeover by mike ashleys sports direct","story":"Retailer said it had little choice as analysts anticipate possible consolidation with House of Fraser storesGame Digital has agreed to a £52m takeover by retail tycoon Mike Ashley, potentially paving the way for video gamers to descend on House of Fraser stores for live battles in purpose-built gaming arenas.Analyst Zoe Mills at Global Data said Game was accepting the offer “begrudgingly” because it was struggling to cope with a marketplace in which gamers often bypass traditional retailers altogether.She said this had left Game Digital more reliant on its embyronic partnership with Sports Direct to open a network of live video gaming arenas in stores, under the Belong brand.“Game launched the first arenas back in 2017, but it has only grown to just over 20, despite the planned tie-up with Sports Direct that was set to open its Belong arenas in up to 100 new locations,” she said.“Now that Sports Direct controls House of Fraser, there is a clear option to utilise some of the increasingly redundant space in some of those stores, helping to generate higher footfall and increase its investment in experiential retail,” she said.Game said: “In coming to this recommendation, the board has considered the growing size of Sports Direct’s shareholding in the Group and the reliance Game has on Sports Direct for supporting its future growth prospects combined with the ongoing industry headwinds, current negative retail market outlook and the likely elongated current console lifecycle which are expected to impact the future financial performance of the group.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d78961f8d86e92a13aeb182857491e95332ae53b/370_191_2762_1657/master/2762.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dba2e70aab1d5ae8408bb44aa5e702fd","title":"what oil companies knew the great climate cover up podcast","story":"Oil firms are said to have known for decades of the link between burning fossil fuels and climate breakdown.

During these times, I find myself digging deep into my repertoire for an easy one-dish bake that will satisfy all the mouths around my table.This recipe is my current midweek saviour – an enchilada-inspired bake, featuring layers of corn tortilla mingling with black beans, corn from the freezer (though use fresh if you have it), baby spinach, a spicy tomato sauce and gooey cheese.This recipe is versatile by design. Use ingredients that you have in your pantry for the filling: chickpeas or cannellini beans would work well, black olives would add a nice hit of saltiness or opt for kale or swiss chard in place of spinach. I’m keen to add a layer of roasted sweet potato for an even heartier dish.An additional but very helpful shortcut is to use a good quality store-bought passata or pasta sauce – if you do this, you’ll need about 1 litre of sauce.extra virgin olive oil1 red onion, roughly chopped3 cloves garlic, roughly chopped1.2kg (3 cans) diced tomatoes1-2 chipotle pepper in adobo sauce (or ½ - 1 tsp ground chipotle powder)4-5 green onions, finely chopped1 bunch coriander, finely chopped100g baby spinach1 can (275g) black beans, drained250g frozen corn kernels (use fresh if you have), thawed10 x 15cm corn tortillas500g grated cheddar cheesesea salt and black pepperPreheat oven to 200C. You will need an ovenproof baking dish, approximately 25cm x 30cm, although a dish a bit larger will work too.In a large frypan on high heat, add a drizzle of oil, along with the onion and garlic. Cook for 5 minutes until the onions have softened and are starting to caramelise.Add the tomatoes along with 1 cup of water (you could also use vegetable stock) and the chipotle pepper in adobo sauce. I use just one pepper as I don’t want it too spicy for my kids, however feel free to use more if you like it hot.Reduce heat to low, season with sea salt and black pepper and allow to simmer for 8-10 minutes. When ready, turn off the heat, and blend until smooth.Take your ovenproof dish and drizzle with a bit of olive oil, along with 3-4 dollops of the tomato sauce. Spread the sauce with the back of a spoon, and then begin layering.First, lay out 3 tortillas, breaking them up (if you need to) so they don’t overlap too much. Add the black beans, green onions, 3-4 spoons of the tomato sauce, and 2-3 handfuls of grated cheese. Season with a little sea salt and black pepper.Now we will begin the next layer – lay out 3 tortillas, then top with spinach, 3-4 spoons of the tomato sauce, a scattering of cheese, coriander, corn and season with sea salt and black pepper.And now the final layer – lay out the final 4 tortillas, top with the remaining tomato sauce, spreading it out with the back of a spoon. Top with remaining cheese. Bake in oven for 20-25 minutes, until the cheese is melted and golden.Allow to rest for 15 minutes, before cutting and serving."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e023c90b1f1dbfa1d6642fe1f14fa4f9e096ae0/0_48_2815_1689/master/2815.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4fdbe4919335b54ab75438a54a80ae39","title":"egypt zimbabwe match report","story":"• Egypt 1-0 Zimbabwe• Mohamed Salah makes return to action in Africa Cup of NationsTrezeguet scored the only goal as hosts Egypt opened their Africa Cup of Nations campaign with a 1-0 victory over Zimbabwe in Cairo with Mohamed Salah returning to action almost three weeks after his success the Champions League final.The winger curled home four minutes before the interval to reward the Pharaohs for a dominant first-half display.Zimbabwe did threaten late on after Egypt failed to capitalise on further chances but the home side held on.There had been reports Zimbabwe’s players could boycott the Group A encounter amid a pay dispute but that did not materialise.Yet Zimbabwe soon looked like the outsiders they had been billed as Salah, Marwan Mohsen and Abdallah El-Said all forced good saves from Edmore Sibanda early on.Liverpool forward Salah also fired over and wriggled through a series of challenges before shooting at Sibanda again.Knowledge Musona had a shot blocked on a rare Zimbabwe attack before Trezeguet struck by cutting in from the left and bending a fine effort around Sibanda.Egypt maintained the pressure after the break but Trezeguet and Salah both missed the target.

A suitable image for a tournament floored by late collapses, first France and now Romania, and Aidy Boothroyd may not be spared from its domino effect. England, all talk and little substance, are heading home.England’s head coach insisted he would not quit after a must-win game against Romania resulted in a sound beating. “I’m not going anywhere,” said Boothroyd, who was given a new two-year contract by the Football Association on the eve of the tournament. “They will have to carry me out.” That said, serious questions will have to be asked of the head coach given his selections and substitutions contributed significantly to this failure.Two consecutive defeats have been littered with inidual errors beyond Boothroyd’s control – goalkeeper Dean Henderson the latest culprit when he allowed Florinel Coman’s 88th minute daisy-cutter to squirm through his grasp – but responsibility for this weak performance and early exit rests with the head coach. His decision not to start Phil Foden against Romania backfired spectacularly.England equalised twice in quick succession as they served up another frenzied climax to a Group C fixture but Henderson’s error, followed by another spectacular strike in stoppage time by Coman, ensured Demarai Gray’s and Tammy Abraham’s goals were in vain. Gray had claimed England remained the best squad in the tournament following their defeat by France. Henderson repeated the nonsense after shipping four goals to an average Romania side. The fact is they play Croatia on Monday to decide who is the third best team in the group.“Are we better than Romania? Yes. Are we better than France? Yes,” the Manchester United keeper said in Cesena. “Looking at the squad and players, I still believe we are the best team in the tournament. With the group of players we have really under-achieved. We wanted to come here and win this tournament. Whoever goes on to win the tournament realistically we know we can beat as well. It is a shame. We have let ourselves down. We have let the country down.”That part was true at least.Boothroyd stood by his decision to omit Foden from the starting lineup, explaining he wanted to keep the Manchester City talent fresh for the late stages and avoid the kind of hamstring injury that struck Ryan Sessegnon only 12 minutes after he had replaced Harvey Barnes. England looked threatening onlyonce Foden replaced Sessegnon – a forced substitution – and the head coach’s argument was undermined by the 19-year-old’s record of starting 14 club matches this season. The Romania coach, Matei Radoi, stuck with the same XI that beat Croatia 4-1 on Tuesday and was rewarded with an incisive, cohesive and purposeful performance. England were lacking on all counts until a second half improvement instigated by their brightest talent.Asked whether he regretted not starting Foden, Boothroyd replied: “It is a difficult one to answer. If we’d have taken our chances and gone on to a dramatic victory it would have been the right thing to do. He didn’t start for a reason, because I wanted to make sure he was fresh coming on and not running out of gas at the end. That was my decision. Do I regret it? I think it’s time for reflection from me without making any daft statements. We are disappointed and wish we could have put in a better performance.”Henderson was forced into several early saves as Romania counter-attacked with speed and penetration from the start. Ianis Hagi, son of the great Gheorghe, revelled in the space Hamza Choudhury would usually protect. England had no like-for-like replacement for the suspended defensive midfielder, Kieran Dowell took the role but had little support from Mason Mount or the erratic James Maddison, and Hagi, George Puscas and Dennis Man wreaked havoc in the first half.Romania opened the scoring as England were starting to exert control in the second half. Puscas coolly converted a penalty past Henderson following Jonjoe Kenny’s clumsy foul on the influential substitute Coman. Gray levelled with a fine curling drive only for Hagi to restore Romania’s lead when he pounced on Fikayo Tomori’s weak clearance and found the bottom corner from 20 yards. Abraham, collecting Mount’s inviting cross, gave England hope of a reprieve once more before Coman chanced his luck from distance and wheeled away in delight as the ball slipped through Henderson’s grasp and over the line. An outstanding half-volley from Coman the destroyer confirmed England’s elimination."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0b8e42342a426009ec432f5e8c0302e167dfc92/157_122_3259_1955/master/3259.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12a740abf2ebb88d82069d235cbe57e4","title":"karen carney world cup dream england cameroon","story":"The Chelsea midfielder is yet to start a game for England in France but expect that to change as the knockout stages begin for a player Phil Neville treasuresAt her second World Cup, Karen Carney is one of the most experienced players in Phil Neville’s side. She is also the most calming presence, on and off the pitch.“I didn’t pick Carney for 12 months,” Neville said before the tournament. “She was coming back from injury, other players had taken their opportunities – she’s been on standby lists for three or four squads. But then she came in for the Austria and Sweden camp in November. Then we took her to Qatar and it was in Qatar where I thought: ‘Yep, she’s coming to the World Cup.’ Her influence on and off the field, her performance levels for Chelsea, in the big games, the big moments she’s a big-moment player.”The Chelsea winger ponders the serenity that is said to accompany her. “I don’t know why I bring that calmness and I’m not really aware of it, to be honest,” she says. “I just come on, smile and enjoy the moment. If that brings calmness, then great. In training I’ll be in a different world and Phil will say to me: ‘You’re counting pigeons again.’ And I think that’s just who I am. I’m usually in my own little world. I see things differently, I feel things differently and that’s how I’ve always been and that’s why I’m different to everyone else.”The quietly spoken and well-mannered Carney, who talked in the buildup to this World Cup about her experiences with depression, prefers to steer clear of getting bogged down in the detail.“I’m not literally counting pigeons,” she says. “I think I like less detail. I try to keep things simple. Information simple. Detail simple. I just play. I just aim to play as if it was five-a-side, as if I was an 11-year-old kid. That’s how I see it because that’s how it is. That’s what I try to tell the youngsters. You’ve played in bigger venues, like Wembley chill, relax, have fun. You’re playing at a World Cup – it’s your dream. Don’t fear it, embrace it.”She gravitates to the younger debutantes, eager to tap into the buzz she felt at her first World Cup in 2015. “They remind me of myself when I was in that first tournament. I don’t say what I feel. I say what was said to me because my senior professionals were amazing to me. If I can do anything similar to the young pups I will do that. My senior pros protected me and looked after me and made me feel amazing.”The 31-year-old is of the generation that had to fight to play. Now she is watching the younger players reap the rewards of her sacrifice, but she is not jealous. “I never had any expectations,” she said. “When I was 11, I just wanted to play for England. I didn’t know when it would happen, how it would happen. I picked that dream and I wanted that dream. I didn’t know how to process it.“Since then, I’ve travelled the world. I went to university – I never would have gone to university through football. I’ve got a degree. I’ve got a master’s. I’ve met some amazing people, I’ve lived my dream. I’ve picked up so many skill sets that I never would have. I haven’t made a lot of money but I’m comfortable. I have food, clothes on my back and my family. For me, I’ll never be bitter.”At this World Cup, and in Emma Hayes’s Chelsea team, she looks happy. Carney came off the bench in all three group matches, albeit briefly against Argentina, and her performances mean she is staking a claim for a start in England’s last-16 tie against an unpredictable but exciting Cameroon on Sunday. She provided the assist for Ellen White’s second goal against Japan, which lifted the pressure.“I’m in a good spot – touch wood – and I credit a lot to my managers, Phil and Emma Hayes. They’ve been amazing. And obviously my family have helped but I credit my two managers for making me enjoy my football and giving me the responsibility. I am very comfortable in my own skin – it’s taken a long process and I’m there finally.”Carney likes Neville (in a video for the 90min website her teammates label her the teacher’s pet). Perhaps the reason the pair get on is that they view football in context. “Phil’s just a human being. He looks after us as humans and wants to make sure that we’re all OK and football’s secondary … Well, it is secondary.“He’s big on being a good person, staying humble, staying classy and looking after each other and you can only demand that from other people if that’s what you are yourself. He is a person first.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7619859ebc9590f9ab8324080c7fac75f47628c/0_0_2419_1451/master/2419.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87d15c2c80e22b3becabd1d4ebdd54f9","title":"women world cup 2019 power rankings usa england","story":"The question after USA’s 13-0 win against Thailand – in which Alex Morgan scored five – and 3-0 victory over Chile was whether they could do it against tougher opponents. A cruising 2-0 defeat of Sweden in their final Group F game, albeit both already having qualified, went part of the way to answering that. Of course sterner tests are to come but the swaggering, confident performances shown so far have all the hallmarks of champions.Corinne Diacre’s home side came out of the blocks with intent against South Korea. Since then the journey has been harder fought and has benefited from some much discussed – though correct – VAR decisions. The Lyon spine has been vital to their perfect start. When Diacre has shuffled the pack, though, the team’s flow has looked disrupted, prompting questions about whether the squad is deep enough.The first England team to finish a World Cup group stage with top marks since 1982 has shown flashes of genius. But consistency across 90 minutes has been a problem. Phil Neville’s heavy rotation policy has been successful thus far but, with tougher tests on the horizon, there is a feeling he needs to settle a little more on a first-choice XI. Will he be bold and hand some of the impressive fringe stars a more central role?The Dutch will concede and at the back they look disorganised. But further forward they have the most potent attack in the World Cup in their new all-time top-scorer Vivianne Miedema, Lieke Martens, Shanice van de Sanden and Danielle van de Donk. Two against Canada – who had conceded only once in 2019 – to top the group showed they are a serious force.In a group alongside Australia and Brazil few would have penned Italy as table toppers. Exploiting the weakness of the Australian defence to come from behind to win showed a much stronger side than expected. Eight of the Italian squad play for two-year-old and two-time title winners Juventus, including Cristiana Girelli and Barbara Bonansea, who have five goals between them. Dark horses.With the influential Lyon playmaker Dzsenifer Marozsán suffering a broken toe in their narrow 1-0 win against China it was easy to write off any chance of a serious title challenge. Yet the Group B winners have nine points, three clean sheets and five different goal scorers. They are no one-woman team. With the best run without a defeat of any team in the competition – 15 games – Martina Voss-Tecklenburg’s side have quietly flown under the radar.Possibly the most lopsided team in the tournament, the chaotic Australia defence is balanced by the goal machine, Sam Kerr, up top. Kerr already has five goals to draw her level with Morgan. How far Ante Milicic’s side can survive on a ‘you score two, we’ll score three’ mentality is anyone’s guess but, with Kerr firing on all cylinders, anything is possible.As mentioned, the Canadians had conceded only once in 2019 before they shipped two to the Netherlands to finish second in Group E. The talismanic forward Christine Sinclair is off the mark and on to 182 career goals – closing in on Abby Wambach’s record of 184 – but questions remain about the side’s fluidity going forward.In the shadow of USA Sweden quietly went about their own 2-0 and 5-1 defeats of Chile and Thailand. The Linköping striker, Kosovare Asllani, has two goals and, despite their loss to the Americans, they will cause other teams problems. Up first is Canada and the Netherlands have already shown their well-organised defence can be breached.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsA staggeringly bad run of nine defeats in the run-in to France was lifted with a Christiane hat-trick against Jamaica. Buoyed by that win the Brazilians took a two-goal lead against Australia before a second-half capitulation. That sums up the team. Bright in attack but will leak goals against the best, or better than average.The injury to Caroline Graham Hansen will hurt the Norwegians but, if she regains fitness, they will test any team. France struggled to deal with Hansen as well as the Chelsea recruit, Guro Reiten.Handing an array of the country’s best young talent their World Cup debuts is a bold move and perhaps done with one eye on the future. The 2015 finalists have underwhelmed in France. The team’s technical, quick and possession-heavy football has been sorely let down by the final ball up front. They have scored only twice, both against Scotland. Luckily they face the Netherlands’ messy defence in the last-16. They have a chance to progress, but it’s a slim one.China are struggling to score. Li Ying has their only goal, in a 1-0 win against South Africa. They resiliently kept Germany at bay until Giulia Gwinn broke the dam but a decent work rate and defence cannot make up for the lack of firepower up top. With opponents Italy a fresh force internationally, pushing past the last 16 will be tough.An unknown quantity and they now play an England team that has not played African opposition since the 1995 World Cup, where they faced Nigeria. Their chaotic defence is matched by an equally chaotic, yet exhilarating, attack. Now Nchout Njoya Ajara is scoring, her two against New Zealand enough to send Cameroon through, and linking wonderfully with Gabrielle Onguene, the England defence should be worried.The Super Falcons’ 2-0 victory over a disappointing South Korea was enough to ensure a place in the last 16. Dealt a crushing blow when faced a retaken Wendie Renard penalty for France, which had hit the post, after the goalkeeper was adjudged to be off her line. Qualification feels like reward for a strong performance against the hosts, a game they lost only 1-0.If points were awarded for artistic merit, they would be much higher up this list. They dominate teams but just do not convert or create enough chances. Atlético Madrid’s Jennifer Hermoso benefited from two penalties against South Africa but Lucia Garcia has their only goal from open play, also in their group opener.

The baby was due in July, and my other children had all been two weeks late, so I was adamant that it would be fine.I’ve always loved the music and the atmosphere at Glastonbury I used to be a bit of a hippy and liked to party. I’d been a few times before I had my first child in 2000. Tragically, Megan died at nine days old from sudden infant death syndrome (Sids). While I was grieving, I met Tracy Harrison, who worked for Glastonbury and invited me to be part of her team, setting up the site and doing jobs such as cleaning the toilets, in return for a free ticket. After that, I went every year the festival became my escape from reality, my happy place.I arrived five days before the festival started. My job was to sit in the office, helping out – nothing strenuous. Glastonbury is infamous for being muddy, but that year was warm and dry. I was huge and struggling to walk, but I had a bed in a caravan and access to a small motorised buggy. By the weekend, the festival was packed. The Rolling Stones were headlining on the Saturday, and a few of us watched from a viewing point, sitting on a trailer. I could feel the baby happily kicking along to the music.Later, after midnight, we walked back to the camp to sit around the fire. It was then that I started to feel twinges. Before long, I was experiencing full-blown contractions. I was in shock. My then partner, Sean, had gone to listen to some music with friends. We had to ring him and say, “You need to come back now.”A friend called the on-site ambulance. Of course, it was almost impossible for them to find us in the middle of a field. When it turned up, it was much smaller than a normal ambulance – I practically had to crawl inside. The paramedics gave me gas and air and told me that the baby wasn’t going to arrive. I said: “I’m telling you now, this is my fourth baby – she is coming!” They drove me to the on-site Ivy Mead medical centre, which meant going through dozens of gates. Security stopped us at each one. I’d say, “Let me through, I’m having a baby!”It took 40 minutes to reach the hospital tent. The contractions were getting stronger. It was about 2am and there was someone in the tent next to us who had done a little too much of something, and was screaming that he was going to die. I was freaking out. My friend Tracy came running in dressed as a panda – it was Glastonbury. But she was calm and said, “Shall we get this baby out then, darlin’?”They managed to find a paediatrician, who didn’t look very impressed. Luckily, the birth was quick and not too painful, except that I was on a little trolley about half the size of a bed and they ran out of gas and air. I suppose they don’t plan for anybody giving birth – as far as I know, I’m the only person to have had a baby on site.Our baby was born at 3.10am on 30 June, weighing 6lb 6oz. She was perfect. Sean and Tracy cut the umbilical cord. Tracy was crying her eyes out, covered in blood, still dressed as a panda.Soon a real ambulance came to take us to an off-site birth centre, and check that the baby was OK. As we left, the security staff and other patients were clapping. At the hospital, our baby was weighed and cleaned, then we had a bath. I didn’t fancy the four-hour drive home to Leicester in the morning, so we went back to the festival with the baby.My friends had scrubbed the caravan clean, put fresh bedsheets on, and hung a sign on the door that read: “Mama and baby are fine, please leave alone to rest.” We called the baby Emelia, but everybody in the festival family calls her Arcadia. She didn’t sleep for years and we joke that it’s because she spent her first hours listening to the rave duo RatPack. It’s even on her birth certificate: born at Worthy Farm in Glastonbury.I wouldn’t recommend giving birth at a festival. It was surreal. But the worst part wasn’t the labour and birth – it was having to use the long-drop toilet afterwards.• As told to Sophie HaydockDo you have an experience to share?

If you want to see why so many people voted (and would still vote) for Brexit, these are the perfect places to start. These conjoined twins have been in a death spiral for decades. The story is depressingly familiar: the sudden removal of a place’s main reason for being, various feeble attempts at sticking-plaster “regeneration” and decades of underinvestment. Today, Grimsby and Cleethorpes need big thinking. There are a few, much-feted, green shoots: the wind-farm industry, for instance (Grimsby has more of its energy demands met by renewables than anywhere else in the country) or the turning of Grimsby’s evocative, 19th-century dockside Kasbah district into a conservation area. Whether these green shoots will grow, though, is a moot point. The area faces formidable challenges. On the plus side, the towns can be truly beautiful, with handsome 19th-century homes, delightful parks and silky sand on the beach.

As it swings, she snarls, winks and breaks into Get the Party Started, her tongue-in-cheek romp from 2001. To the delight of Cardiff’s roaring crowd – though perhaps not her insurance underwriter – the 39-year-old pop veteran scales every angle of the bejewelled contraption with the acrobatic execution of a Cirque de Soleil runaway, held aloft by just a light harness. Not your average start to a party, then.But Pink is not your average pop star. Born Alecia Moore, the multimillion-album-selling artist and trained gymnast has spent two decades infiltrating the mainstream with her brand of delightfully brash pop-rock anthems (her 2017 album Beautiful Trauma was the third-biggest seller in the world that year). From the self-empowerment anthem Fuckin’ Perfect – played tonight sans expletives – to the club banger Raise Your Glass, her confessional songwriting has marked her out as an ambassador for misfits. She knows, too: “We’re all Pink on the inside,” chimes a mid-set transition clip.Pink condenses a tour’s worth of energy, showmanship and stage production into one show, flexing her athleticism while singing live, on-key and with sublime verve.

With this arsenal of palatable, crowd-pleasing hits, there was presumedly no need for a cover, but her powerful rendition of Bishop Briggs’ gothic, reverb-drenched River allows a rare unshowy routine that, for once, leaves the spotlight on Pink’s voice rather than on her physical capabilities.The nursery rhyme-like stomp of So What heralds a high-flying aerial finale strapped in by four bungee chords, Pink erratically slingshots her way across the stadium’s ticketed sections and e bombs towards fans.

None of these candidates come close to having any of these attributes and it makes me despair for our country ZeitgitThe whole thing was dismal. What seems striking is that anyone should continue to bother to ask these people exactly how they’ll get Brexit done, when it’s painfully obvious that their plans range from non-existent to laughable fantasy to just-about-possible-if-a-miracle happens.The merits of leaving or remaining in the EU are now beside the point. Brexit has become a vacuous non policy, which depends for its continued existence on not being specified to any credible level of detail. Once you start to pin down exactly how it would be done, support evaporates from one side or the other.Herein lies its real purpose: to create an endless and insoluble riddle, causing sufficient ongoing distraction and chaos to enable the disaster capitalists to ply their trade. There is no actual Brexit that true Brexiteers would support, because then it would become a boring and difficult reality the fantasy is so much more appealing and useful to them. This is why Farage’s party had no manifesto. Michael GallagherEvery single one of them ignored the repeated question regarding the correlation between poverty and their ideological cuts. Johnson well and truly in script mode, maybe his handlers should have instructed basic listening and response skills. Stewart was squeezed out time and time again by Emily and the other candidates. The only solace I can take from all of this, given the majority view of PM candidates on Brexit, is that we will be facing a general election very, very soon. Jazzfunk23My concern is that Johnson is not running for PM, but for ‘having been PM’ and the lucrative reward that this will afford him for the rest of his life. At least Stewart looks like he means it and that he wants to affect change of some sort. Gove, too, is committed I think and has a track record of actually achieving things... disastrous in education, but actually quite good in environment. I only hope the privileged few who get to choose our leader think about this, though I doubt many will be reading here! ExeprattlerIt’s satisfying and fun to rip in to this collection of deluded misfits. None of them deserves the top job, and most sensible people can see how flawed and uninspiring they are. But, the fact is that no matter how much we mock Boris Johnson’s mannerisms, or his hair, or his fecklessness, the UK is on a collision course with an economic crisis. Isn’t it about time we put aside the sniping partisan politics of our echo chambers and worked towards a solution? The first part of any way out of this mess must be the rejection of no deal as an option. The next stage would be a public consultation on what out negotiated leave options are and how they stack up against not leaving at all. It’ll never happen of course, but my point is that until the current tension is diffused nothing objective can be achieved. FreeThinker73Out of this bunch Gove is by far the best candidate. That’s not to say that I like him, or his politics but considering this is a Tory leadership contest and I’ve voted Labour in every election of the last 30 years, I’m not going to like any of them. Gove is the most serious, the most informed and the most likely to be able to elicit some movement from the EU. The fact that he comes across as that annoying little pip from school doesn’t change that. Nor does what happened within education whilst he was there the policies may have been poor but ultimately he delivered them, which was his job. I can’t stress enough that I don’t even want a Tory government, let alone one with any of these people running it. If we have to have one though and if it has to be run by one of these, it’s Gove. AndyOldhamOn the plus side, the Tory party will almost certainly be crucified on the Brexit cross. Whoever takes leadership has a year, maybe two before they befall the same pitfalls as their predecessors. Reality is simply something none of them are able to face (bar Stewart). There is no logic, or ration, or reason, to what they are doing. Still they believe they can abolish legal issues with force of will. Frankly both main parties may well be sacrificed in the altar: If the Tories fail to deliver Brexit, they are doomed. When they deliver it, they have nothing left to offer other than tax cuts.

He said the candidates needed to have their character tested as part of the job.On Friday, the Sky News anchor Kay Burley said Johnson had turned down the chance to take part in a TV debate next Tuesday in front of a Tory-supporting audience.Hunt wrote to his leadership rival on Friday afternoon saying he believed they should take part in at least two debates in the next fortnight, before members receive their postal ballots.Johnson has so far committed only to a debate on ITV on 9 July, by which time Tory party members will have received their ballots.  understands that Johnson’s camp agreed with ITV that this would be the first head-to-head debate, requiring Sky to move its debate back.The foreign secretary said it was essential that candidates were tested before they took on the job of prime minister, suggesting untested candidates such as Theresa May and Gordon Brown had not been successful prime ministers and the “stakes are too high” for that to happen again.“The purpose of this stage is to test us – our plans, our policies, our character,” Hunt wrote to Johnson. “We do this country and our democracy a deep disservice if we hide away until members have submitted their postal ballots. So my challenge to you is this: let’s have live televised debates right at the start of this contest, and specifically at least two in the next two weeks before members receive their ballot papers. I will debate you anytime, anywhere on live TV.”The two rivals will face 16 hustings across the country where they will be questioned, one after another, by Conservative party members, but not by journalists or other members of the public.Hunt said he wanted to ensure that the public also had an opportunity to question them, proposing a 30-minute Q\u0026ampA with local media after each hustings. “I can spare half an hour to meet the public and I’m sure you can too,” he told Johnson. “Scrutiny can be uncomfortable. But if we can’t handle it with friends, we won’t deserve to lead against our opponents.”Hunt said he had accepted live TV debate invitations from Sky, the BBC, Channel 4, the Sun and ITV. “My message is simple: if you want the job, you have to turn up for the interviews,” he wrote.Johnson took part in a BBC Newsnight debate on Tuesday night, but declined to attend an earlier debate on Channel 4 that featured the five other candidates still in the leadership race at the time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ab309586e55bd02f5ee85455752643cf5918b5e/0_2614_3370_2021/master/3370.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28f1928947d8c7bea65c453b3c93bace","title":"share your experiences of sure start childrens centres","story":"Whether you helped set up the programme in your area or your family used a centre near you, we would like to hear your storiesThe flagship Sure Start programme has saved the NHS millions of pounds through the benefits it has brought to children including some of the most deprived areas and reducing the number of those taken to hospital, according to a study.Research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies “found that where Sure Start offered high levels of service in poor neighbourhoods in England, visits to hospital to treat injuries fell among all children of primary school age, and by a third of all 11-year-olds”.Tracy Brabin, the shadow early years minister, said: “This research shows the critical role Sure Start plays in children’s health, as well as their development.

He remains tantalisingly poised short of the semi-finals in a tournament he has won a record five times, five months after career-saving hip surgery, and just hours after his Argentinian friend, Juan Martín del Potro, cast doubt on his own future before an operation on his cracked knee-cap.Murray and Feliciano López, who beat the No 1 seeds Juan Sebastián Cabal and Robert Farah in straight sets on Thursday, went to work in fading light on Friday against the British pair, Dan Evans and Ken Skupski, in another tight thriller. They were 6-4 up and 4-5 down when a high-grade contest was called off under gloomy skies at 8.50pm, half an hour before sunset on the longest day of the year.Had the schedule started rolling just a little earlier than noon, they might have got a result in this quarter-final. The players will resume on Saturday, although squeezing it into an already concertinaed programme will be tricky.López is in the semi-finals of the singles, mid-afternoon, against the exciting young Canadian, Felix Auger-Aliassime, and the doubles semi is slotted in as the last match on Centre Court. The 37-year-old Spaniard, a champion here in 2017, could end up playing three matches in a row on the same court.Waiting for the delayed winners will be John Peers and Henri Kontinen, who earlier beat Murray’s brother, Jamie, and his new partner, Neal Skupski, Ken’s brother, 7-5, 7-6 (6).A small cloud also drifted across Murray’s world when Nicolas Mahut, the regular doubles partner of Pierre-Hugues Herbert, who will play at Wimbledon with the Scot, presented a grumpy face when asked how he felt about being dumped. “I don’t want to talk about this doubles team,” he said. “The only one who needs to know what I think is Pierre. We talked together but I won’t come into the press to say what I think about this situation.”Herbert was more forthcoming on social media. “It’s safe to say that it’s not the cleanest move,” he said. “I will play doubles when I said I wouldn’t. But it is exceptional to play with Murray at Wimbledon.”Mahut will play with Édouard Roger-Vasselin at Wimbledon and get back together with Herbert at the US Open. Murray, if he plays at Flushing Meadows in September, might even be ready to play singles.Across the landscape change is in the air. Auger-Aliassime strengthened his credentials as a major new force in the game when he played two superb sets to dislodge the top seed, Stefanos Tsitsipas, two years older than him at 20 and equally bristling with promise.The Greek world No 8, a cerebral as well as physical presence, reacted with maturity and insight to the Canadian teenager’s 7-5, 6-2 win in the quarter-finals. “He’s the most difficult opponent I’ve ever faced,” he said. “He has one of the best returns on the tour. He has a really powerful, accurate serve, which is tough to read. He’s really quick and fast. It is rare to find all of that combined. He can create a lot of opportunities from his backhand, but also, at the same time, he can be very aggressive from the forehand side. There’s not much to come up with when you play against him.”Tsitsipas predicted Auger-Aliassime could master even the class and experience of Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal - a report card the winner could have composed himself – if he was not such a level-headed young player.Auger-Aliassime, who began the year outside the top 100 and will go to Wimbledon inside the top 20, said: “It’s humbling. I appreciate that from him, because he’s beaten these players. How do I explain it? I think it’s the result of a lot of work over years and months.”On Saturday he plays López, who is more than twice his age and who played solidly but with dashes of flair to end the run of Auger-Aliassime’s compatriot, Milos Raonic, 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (5) in two hours 16 minutes. “He’s 24 years old. He brings an electricity to tennis. That’s why everyone is trying to figure a way to work through this – so he can get to a place where he can go out and feel free to compete and give the effort.

Sri Lanka win by 20 runs• Veteran paceman Malinga takes four for 43 to stun hostsAgainst all the odds Sri Lanka produced the result of the tournament with a stunning 20-run victory over England. Dimuth Karunaratne’s side, pursued by the rain for most of their stay here, had been grumpily unimpressive until now with a solitary victory over Afghanistan.But here in the Headingley sunshine they humiliated England, for whom only Ben Stokes, stranded at the crease at the end on 82, could be content with his display with the bat. Not that he will be smiling much after England had lost a match which they appeared to be controlling at the halfway stage with Sri Lanka restricted to 232 for nine.The architects of Sri Lanka’s win were the old soldiers on the brink of being discarded. Angelo Mathews hit a craggy unbeaten 85 – a gnarled old pro’s innings by his standards which looked insufficient to keep his side in the game. Then Lasith Malinga, the old white-ball trouper, conjured four vital wickets from nowhere, all of them top-order batsmen.Here was a fine example of the difference between a World Cup match and one that is part of a bilateral series. A target of 233 for a side that loves chasing? A mere bagatelle. Not with the additional tension of a tournament that matters, not against a Sri Lankan side that has been universally derided, but which, unlike the bookies, refused to accept that defeat was inevitable.The tension in the England dressing room was triggered by the early dismissal of both openers, a rare event in this tournament, especially among those near the top of the table. For the second time in the competition Jonny Bairstow was out first ball, lbw to Malinga. James Vince unveiled the statutory brace of breathtaking strokes before departing caught at slip.Now it was 26 for two and no time for frippery. England had budgeted for two more points here and this could no longer be taken for granted. But Joe Root was still there. The best teams have an ordinary Joe, a batsman prepared to be self-effacing, who does not need to have the crowd gasping at the audacity of his strokeplay, who measures risk and reward adroitly. However, on this occasion Root could not guide his team home despite posting his fifth half-century of the tournament. After Eoin Morgan had succumbed to an excellent return catch by Isuru Udana, Root flicked down the leg side and the review proved positive - for Sri LankaStokes remained resolute, a pragmatist among wayward cavaliers. Now his partners kept disappearing with wanton regularity. Moeen Ali clubbed the off-spinner Dhananjaya de Silva to square leg for six and then, to the exasperation of all non-Sri Lankans in the Leeds crowd – sought another six over Udana at long-off. Instead he found the hands of Udana.Chris Woakes and Adil Rashid both opted to cut De Silva’s off-spinners, something Tykes of old would never have tolerated – at least not before July. Both were caught behind by a jubilant Perera.Now 55 were needed with just two wickets in hand, a stern first test for Jofra Archer, the international batsman. Stokes was stranded once more as Archer holed out to long on. Now Stokes cracked 25 runs off his own bat including two mighty sixes off Udana. But Mark Wood, defending the last ball of Nuwan Pradeep’s final over, edged to the keeper and the Sri Lanka celebrations could begin. They have moved into fifth place in the table. England are stuck in third.The Sri Lankan innings was a throwback. 232 for nine was a commonplace total decades ago but a rarity now. Their openers, the only batsmen to show any form so far in the tournament, were dismissed inside three overs to contrasting outside edges, Karunaratne’s went to the keeper, Perera’s to third man.Then Avishka Fernando produced the only modern contribution of the day. The 21-year-old gave us an enchanting cameo, which lasted 39 balls and delivered 49 runs. There were some glorious strokes especially against Archer, who conceded 14 runs in his third over.Two sixes were flicked off his hip to square leg, elegant drives skimmed towards the boundary until he upper cut straight to third man. Fernando had scored 49 out of a total of 62 for three. He has yet to play a Test match. He surely will before long.The recovery was gritty rather than graceful, which is unusual when Kusal Mendis and Mathews are together. They carefully compiled 71 together in 17 overs. It took Mathews, who had mustered nine runs in his previous three innings, 33 balls to reach double figures. This was a classic example of a very fine player out of form, doggedly hanging in there. Mendis was not much more fluent as they nibbled singles against England’s spinners. Rashid took two wickets in two balls, dispatching Mendis, Kusal and Jeevan.The sole remaining obstacle for England was Mathews who eventually began to hit the odd ball with the middle of his bat. He finished with an unbeaten 85 from 115 balls, which owed everything to his vast experience and very little to the exquisite timing, usually such a shining feature of his play.Only Dhananjaya de Silva kept him company for long. But it was long enough. 232 may be scoffed at as a target in this era but the tenacity of the Sri Lankans coupled with a lemming like display by the lower order of England, who profess to like chasing so much, led to the most startling result so far. With England’s last three opponents Australia, New Zealand and India perhaps we cannot all go awol until the semi-finals after all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41933fe5dc59bd8afb25716c8529d70db599b63f/16_0_4649_2790/master/4649.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d1b132dfa755677ec8be5b399d2b207","title":"st helens leeds super league match report","story":"With ten games remaining this season, the fact that there are realistically two-thirds of Super League still in danger of relegation means there are no shortage of narratives for those looking to find one. Yet as the weeks go on, and the trap-door to the Championship looms, you have to wonder just how this season will end for Leeds Rhinos.“We’re in control of where we will finish this season,” was the defiant message post-match from their interim coach, Richard Agar, after another defeat which underlined the grave deficiencies of a side who appear to be staring into the abyss. Agar may well be right, but given how there has not yet been any sign of the Rhinos turning this dismal season around save for the odd false dawn, you would forgive any Leeds supporter for beginning to panic.The fact London Broncos - tipped by many for relegation this season - keep winning, and are now two points clear of the Rhinos at the foot of the table, only further illustrates the gravity of this situation. Here they were well-beaten before half-time, trailing 24-6 against a St Helens side who, it must be said, played nowhere near their scintillating best, underlining the gulf in quality between two sides who have 14 Super League titles between them.“It’s the first time we’ve mentioned relegation in the sheds, but we know we’re still in control,” Agar said. You cannot dispute the effort, which in itself is a step forward from where Leeds were a month or so ago – but this season is fast approaching a point in which results become imperative, not performances. Such is Leeds’ frail confidence at present, the damage had been done within four minutes. They hadn’t even touched the ball by the time they were 12-0 behind, with early tries for Kevin Naiqama and Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook.On the day of the summer solstice, this certainly had all the makings of the longest day of the year for the Rhinos - and while Brad Dwyer’s first-half try was mere consolation for the visitors, before tries from Lachlan Coote and a wonderful one-handed finish from Tommy Makinson made it 24-6 at the break. Even then, so early in proceedings, there was no way back. On any other night, a 17th victory in 19 league games for St Helens would claim the headlines, but against such an ordinary Leeds side here, this was as routine as it gets.“We didn’t really play at our best,” said their coach, Justin Holbrook: underlining the lofty standards surrounding the Saints at present. They did ease off somewhat after half-time before late tries from McCarthy-Scarsbrook and James Bentley put the gloss on the victory: and while Luke Briscoe’s 45th-minute try epitomised Leeds’ efforts, it by no means threatened a comeback for a team who were well-beaten yet again. The impossible is fast becoming a nerve-wracking reality.The race for the play-offs is just as enthralling as the battle at the bottom, and Salford Red Devils moved into the top five courtesy of victory of Castleford, who they moved above in the process. Jackson Hastings was among their scorers as Ian Watson’s side made it back-to-back victories.The reigning champions Wigan are now level on points with the play-offs after comprehensively beating Huddersfield 38-22, who remain just two points clear of bottom-placed Hull Kingston Rovers after their latest defeat. The night’s other game saw Warrington strengthen their grip on second spot with a 30-6 victory against Wakefield Trinity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a823df300818c2d1cd576727821057904ce9dc34/173_192_1195_717/master/1195.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=875a891846faf421911609d3716023a7","title":"cork midsummer festival review ray scannell theatre for one","story":"Various venues, CorkMini plays performed for solo festivalgoers are a hit – plus there’s a bluffer’s guide to the suburbs and a Tom Waits-esque concept album come to lifeThe multi-disciplinary Cork Midsummer festival commandeers site-specific spaces all around the city, but the tiny booth in Theatre for One (★★★★★) still stands out. Created by Octopus Theatricals and Landmark Productions for one-to-one encounters with a solo actor, it was surrounded by festivalgoers queuing for the intense five-minute performances that happen within, somewhere between therapy and confession.It is a sequence of six specially commissioned miniature plays, and the life experiences each audience-member brings to them are crucial. In fact, “audience” is not quite the right word. Emmet Kirwan’s play refers to “active listening”, but more than that is involved: the viewer has to allow themselves to be seen, at least as much as the actor.None of this seems contrived in the hands of writers Marina Carr, Stacey Gregg, Mark O’Rowe, Enda Walsh, Louise Lowe and Kirwan, and there are performances of riveting openness from Sean McGinley, Derbhle Crotty, Eileen Walsh, Kathy Rose O’Brien, Kate Gilmore and Frank Blake. Reflecting on our interdependence with nature, the Earth and each other on the coincidences that connect random strangers on bereavement and lies and on two women’s profound loss of identity for different reasons – postnatal depression and the trauma of domestic violence, the six pieces become an urgent antidote to watching the world through the mediation of a small screen. Cumulatively, they create an exhilarating sense of aliveness.Elsewhere in the festival, a returned emigrant, Finn, finds his native Dublin disorienting in Ray Scannell’s show The Bluffer’s Guide to Suburbia (★★★★☆). The kid who wrote post-punk tracks blasting the infernal dullness of everything in the 1990s is back sleeping in his teenage bedroom. Leopold the cat is the only one who seems pleased to see Finn, and even that is not certain.In Evening Train (★★★☆☆), love is triangular and the mood is one of Tom Waits-esque melancholy. Playwright Ursula Rani Sarma gives theatrical life to a concept album by singer-songwriter Mick Flannery, with themes of money, property and small-town feuding that could be in Ireland or just as easily, as the setting suggests, somewhere in the American midwest. While Annabelle Comyn’s production for the Everyman seems a little too comfortably timeless, familiarity doesn’t detract from the powerful ensemble performances. Two brothers, Frank (Ger Kelly) and Luther (Ian Lloyd Anderson), are in love with the same woman, Grace, who is played as a life force by Kate Stanley Brennan. That Luther is a chronic gambling addict and Grace and Frank are his codependents only partly explains the stasis they experience, and the first half of the show seems to stall. But as the script takes an unexpected turn, it proves worth the slow burn."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e00c4f0ed21ea0f58ffebffb717ab20acc2b4f43/655_420_2860_1716/master/2860.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29f686eee54ff2117a1f2f09d614440c","title":"mark rylance resigns from royal shakespeare company rsc over bp sponsorship","story":"Actor says Royal Shakespeare Company deal helps oil firm ‘obscure reality of its activities’One of the UK’s most respected actors is to resign from the Royal Shakespeare Company as a backlash against big oil’s financing of the arts gathers momentum.Mark Rylance, who has been an associate artist with the RSC for 30 years, said BP’s sponsorship deal allowed the company to “obscure the destructive reality of its activities”, which he said threatened the future of the planet.“I do not wish to be associated with BP any more than I would with an arms dealer, a tobacco salesman or anyone who wilfully destroys the lives of others alive and unborn. Nor, I believe, would William Shakespeare,” he said.The move will be a blow to the RSC, which said it was saddened by Rylance’s announcement. It follows a series of high-profile protests by artists and campaigners against BP and other global oil corporations at UK cultural institutions ranging from the National Portrait Gallery to the Royal Opera House and the British Museum.Jess Worth, of the campaign group Culture Unstained, said: “Opposition to BP sponsorship is now so squarely in the limelight that it’s upstaging the art … There is no justification for promoting one of the world’s most destructive fossil fuel companies in the midst of a climate crisis.”In February hundreds of people occupied the British Museum in objection to its relationship with BP. This month a judge and several leading artists wrote to the director of the National Portrait Gallery on the eve of its annual awards calling on it to end its links to the company. A subsequent demonstration disrupted the awards ceremony.There have been other protests at different galleries in recent weeks, and on Thursday hundreds of people from Extinction Rebellion occupied the Natural History Museum to object to its hosting of a Petroleum Group dinner.Worth said: “As actors, musicians, artists and culture lovers unite in a chorus of disapproval, the RSC, National Portrait Gallery, Royal Opera House and British Museum must act fast to end their sponsorship deals or the damage to their reputations will keep escalating.”BP, one of the world’s biggest fossil fuel companies, sponsors subsidised £5 tickets for young people at the RSC.Writing in the  as hundreds of thousands of young people took part in the latest school climate strikes on Friday, Rylance said its involvement was no longer acceptable.The sponsorship “means the RSC will continue pushing BP’s brand on to young people who have – in huge numbers through the ongoing school strikes – told adults they need to step up their response to the climate crisis now,” he wrote. “Surely the RSC wants to be on the side of the world-changing kids, not the world-killing companies?”Last year the world’s leading scientists said there were only a dozen years to avoid the worst consequences of global heating, which is expected to bring drought, floods, extreme heat, food shortages and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. David Attenborough said this year that the environment emergency threatened the future of human civilisation.Rylance said he had been delighted to be associated with the RSC as a young actor, but his long-term objection to BP’s involvement had not led to any meaningful change.“The RSC could turn this situation on its head and give young people much more value than a cheap £5 ticket. They could give them the support of Shakespeare in their stand against our addiction to energy dealers who would willingly destroy us for a quick quid.”The RSC’s artistic director, Gregory Doran, and executive director, Catherine Mallyon, said they were saddened by Rylance’s decision. “We recognise the importance of a robust and engaged debate in taking these decisions, especially in the light of the acknowledged environment and climate emergency,” they said. “It’s one of the many ways that help us to establish lifetime enthusiasts for Shakespeare and live theatre and applies to all of our productions whether in Stratford, London or on tour around the UK.”BP declined to comment on Rylance’s decision, but said it was proud of its sponsorship which provided about 10,000 cheap tickets for young people each year.“We’ve been supporting the arts in the UK for 50 years and over that time around 50 million people have enjoyed BP-supported activities and programmes,” it said. “On climate our position is very clear. We recognise the world is on an unsustainable path, more needs to be done to fix that and the world needs to move to net zero carbon emissions in the decades to come.“In addressing the climate challenge facing all of us, it is critical that everyone plays their part: iniduals, governments and companies such as BP. The answer will come through coming together, building understanding and collaborating to find real solutions rather than through further polarisation and exacerbating isions.”The company said it was committed to being “part of the solution and are working every day to advance the transition to a low-carbon future. We want a fast-paced transition to a lower-carbon energy system, which will require a huge re-engineering of the world’s energy system. With our knowhow, relationships and capabilities, we believe companies like BP need to be part of the solution.”Rylance said it was time for others in the arts world to examine their positions. “I am resigning to lend strength to the voices within the RSC who want to be progressive, and to encourage my fellow associates to express themselves too. The children know the truth … In the face of addiction, tough love is the only path. It’s time for an artistic intervention.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b9d1e070160b7b7d1c11eafbd699174dda12960/0_307_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0af9e3eaf543fcf15830435388871667","title":"5g finally launches in the uk but is it really worth it","story":"We spent two weeks with a 5G phone to find out if it really lives up to the hypeThe future of mobile phones is finally here. You can go out and buy a 5G phone, and if you happen to be in one of the six cities across the UK in which EE’s 5G network is up and running, you can get the blistering mobile broadband speeds we’ve been promised will revolutionise our mobile lives, again. But should you?I’ve spent the past two weeks equipped with the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G on first-out-of-the-gate EE’s 5G network. I streamed 2K HDR movies, downloaded whole albums in seconds and generally used it like I would on my extremely fast 350Mbps home wifi – data caps be damned.So what is 5G like, and is it worth buying into? The answer to both those questions is … complicated.Is 5G faster than 4G? Absolutely. Day to day in the most congested parts of London, it was at least double the speed of EE’s 4G, sometimes up to 10 times faster.That meant speeds varied wildly as I trundled through patches of 5G on the train. At Elephant and Castle in the morning rush hour I got full 5G signal, but only speeds of about 3Mbps – still double the 1.5Mbps 4G could produce at the same time.A few hundred metres down the tracks stuck outside Blackfriars, speeds in excess of 120Mbps were routine, with 4G capping out at less than 30Mbps. A similar experience was had outside Victoria and several other central London stations.On foot in 5G areas such as St Paul’s or Covent Garden, it was clear that speeds were much more transformative. On-the-street speeds of 200-300Mbps were the norm in the lunchtime rush, with peaks of 500Mbps or more at less congested times, which is genuinely faster than my home broadband.5G is the next generation mobile phone network and it promises much higher connection speeds, lower latency (response times) and to be more reliable than the creaking\u0026nbsp4G\u0026nbspnetworks we have now.It will be much faster, with download speeds 5-10 times quicker than 4G to start with, meaning a movie will download in seconds rather than minutes. Over the next few years it should become even faster, as the technology matures. It will also have lower latency, the time it takes for something to happen: tap a link and the download will start faster.But perhaps the most important thing\u0026nbsp5G\u0026nbspwill immediately do for users is increase the carrying capacity of the masts, meaning more people can connect at the same time.The speed can be blistering, with full movies downloading from Netflix in seconds. But what is noticeable is how that speed is delivered. It’s rapid: click the button and something happens instantaneously.It’s a bit like driving a high performance car. More or less any car can hit 60mph, but a Tesla Model S can do so in 2.4 seconds. You’re not driving any faster, but it is so much more instantaneous it feels faster. 5G inherently feels faster because everything happens so much quicker, even if the data actually downloads at the same speed.The other advantage of 5G right now is that you remove the effects of congestion. We’ve all been there: sitting on that packed commuter train or bus with full 4G signal but nothing happening when you tap that link apart from your phone getting hot.Even at this early stage 5G cures that problem, meaning you can do what you want, when you want, even if that means streaming the TV show What We Do In the Shadows on the morning commute.It is very early days for 5G in the UK, but it still feels like we’re more prepared for 5G than we were for the similar transition to 4G and 3G before that.For one, we have compelling handsets that behave exactly the same as their 4G counterparts. Not some bulky, crippled phone that suffers because of the addition of 5G.The OnePlus 7 Pro 5G, for instance, has the same thickness, weight and even battery life as the excellent 4G version. The only difference, as far as the consumer is concerned, is that it can connect to a 5G network when there’s one active and it only supports a single sim.EE too appears more prepared with wider 5G coverage than you might expect. I was surprised to find it in Denmark Hill in London’s zone two, for instance, and every day there appeared to be additional patches where the little 5G symbol began to appear in the suburbs of London. It’s not exactly blanket coverage in the six cities in which it is active and it’s mostly available outdoors, but it’s a good start.Of course, you still have internet when you’re not on 5G, as you simply swap between 4G and 5G. And sometimes that means it can be hard to tell if you’re on the faster network as the 5G symbol disappears when you start to download a track or watch a video.These are the pains of an early adopter. Which is exactly what you are if you buy into 5G right now. But apart from the added expense – which is about £5 a month on EE – you’re not getting a worse phone experience. The traditional first-generation pains of poor battery life and excessive heat have been at least partially mitigated.In the near future buying a 5G-capable phone will be recommended, simply because we’re keeping our handsets for longer. You may not see the immediate benefits of 5G today, but you will in your second, third or fourth year with your phone. Future-proofing is always a guessing game, but a 4G phone in 2022 might look like a new Nokia 3310 now. Delightfully retro. Decidedly quaint.So should you get 5G now? If you’re in the process of upgrading, have the money to burn, live in an area with at least limited 5G coverage and were already looking at high-end phones such as the OnePlus 7 Pro, there’s no real downside.There are a few things of which to be aware. First, if you want a small phone you’re out of luck, as all 5G phones have massive screens right now. Secondly, you will likely need more data allowance than you think you do. When it flows this quickly you end up using more of it. Thirdly, uploads of things such as photos and videos still use the 4G network, as do calls and other non-download related activities.And lastly, by next year the second generation of 5G phones will launch, potentially offering better performance, longer battery life and smaller sizes.EE is the only game in town right now, but Vodafone will launch its 5G offerings on 3 July with Three launching 5G mobile broadband in London in August and O2 by the end of 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99b7a415b3618a79cdcd3f60d04b876e3dfa8c0a/0_0_1165_699/master/1165.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a430f02c76077b8fcea9099f30d38b36","title":"instagram influencer staged surprise engagement weekend","story":"Marissa Fuchs posted photos of disbelief, but marketers were sent itinerary months beforeA public proposal is a risky thing to attempt. For every couple whose love for each other is perfectly in tune, there is a partner who has woefully misjudged their lover’s desire for public attention, grand romantic gestures, or simply marriage full stop.So Gabriel Grossman might have been taking a huge risk when he and his girlfriend, the Instagram influencer Marissa Casey Fuchs, embarked on not just a public proposal, but a 48-hour-long surprise holiday scavenger hunt, exhaustively documented by the couple on their respective Instagram accounts. What if she’d said no? Or decided that this precious moment was too personal to be shared with her audience of 193,000 people?But perhaps Grossman didn’t need to worry. Not just because Fuchs has been sharing nearly every detail of her life for years and shows no sign of stopping – but also because it may not have been as much of a surprise as her audience were led to believe.Before the “surprise” trip even began, marketers across New York had received a detailed itinerary of what it would contain. Spread over multiple pages, the PDF slide-deck detailed where Grossman and Fuchs would be, down to the hour, as well as what and how Fuchs would share on her Instagram account, from a “specialty shot” at the Surf Lodge at 9pm on Tuesday to a “Short Film Next Stop Post” at Gurney’s Resort at 8am the next morning.The document promised to “capture heartwarming moments and surprise and delight the soon-to-be bride at every twist turn and flight!” It ended with an offer to brands of “the opportunity to align with this momentous occasion and the beautiful cities she will be visiting along the way”.The slide deck was leaked to the Atlantic’s Taylor Lorenz, the Bob Woodward of the influencer world, who published it on Thursday. “The pdf not only is expertly designed, but also directly solicits brand partnerships and was sent to marketers under the guise of a possible sponsorship,” Lorenz wrote, dismissing initial claims from a friend of Fuchs that the document was a simple “logistical plan”.Not that such a pitch would be likely to be particularly successful, says Arron Shepherd, co-founder of influencer marketing agency Goat. “I would find it very strange. It’s not something that’s coming along regularly. People will certainly tell us, “I’m going to be here at this time” and seek sponsorship, but something so personal as that … It’ll be giving birth next.”Indeed, Shepherd worries that the pitch could end up doing more harm than good for Fuchs’ burgeoning celebrity. “The people that will suffer the most will be the influencers, not the brands. Influencers have very specific audiences, who are sensitive to betrayal.”What influencers are selling, says Tom Winbow, UK MD of Ralph Creative, is authenticity, and when that is harmed, it can damage their business. “The strength of an influencer’s influence is really defined by the relationship with their audience. We find that those influencers who remain authentic and cultivate a real relationship with their audience are the ones who can genuinely influence their audience in to taking an actual action (and not just an empty like or comment).“Social media was supposed to be all about authenticity and real moments, without the gloss of traditional media. Across all media, traditional and social, the trusted bond between author and audience is becoming more and more fractured. And stories like these only serve to damage this relationship further, meaning we should always ask ourselves, ‘What is real?’”When the mask slips too much, the results can be actively unpleasant. Last year, fashion blogger Scarlett Dixon posted an Instagram shot of herself supposedly having breakfast. The picture, a sponsored post for a brand of mouthwash, was ludicrously over the top in its twee perfection, with Dixon, who Instagrams as @scarlettlondon, sitting on a freshly made bed, surrounded by pancakes and strawberries with an apparently empty cup of tea and pink heart-shaped balloons floating above her head.As the image spread across other social networks, Dixon faced a torrent of abuse. “Each time I refresh my page, hundreds of new nasty messages pour on to my Instagram, Twitter and YouTube, some of which have contained malicious death threats,” she wrote in a follow-up Instagram post. “There are now hundreds of thousands of tweets circling the internet, shaming me.”“My feed isn’t a place of reality,” Dixon added. “I mean, who spends their time in such a beautiful city, perched on a ledge, ice-cream in hand and smile permanently affixed to her face? It’s staged, guys.”For the FuchsGrossman household, at least, the preparation didn’t seem to pay off. He told Lorenz that “most brands didn’t even respond”, with the bulk of the sponsorship coming from companies the pair already had dealings with. “I can be public for a bit for this one moment in our lives, then it will go back to normal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a791ae81beee4fb57f028341c8d4e9494b86d0db/709_683_2002_1201/master/2002.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1666fdc81d25cdc3bf15829939c4408b","title":"send us a tip on enjoying lakes in the uk and europe for a chance of winning a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Lakes can be quiet beauty spots, a hive of fun activities or great places for hiking, swimming and sailing.

The Association of Independent Festivals (AIF) launched the Take Your Tent Home – Say No To Single Use campaign earlier this year, which followed the Drastic on Plastic initiative in 2018. As with other campaigns, such as Eco Action’s Love Your Tent and its #justtakeithome message, the aim is to reduce waste and remind festivalgoers that a tent is for life, not just for a weekend.A cheaper and greener alternative to buying a tent is to borrow one. Peer-to-peer lending sites, such as Fat Llama, include listings for a variety of camping equipment – currently there are four-person tents from £2 a day. Alternatively, give a new home to a discounted display or refurbished tent from Vango’s Camping Recycled site.Down-filled products have long been rejected by ethically minded consumers. Although there are responsible down standards among some outdoor clothing and equipment brands, these vary between manufacturers, and there are still concerns about cruelty taking place. It is often difficult to tell whether down has come from a live-plucked bird or one force-fed for foie gras.Natural rubber seems like an obvious alternative to PVC or plastic-based wellington boots. Rubber wellies are more durable and when they are eventually discarded, they won’t be toxic when they decompose. However, it’s best to find out whether the material comes from sustainable sources or not before buying.This sparkly stuff may seem joyful and innocent but most of it contains microplastics that will eventually end up in waterways and oceans. Along with banning single-use plastics, such as straws, many festivals are now asking onsite stalls to only sell biodegradable glitter. In March this year, campaign group 38 Degrees launched a petition calling for the ban of conventional plastic glitter in the UK, and several retailers, including Aldi and Waitrose, have committed to scrapping it from products by 2020.There are several companies selling biodegradable glitter, in a range of colours, blends and particle sizes. These are all made using Bioglitter, created from plant cellulose, sourced mainly from sustainably-farmed eucalyptus trees. Eco Glitter Fun (from £4 for single tins of loose glitter and £22 for a set of six) and EcoStardust (from £6 a bag)also use recyclable packaging and support environmental projects through donations. The latter also sells an all-natural vegan balm (£6) to use as a base for the glitter.

Yes, that. What’s taking you so long?Perhaps you need to reply to an important-but-not-urgent work email, or pay an overdue utility bill. These tasks are straightforward enough, so why does alphabetising your books seem preferable instead?Procrastination is the pits. It leaves us feeling guilty and self-loathing. When contemplating, say, getting round to finally sorting out that life insurance quote that’s been on a Post-it note on the fridge for nine weeks, why does scrubbing the shower grouting with a toothbrush suddenly become more pressing?It cannot be that, as a species, we are inherently bone idle and appalling at managing our time, because the tasks we engage in rather than the ones we need to do often require focus and physical labour. In fact, laziness has very little to do with procrastination, which is, in simple terms, a form of self-punishment.Procrastination is not just about delaying. It is about engaging in something we know in our gut to be unhelpful – a painful level of self-awareness. We know that we’re avoiding what we need to do, which feels awful enough, but also that doing something else instead is not a great idea either. But we go ahead and do it anyway.The pattern is irrational. Yet when we start to consider how we feel, things become a little clearer. Procrastination is usually a habit rather than a one-off occurrence. It is unfair to label it as a character flaw (although it may be perceived as such by those close to us). Rather, it is an inability to manage uncomfortable feelings associated with a task.Particular jobs such as cleaning the toilet or unblocking the bath plughole are universally revolting because they involve matter we instinctively know could contaminate us. We’re wired to find them disgusting as a form of protection. However, deeper negative emotions – such as frustration, boredom, anxiety, resentment, confusion or insecurity – may be connected with other, less grimy tasks.If I am sitting in front of my computer trying to write a cover letter for a new job, I might start thinking: “I sound like a fool, they will surely think I sound terrible.” Replacing the task with something monotonous and engaging, such as vacuuming the stairs, is a way for me to cope with those difficult emotions.Research shows that procrastination can be explained as something we engage in as an urgent self-soothing technique, but the comfort is fleeting at best – once we start thinking about what we’re doing, more stress creeps in. There’s even a scientific name for this thought process: procrastinatory cognitions. In turn, this makes us procrastinate even more. We reward ourselves for procrastinating, while the negative emotions surrounding the task remain, as well as self-blame.Particular areas of our brain involved with self-perception interpret the tasks we’re procrastinating over as, essentially, not our problem – in the long-term, at least. As humans we aren’t wired to prioritise long-term needs. From an evolutionary perspective, we prioritise providing for ourselves in the present, because our ancestors never knew what was (or wasn’t) around the corner.So what can we do? Looking in the mirror and saying, “Stop procrastinating NOW” probably won’t work. Time management apps will only get you so far. Really, we need to think about the root cause of why we’re procrastinating. Identifying that it is about emotion rather than efficiency is a good start.Practically speaking, we can make our procrastination activities harder to do. If you habitually turn to social media, try deleting the apps from your phone and creating new, elaborate passwords. If you throw obstacles into the procrastination cycle, it takes longer to feel the reward and changes how your brain perceives the value of something – such as checking social media.Ultimately, loosening the grip of this existential habit comes down to self-compassion. Re-evaluate your tasks by creating a new “evidence base” for when you have done similar things well. Imagine the positive outcome. How will you feel in yourself? How will you – or others – benefit? Try writing that down. Presenting our inner dialogue to ourselves can be very powerful.Another potentially helpful technique is “defusion”. When the urge to procrastinate strikes, set an alarm for three minutes on your phone. Close your eyes. Bring your awareness to what is happening in your inner world – your thoughts about procrastinating (are they streams of words or images?) and the feelings in your body: where do you feel them? Are they familiar? Start noticing the way you’re interpreting what the thoughts and feelings around procrastination mean to you, and how that affects you in that moment. When the alarm goes, you may see your urge to escape your feelings for what it is.There is a robust evidence base to show that mindfulness exercises, if practised regularly, can improve our ability to accept and tolerate negative emotions without engaging in avoidance or actions that bring short-term relief. It might take a little time, but change is entirely possible. Your books can go unorganised for a while yet.For more information, visit avivalife"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a31faf41eea4f8089adf70911cbe483cded6426/0_0_3444_2067/master/3444.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f63401bb5f713738c6cdd4add460a00","title":"botched spanish statue st george lovingly unrestored","story":"Reverse restoration of St George in Navarre shows him in his true coloursAfter a year’s exile and hundreds of hours of painstaking work, a 16th-century polychrome statue of Saint George and the dragon from northern Spain that made the news for all the wrong reasons has been lovingly and carefully unrestored.Last summer the Church of St Michael in Estella, Navarre, became the latest holy place to fall victim to some well-intentioned but ill-advised brushwork. A local artist’s efforts to freshen up the walnut wood statue did not go entirely according to plan.The saint was left with a rosy pink face and a strikingly bold suit of armour that reminded some of Tintin and others of a Playmobil figure. It also elicited comparisons with the infamous “Monkey Christ” restoration six years earlier.Now, however, the statue has been returned as closely to its pre-2018 state as possible. Carlos Martínez Álava, the head of the Navarre government’s historic heritage department, said the latest intervention had finished two weeks ago and the plan was to get the statue to Estella in the next few days.“It’s been a long process because we had to do preliminary tests and take samples to see how we could go about cleaning it and to determine which would be the best materials and methods,” he said. “Today, the statue has the same colours it had before last year’s extremely unfortunate intervention. But we know that we’ve lost part of the original paint along the way.”Martínez Álava said that although he was a historian and not a restorer, he thought things had turned out really well. “The bits of paint that were lost have been filled in and from a distance it all looks the same,” he said. “But when you get up close, you can see very clear what’s original and what’s not.”He said the restoration process had been time-consuming, estimating that it had taken all those involved with the project about 1,000 hours to undo the damage and restore the work.“It’s been a big effort economically as well,” he said. “The archdiocese of Pamplona and the parish have assumed the costs, which have come to around €32,000 or €33,000 (about (£29,000). If they’d done things properly in the first place, it would have cost around €10,000 to €12,000. That mistake has ended up costing three times as much it should have. There was also a €6,000 fine they had to pay.”But he said he had been struck by the panic and remorse of those behind the botched job. “When it came in, what I noticed most wasn’t just how inadequate the restoration had been, but how much the people responsible were suffering and how worried they were that there was no way of fixing it.“Our cultural heritage needs to be looked after by people who are qualified and trained. We need to know our heritage as throughly as possible to protect it, and we need to be alert. The alarm in this case was raised by somebody in the town telling us what had happened.”Estella’s last mayor said the town did not relish the notoriety that the statue’s restoration had brought it and would prefer that people came to see its historic Jewish quarter instead. “We don’t want to attract visitors because of the poor treatment of our heritage,” Koldo Leoz said last year. “We haven’t publicised it and nor will we.”Others, however, have been keen to find opportunity in adversity. The town of Borja managed to capitalise on the attention it drew after a devout parishioner, Cecilia Giménez, tried to restore the face of the scourged Christ that had been painted on the wall of a local church almost a century earlier.Her well-meant but incomplete labours may have resulted in Monkey Christ memes, much mockery and global coverage, but they have undoubtedly benefited Borja. About 16,000 people a year now visit the town – more than four times the number who came before Giménez did her restoration – and the church gift shop is full of merchandise bearing the instantly recognisable results of her brushwork.The “restoration” has provided jobs for the sanctuary-museum’s two caretakers and helps fund places at Borja’s care home for older people."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89bc12f0d4b16c14a7fe50e27188721e0bc626a2/327_0_5325_3196/master/5325.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a6350d12fd6e9ca9155af6989cfe699","title":"why not scrap gdp replace with trees upside weekly","story":"This week the Upside looked at some alternatives to the quest for endless economic growthIn May we asked you: what are the alternatives to endless economic growth?

Photograph: Julien WarnandEPAEU leaders have signalled they are open to discussions with Boris Johnson about Brexit if he becomes British prime minister, but have again forcefully ruled out tampering with the Irish Border backstop.Speaking in Brussels on Friday at the end of a two-day European Council summit, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he looked forward to an “early meeting” with Mr Johnson if, as expected, he is elected leader of the Conservative Party next month. Mr Varadkar said he was open to hearing any “new ideas . . . as to how we could amend the political declaration”, the document that accompanies the Withdrawal Agreement and which sets out the direction for the future relationship between the EU and the UK.However, he said that it was a settled EU position that the agreement would not be re-opened – a point reiterated by several EU leaders, including German chancellor Angela Merkel. Dr Merkel also raised the prospect of talks with the new prime minister, telling her end-of-summit press conference: “There is willingness to work with a newly elected prime minister, to enter into talks again.”Although the message on the Withdrawal Agreement and the backstop was strong and consistent throughout the summit, EU leaders appeared to be holding the door open for the new British prime minister.SpeculateAsked if Mr Johnson could agree to a mechanism outside the agreement that could affect the operation of the backstop, Mr Varadkar said: “They’re the kind of conversations that we’re going to have to have with the new British prime minster whenever they take up office. So I’d rather not speculate here.”Pressed if he was open to the idea of dealing with the backstop outside the agreement, Mr Varadkar said: “The absolute position of the EU is that the Withdrawal Agreement – including the backstop – is not going to be reopening. The political declaration can be reopened and reconsidered.“But the most important thing for me is always when it comes to the backstop is achieving the objective and that is to have a legally binding and operable mechanism to give us the assurance that Brexit will not lead to the emergence of a hard border between North and South, whatever happens. And that’s what’s fundamentally important – achieving that objective.”When it was put to Mr Varadkar that without a withdrawal agreement there was no backstop, and therefore a hard border, Mr Varadkar said “a deal without a backstop is effectively no deal. Mr Varadkar said if there was a no-deal Brexit on October 31st, Ireland would be under an obligation to protect the single market.

Photograph: ReutersAn intensive round of last-minute meetings is underway in Brussels before today’s EU summit in an attempt to strike a broad deal which would fill all the EU’s top jobs for the next five years.Is it just about jobs? Few things enliven politicians more than the prospect of new jobs for politicians few things interest the public less. But it is the main business of this summit and it is vital for the future of the EU.Who leads the EU institutions, and how they do it, has a significant bearing on not just what the EU does, but how it is perceived by its citizens. If this summit is primarily about EU housekeeping it’s no less important for that.So despite expectations that no deal on the jobs would be possible, a flurry of meetings are taking place this morning in advance of the real horse-trading at the summit-proper later.The heads of the European Parliament’s groups are meeting this morning and are due to publish a political programme for the next parliamentary term. More significantly, a meeting of the “co-ordinators” of the three big groups – the liberals, the socialists and the Christian Democrats – is specifically addressing the question of the top jobs.The prime ministers of the liberals – now called “Renew Europe” and incorporating French president Emmanuel Macron’s MEPs – are also meeting, while the socialist group and the EPP will have their usual pre-summit meetings a little later.The President of the European Council Donald Tusk – who, as chairman of the group of heads of government convenes these summits and controls the agenda –\u0026nbsp is also engaging in a last-minute round of contacts with EU leaders. He wants a decision as soon as possible, and diplomats have speculated that if no deal is reached this evening, leaders could return for a special summit next week in order to finalise the slate of appointments before the new European Parliament meets on July 2nd. Some Brussels sources say that the process could drag on into July it all depends on the approach the leaders take this evening.How is it going to play out? The summit will demonstrate how power has shifted dramatically in the European institutions since the last summit. The EPP, which has held all the top jobs in the last term, no longer dominates either the parliament or the council. Its great champion, Angela Merkel, is in the last phase of her career and her influence is waning. How that power moves, and to whose advantage, is the great undercurrent of this summit.What jobs are to be filled? The most important is the presidency of the European Commission, replacing Jean-Claude Juncker who retires when the current commission’s term expires in October.Under a convention applied last time (but not before that) the main groups in the European Parliament propose a lead candidate – or “spitzenkandidat” – before the Parliament elections, and whoever gets the most votes is then nominated by the Council, and approved by the parliament.That process is in trouble for two reasons: firstly, the EPP candidate Manfred Weber is not viewed by many of the leaders (particularly Macron), who has made his opposition blunt) as a candidate of sufficient standing for the Commission job. It’s traditionally the preserve of former prime ministers (as Juncker was), and the prime ministers on the European Council are unsurprisingly in favour of appointing former prime ministers to these important roles.Secondly, while the EPP is the largest group, it would be a stretch to say that it “won” the European Parliament elections, and the other groups have said that they will block his ratification. In other words, as things stand, he doesn’t have the votes.But nor do the other “spitzenkandidaten” – the Dutch socialist Franz Timmermans and the Danish liberal Margrethe Vestager. So various names have been touted as compromises, including the Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, who is meeting the Taoiseach this morning.What are the other jobs? Whoever is selected for the Commission job, it will be part of a package that also sees the next head of the Council (Tusk’s job), the next ECB President – hugely important, though less political – to succeed Mario Draghi, the next President of the European Parliament (high profile in Brussels, but not that important) and the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs (a second-tier job).It is all about jobs then? Ah no. The leaders will also discuss climate change, the EU’s strategic agenda for the next five years, international affairs and the next EU budget. Tomorrow there will be a discussion on Brexit, ever the Irish priority. EU leaders will be delighted not to have a summit dominated by the question of the UK’s exit, for once.

Another 2,500 troops including soldiers from the Royal Gurkha Rifles arrived by Chinook helicopter as well as overland, some having driven straight from the D-Day ‘75 commemorations.Lieutenant Colonel Mark Swann, Commanding Officer of 3rd Battalion The Parachute Regiment, said his unit: “specialises in the rapid insertion of highly trained soldiers into hostile environments, and has the ability to sustain itself for long periods of time behind enemy lines.“The exercise is a significant logistical undertaking and a fantastic opportunity to test our capability.”Paratroopers prepare to deploy from the Hercules under tactical night-light conditionsA Canadian soldier taking part in the exercise was killed on Monday, when his parachute failed to open on a drop into Cheshnegirovo airfield near Plov, Bulgaria.Bombardier Patrick Labrie, a soldier in the 2nd Regiment, Royal Canadian Horse Artillery, died as a result of his injuries. One other Canadian and two US paratroopers were injured at the same time.British reservists from 4th Battalion The Parachute Regiment carrying Javelin anti-tank missiles.Supported by aircraft from the Royal Air Force and the Army Air Corps, Zadar airport formed the initial headquarters where 14 Apache and Chinook Helicopters lined up, much to the bewilderment of tourists arriving on Ryanair flights.The exercise was also an opportunity for part-time soldiers to train. Captain Zac Leong, a property developer from Colchester and reservist with the 4th Battalion The Parachute Regiment, said: “It’s fantastic to come to Croatia and for reservist soldiers from all walks of life to deploy alongside their regular counterparts and develop new skills”.The exercise continues for the next fortnight in Udbina, 90 km north of the coastal city of Zadar, a British holidaymakers favourite.Troops will be deployed to defend the airstrip against an imaginary enemy alongside their French and Croatian counterparts. The exercise will focus on rapid assault tactics, airborne operations and fighting against a well armoured mechanised enemy.It will also enable the army to test new hi-tech equipment such as the Wildcat helicopter and a Puma Drone that can spy on enemy troops using infrared cameras at long range from the air.British soldiers in the back of a Chinook helicopter with weapons pointed towards the floor to ensure shots do not accidentally fire up into the engines.The British and French soldiers conducted both blank and live firing training in the rolling hills of the Croatian countryside.It has been a privilege to work alongside our British allies and share tactics and training,” said Colonel Renaud Senetaire, the French Deputy Commander of the 11th Parachute Brigade.“It is important that we continue to develop our strong military ties to protect the future of Europe. It’s about sharing our capability as an expeditionary force.”Nato airborne forces relax during a break in the exercise. This is the first time that the allied force has operated in Croatia. The scale of the exercise is clearly designed to put off any designs the Kremlin might have to further expand their sphere of influence in the Balkan region.The Russian President, Vladimir Putin has responded in recent weeks to what he describes as Nato aggression in Poland and the Baltic states.British officers were quick to deny any accusations of provocation in Croatia.Brigadier John Clark, who parachuted into Croatia himself with 3,000 of his men, said “The UK stands shoulder to shoulder with our international allies in both operational and training environments.“It’s important to remember that we are here at the invitation of the Croatian government.British reservists from 4th Battalion The Parachute Regiment with helmet-mounted monocle night vision sights.Croatia is a very strong strategic partner in Eastern Europe and we welcome the opportunity to develop strong bi-lateral ties as well as demonstrate the UK’s approach to joint exercises.“It sends a very clear message to our adversaries that we can project force over long ranges at very short notice. Stability in the Balkans is essential to stability in Europe.”The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Naturally, with the age-old adage of “tidy room, tidy mind” at the forefront of their smugly neat brains, plenty will make the leap that Boris’s untidiness makes him unsuitable to lead the country.His many critics might also throw in the other car-related evidence that, when he was GQ’s motoring correspondent, he accrued enough parking tickets to paper a downstairs loo and frequently misplaced the vehicle he’d been loaned.A potential PM needs to be across the small print of every situation, they argue, and Boris is just too “chaotic” to do so. But is that true  After all, Gordon Brown and Theresa May were sticklers for detail and look what happened to them.So perhaps it’s time for a “bigger picture” personality with the strength of character to lead the country through a series of inevitably dficult decisions while leaving the crossing of Ts etc to several trusted lieutenants.According to journalist Andrew Gilligan, who worked for Boris when he was Mayor of London, his former boss has the “factory setting” of one nation Toryism and the ability to “master detail whenever he wanted to” but seldom wanted to.“A leader’s job,” Gilligan adds, “is to set the general direction and tone, choose the right people and inspire them to implement it. Lots of folk can do detail.”My friends would tell you that, despite the chaotic mess of my office at home , I possess clarity of thought when it comes to work and le’s general admin.So let’s hope that,he becomes PM, Boris is the same.

He’s just done so again.People who want a second vote on Brexit should go and live in North Korea, he said. Meaning that they had no time for democracy.Gallagher — like almost every bloody pop musician — backed Remain in the ­referendum. But he said: “There’s only one f***ing thing worse than a fool who voted for Brexit. That’s the rise of the c***s trying to get the vote overturned.”His message, then, to the relentlessly moaning Remainers who have tried every trick in the book to get that democratic decision overturned is: Don’t look back in anger — get on with your lives and let Brexit happen.As we decided it must.And here’s the thing. I suspect most Remainers think exactly the same. The people I know who voted Remain were saddened by the referendum result and they wished we’d all voted dferently.But they all believe that the vote must be upheld. And there should not be a second vote.And when I talk to them, they don’t call me a Nazi or a fascist for voting Leave.They don’t suggest I’m too thick to be allowed to vote or that I hate all foreigners.They just agree to dfer on that simple issue of in or out, and there’s no bad ­feeling at all.This is the thing. The politicians and commentators insist Brexit has ­brutally ided the nation. That the wounds will take a long time to heal. That we’re all at each other’s throats. The .million versus the .million.It’s not so at all. The only real ide is between the four or five million Remain voters who simply won’t have it — and the rest of the country.A lot has been written about the people who voted Leave — most of it codswallop.“It was just the poor and the left-behind, the uneducated and the ­xenophobes.”The statistics simply don’t bear that out.People of all walks of le, all levels of education, all ages and all ­backgrounds voted Leave.This is not, however, true of that hardcore of Remainers, between a quarter and a third of that million, who demand we run the vote again.They are insulated from the normal world. When they say they don’t know anyone who voted Leave, they’re telling the truth.They work in professions where ­virtually nobody voted Leave.In our ­universities , in schools , and among luvviesand scientists .And the BBC — I don’t have figures for the BBC but I would guess it’s close to  per cent for Remain.This is the real ide. Between a ­liberal middle-class elite who simply do not understand the hopes and aspirations of the rest of us. And react with absolute fury when they don’t get their own way.When Brexit is over, one way or another, that liberal elite will still be with us, utterly out of touch with the rest of the country.That’s the ide that matters today. A small minority determined to inflict their liberal policies upon the rest of us.THE BBC shoved an imam from Gloucester on to its Tory leadership debate programme and has now had to apologise.Abdullah Patel asked questions of the candidates about anti-Muslim bigotry in their party. Turns out he’s been accused of plenty of bigotry himself.A whole bunch of social media posts from Patel attacking Israel and praising Corbyn were uncovered. There were “Zionists” hiding behind the Holocaust, a suggestion that Israel should be transported to the centre of the US and so on. The usual stuff.None of it surprised me – and he’s not alone in pushing this view. Is it any wonder anti-semitism is now so entrenched in the Labour Party, and in our country Bob lived in Zimbabwe. Bob was standing in the middle of a road at night when a car hit him.The car cartwheeled, killing both of the people in it. They were rhino-horn smugglers – scumbags who kill rhinos so the valuable horns can be sold in powder form to sad Chinese men who can’t get a stfy.Anyway, Bob’s now dead. But his le was not given in vain.Thank you, Bob.THE latest social media trend is the bubble-tea selfie. Japanese girls take photos of themselves with a carton of the sugary drink nestled between their baps.Nope, I don’t know why.The craze is spreading west, too.People have been seen doing it in Thailand and Vietnam.Will it reach here Well, it’s got to navigate its way through Pakistan, Iran and Saudi Arabia – so I wouldn’t bet on it.THE Breakthrough Listen Project was a massive scheme using millions of computers.It was dedicated to finding intelligent extra-terrestrial le. It has found . . . nothing. Just light year after light year of utter silence.I think it’s time we accustomed ourselves to the fact there’s nothing out there and we’re all alone. The rest of the universe is cold, silent and devoid of intelligent le.

I’d just thought it was high time we had a PM whose real Christian name is Roderick.If people called Roderick ran the country we wouldn’t be in the mess we are now.Sure, Mr Stewart doesn’t use “Roderick”.He’s shortened it to “Rory” in order to sound more dashing and maybe a bit Celtic. Big mistake.Be proud of your given Christian name, Roderick Stewart. It means great ruler. Rory, I think, just means drunk Glaswegian eating a pie.THE bigger and richer charities get, the less likely they are to do the job they were set up to do. The RSPB is a case in point.It’s very rich indeed, with mugs like me paying for its upkeep each month.Incredibly, this organisation has flogged part of a crucial nature reserve near Middlesbrough – so a huge power station can be built on it. What possible right do they have to do that The RSPB says the Saltholme reserve is not one of high ecological signicance. But it was home to some of the UK’s most endangered birds. Not for much longer. At least the RSPB made a fast buck.HAVE you seen Joe Hart’s new tattoo  Christ help us all.It looks like half his torso has been draped in a torn bin liner.Joe doesn’t care what other people think of it – fair enough.But remembering his performances in goal for England, I wondera dferent sort of tattoo might have been more helpful. On one wrist the words: “Stand in the centre of the goal when facing a free kick, you idiot.” And on the other: “Have a go at catching the ball from time to time.”THE oldest woman in Europe has died at the age of .Italian Giuseppina Robucci credited her long, long le to avoiding alcohol.A week ago, however, the oldest woman in the UK died.

It will be a shiny new global currency for the st Century, taking on the dollar and the Pound.But I’m not fooled. I think we all know what Facebook is really up to.This is yet another way to harvest data about our financial habits which it can then use for targeted marketing. Critics are already calling it the “most invasive and dangerous form of surveillance ever designed”.Collecting and exploiting information about us is, after all, the whole reason for the company’s existence.Years ago it was basic stuff, like quizzes asking, “What kind of personality type are you ”Fill that in and you are practically begging to be ­targeted in marketing and ­political campaigns. But handing over our spending details is quite another matter.This may be spun as ­connecting the world and ­revolutionising payments but it is really all about tapping the modern-day version of oil — the wells of data.Facebook already knows who you are. Accept Libra and it will know what you are buying, who you’re paying and how much you have.Will it be regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority, as banks are in this country  Certainly, the company has not shown much desire for regulation so far — of which more later.But what do we know about how trustworthy, secure or morally sound this would-be money broker is The Cambridge Analytica scandal, where data from million users was shared with political consultants, led to a fine of £, by ­Britain’s Information ­Commissioner’s Office.Last September the company admitted that data from million of its users had leaked due to a security flaw.In  it failed to stop the live broadcast of the torture of a disabled man in Chicago. It has also refused to take down neo-Nazi content.Facebook is under criminal investigation by US prosecutors who are looking into data-sharing deals with, among other, Amazon and Apple. It has been caught out farming data from apps whose users might have been unaware they were feeding information to Facebook.The company was found to be harvesting the dates of female users’ periods via an app which tracked ovulation.Facebook has also been accused of doing little to protect ­vulnerable children from ­promotions of self-harm. British father Ian Russell has directly linked Facebook-owned Instagram to the suicide of his -year-old daughter, Molly.Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg refused to attend the UK ­Parliament’s committee on ­disinformation and “fake news” last year, amid concern the social media giant is ­positioning itself as a news publisher but without ­compliance with any of the regulation or laws governing traditional journalism.The  has been blamed for spreading hatred. In March this year an ­Australian white supremacist live-streamed on Facebook his massacre of  people at two New Zealand mosques.It has further been accused of putting IS terrorists in touch with each other via its “suggested friends” application.When challenged as to why it does not do more to tackle ­terrorism, it falls back on the explanation that it does not have the technology to watch what its .billion users are doing all the time.Yet somehow that does not seem to stop it farming commercially valuable data from our accounts.The same will no doubt turn out to be true about Libra. This week French finance ­minister Bruno Le Maire warned that the cryptocurrency would inevitably be used by terrorists and criminals to sht money around undetected.When it happens, Facebook will no doubt shrug its corporate shoulders once more and say it is powerless to stop it.In theory, the very complex nature of cryptocurrencies means that it should be near impossible for anyone to steal our money.But we have all heard the horror stories. The best-known cryptocurrency, ­Bitcoin, ­at first soared in value, ­making millions for people who latched on to it early. But  months ago it crashed.Of course, most of us like to shop on the internet — and e-commerce is only likely to grow in the coming years.But most of us do it with our bank cards or direct from accounts which hold our money in a ­currency which is backed by the central bank of a First World country.This means we can be ­reasonably sure the currency won’t ­suddenly disappear or become valueless. It is quite another matter doing business in a currency that is backed by internet firms.How can we be sure that Facebook will still be around in a few years’ time Of course, banks sometimes go bust, but at least we have some protection in the form of the Government’s financial services compensation scheme which will refund up to £, of savings in the event of a failure.Facebook claims Libra will be backed by an independent foundation in Switzerland and will be free from the kind of speculation that drove the value of Bitcoin, because its value will be linked to a basket of currencies.But I’m sorry, I’m just not buying it. I’m sticking with sterling when I do my online shopping.It might not be very exciting but I feel confident it will still be around well when Libra, and Facebook, have long ago ­disappeared. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They’re just trying to ride roughshod over us because they don’t care about older people.But it won’t stop me wearing my bikini.Kay, who used to model for fashion houses, says the dispute with the council began last May when she was given a Community Protection Notice , a new-style of Asbo .That was later withdrawn but the council took her to court and she had to give a general undertaking not to engage in behaviour which caused “harassment, alarm or distress”.But she denied shouting at the children and claims she only listened to talkSPORT on her radio in the back garden.She said: I don’t think any of the children were upset by my bikini. Young children don’t care what you wear.Whatwas on a beach  Would children get upset there too In April the council wrote to her sayingshe continued to breach the undertaking, which is in force until  December, they would begin committal proceedings in court.Committal proceedings involve charges of contempt of court and anyone found to be in contempt can be sent to prison for two months.Kay insists the dispute stems from the nursery’s decision to expand and build a car-park at the back of her home.She claims the nursery decided to turn the car park into an adventure playground but the owners are still waiting for retrospective planning approval.She added: They cut down lots of trees and plants and made a real mess when they did the building work.I can’t understand they are getting upset about me in my bikini after everything we put up with.What century are we living in for goodness sake A spokesman for the council said the case had caused a great deal of alarm and distress to the kids at the nursery.They said: We have tried to work with Ms Crane as much as possible, and whilst wearing a bikini is not a breach of the undertaking agreed in court, staring at the children, shouting at the children and watching the children playing whilst wearing a bikini in full view are some of the repeated behaviours that have caused concern and are classed as a breach of the undertaking.The number of notices - dubbed a “busybodies charter” - have increased by  per cent from , in   to , in  , according to Freedom of Informationrequests.They can be handed out for anti-social behaviour by council or police officers.Violating the order is punishable by on-the-spot fines of £ ortaken to court a fine of up to £,. Councils retain the fine revenue.Ten councils issued Community Protection Notices against people feeding birds, and one took action against a resident who put up cat deterrents to stop the pets fouling their house or harassing birdle.Another woman, Estelle, who had kept free range chickens for seven years on her rural smallholding in Gloucestershire without complaint, got a CPN warning ordering her to keep them in a pen, following a complaint from a neighbour.Josie Appleton, director of the Manesto Club who sent the FOIs, said: At least Asbos had to go through court and you had a right to a defence. These new orders are a scandal in comparison - you can be issued with a legal order by a town centre warden filling in a form.“These powers need to be urgently reviewed, and drastic changes made, to avoid further injustice and innocent people being penalised.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “Anti-social behaviour harms communities and can severely impact people’s way of le, which is why we have reformed the tools and powers available to tackle it.“There is a clear legal test for issuing a Community Protection Notice, and our statutory guidance highlights that agencies should have sufficient evidence to satisfy themselves that the behaviour in question is genuinely having a detrimental effect on others’ quality of le, rather than being a behaviour that others may just find annoying.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NINTCHDBPICT0004991960","title":"us missile cruiser 72 hour standby strike iran","story":"American military assets in the region, including the missile cruiser USS Leyte Gulf, have been put on alert after the Islamic Republic shot down a spy drone yesterday, a Pentagon official reportedly said.The source said that US troops were woken up at around am local time “within the hour” of the proposed strike – but then nothing happened, according to Newsweek.Among the targets which US military chiefs were targeting was the S- Neva Pechora surface-to-air missile system, the Pentagon official said.Washington believes the Soviet-era weapon was used to down the drone on Thursday although Iran claims they used the domestically-made rd Khordad transporter erector launcher to destroy the aircraft.According to reports, US President Trump signed off on military strikes to destroy targets such as radar and missile batteries during a day of feverish tensions.But he called them off with moments to spare after intense debate in the White House among the president’s top national security officials and congressional leaders, the New York Times reports.Planes were already in the air and ships were in position to launch a ferocious bombardment when the order was given to stand down last night, the paper claimed.Speaking with Reuters, an Iranian official said that Tehran received a message from Trump overnight warning them of the imminent attack.The White House and the Pentagon declined to comment officially on the reports.Earlier, Trump declared that Iran made a very big mistake by shooting down the unmanned £m US spy drone over the Strait of Hormuz.He also suggested that the downing of the aircraft was a foolish error rather than an intentional escalation of tensions - which have led to rising fears of open military conflict.Trump said at the White House: I find it hard to believe it was intentional,you want to know the truth.I think that it could have been somebody who was loose and stupid that did it.But Iran portrayed the shooting as a deliberate defence of its territory - insisting the drone was flying over their airspace.However, the Islamic Republic has been accused of using a fake photo in an attempt to prove the aircraft was over its territory.State-run IRNA news agency shared an image of a damaged drone falling to Earth to illustrate its report.But it has subsequently emerged that the same image - albeit in a wider crop - was previously used on a report of another drone being shot down over Yemen two years ago.Yet, Irans foreign ministry says it has undeniable evidence that the spy plane  was in Iranian airspace.Irans deputy foreign minister Abbas Araghji told the Swiss ambassador in Tehran that some of its wreckagehas been found in Irans territorial waters, reports Saudi outlet Al Arabiya.The incident comes amid heightened tensions between Tehran and Washington.In recent days, the US confirmed another attempt by Iran to shootdown an American drone last week as well as the successful destruction of one on June  by Iranian-aligned Houthi forces in YemenEarlier this week, the US announced plans to deploy more than , additional troops to the Middle East following suspected bomb attacks on two oil tankers.The Pentagon released photos which it claims proves Irans Revolutionary Guard were behind the attacks on the ships in the Gulf of Oman.The Federal Aviation Administration last night prohibited US-registered planes from flying in Iranian-controlled airspace in the Gulf as a direct result of the recent tensions, Market Watch reports.Congressional leaders urged caution to avoid escalation and some lawmakers insisted the White House must consult with Congress before taking any actions.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton have advocated hardline policies against Iran.The Trump administration is engaged in a maximum pressure campaign of economic sanctions with a buildup of American forces in the region.Yesterday, Iran called the sanctions economic terrorism insisting the drone had invaded its airspace - near the Kouhmobarak district in south of the country.It accused the US of a very dangerous and provocative act and said it was taking its case to the United Nations.The drone - which has a wingspan wider than a Boeing  - entered Iranian airspace despite repeated radio warnings, Irans UN Ambassador Majid Takht Ravanchi claimed.But the US insists the aircraft was  miles from the nearest Iranian territory and flying at high altitude when struck by a surface-to-air missile.Trump, who has said he wants to avoid war and negotiate with Iran over its nuclear ambitions, appeared to play down the signicance of the shootdown.He cast it as a new wrinkle ... a new fly in the ointment while also saying this country will not stand for it, that I can tell you.Air Force Lt. Gen. Joseph Guastella, commander of US Central Command air forces in the region, took a more pointed view of the incident.He said: This attack is an attempt to disrupt our ability to monitor the area following recent threats to international shipping and free flow of commerce.The US recently sent an aircraft carrier to the Persian Gulf region and deployed additional troops alongside the tens of thousands already there.It comes just a week after Iran was accused of planting and detonating mines on two oil tankers in the region."},{"url":null,"title":"foetus onboard flysafair flight johannesburg south africa","story":"Flight FA  by Fly Safair from Johannesburg to Durban was scheduled to take off King Shaka International Airport this morning at .am.But on final preparations for take-off one of the airlines cleaning staff discovered the foetus blocking the toilet of the aircraft.The plane had reportedly been parked overnight at the airport after it landed at the airport late on Thursday evening.Suction reportedly needed to be used to remove the blockage from the toilet.Fly Safair crew immediately alerted the relevant authorities and police were called out to the aircraft to investigate.The budget South African airline said the tragic finding forced them to evacuate the plane while procedures started to investigate the findings.Kirby Gordon, spokesperson for FlySafair said in a statement: “We will be doing everything in our power to aid authorities in the necessary investigations and thank our loyal customers for their patience with the resultant delay.South African Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said early investigations were underway while urging pregnant women to ask for helpthey need it.She said: If they have a problem, there are social workers, or they can go to the police, who can advise them where to go.There are social workers who can assistyou think youre not ready for the pregnancy.FlySafair said they would be happy to offer refunds or free changes to passengers who were on board the scheduled flight.After delays, the flight was eventually cancelled and all passengers were booked onto alternate flights by the airlines crew on the ground.The South African reports that laws around disposal and abandonment of foetal remains is complex in the country.According to studies, it is very rare that the person responsible for the disposal of the foetus is found guilty of murder.The identity of the mother is currently unknown.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As you would imagine, they were left terried.When I joined this industry  years ago I didn’t know that trying to calm people down would be such an important part of the job.But when you look into your toilet and see a rat down there, its really scary for the customer and they can get quite hysterical.In the jobs I have attended, when a rat comes up through the pipes into a toilet it doesn’t want to go back the way it came and so has to be removed either dead or alive.They appear to have learnt how to climb and swim upwards through the pipes.Mr Storey said there is a simple solution to the problem in the form of a drain guard.The guard is inserted into a sewage pipe and works like a cat flap, allowing waste out while blocking anything coming the other way.He added: Rats will get in to properties for a iety of reasons – from searching for food and shelter to general inquisitiveness.Home owners often feel ashamed or embarrassed but there is really no need to.Its generally not a reflection on them, its a reflection on the abundance and tenacity of rats.Before calling in the experts, which might be costly, you could try these:Fill in any holes or gaps and remember the rodents can squeeze themselves through holes a quarter of their size.Don’t encourage them to come in by leaving food lying around that they might see as a tasty treat, this includes any crumbs.Trim any trees or shrubs back four feet from your home.Set traps inside and outside your home.Remove any potential nesting sites from your property, such as leaf piles and mulch.Luckily there is a simple solution to the problem, by inserting a drain guard in the sewer pipe.They work like cat flaps and let the waste out while preventing anything coming back up.It is a simple and cost effective solution that will give people peace of mind."},{"url":null,"title":"giant cow guinness world record longest horns","story":"Poncho the seven-year-old Texas longhorn steer smashed the previous record holder by more than an inch.He lives on a ranch in Goodwater, Alabama, just outside the Birmingham metro area.The Pope family have owned Poncho since he was just six months old.In a video interview with Guinness World Records, Jeral Pope Jr. said: Ponchos horns curl and twist and go straight out.Its so neat to see the dferences and iation of the horn mass and how they grow.

It’d be Britain the “do-as-I-say-not-as-I-do” years.An horric thought that certainly added a bit of perspective to the penultimate episode of Years And Years, which was written by Doctor Who’s Russell T Davies in a fit of anti-Brexit Trump rage, thereby guaranteeing it would age about as well as Neil “Razor” Ruddock.The blasé assumption that went with it was that this series would be one of ’s big hits, so I won’t pretend the fact it’s died like the proverbial flea in a Russian’s beard hasn’t given me a lot of pleasure.It will have been a huge shock, though, to the BBC because, on the face of things, it was a bold and imaginative idea to travel ten years into the future with “an ordinary, everyday” family like the Lyons.Or it was up to the point when it became clear they were the sort of “ordinary, everyday” family who lived in a million-pound mansion and had more ticked boxes than Stephen Hawking’s homework.They were mixed race, naturally. One daughter was a lesbian left-wing activist, another was in a wheelchair, there was a gay son, with a refugee boyfriend, a cross-dressing nephew and niece who was “trans-human” and could take photos by blinking her eyes. All of them were bloody insufferable.The plot didn’t offer a lot of joy or surprises either, as it began with Donald Trump starting a nuclear war. An idea that secretly thrills all thosereaders who long to shout: “I TOLD YOU SO.”Armageddon quickly fizzled out, though, and was replaced by the melting of the North Pole, bananas becoming extinct, poor people being banned from London’s Kensington, Biblical downpours of rain and the Ukraine causing a refugee crisis when its Christian regime started arresting homosexuals, as Christian regimes so often don’t.Ben Shephard: “What is the fth letter of the alphabet ” Faith: “F.”And Love Island, Tommy: “What year did World War One start ” Molly-Mae: “.”Cheerful and brave, it most certainly wasn’t. The BBC doesn’t get a real buzz, though, unless it’s sticking it to the mother country.  So, on last week’s episode, Viv Rook became PM and immediately started planning genocide on asylum seekers. It’s not an original drama idea, obviously.Dennis Potter did the groundwork for Davies in Brimstone  Treacle, over  years ago. On Years And Years, however, plot twists come with a gear-crunching speech or a history lesson, spelled out here by the Thompson character.The thing about giving history lessons, though, is you’ve got to get them right. Years And Years didn’t.Simple Googling would’ve told the BBC concentration camps were actually a Spanish invention, during the Cuban wars of independence, and forced labour dates back centuries.I suspect they didn’t bother because the BBC and Russell T Davies are both so full of self-loathing they want to believe the worst things they hear about their own country.If you didn’t pick up that contempt for the audience from Years And Years last week, you certainly will have got a sense of it from the fact the BBC decided to land .million people over the age of  with a £. bill for the licence.It’s unlikely anyone would volunteer to pay that sort of money to endure the Years And Years lecture, no matter what it conjures up in tonight’s finale.Though how the hell it ever survived to , under the current management, will be the real mystery for most viewers.Shelley Kerr: “The one thing we want to do is win or get a draw.”Claire Rafferty: “England need more of the same but dferent.”Rachel Brown-Finnis: “Phil Neville is the female version of Gareth Southgate.” He is .LONG, cold evenings in a Highland yurt, staring at the same ruddy animals year after year, can lead presenters down all sorts of weird television cul-de-sacs.Take, for instance, Springwatch’s Michaela Strachan who, after a couple of weeks huddled in the Cairngorms, on BBC, suddenly piped up with some hot news about: “Starling testicles.”Yes. Starling testicles, which are a bit like Aston Villa, apparently.  Timid, puny little things in the winter but quite magnicent come the spring.A fact that led Michaela to wonderviewers could “imagine flying round with testicles the size of a bean ”  I could, and it quite took the thrill out of my new superpower, I can tell you.If that wasn’t a vivid enough image for you, though, co-host Chris Packham was on hand with a starling testicle-size graph and a prop, to tell her thathuman testicles swelled to the same scale, they’d be the size of basketballs.“And that’s quite a thing to get your head around, isn’t it ”I’ll take your word for it, Michaela.HAVING gone absolutely nowhere for over a week, Love Island was transformed on Wednesday by the arrival of a heat-seeking missile in human form. She’s Maura Higgins, an Irish “ring girl”. A description you can interpret pretty much any way you like.Because she may look like one of The Corrs, but Maura has a gob on her like Father Jack and, within five minutes of meeting Molly-Mae’s partner Tommy, was telling anyone who’d listen: “I swear to God, the things I’d do to that man. ‘Oh Tommy, Tommy, Tommy’. I can imagine screaming his name already.”That was just for starters, though.By Thursday, Maura was announcing her intention to “wrap my legs round his head”, which Tommy said was “doing a -degree turn”, without any danger of cutting off the blood supply to his brain. And on Friday she told all the other girls Tommy was giving her “fanny flutters”, who I think I once backed to win the  Guineas.Tommy’s now wearing the same haunted expression as a male praying mantis just before his head’s removed during the mating process, but by far the best thing about Maura’s arrival in the villa has been her verdict on herself. “I’m a girl’s girl.” RemarkableThe naive but still widespread belief Madonna will one day give a good interview.

The European Council President said he was not happy with Britainaposs political turmoil even though he can understand it is political reality. It comes as Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt grapple to be Prime Minister two months after Mr Tusk granted a delay to Brexit. Back in April Mr Tusk begged: Please do not waste this time. But since then Theresa May has resigned, a leadership race is under way and basic questions about Brexit remain unanswered. Only this morning Boris Johnson was accused of putting forward an inaccurate plan for how the UK could survive in a No Deal scenario.

The EU Council President believed “personnel decisions in London” could shake up the process. Boris Johnson is the frontrunner to replace Theresa May as Prime Minister, and has vowed to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement between Britain and the bloc. But Mr Tusk insisted the deal was not up for renegotiation. Speaking after a two-day Brussels summit, he said: “We look forward to working together with the next UK Prime Minister.    “We want to avoid a disorderly Brexit and establish a future relationship that is as close as possible with the UK. “We are open for talks when it comes to declaration of the future EU-UK relations. “But the Withdrawal Agreement is not open for renegotiation, and we have been informed on the state of play on planning for a no-deal scenario.” He added: “Now we are waiting for the new British Prime Minster and we have to be very precise and also patient in waiting for the decisions.  “Maybe the process of Brexit will be even more exciting than before because of some personnel decisions in London. “But nothing has changed when it comes to our position.” EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker insisted the  EU nations remained united on their approach, saying: “We repeated unanimously that there will be no renegotiation of the Withdrawal Agreement.” Mr Johnson and his successor as Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt , will battle it out in the race for No.    The winner will be announced in the week beginning July .

Shadow Housing Minister Sarah Jones has accused Tory Minister Kit Malthouse of misleading MPs over a promise to remove any building cladding that failed fire tests in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire which killed  people two years ago. The removal of flammable cladding from all tower blocks and public buildings is a key demand of the Mirror’s Grenfell Never Again campaign. In January, Mr Malthouse told a parliamentary select committee previously said that material that failed a large-scale ‘British Standards’ fire test would — like Grenfell-style ACM cladding — be considered too dangerous to be left on buildings and be removed immediately.    But now Mr Malthouse has admitted that for the last eight months his department has been aware of another cladding type that failed a large-scale fire test. The Government was informed that High Pressure Laminate cladding– failed the test in a third party test when it was tested with certain insulation in November. In his reply, the Housing Minister admitted: “We are aware of one BS  test carried out in the UK in  on High Pressure Laminate  in combination with combustible insulation material. This test was commissioned by a private company and the department only became aware of the test in November . We understand that the arrangement tested failed to meet the criteria for passing the test.”    Last night Mr Reed told the Mirror: They should have taken immediate action to remove it from buildings and keep people safe. “We already know ministers were warned about flammable cladding before Grenfell went up in flames. He added: All flammable cladding must immediately be banned and removed, including HPL.” The Mirror understands that while the cladding failed the test, it performed better than the type of  used on Grenfell Tower. The governmentaposs independent expert  has previously said that the combination of materials should only be usedthey have a passed the appropriate safety test and written to building owners to ask them to clary the materials in their cladding.But the result of that failed test only emerged when Labour MP Steve Reed wrote, Mr Malthouse to ask about HPL.The £million government fund set up to pay for the removal of the ACM cladding used on Grenfell Tower does not cover other flammable materials like HPL.    Labour’s Ms Jones said: Mr Malthouse had serious questions to answer. She added: Not only did the Government withhold this test result from people living in potential deathtraps, but the Housing Minister appears to have misled MPs in an important select committee evidence session. “It’s scandalous that six months after being told this cladding was lethal, the Government has not made any effort to remove it, or even find out how many buildings are covered. Ms Jones added that the government must urgently widen fire tests to include all suspect cladding and give any building which fails a fire test access to the governmentaposs cladding removal fund.    Lives are at stake and we must do better,” she said. Last week the Mirror revealed that residentaposs in blocks across the country faced being left thousands of pounds out of pocket to replace the dangerous HPL cladding on their buildings. Last night a MHCLG spokesperson said: “There should be no buildings in this country with this combination of cladding and insulation. “Building owners are legally responsible for ensuring the safety of their buildings and need to make sure this is the case. “They should be well aware of their responsibilities as we issued clear-cut advice in December , reinforced last December, telling them to check that only safe cladding and insulation combinations had been used on their buildings.

Protesting pensioners, mostly ladies, filled the pavement outside the BBC’s northern HQ in Leeds. My, did they make a noise. And they were just one of  such demonstrations all over the country. Through the plate-glass windows of their plush offices, Beeb bosses must have got the message that the oldies are on the march. It must also be filtering through to the traitor Tory politicians who reneged on their manesto pledge to keep all pensioner benefits. Protesters waved placards showing a TV set with the message Don’t Switch Us Off! and they cheered as passing drivers hooted their support. Jacqueline Robinson, , from Castleford, is one cross lady.    She said: “I’m absolutely disgusted with the licence being taken away. “My father-in-law is  and the TV is his leline. He lives in the middle of the countryside, there are no buses at the weekend. The television is his best friend.” Another “Cas Lass”,  year-old Barbara Cotton, said: “We’ve earned it and we deserve it. “We’ve put up with things youngsters wouldn’t put up with. We were deprived – but we won’t be deprived again.” Bob Harris, , a retired electrician, added: “I’ve had a free licence for  years and now they want to take it away. People like me did national service – two years on pittance pay. “It’s outrageous and it’s the thin end of the wedge. Next they’ll have the bus pass, the fuel allowance and then attack the NHS.” Nearly . million old people will lose their hard-won concession in less than a year’s time. Most protesters are in no doubt who the culprits are – Tory ministers who forced this cost-cutting treachery on the Beeb. “The Government should fund the over-s’ TV licences not the BBC,” proclaimed their placards. Hundreds joined the nationwide protests, organised by the National Pensioners Convention. In Glasgow, demonstrators chanted, “BBC, BBC, Keep our Licence Free”. Billy Foster, , reminded the politicians: “Lots of elderly people are really proud and they will refuse to be means tested, and will end up without a TV, which is their only contact with the outside world.” Outside Broadcasting House, in the centre of the capital, Londoner Ian Burleigh insisted “It’s a stealth tax by the Government, hiding behind the skirts of the BBC. “I have great respect for the BBC, but they should have had the guts to stand up to the Government.” The mood over at the Beeb’s northern HQ in Salford, Greater Manchester, was just as vehement. Leonard Mather, an -year-old Korean War veteran, was “disgusted” by the actions of the Corporation and the Government. “Gary Lineker gets paid a fortune for Match of the Day, but they can’t do anything for people who have given so much for their country,” he said.    “The Government should step in and pay the licence fee. If they don’t, the Tories will get slaughtered at the next election as people are very angry.” He has a point. This is electoral dynamite. It’s not just those directly affected. They have sons and daughters, and grandchildren, who are just as passionate as their old folk. This campaign unites the generations. And,he fails to honour his  manesto pledge to keep pensioner benefits, it could well gather enough momentum to shorten betrayer Boris Johnson’s time in No. MPs will debate this injustice on July , after a petition gathered more than , signatures. The Mirror is campaigning to save the free licences, backed by celebs such as Len Goodman and Dame Esther Rantzen.

Construction worker Chris Lodge, , and business owner Sharon Lodge, , are so busy with work and caring for their disabled dog Dice, , that they havenapost been able to take time off to go abroad. But Chris decided in June  to bring that holiday feeling to them by turning their back garden into a tropical tiki wonderland. He threw every free evening and weekend he had over  months into the mammoth project - despite having no experience of gardening whatsoever.    After digging out the lawn, Chris built a beautul timber, drtwood and rope bridge across the garden which is surrounded by luscious green palm trees and succulents. The bridge leads to a tiki hut, which Chris and Sharon call their aposFreaky Tikiapos, filled with a timber bar built by Chris, tropical trinkets and gorgeous timber engraved bar stools. While it has been no small undertaking with the couple forking out £, on the project, Chris says every penny and hour of hard work has been worth it. Not only can he, Sharon and boxer dog Dice now wander to the bottom of their garden and aposescapeapos but the venture has also ignited a passion for gardening in Chris.    Chris, of Wollaston, Northamptonshire, said: We used to love our holidays but we have a big business and I work a lot. The business suddenly took off and went a bit crazy and weaposve really been pushing it so we struggle to find the time now. We havenapost been able to go on holiday for about six years. Our dog also suffers from little seizures now and then so we donapost like to leave him. Weaposre both housebound and office-bound.  So I decided, I would bring the holiday to us so we can enjoy. Now we can go to the bottom of the garden and escape in a tropical paradise. We can come down here to our tiki hut and grab a cocktail or a latte and relax. You feel like youaposre on the other side of the world. Youaposd never guess youaposre at the bottom of a garden in the UK. I want it to be a place where all our friends can come tootheyaposre having a bad day or feeling down. I want it to be a place where people can just get away.    I just love to do things that make people happy and put a smile on their faces. It has taken some time and itaposs swallowed up about £, but itaposs all worth it as long as it makes us and other people smile. After living in their home for  years, Chris finally found the time to build an extension two years ago and decided to tackle the garden at the same time.  A willow tree at the bottom of their lawn reminded Chris of a jungle-themed fairground ride he used to go on as a child. Chris poured hours into researching which tropical plants could best withstand British weather and used online tutorial videos to learn all the tricks of the gardening trade. With an aposeye for detailapos, years of construction and a helping hand from his mate Rob, Chris has really put his own aposfunky and dferentapos stamp on his garden. His aposFreaky Tikiapos hut was a wooden shed purchased for £, which Chris then transformed with dried grass roofing, an optical illusion tropical window and exotic decorations.    No expense has been spared with some plants costing £ each and tiki mugs that adorn the barn specially imported from America. Chris said: I didnapost have any gardening experience at all before this - apart from keeping the odd cactus or venus fly trap on the window sill when I was younger. But a couple of years ago I started an extension on our house and decided it was time to do the garden as well. Thereaposs a willow tree at the bottom of the garden that really inspired the jungle theme. The way the canopy hangs down made it feel a bit like a rainforest. So I started looking into tropical gardening and all the things you could do even living in this country. It really got me. I was hooked. So many friends have seen what Iaposve done and theyaposve never been into gardening before but now theyaposre starting to take it up. I love that Iaposve showed people what you can achieve.

The sun rises behind the Heel Stone, the ancient entrance to the Stone Circle, and rays of sunlight are channelled into the centre of the monument.    Summer solstice takes place as one of the Earth’s poles has its maximum tilt toward the sun and the sun reaches its highest position in the sky, ensuring the longest period of daylight for year. Wiltshire Police arrested four people at Stonehenge and a fth was detained in Avebury — two on alcohol-related offences, one for indecent exposure, one for assault and finally a -year-old man was arrested for criminal damage. But Superintendent Dave Minty said: “We were pleased with how summer solstice went once again this year. “Overnight, we deployed a force drone at Stonehenge several times to help keep an eye on the estimated ,-strong crowd.”   The UK soaked in glorious sunshine on Friday with more sizzling weather in the week ahead. But Met Office experts have also warned that along with humid temperatures we will also see thunderstorms and sudden showers.This weekend we can expect mostly fine weather for England and Wales, so it may be time to plan a picnic. But from late Sunday onwards, severe thunderstorms are set to batter parts of the UK with a risk of localised flooding.  Thunderstorm warnings are in place from pm on Sunday until the end of Tuesday, with up to inof rain expected to fall in England and Wales. Warm air is heading to Britain — that has drted north from Algeria — will push up temperatures in South East England in what has been dubbed a ‘Saharan bubble’. On Monday, which is Midsummer’s Day, temperatures will start to soar and humidity levels rise. By the middle of next week we could be in for some traditional ‘flaming June’ weather, with thermometers even hitting the Fs . And by Thursday and Friday, temperatures could start getting into the low-s and even above Cnext week, particularly in southern and eastern England. The Met Office’s Laura Ellam said: “High pressure will bring a brief spell of warmer, drier and sunnier weather this weekend.  “However, as low pressure re-establishes later on Sunday, we’re going to see ato the heavy rain and thunderstorms we’ve seen so far this June. “Rather than the recent cooler conditions, it’s going to feel much warmer and humid. “While it will feel warmer for everyone in the UK next week, parts of southern and eastern England will see the hottest weather with temperatures here into the high Cs , possibly exceeding Cat the peak of the heat by Wednesday or Thursday.” Yet she warned: “With this hot and humid weather there is the potential for severe thunderstorms developing. “That brings the risk of torrential downpours, hail, flash flooding and gusty winds. “We are carefully monitoring the situation and will update any national severe weather warnings as confidence in where the greatest impacts from the thunderstorms and heavy rain increases.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman 32 who didnt tell","story":"NewsWoman, , who didnt tell husband about boob job now getting a vampire facialWelsh model Lora Evans spent up to £, on cosmetic surgery in just two years, including getting a boob job, lip fillers and botox every six monthsShareCommentsByKatie BellisKaisha Langton:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsThe -year-old model Lora hopes a vampire facial will work as well for her as it did for Kim Kardashian \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A Welsh model, who didnapost tell her husband about her boob job until the day before she was due to go under the kne, is undertaking a risky facial made famous by Kim Kardashian .Lora Evans, , also known as Lora Mua, is no stranger to cosmetic work having already had a boob job, eyebrow tattoos and lip fillers and botox, Wales Online reports. Earlier this year, the Swansea model shared her fears that her modelling career could be over after her lips turned blue and started to split after she had fillers. The -year-old is now set to try the latest anti-ageing craze involving injecting your own blood back into your face. A vampire facial is an anti-ageing treatment which involves using your own blood to boost the bodyaposs ability to regenerate and heal the treated area. It consists of extracting the patientaposs blood, separating the plasma and the re-injecting it into the skin. It was made famous by Kim Kardashian in  after she posted an image of herself during the facial.      Mrs Evans said: I just like to improve on things, I just want to make the best out of what Iaposve got. Thereaposs pressure to look a certain way with my modelling, I am  now and you have models who are starting at . In order to keep up I have to spend the money and time on my face to look a certain way. Lora said that she started having work done when she was  and says her husband was dead set against it at first so she paid for her breast operation and didnapost tell him until the day before she went under the kne. She said: With my fillers I wouldnapost tell him I would just say that I was stung by a wasp but he knows now as he found out when he read it in the paper, heaposs used to it now. Mrs Evans added that she was hoping to see similar results as Kim Kardashian from the vampire facials. The model said: Kim Kardashian had it done a few times and she said that the results are amazing.  Whatever she has done people will think apos itaposs good enough for her then I want to have it. She admitted that having procedures can be addictive. You like the way you look when you have the procedures done and when it wears off you want to have it done again. With the vampire facial you can feel the needle go in, it wasnapost unbearable but it was uncomfortable. It was over very quickly. My eyes started to cry but itaposs not as bad as what I thought it was going to be. I was expecting it to be really gruesome but itaposs not. Itaposs part of my skin care routine that I have to keep up every six months, I want to look good for the future becauseI stop now and get wrinkles itaposs harder to get rid of them and itaposs easier to prevent them. The next thing I want done is my bum, I would like it to be made biggerpossible.  According to the RCJ Aesthetics practitioner Rebecca Cromwell who conducted Loraaposs vampire facial, the treatment costs between £-£ and takes around one hour. She said: People can become addicted to dferent procedures butsomeone came back to me and said I want more and more I do say no as it can become too much. You get an instant glow with the facial and the next day you feel a lot more fresh-faced. Results take up to - days and they say to have one four times a year.

Amirali Hajizadeh, head of the Revolutionary Guards air force, said the debris was proof that the U.S. drone had been over Iranian territorial waters when it was shot down. But Washington claims that the drone was downed over international airspace in the Strait of Hormuz.   US President Donald Trump said he had been close to launching retaliatory strike against the Islamic Republic, saying the military had been cocked and loaded in anticipation.However, he declined to authorise the action after being told that  people would have died as a result, he claimed. Ten minutes before the strike I stopped it, not proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone. I am in no hurry, our military is rebuilt, new, and ready to go, by far the best in the world, Trump tweeted. Independent confirmation of the droneaposs location when it was brought down was not immediately available.    The droneaposs destruction exacerbated tensions in the Gulf where six tankers have been damaged by explosions in the past six weeks. Iran has denied U.S. and Saudi accusations it was behind the tanker attacks and accused Washington of warmongering. The U.S. wants the current Iranian regime to come to the negotiating table and to stop their support for terrorism, pursuit of ballistic missiles, nuclear program cover-ups and human rights abuses, tweeted U.S. Ambassador to Germany RichardGrenell.  Our European partners share these goals. European powers - fellow signatories of the nuclear deal with Iran - say more evidence is needed to pinpoint responsibility for the tanker strikes. In his initial response on Thursday, Trump said he was not eager to escalate a stand-off with Iran over its nuclear and ballistic missile activities and support for proxies in ious Middle East conflicts.  He said the unmanned drone might have been shot down in error by someone who was acting loose and stupid, though added: This country will not stand for it. The incident aggravated global fears of direct military confrontation between the longtime foes, and oil prices rose a further  per barrel to above . on Friday due to worries about possible disruptions to crude exports from the Gulf.

Animal rights group L published the video yesterday showing the cows with transparent plastic devices on their side. The plastic porthole devices, known as cannulas, have been used for decades and is a relatively a common practise in industrial farming. The animals are known as cannulated or fistulated cows, and the device allows scientists to optimise and regulate their nutrition by observing the inside of their four stomachs.    However, the animal rights group has launched an online campaign demanding authorities ban the device, adding that the use of cannulas was a symptomatic of the way animals are considered as simple machines at our disposal. In a video released by the group, they said: As citizens, we call on the ministers for research and agriculture to immediately ban experiments aimed at increasing the productivity of animals. They have pierced a hole into the cowsapos stomach so they can regularly access its content. Employees come regularly to open the porthole to deposit food samples or take them out. Describing how the cows are being treated as milk producing machines, they added: The aim is to perfect the most effective form of feeding so the cows produce as much milk as possible.    They also explained how they had filed a complaint to the regional prosecutor in the Mans region, Fabrice Belargent over the illegal experiments and the serious animal abuses. The animal rights group added: For Sanders and those involved in intensive livestock production, which is the norm in France, these animals are nothing more than production machines, a basic raw material at our disposal. The facility belongs to French food research giant Avril which said the six fistulated cows featured in the video were closely monitored and observed extremely rigorously by vets. In response to the L complaint, Avril Group said: This process is used worldwide for research purposes only.  This is currently the only solution to study the digestion of plant proteins. They added: This analysis is essential for many advances in breeding and, in particular, to improve the digestive health of millions of animals, reduce the use of antibiotics and reduce emissions of nitrates and methane related to livestock. French TV host Nagui Fam, who presented the footage, lashed out at the inhumane practise. He said: For Sanders, these cows are just milk-producing machines that need to have their settings optimised. Today, dairy cows produce on average  litres of milk a day, which is five times the daily requirements of a calf.    He added: Other experiments are carried out on isolated calves in small enclosures. The pigs only have cold metal as their environment. The rabbits are prisoners in their small cages and they will know only these cages their whole lives. They will never get out. And the chickens, which are from fast-growing strains, are fed with a too rich diet and their weight is pushed to the extreme. They can barely walk.

Especially here, where they have an extensive menu dedicated to them categorised by flavour and even offer “cocktail experiences” for those looking to learn from their mixologists. Our waiter recommended a real fruit mocktail with lots of real crushed fruit and berries and juices to provide a thirst quenching mix without the alcohol .We relaxed into the quiet and sipped our drinks in the sun as we pondered over the vast menu options.The venue’s interior is a mix of classic wooden floors with soft leathers and muted tartans in greys and brown, combining traditional charm with modern comfort. vw, px\"  The menus are bound in heavy leather books, and there was plenty of choice.My other half ordered bruschetta to startwhich, of course, we ended up sharing. Well, I am eating for two!Who knew that three simple slices of toasted bread with oils and tomato could be so delicious  Also, both of us were pretty in awe of the little yellow tomatoes – spot the uncultured pair.I toyed with the idea of my usual steak pie-pick and even deliberated a fish dish, but in the end we both went for the same main course of chicken tikka curryand it was presented beautully.The plate held rice and naan with a small dish of mango chutney and a large dish of gorgeously bright-coloured chicken tikka.The chicken was wonderfully soft and the tikka sauce was full of flavour, not too salty with just a bit of zing. vw, px\"  I’m notoriously soft when it comes to anything spicy, but this was just enough for me and I only needed water for my tingly lips towards the end of finishing the plateful.We were both equally surprised at the portion size from the Caird. Although it felt upmarket, there was no scrimping on the food.I chose the brownie for dessert and my partner the sticky toffee pudding . Again, both platefuls looked almost too good to eat.My dark chocolate brownie was topped with drizzled caramel sauce next to a scoop of vanilla ice cream with sprinkles of crushed chocolate and chocolate sauce. Strawberries and homemade fudge was presented to the side in a design with shards of wafer and small dollops of salted caramel and strawberry mousse. It sounds like a lot of flavours and it was, but in a good way.My partner’s slab of sticky toffee pudding was also teamed with a large scoop of ice cream, crushed chocolate, a large wafer and a couple of raspberries, sprinkled with icing sugar.We both finished the lot.The whole evening was lovely and relaxing. We could hear the live musicians in the bar from where we were seating which provided great listening.

This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

Design fleets comprising the Sigma s, Sonatas, Etchells and Hunter s joined the racing at Tarbert.Amid a flurry of rib activity laying and moving marks, it was not long before the CYCA  passage race fleet approached the finish line.The teams later caught up in the bar for the day one prize giving as new event chairman Glenn Porter welcomed everyone to Tarbert. With a number of races omitted due to protests, it was a nice easy start for Glenn.The Hunter s and Sonatas saw a spread of results after some close racing. The CYCA class  fleet on the Largs passage race was won on corrected time by Celtic Spirit. Additional prizes were awarded to Encore for the passage race line honours and Shona of Ashton for toughing it out at the rear of the passage race.Saturday was a much more challenging day on the water with a light wind and dreich drizzle.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"fountainhead megayacht spotted in tarbert harbour","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTarbert enjoyed a short visit from the megayacht Fountainhead, a  Feadship built for American billionaire Eddie Lampert, chief executive officer of American store Sears.At .m , she is the th biggest yacht in the world, registered in the Cayman Islands.

skies of June burst through threatening rain clouds on Sunday evening and out marched this yearrsquos Beltane Festival Principals onto Peebles High Street, the festal colours of red and white fluttering in the breeze above them.Father Tony Lappin was a newly welcomed guest to this spectacle only a year prior. But the honour of being installed as the Warden of the Cross Kirk was his on Sunday.Cornet Gregor McGrath led the parade of Principals, Court, Committee, Ex-Cornets, their Lasses and Peebles Callants to the medieval ruins of the Cross Kirk which comes to le annually to host an annual congregation for the townrsquos religious ceremony which marks the start of the Beltane Festival.A wide iety of local organisations flying their flags marched to the ancient grounds for the Inaugural Service where retiring Warden of the Kirk, Rev Barry Hughes, carried out his last official act in Peebles.Rev Hughes left the town six months ago to take up ministry at St Markrsquos Church in Raploch in Stirling.He said: ldquoPeebles and Raploch are in many ways as dferent as two places can possibly be ndash they are dferent socially, economically, geographically.\"Peebles is a small Borders town, full of history, whereas The Raploch is a large council estate which sprung up in the middle of the th century.ldquoBut Peebles and The Raploch have one very important thing in common ndash the strength of their communities.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

Itrsquos in such a beautul part of our county that the journey there was an adventure in itself.The loch is hidden, surrounded by a wood which embraces its secrets. Irsquod never visited it before, but Irsquod been told how magical this place is and that it has a story attached to it.Finding an appropriate place to park was our first challenge. There is no direct access to the loch and no car park with signposts, so care is needed in finding a suitable place. A private farm road that takes you to the entrance gate is not an option, so initially I struggled to find a suitable place, but some kind advice from a friendly farmer helped us out.Itrsquos a perfect time of year for such an adventure. The woods are fully clothed and still echoing with birdsong. I like to explore new places initially without a map or guide. It adds to the adventure, as we had to decide which way to go and initially wonderedwersquod taken the wrong route. But there is a circular walk around the loch, so once the path is discovered there isnrsquot a wrong way.It is a beautul and tranquil place, and as we wandered along the tree-lined loch I thought about the story of the man responsible for its creation.That man was Harry Younger, of the well-known brewing family. His ancestor, William Younger, had been the man who had built up the famous brewing business which produced Youngerrsquos Ale. A huge chunk of the Canongate in Edinburgh was taken over by their Holyrood brewery, including the site where the Scottish Parliament now sits.When William Younger died in , he was a hugely wealthy and successful businessman but also, it seems, exhausted and overworked. The empire he left was continued by the family but eventually in , the Younger enterprise was merged with rivals McEwanrsquos, to form Scottish Brewers Ltd.This merger, the reasons for which are another story, meant the Younger family branched out into other ventures. In the s, Harry Younger, the then head of the family, bought the land at Baro and began transforming it into the haven of nature it now is.Harry led an interesting and privileged le. He was an internationally known curler who regularly competed and won trophies. His intention was to create a new home amid the beauty of this area of East Lothian. He set about building a house, but also developed Bara Loch as it now exists and surrounded it with an embrace of trees.But the dark clouds of the Second World War intervened in his plans to enjoy this paradise. He had attended Sandhurst in his earlier years and seen the last months of the First World War. He remained involved in the Territorial Army and in January  he was sent to France as commander of a mechanised unit.It is recorded that he was killed in action on June  at St Valery-en-Caux. His unit, the Lothian and Border Horse, had been part of the brave and ferocious defence of the Dunkirk beaches. Anyone with knowledge of this action will understand the hell and desperation of that defence, and the supreme courage and sacrice of the defenders.Harry died on the day these brave defenders had to finally surrender, after over , had been evacuated from the beaches. How he died, what horrors he witnessed, we can only guess. He lies buried in the St Valery-en-Caux Franco-British Cemetery.And so this is the story attached to this beautul place. The man who began its creation never got the chance to enjoy it.In our walk, we arrived at a stone seat overlooking the loch. It had a worn inscription on it. We could make out the words lsquoin memoryrsquo or lsquomemorialrsquo and lsquoYoungerrsquo, but the rest was too worn.But I knew this must be a memorial to Harry Younger, which was later confirmed when I found a wonderful blog called Walking East Lothian in which the author explained he had traced the inscription to reveal Harryrsquos name and the date , the year of the lochrsquos creation.I sat on the seat and watched my kids play in the wood. The trees on the north side arch over the waterline to catch the sunlight, creating a canopy which dips into the loch. The serene tranquillity and beauty of the place is no doubt what Harry intended.But that in a sense is part of the magic of this place. As the pioneer Nelson Henderson once said to his son: ldquoThe true meaning of le is to plant trees under whose shade you do not expect to sit.It was these words I was reflecting on as I watched my children play. Harry was of course wealthy but we can all plant trees, either real ones or metaphorical ones, as a legacy for others.The recent death of a fellow storyteller and all-round wonderful woman, Ros Parkyn, was also on my mind. I had spoken about this place to her and of my intention to visit it. She loved nature too and would have gladly come along with me. But I sadly left it too late.Ros encapsulated all that was good and compassionate about humanity and she also planted many trees, some in the ground for she was a nature lover, but even more were planted in the hearts of those who knew her. They all now will grown as part of her wonderful legacy.As we left the wood, butterflies and blue dragonflies accompanied me, along with thoughts of my friend Ros and a man I didnrsquot know but whose trees shaded us.I willin autumn to see the colours and pay quiet homage to those who leave this world having made a positive dference."},{"url":null,"title":"new-primary-school-at-letham-mains-starting-to-take-shape","story":"Work began on Letham Mains Primary School, on Haddingtonrsquos western edge, earlier this year.The

Tranentrsquos eastern edge, despite the land being earmarked solely for economic development.Developers insisted that the only way to bring businesses onto the site was by generating funds from the sale of the new homes.They argued that making the site suitable for development would cost pound.million and it was not viable without housing.However, East Lothian Council rejected their plans at a meeting in August when officers insisted the site should be retained for employment use.Councillor John McMillan, economic spokesperson, referenced the Kevin Costner movie Field of Dreams when he told colleagues: ldquoIf we build it, they will come.Developers appealed to the Scottish Government to overturn their decision, insisting the local authority had failed to acknowledge the evidence they had provided which, they said, demonstrated the need for enabling residential development on the land.However, the Scottish Government Reporter appointed to investigate the appeal has now rejected their argument, siding with the council.He said that the Local Development Plan for East Lothian had set aside the land at Kingslaw for economic development and it should be retained as such.And he pointed out that the housing proposed by Barratt,which was described as lsquowindfallrsquo housing ndash which refers to a site which becomes available unexpectedly ndash would ldquosimply supplement an already generous housing land supply.Despite rejecting the appeal, the reporter said that he accepted the views of the developers and the District Valuer that the site was not financially viable as employment land in the current market conditions.He said: ldquoWhile I cannot be certain that there is no prospect of a business or industrial use being realised on the whole site, the information for this appeal indicates that, in the current economic conditions, it would be unlikely.However, he questioned whether the plans to build  houses and provide the local authority with . hectares of ldquoserviced land to build business units on it were possible, with no evidence the units would be created or could operate next to the new residential development.The reporter said: ldquoI find that the housing proposed would not directly enable commercial development to take place.ldquoAlthough not likely to be currently viable, the site would be removed as a strategic long-term employment option.East Lothian Council welcomed the ruling which is the first housing appeal to have been ruled in their favour since their new Local Development Plan was adopted.Councillor Norman Hampshire, planning convenor, said: ldquoWe welcome the outcome of this appeal both in the context of the Scottish Government Reporter upholding a decision that was carefully considered by East Lothianrsquos Planning Committee, and of course in respect of our adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan , which is now the basis of all planning considerations in East Lothian and provides clear guidance on

There are several factors influencing this, but the major factor which has tipped the balance is the extended funding hours and the negative impact this is having both financially on small businesses, like Mary Poppins, and to the quality of early learning and childcare.New Scottish Government policy instructs councils to increase their funded childcare hours from  to , by . This move also includes longer opening hours and a move from term time to year-round opening hours to attempt to make childcare more nationally accessible.Ms Dewar said: ldquoThe money received for funded places does not cover the costs of providing the quality of early learning and childcare which we want and are required to provide, especially with regards to staff costs.ldquoThe timescales and measures that the Scottish Government has put in place to educate a workforce to meet the increased requirements are insufficient, and there is a serious shortfall to meet the requirements of the extended funding.ldquoEast Lothian Council indicated it estimated it would require approximately  staff to facilitate the increase in funded hours in East Lothian. The majority of these posts are early learning and childcare practitioners.ldquoThe local authority advertises early learning practitioner posts at between pound. and pound. per hour. Private nurseries are unable to compete with these rates of pay due to the funding rates we are allocated.A group of parents and staff, including Ms Dewar, are visiting county MSP Iain Gray to discuss the problems, but Ms Dewar added that unless he can ldquowork a miracle and change the policy, then it is unlikely the decision to close the nursery will be reversed.When asked about the nursery, Mr Gray said: ldquoThe loss of any nursery provision is disappointing, particularly with the Governmentrsquos , funded hours policy set to be implemented next year.ldquoIn the case of the Mary Poppins Nursery, the owner has highlighted a number of factors that have contributed to their decision to close.ldquoI have written to East Lothian Council about some of these issues.ldquoHowever, there are also wider issues at play here. The nursery sector has been warning the Scottish Government that private nurseries are struggling in the run-up to the roll-out of its flagship , policy from August .ldquoMinisters must act quickly to address the sectorrsquos concerns and ensure that the capacity exists to deliver the funded hours next year.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is, of course, concerning to hear of any nursery considering closure, and the obvious effects this might have on staff, parents and children.ldquoEast Lothian Council has provided assurance that they will support families to find alternative early learning and childcare places for children who had been expecting to use the Mary Poppins Nursery from this August.Ms Dewar added: ldquoI am distraught that circumstances have forced me to this decision and that such a wonderful place for children to experience their early years is to close.The decision was met with an outpouring of grief on social media.The nurseryrsquos recent th birthday was marked with a garden party.The nursery was founded by Sue Armstrong, affectionately still called lsquoMiss Suersquo, after she had written to Mary Poppins author P L Travers to askshe could use the name.Miss Sue said: ldquoI received many letters from P L Travers about the nursery.ldquoAt the beginning, she wanted to know what the nursery was going to be like. She had no objection to me using the name, she just wanted to find out more. I ended up meeting her as well.ldquoWe were hoping to get her to come and open the nursery  years ago, but her arthritis was bad. We stayed in touch, however. I would send her letters about how the nursery was getting on along with photos, and she would write back saying how she liked it, and ideas of what to do.ldquoShe said that the children should be encouraged to make up their own stories. lsquoChildren like doing that,rsquo she said.Miss Sue sold the nursery to Ms Dewar in  as she was ldquosick of all the paperwork.She said. ldquoWhen I heard it was to close down, well, itrsquos just all so sad really. Itrsquos such a terrible shame.ldquoIt is such a nice and happy place for the children, homely and warm. Itrsquos just awful that it canrsquot stay open.Miss Sue still attends events at the nursery, dressed as the iconic nanny Mary Poppins.She added: ldquoIn the film, Mary Poppins says that shersquoll stay until the winds change. Well, maybe this is the wind changing for Mary Poppins Nursery.Ward councillor Craig Hoy said: ldquoThe closure of the Mary Poppins Nursery is deeply regrettable but reflects the real pressures the independent sector is experiencing as a result of the SNPrsquos , hours policy.\"The Government faces huge problems to provide the free childcare it has promised.

This really is an exceptional moment in politics. Everyone says that Boris Johnson is unreliable, untruthful, unfaithful, unruly and unpredictable. Yet, he is almost certainly going to be our next Prime Minister. How did we get here Hes a chat show celebrity, of course. But its not ashes seen in a positive light by the media glitterati. Last week, Ian Hislop, the lead list on BBCs Have I Go News For You, on which Boris famously starred, called for him to be jailed. TV presenters loathe Johnson, which is why his minders have tightly controlled his TV studio exposure. He has been pilloried in the press, rubbished on social media and disowned by Tory cabinet ministers.Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, made no secret of her dislike for the former London Mayor and even launched a campaign, ldquoOperation Arse to stop him. The Conservative Scottish Secretary, David Mundell, said he ldquowouldnt serve in a Johnson cabinet . But somehow all this bounces off the Teflon Blonde. In last weeks first round of voting, Johnson won more that twice the votes of his nearest rival.The short answer of course is Brexit, but that doesnt explain why Tory MPs are so keen to have this recklessly outspoken politician as their leader. The other candidates are no less Brexity than he is. Yet he is crushing the le out of them.Iain Macwhirter: Brace yourselves, wersquore in for a Trump-Johnson double actHard man Dominic ldquokarate Raab, is a dedicated No Dealer, yet he was left gasping on the canvas after last weeks votes. The Environment Secretary, Michael Gove, is still in the race, despite his cocaine confessions, but only just. Sajid Javid, has ldquoalso ran written all over him, despite winning the support of Ruth Davidson.This just leaves the Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, as the safety-first candidate. Hell probably win enough votes to come second to Johnson and be one of the two candidates offered to the wider Conservative Party membership. But he is so colourless - a male version of Theresa May - that hes most unlikely to succeed. Tories realise that this isnt the time for safety-first candidates. Theyve been there done that.Media commentators have been talking up the ldquoWhite Walker, Development Secretary, Rory Stewart, who squeaked into the second round. He certainly has a good back story, with his wanderings in Afghanistan, and possesses the effortless self-confidence that only an Eton education can provide. Hes a youthful breath of fresh air, but Tories arent interested in fresh air right now. They prefer the fug of populism.Which leaves us with Boris Johnson as the next Prime Minister. Even as I write that again I can still hardly believe it. Consider this testimonial by one of Johnsons former employers. ldquoHe is a far more ruthless, and frankly nastier figure than the public appreciates...I would not take Boriss word about whether it is Monday or Tuesday.. He is not a man to believe in, to trust or respect, save as a superlative exhibitionist.That was Johnsons former editor, Max Hastings, of the Tory-supporting Daily. In the same article, Hastings said thatJohnson ever became Prime Minister hed be ldquoon the first plane out of Britain. I hope hes booked his tickets.: Scottish Tory MP warns Boris Johnson against trying to \"subvert\" leadership voteEveryone knows that the former London Mayor was sacked as a journalist for lying, and then again as a junior minister for lack of candour. His infidelities are legion. Hersquos barely capable of appearing in public without provoking offence, usually from ethnic minorities. Three years ago he won pound from the Spectator magazine for a limerick that referred to the President of Turkey having sex with a goat.You think Im making that up, dont you  But the next PM really did write this about of President Recip Erdogan: ldquoThere was a young fellow from Ankara. Who was a terric w@nkerer. Till he sowed his wild oats. With the help of a goat. But he didnt even stop to thankera. Dont think hell be reprising that when he meets the Turkish President.The Tories used to be the sober, serious and sensible party. The political wing of the Anglican Church. Its in the name: ldquoConservative. So what are they doing electing this man  Are Tory MPs so addled by Brexit they cant see whats coming  A Prime Minister as chaotic and unpredictable as Donald Trump.In many ways, Boris Johnson seems the polar opposite of Trump. In terms of education, wit, literary ability and social background, he couldnt be more dferent to the belligerent billionaire. But they share one important characteristic: they are charismatic populists. They are rule breakers, who can be guaranteed to defy convention, for good or ill. Theyre not really politicians in the conventional sense, but anti-politicians, repositories of popular discontent.Many voters like Boris because he is the embodiment of political incorrectness. He is guaranteed to provoke outrage from the professional offence-takers and social justice warriors who populate social media. Many middle Americans voted for Donald Trump, not because they expected him to be a model president, but because he would upset self-righteous scolds who tell people what to say and what to think. The woke s of the culture wars, who police the language of ersity, and condemn jokes about gays, women or racial minorities.Boris is also someone who will make trouble, and many voters want to make trouble right now. That is why, paradoxically, the party of the establishment, is embracing someone whose demeanour seems so anti-establishment. Conservatives know that the only thing that matters is getting power and keeping it. Back in the day, this involved electing boring politicians in sensible suits who wouldnt frighten the middle classes and would invite deference from in the lower orders. Politicians behaved like bank managers, headmasters, churchmen.But the middle classes have been plunged into insecurity by the financial crash, working people no longer defer to authority figures, and respect for religion has largely vanished from our secular public realm. In many ways, the passing of deference is a good thing. But we have also become an irritable and fractious society that doesnt know what it wants, but wants it now. Brexit is a touchstone issue here: a political project which no one really understands, because it is about complex trading law, but on which everyone has an emotionally-charged point of view.Boris Johnson, is natural material for these emotive times. He is a performance artist, really, a living commentary on the state of society. A politician of shting principle, who is not expected to honour his promises, and whose moral compass is his own ambition. So, prepare for a bumpy ride. The one thing Boris Johnson will never be is boring."},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  March on the Tories  not the BBC  over free TV licences","story":"Older folk on this side of the Atlantic are indeed preparing to change out of their slippers, albeit for a very dferent cause. Thousands of pensioners plan to march this week on BBC sites across the UK in protest at the corporationrsquos announcement that from  it will stop giving free TV licences to everyone aged over , at a cost of poundm a year, moving instead to a means-tested system where only those claiming pension credit will be exempt from paying the pound. annual fee.Read more: Pensioners to march in fury over BBC licence fee grabThe National Pensioners Conventionwhich is organising the protest, off the back of an Age UK petition that has already garnered more than half a million signatures, has called the BBCrsquos move ldquocallous and cruel.The NPC claims the issue is ldquouniting generations when the reality, of course, is that universal benefits for pensioners like this one and the winter fuel allowance ndash which costs around poundbn a year ndashincreasingly ides society by age, with the gap between older, private-pensioned, property-rich haves and younger, debt-ridden have-nots growing by the day.What really dispirits me about the outcry over this move, however, is the way in which large sections of society have fallen hook, line and sinker for the Tory ploy to blame the BBC. The corporation was, after all, left in a no-win situation when it was landed with free licences as part of its settlement in . If it continues to fund them for all over s, the very services viewers and listeners say they value, that mark the corporation out from lesser commercial broadcasters ndash the peerless radio output, BBC and BBC ndash would have to go.Read more: Pensioners to march in fury over BBC licence fee grabAnd make no mistake, this isnrsquot just an opportunistic shting of responsibility for an unpopular policy from Government to BBC, though it seems ridiculous that anyone would believe a broadcaster would or should be in charge of welfare policy. Rather, it is a calculated move as part of a much bigger, more ideological and potentially damaging attack on our public institutions.How George Osborne, the former Tory chancellor who made the decision to cut funding for free TV licences, must have laughed over the last week as he put out article after article about the brouhaha in the newspaper he now edits, the London Evening Standard.The joke, of course, is on us. Mr Osborne and his chum David Cameron were two of the most blatantly mendacious politicians of the modern era. It is they who sowed the seeds of the dangerous political situation we currently find ourselves in, who set the standard for the motley crew of charlatans and nersquoer-do-wells lining up to lead the country further into oblivion.Letrsquos do a quick recap. Despite casting themselves in  as modern, centrist one-nation Conservatives, the Cameron administrationrsquos post-crash austerity narrative disguised a strategy specically designed to run-down, undermine and under-fund our public institutions and services. Indeed, this agenda, taken alongside the EU referendum, suggest Cameron and Osborne were doing the work of the Tory hard right from the off. We should have remembered from the s that the Tories are past masters when it comes to ide and rule. And yet here we are in , iding ourselves into ldquothem and ldquous politically, constitutionally, culturally, economically, on the precipice of a disastrous no-deal Brexit under an odiously populist leader. The services and institutions that used to anchor us on common ground, the post-war settlement that encompassed social housing, the NHS, the BBC, have or are in the process of being deliberately, ideologically undermined.And by attacking the BBC over free licences, we are doing the work of these ideologues.Though I do not agree with the view that all over-s should get a free TV licence, I respect the NPCrsquos demand to retain the benefit. The plan to march on the BBC, however, is not only wrong-headed but plays straight into the hands of those who would like to see our remaining public services either privatised or obliterated.More likely to vote than other groups and with higher incomes, older people now have more clout than ever before they should use it by putting on their marching shoes and heading to Conservative HQ."},{"url":null,"title":"TV REVIEW  Who won the Tory manspreading contest ","story":"Not THE Boris Johnson, blonder than Harlow, more reclusive than Garbo, the dude the media cannot tame  The very same.

And it was the Russians who made the first great advances. Fuelled by the most powerful rockets in the world at the time, they launched the first articial satellite - Sputnik - into orbit in , and reached the moon with their Lunik probe just two years later.:Then, in , Soviet scientists achieved what was thought beyond them, and launched the first man - pilot Yuri Gagarin - into space.US President John F Kennedy resolved that the US would not be beaten again, and set NASA on a course for the next frontier - a manned mission to the moon.In September , he said: ldquoWe choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.ldquoBecause that challenge is one that wersquore willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win.The wheels were set in motion. Dr Timothy Peacock, Lecturer in History at the University of Glasgow, explained what was at stake: ldquoThe US Soviet rivalry was intense, with any achievement which could aid in demonstrating the superiority of Capitalist or Communist superpowers mobilised in support, from films and food to the latest scientic advances.ldquoThe rivalry in space represented the Crown Jewels of Cold War theatre and propaganda. Images or film clips of spaceflight successes were like science fiction brought to le, firing both popular imagination and the international prestige of their architects to the same heights as the rockets themselves.ldquoEvery new achievement was heralded as a testament to the technological sophistication of that superpower. The first satellite in Space, the first animal, the first man, the first woman, the first spacewalk, the first Moon landing.This rivalry would propel the Apollo programme which would carry out the first orbit of a celestial body by a crewed spaceship, before landing Armstrong and Aldrin on the moon.A third astronaut, Michael Collins, stayed behind in lunar orbit, floating around the moon alone for more than  hours, , miles from earth.With the Cold War now a memory, science will once again take the lead in celebrating the triorsquos achievements. Museums and discovery centres around the world have already begun programmes of events to celebrate the first moon landing, with NASA taking the lead.:On July th the space agency will host a series of broadcasts from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the newly-restored Apollo mission control room at Johnson Space Center in Houston and the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.In France, astronauts Walt Cunningham , Charlie Duke , and Al Wordenhave launched a week-long program of celebrations, presentations dedicated to the space race at the Paris airshow while in Australia the US Embassy will host a race-to-the moon exhibition at its embassy in Canberra.In the UK, events have been brought under the banner of Moon, with dozens happening around the country over the course of the year, including a screening of the dramatisation First Man in Glasgow and a talk by Professor of Planetary and Space Science at The Open University Monica Grady at Dynamic Earth in Edinburgh later this year.Each will encourage people who take the moon landings for granted to look again with fresh eyes at one of mankindrsquos greatest achievements and great lasting legacies. Dr Peacock explains: ldquoWersquore talking about launching the first satellite and only  years later being able to transport people -,km through Space, landing in a largely unknown environment only visited by a handful of unmanned probes, ing safely to Earth at speeds faster than any person in history, surviving for a total of - days, against hazards of solar radiation, extreme temperature iations, and the vacuum of Space.ldquoThe Moon landings have had many long-lasting effects, inspiring generations in everything from studying science to prompting critical Space investment of countries and companies that continues today, in a renewed lsquoSpace Racersquo topeople to the Moonrsquos surface."},{"url":null,"title":"beef event one of the best yet","story":"Early morning rain failed to deter farmers from attending the Scottish Beef Association#s Scotland#s Beef Event  held last month on a leading Aberdeenshire beef farm.Around , people streamed into North Bethelnie Farm, near Oldmeldrum, on Thursday, May .Rural Economy Cabinet Secretary, Fergus Ewing, speaking at the opening ceremony“It was a very successful day and generally recognised as one of the best of the biennial beef events the SBA has organised over the years,” said SBA vice-chairman, David Barron, who chaired the organising committee.“The  trade stands reported good business and the extensive technical demonstration area was thronged throughout the day with farmers keen to pick up all the latest technology for the beef industry.”Mr Barron was full of praise for the host farmers, Robbie and Barbara Milne, and their son, James, who put on a great show.One of the highlights of the day was the tour of the  acre all-grass farm – with no fewer than  tractors and trailers at the ready to avoid queuing – which took visitors right to the top of the hill, where they were treated to an ice-cream from neighbouring farmers, Mackie’s, while enjoying magnicent views of the Aberdeenshire countryside looking up to Bennachie.Beef farmers – like all farmers and indeed the whole of industry – are facing an uncertain future as the debacle and stalemate of the Brexit negotiations continues.The only thing farmers can do is to make sure they are operating as efficiently and productively as possible so they are in a strong position to cope with whatever hits them in the future – in or out of Europe – and they had plenty of pointers at the Beef Event which more than lived up to its theme - Breeding, Feeding, Succeeding.Rural Economy Cabinet Secretary, Fergus Ewing, who in giving the official opening address, reiterated his support for the beef industry and determination to reverse the continuing decline in the national beef herd.But saying is not doing although, in fairness to Mr Ewing, he dropped more than a broad hint that the Scottish Government is looking at an emergency support package for the beef sector. This could take the form of increased headage payments under the existing beef calf support scheme.The SBA, along with NFU Scotland and other industry stakeholders, have been pressing Mr Ewing on the issue and SBA chairman, Neil McCorkindale, was hoping for an announcement by the Cabinet Secretary at the event.This didn’t materialise but Mr Ewing indicated he was sympathetic to the plea and accepted the argument that headage payments would be a more effective approach than area based support which would simply encourage inertia in the industry.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Owners Jonny and Ali Aspden\"  Popular Ellon coffee shop extends opening hoursviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Aby Wilson, Stuart Wood, Elaine Lownds, George Laing, and Director Nicola Alexander of Bethan Customs Consultancy\"  Oldmeldrum start-up doubles team viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"garioch sc launches new children s activities programme","story":"Garioch Sports Centrethis week announced that it islaunching GSCkids, a new programme of children#s activities, in a bid to make children#s activities more accessible in the local area.Launching on Wednesday, August , children will still be able to enjoy their favourites, including additional football classes, and some new additions including Junior Boxercise.GSC will also be offering preschool gymnastics classes in partnership with Donside Gymnastics for the very first time.Sandra Simpson of Donside Gymnastics commented: “We’re delighted to be launching five brand new preschool gymnastics classes at Garioch Sports Centre. “Classes are suitable from .- years old and are the \u2028perfect pathway into our school-age gymnastics programme.”Garioch Sports Centre’s Kevin Bonarius, chief operating officer, added: ‘The aim of GSCkids is to provide a safe and inclusive environment for local children and their families and carers to enjoy active lestyles while having fun.“Our doors are open to children of all ages and abilities.

Providing practical training for riders where they can improve their skills and understanding of risks through controlled exercises is a vital part of this strategy.“Motorcyclists are vastly over-represented in serious road injuries, so I hope that Orkney’s motorcyclists will take up this opportunity to both become a safer road user and improve their overall riding experience through better bike handling skills.”Anyone interested in attending the course should email: operationriderrefinement@scotland.pnn.police.ukcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There are hundreds and hundreds of beaches around our coasts that have never been cleaned and surveyed — and it#s the collection of this data that is so important to getting even more positive actions implemented than have already been achieved in the last year or so.##This year we’re appealing for more people to adopt a beach and become one of our army of beach clean organisers.”“It’s an absolutely vital role because the more beaches we have litter data for, the clearer the picture we will have of where it all comes from and what needs to be targeted next.”Anyone interested in becoming involved with this year#s Great British Beach Clean simply has to find a beach they want to clean, sign up and register it on the MCS online system and MCS will provide them with all the help they need to get going.“We hope to have even more people cleaning up Britain#s beaches this September than we did last year, so registering your events with us soon is invaluable,” added Lizzie Prior.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Not content with writing just one book, he decided to author two: one will be the scuttle story in photographs, From Scuttle to Salvage, which will be launched this Thursday, June . The  other, The Last Days of the High Seas Fleet, is the more in depth story of the German Naval mutiny, and how the Fleet came to be interned in Scapa. Both are on sale at the Orcadian Bookshop.As with Jutland, Nick decided to tell the story in film. He is passionate about passing history on to his childrens’ generation, and says he felt that this would be a best way of reaching younger people who prefer video to text. The -minute animation has already been seen by more than , people online, and was made possible through crowdfunding and the help of numerous museums and archives, the Kirkwall Library and Archives being among them.Nick will be talking about the scuttle on June  at pm at the St Magnus Centre, where with him, many of the descendants will participate. He’ll also talk at Stromness Academy on Monday June , and at Kirkwall Grammar School that afternoon. He will also sign copies of From Scuttle to Salvage at The Orcadian Bookshop on June , from am to pm.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

No less a figure than Vernon Bogdanor dismissed the prospects of regional devolution or an English parliament in his latest book, preferring more of the same piecemeal municipal efforts that have created ‘metro mayors’ in Manchester and Liverpool.This despite the truth apparent to anyone who looks at the UK’s constitution: the English are born free, but everywhere they are in chains. The  Brexit referendum and everything that’s followed proves there is a growing English political identity, but no specic representation to express it. : Cross-party trio seek constitutional reform to keep Scotland in unionOf course, England and English concerns dominate the UK parliament and the machinery of Westminster government, which presents its own problems. David Cameron’s clumsy, ill-timed attempt to answer the West Lothian question, English Votes for English Laws, is unloved by everyone and has only put the Union at greater risk.The status quo can only endure with continued English indference about how disenfranchised it is.

The Conservative Party has gone missing before, staying out long past its curfew before dragging itself home days later in a sorry state. This time, though, it looks like it might run away for good.Theresa May’s premiership began with a repudiation of David Cameron’s legacy, both in rhetoric and personnel. She chucked out most of his cabinet, and told the UK’s biggest commercial interests they were harbouring “citizens of nowhere”.Cameron’s project was dressed in social liberalism, on issues like the environment and gay marriage, but on welfare and education reform, and crucially in fiscal policy, it was faithful to core conservative values.May borrowed the outfit with her talk of solving burning injustices, but the shop mannequin that filled it was carried out to skip in the alley.In its place, we were promised a revival of reforming liberal conservatism in the mould of Joseph Chamberlain, delivered by May’s top adviser Nick Timothy.It always seemed unlikely, against the economic and political backdrop of Brexit, and after the  election, those ambitions left Downing Street with Timothy.Even though I’m writing this before the final two candidates for the Tory leadership are confirmed, we know the next Prime Minister is going to be someone who,necessary, is willing to take the UK out of the EU without a Brexit deal, despite the risk that poses to the Union and the economy.We also know the next Prime Minister is likely to pursue deep tax cuts. Boris Johnson, the prohibitive favourite to step into  Downing Street in a month’s time, says it’s his “ambition” to cut tax for higher earners on between £, and £,.: Brexit zealots are happy to throw ‘uppity Jocks’ out of UK – Kenny MacAskillHe has also explicitly rejected the appeal from the current Chancellor to keep to the current policy of continuing to reduce the deficit.Other than Rory Stewart, every candidate has stood on a  of both offering tax giveaways and promising to turn on the spending taps, calculating that the disaffection expressed in votes since  can be blamed on austerity, and at least partially fixable with cash.They are probably right. But it isn’t particularly conservative – and Brexit can be called many things, but it certainly isn’t a One Nation pursuit.Privately, many of Johnson’s supporters admit that they’ve been driven to him out of fear of Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party. They ask for him to be given a chance to govern. He listens to advice, they say, and has the personality to hold his party and the country together. They’re probably going to get the chance to test those pleadings out.Anyway, are there even any small-c conservatives left out there  Are they voting for the Brexit Party or the Tories – and which of the two requires them to hold their noses tighter  It isn’t clear. When even George Osborne as editor of the London Evening Standard is willing to back Johnson, as he did yesterday, you have to question whether the traditional framing of conservatism works anymore.: Brexit: Jeremy Corbyn takes step towards backing second voteBut given the country is probably going to get a Tory Prime Minister reported to have said “f*** business” in response to the concerns of the UK’s biggest employers and taxpayers, whoever and wherever they are, those sorts of conservatives can’t be under the illusion that their values are setting the political agenda.Jeremy Corbyn’s rise and the collapse of the Liberal Democrats made it easy to argue that the centre-left has been hollowed out since the European elections it looks more like the centre-right has gone missing, lured away by the thrill of nationalism.Analysis of the European election results shows the Conservatives have as much,not more to fear from the Liberal Democrats than the Brexit Party. The Lib Dems have a party machinery and a base across the south of England to build on, while parties led by Nigel Farage have won just one Westminster seat in general elections.Whoever it is that leads the Tories back home again, they may find that the electorate has changed the locks.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc scotland figures branded deplorable after 21 shows have no viewers at all","story":" shows recorded no audience some days, according to the Mail on Sunday.The viewing figures prompted media watchers to brand the channel a waste of taxpayer money.But a BBC spokesperson said: \"Its not unusual for digital channels outwith the main five to occasionally record zero audiences.\"According to the Sunday newspaper report, on one particularly quiet day last month the new channel had an average audience of only , people.The figures were gathered from The British Audiences Research Boardbetween February  and June  this year.

OK, yes it isspeeding.Surely the issue is appropriate speed # like doing  mph when there are pedestrians or next to schools, built up areas, where there is a limit etc Kat is so right to complain about dangerous driving.It has become an unwanted fad amongst young menwho must be so stupid and so bored that they are prepared to risk le and limbto get their kicks. My belief is that the pointless and brainless cavortings of silly,silly moronic types on programmes like Top Gear are partly to blame.In addition , street racing in cities like London take place late at night driving people to distraction.Police keep an eye on proceedings but it still goes on. Not easy for police cars to safely keep up with idiots in illegally souped up cars travelling , as reported, at  mph.I understand people that have the need for speed. But keep in mind, just because you think you#re a confident driver, that you are safe because you can drive. Doesn#t mean you#re safe. Just recently there was a news report about a drunk driver going off the road and hitting another car. If you#re going at a high speed and that thing comes at you, what can you do  Swerve  There#s a good chance you#re dead, in hospital or best case scenario, your car is totalled.Just because you think you#re a competent driver, doesn#t mean everyone  is. Drive safe.Of course, accidents do happen even to competent,confident, safe drivers but there are people who cast aside such standards in favour of dangerous, unlawful behaviour.These are the ones who need to be severely apprehended.Try to be less pedantic when reading comments.Johan, youseemto have missed the point of Kat’s letter.Nobody has said that overtaking is illegal or wrong but It was estimated that the Audi was travelling at around  to  mph. An offence.In addition , about six or more cars were overtaken in one fell swoop.Not advisable by any stretch of the imagination. Suppose there had been a need to suddenly pull in due to an unforeseen hazard.Something would have had to give , possibly causingan accident.My father used to say to me when I was learning to drive “ always drive asother drivers are stupid”.In short, drive defensively NOT offensively.It seems to me that the Audi driver falls into the stupid category.Better to be ten minutes late in this world than fty years too early in the next.Have you seen this stretch of road  It is the only place in Shetland where there is a lane for overtaking # that is two lanes going up a hill.Very often you are overtaking quite a few things even at  mph going up because of slow things and other cars not overtaking.Unless she actually had a speed gun she cannot judge the speed of things. I regularly see traffic pouring down Herrislea hill and I know that although it looks fast, some of them are actually sticking to the  mph limit.I maintain that it’s better to be safe than sorry.Ease off and keep the undertaker waiting !!

Even England has some pretty steep examples in the Lake District.The sharpest inclines I’ve experienced in Shetlandare on Foula.I doubt that quad bikes would be much use on the hills though I have seenthem being driven on the low level road.It would be interesting to gauge why people bought a certain model of vehicle in proportion to its top speed, and whether or not this was a deciding factor  The power of an engine could be compared as well  How often would the said person go well over the speed limit just to test the engine or impress a passenger in the vehicle with them regardless of any safety  If a vehicle can do  # mph, why would this be allowed  Why would there not be a limiter to say mph installed If the law allows such vehicles to be sold, why would this be the case Good questionI think more and more there will be speed limiters on cars and insurance companies and Companies already want these.Johan,The EU has already sorted this one for us.Thanks MHJ.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you are interested in adopting a dog please get in touch with the team at Dogs Trust Ballymena on  or visit www.dogstrust.org.uk our-centres ballymenaAbandoned - SallyCouncil defends warning householder they could face hefty fine over unauthorised Irish language street sign Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"try catch "},{"url":null,"title":"this is how many points you ll get on your licence for these driving offences","story":"Drivers who accumulate  or more penalty points from motoring offences within a three-year period can face a ban from driving for up to six months, while six or more penalty points within two years of passing your driving test can lead to a license withdrawal and a re-test requirement.

As a result of its strategic importance both sides concentrated some of their best armoured regiments and equipment in this area. The Guards Armoured Brigade comprised of three tank battalions and had been set up and trained in England. The three battalions were the nd Battalion of the Grenadier Guards, the st Battalion of the Coldstream Guards and the nd Battalion of the Irish Guards. The Irish Guards were recruited from Northern Ireland and the nd Battalion contained men from the Province. You can see it in the tank commanders names. We have Agnew, Brennan, Carson, Connolly, Healy, Harbinson, Mahoney, McCorkell, McGuire, McHugh and Robinson amongst others.The nd Battalion Irish Guards was equipped with American Sherman tanks. These were  ton Medium tanks and mainly equipped with a  mm gun, a useful weapon against infantry but not entirely satisfactory against tanks. The battalion was organised into sub units. There were three squadrons in the battalion, each composed of four troops and each troop had four tanks. The Irish Guards named their tanks after towns and the nd Squadron named theirs with B’s. So we have Ballina, Bangor, Bantry, Belfast, Benbane and Ballynahinch. We also have Ballyraggett and BallymenaBallymena was a special Sherman tank. Ballymena did not have the standard  mm gun. The inconvenient truth for the Allied tank crews was that their tanks were not as good as the best of German ones. A German Tiger tank, for example could destroy a Sherman tank at a distance of over a mile. A Sherman on the other hand would be lucky to harm a Tiger at  yards.  The Britsh crews themselves had already concluded that a Sherman tank was not considered as safe a location as many would have been believed. Hence they covered the front with extra metal tracks and the propensity of the Sherman to do a “Ronson”, that is light up, encouraged the crew to get out very quickly.To deal with the stronger German tanks the Allies devised a way of mounting a bigger gun on some of the Shermans. This new gun was so big it meant redesigning the tank and reducing the size of the crew. These Shermans, now armed with a  pounder gun, which referred to the weight of the shell it fired, were nicknamed FireflyThe Irish Guards arrived in Normandy  days after the initial D Day landings. Caen had still not been completely captured so the Irish Guards eere given a mission to help bypass the city of Caen by gaining ground to the east of the city and drive towards the village of Cagny. This was Operation Goodwood, named after the racecourse in England.Undercover of darkness on the night of th July, Ballymena and the other tanks moved over the River Orne on newly constructed bridges and prepared for battle.The smoke, noise and movement of the battlefield created chaos. Units became mixed up and both sides sometimes got lost. This led to one of the most famous incidents of the battle. By the middle of the afternoon of July th the Irish Guard’s assault is under fire, stalled and mud bound outside the village of Cagny. Lt John Gorman of B Squadron th troop commanding a mm armed Sherman called “Ballyraggett” gets slightly ahead of his comrades and spots a German King Tiger at about yrs. Knowing his gun could do little damage to the King Tiger, Lt Gorman chose a dramatic course of action. He had previously briefed his crew Gunner Albert Scholes, Driver James BaronRadio operator Agnew, and told themhe got the chance they would adopt “Navy tactics”. He instructed Baron to drive at full speed ahead and prepare to ram the German tank. Firing a high explosive shell at close range stunned the inexperienced German crew but had little impact on the tank. However, the high speed collision effectively immobilized both tanks. The Sherman and the King Tiger were abandoned and their crews hid in the fields.Lt Gorman realising the King Tiger was still a viable threat ran towards the nearest Sherman Firefly, in the knowledge only a  pounder gun on the Firefly could do any meaningful damage. This was Ballymena. Some of Ballymena’s crew were already either dead or injured but Gorman jumped in and directed fire on the abandoned King Tiger.  The fighting continued for a while but eventually Gorman was able to rescue his own and other crews and get back to safety.For his exploits Gorman - later Sir John - was awarded the Military Cross. Editor’s note: Sir John, who died aged  in May , was a Northern Irish Roman Catholic Unionist with an unflinching sense of service.After the war he joined the Royal Ulster Constabulary before becoming a senior manager with British Overseas Airways Corporation, then head of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Finally he was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly as the sole Roman Catholic member of the Ulster Unionist Party, and served as Deputy Speaker until the Assemblys suspension in . He was a frequent visitor to Ballymena during his time with the NIHE and he never failed tomention that he had married a Ballymena woman, Norah Caruth.

At the time it was taken in the iconic Flamingo Ballroom, they were members of local rock’n’blues band, Tailor.The band was formed in the early s by Tucker McIlwee and John Tennant.“Other band members who played with Tailor over the years were Ronnie McAuley, Hubert Dunlop and Ricky Maybin, Henry McQuillan, Dave Moore Trevor Erwin andGerry McNeely. We were transported to and from the gigs by Brian Surgenor, ” says John.“Our first gig was at a place called Betty Staffs in Belfast but we travelled throughout Ireland playing most of the towns on the circuit.“Amazingly, we had never played in Ballymena until Sammy Barr of the Flamingo approached our manager to offer a booking.”It transpired that Tailor were playing on the same bill as Rory Gallagher. As you would expect, the group were excited but, in their own words, ‘not overwhelmed.’John remembers: “We met with Rory and his band during set up,. Rory was a very down to earth guy. We discussed what songs we were going to play as we were going to have a one hour set. The Flamingo was full to the brim, the crowd were electric and Tailor recieved a tremendous welcome.“Following the gig we met with Rory for the photo call. The rest is history. Tailor continued to travel theand breadth of Ireland entertaining the young and not so young ravers until the group members went their seperate ways after six years of traveling on the road.”After years of inaction the group reformed to play two gigs for Cancer research, The Countryman Inn and the Telecom Club were filled to capacity for the night of nostalgia and entertainment. pound was raised for charity.And John ponders: “Will the group do it again  Watch this space!”Rory Gallagherwas an Irish blues and rock multi-instrumentalist,songwriter, and producer.Born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, and brought up in Cork, Gallagher recorded solo albums throughout the s and s, after forming the band Taste during the late s. His albums have sold over  million copies worldwide.Gallagher received a liver transplant in , but died of complications later that year in London at the age of .He began playing after school with Irish showbands, while still in his early teens. Having completed a musical apprenticeship and influenced by the increasing popularity of beat groups during the early s, Gallagher formed The Taste, which was later renamed simply, Taste, a blues rock and RB power trio, in .Performing extensively in the UK, the group played regularly at the Marquee Club, supporting both Cream at their Royal Albert Hall farewell concert, and the blues supergroup Blind Faith on a tour of North America.After the break-up of Taste, Gallagher toured under his own name. The s were Gallaghers most prolic period. He produced ten albums in that decade, including two live albums, Live in Europe and Irish Tour . November  saw the release of the album Deuce. In the same year he was voted Melody Makers International Top Guitarist of the Year, ahead of Eric Clapton. Though he sold over thirty million albums worldwide, it was his marathon live performances that won him greatest acclaim. He is documented in Irish Tour , a film directed by Tony Palmer.During the heightened periods of political unrest in Northern Ireland, as other artists were warned not to tour, Gallagher was resolute about touring Ireland at least once a year during his career, winning him the dedication of thousands of fans, and in the process, becoming a role model for other aspiring young Irish musicians.

Kenneth stands aghast as chants of ‘Greysteel seven, Ireland nil’ rain down from the stands as the match kicks off.Shell-shocked following the match and all that went on during those fraught  minutes, Kenneth brings Ernie home and begins to question what could be his inevitable pathhe doesn’t start making some changes.Lead actor Matthew Forsythe has a total of  roles to portray in this fast, furious and incredibly demanding one-man show. It’s no easy task but each character is brought to le vividly through his tone, his stance and his voice. Even a simple fold of the arms can work wonders, whether’s it’s Kenneth’s ‘keeping up with the Jones’ snooty we Deborah, his boss Gerry, or Wee Ernie, the bitter and wheezing father-in-law.Chris Hunter’s set design is in a sense the only other character beside Kenneth and that too is brought imaginatively and effectively to le. Astro turf gives us our pitch, but it’s the innovative scattering of cardboard boxes that turn into Kenneth’s car, his desk, chair – even the soaring New York skyline – which work to greatest effect. A particularly effective ploy is the backdrop of a distorted mirror showing us, the audience, and inviting us to join Kenneth on his journey of reflection.The play comes  years after the curtain first came up in Dubblejoint’s Whiterock theatre space. It remains as dramatic, funny, poignant, worrying and challenging as it was when it burst into our consciousness all those years ago. The question is, how much has changed outside the theatre A Night in November runs at the Lyric Theatre until June  and will then go on tour.

Parishioners and well-wishers packed into Corpus Christi Church for am Mass as the Springhill congregation came together to give thanks for Fr Des’ dedicated service to the West Belfast community.Parish Priest of Corpus Christi Fr Paddy McCafferty, who celebrated the special service, praised Fr Des’ “immense strength and dedication” within and to the community and said the depths of gratitude felt towards him are “immeasurable.” “Fr Des is a champion of the people, Fr Des saw was needed to be done and did it, he is a man without equal.”“Fr Des co-ordinated, instigated and educated the community. I’m almost lost for words when it comes to describing him. I was looking up the meaning of the word ‘platinum’, it means hard wearing, hard, Fr Des was rock hard in his work for the community. What would people have done without him ”On celebrating his Platinum Jubilee Fr Des said: “I never thought I would get this far.“There were more than  priests ordained the same day as I was, most of them are gone from this world, a mere handful of us laughing about which of us will reach the th birthday first.“What I want to do now, most of all is to thank God for allowing me to live among such good family, friends and neighbours during those years. You taught me what le means you taught me that especially during the bad, sad times. I believe we are seeing the beginning of a renewed Ireland, a renewed Christianity, a renewed city of Belfast – and we are privileged to live in one of the most beautul parts of the city – between the beautul mountain that is full of surprises like the feast of bluebells in the beginning of summer to the snow topped hills in winter, between the sweeping magnicent valley of the Lough and the Lagan,” he said. “This must surely be one of the most beautul places for a city to be in.”Fr Des continued: “This is where I learned the best lessons about le and I am grateful to family, friends, neighbours who taught me and even had great patience when I learned so slowly. I learned how good people show their dignity even during the hardest of times, show it most of all during the hard times. “So I am grateful to God for being here, grateful, to all whom I have had the privilege of being family and neighbour to. And very, very hopeful for the future.“Coming out of the worst of times we could now be facing into the best of times. May God and good people make it so. Father Paddy, like our friend Father Aiden, you are with us all at the beginning of a newly awakened Church and a people refreshed by what they have suffered and achieved together. We have good reason to be thankful for that and for each other.#"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"from detroit to north belfast how a big name does a big job","story":"TO say the name Kronk Boxing Gym is iconic in the sport would be an understatement. Located in Detroit and once led by trainer Emanuel Steward, the name is a household word in the sport of boxing.But North Belfast has its a Kronk Boxing Gym, located in the Duncairn Centre on Duncairn Avenue.Formed as Belfast ABC over  years ago by Bobby McAllister, one of the best coaches in Ireland at the time, the club has come a long way since.In December , former secretary of the gym, Damien McCann, played a pivotal role in Limerick boxer Andy Lee turning pro. He then negotiated a lucrative financial management agreement for Lee to turn professional with Emanuel Steward from the world renowned Detroit Kronk Boxing GymLee was Ireland’s rising amateur boxing star and when he beat USA champion, Jesus Gonzales in the semi-finals of the World Junior Championship, a new relationship between Steward and Kronk in Detroit was born with Belfast ABC gym, hence its name today, Kronk ABC Belfast.Past professional coach Tony Dunlop has been a key figure throughout the history of Kronk ABC Belfast and spoke about the club’s illustrious time.“This place started over  years ago when Bobby McAllister walked past the building which was derelict at the time and thought it would be perfect place for a boxing gym,” he explained.“He asked people in the community who were very positive and said that it would be great for young people in the area.“After a period of time, a lot of kids came through the doors. Ryan Burnettt and Paddy Barnes both started off here.“Burnett was groomed from his early days in here to become a superstar. He left here at  fights undefeated and was one of the best in the world at just  years old.“The turning point I suppose was when Emanuel Steward from Kronk gym in Detroit, which is the best gym in the history of boxing, got in touch.“He saw some of the work we were doing and Belfast Kronk Boxing Gym was born –the rest is history as they say.“We have continued to bring through a lot of champions including professionals James Tennyson and Daniel McShane.“Tommy McCarthy is also here now fighting professional.”Today, the club is going from strength to strength under the stewardship of a new breed of coaches in the shape of Paddy Saunders and Martin McCullough.The duo have embarked on a new programme of coaching young people from North Belfast with the aim of using boxing to their benefit.Tony added: “Paddy Saunders and Martin McCullough are both fantastic coaches. They are flying the flag for Belfast Kronk Gym today.“They have started off a new programme with the youth of the area. They are both giving it a million per cent. I’ve never seen two coaches work as hard. Kronk Gym could not be in better hands.”Classes for - to -year-olds take place every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from .pm to .pm with classes for  years and older from .pm to pm on the same days.Paddy Saunders explained: “Many of the kids have behavioural problems and some suffer from autism.“These classes are an outlet and something to focus and concentrate on.“It is not all about boxing but something for them to do. They don’t miss classes.“If we get a few champions out of it, then brilliant, but it is for the kids.“Most boxing clubs don’t take kids at eight years old, but we do.“All the kids start off exercising and running about the big hall before they come into the boxing gym itself.“They are putting their energy into something positive instead of being on the street and engaging in vandalism and anti-social behaviour. I believe there is a bright future for boxing in North Belfast. We have a top-class facility and there are a lot of good kids in here.”To find out more about the club and to get involved, check out the new Kronk ABC Belfast Facebook page."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"local mla gets brexit safety alert","story":"POLICE have delivered an extraordinary advice list to the West Belfast home of a Sinn Féin MLA suggesting ways in which he can improve his and his family’s personal security post-Brexit.The document has already been delivered to the homes of all  MPs across the United Kingdom, but officers who called to the home of Máirtín Ó Muilleoir said they are widening distribution of the document to take in Brexit spokespersons of parties in the north. The leaflet – headlined ‘When It Goes Too Far’ – outlines steps that politicians should takethey are targeted by extremists in any wave of public unrest that may break out post-October , the latest deadline for the UK leaving the EU.The document – which Mr Ó Muilleoir yesterday branded “Brexit bollox – has been compiled by a number of UK agencies: the National Police Chiefs’ Council, the Crown Prosecution Service, the College of Policing and the Electoral Commission. Despite its wide experience in dealing with public unrest, the PSNI has not been involved in drawing up the guidelines. But local police officers have been tasked with distributing it to MLAs closely connected to the Brexit issue.To the fore in the security advice is what Mr Ó Muilleoir and his family should do in the event of being targeted with a hazardous substance. Police advice is to:• Leave the house and seek fresh air.• Treat itchy or painful skin with water.• Remove outer clothing – but not by pulling it over the head.• Remove any substance that may contact clothing or skin by using a dry absorbent material or brushing it off.Advice is also included on what signs may signal the presence of hazardous substances in the home.The leaflet also advises politicians not to engage with iniduals who may be “stalking harassing” them, either online or offline. It urges them to seek further advice on personal safety and building security from their local police force and to conduct a review of what personal information about them is available online.The leaflet explains that the advice is being forwarded for politicians to consultthey are subjected post-Brexit to “unacceptable levels of harassment and intimidation”. It continues: “In some cases, these behaviours and actions have reached the criminal threshold. The worst examples have led to violence and injury.”The most serious example of Brexit-inspired violence was the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox in June  in West Yorkshire by a gun- and kne-wieldingman holding extreme pro-Britain views. Mr Ó Muilleor said: “It seems preposterous to me that the PSNI is promoting Brexit security advice compiled at the behest of a UK government which for three years has shown itself so thoroughly inept in its handling of the issue. There’s little in this that isn’t already known to most people and no reason why it couldn’t have been emailed to me rather than dispatching a police patrol. There are Catholic families in my South Belfast constituency living under the jackboot of the UVF and the flegger bully-boys. The PSNI would be better advised to protect those folk rather than wasting their time and my time with this Brexit bollox.”"},{"url":null,"title":"9000 in northern ireland apply to secure status after","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

them demonstrated.“That hasn’t been done yet and I don’t see that being done this side of October  which is why we certainly can’t accept the deletion of the backstop.”He added: “For us, a deal without a backstop is effectively no deal because it means that there is no legal guarantee we won’t have a hard border, there is no operable mechanism by which we can avoid a hard border, it would just be a case of trying to pull it off, which I don’t think really is much of a solution.”Mr Varadkar said EU leaders had reaffirmed that the Withdrawal Agreement was not open for renegotiation and they agreed that negotiations would only take place between the UK and the EU.But he said the Irish government would have an “obligation” to protect the single market in the event of a no-deal outcome.“If there is a no-deal Brexit at the end of October, Ireland will be under an obligation to protect the single market, it’s our single market, our economy and our jobs are dependent on it,” he said.“We will have to make sure that Ireland doesn’t become the back door to the European single market.”He added that the only way he could see of being sure of avoiding a hard border was through regulatory alignment.Asked about the Tory leadership race, Mr Varadkar highlighted that both of the candidates, who remain in the running to become prime minister, had voted for the Withdrawal Agreement.He said he looked forward to holding a meeting with the new prime minister and discussing potential changes to the Political Declaration.But he reiterated that there would be “no implementation period for the UKthere is no Withdrawal Agreement and there will be no Withdrawal Agreementthere’s no backstop”."},{"url":null,"title":"22 northern ireland schools could close because

The backstop was agreed between Theresa May and the EU as an insurance policy in the event the UK and EU can not agree a trade policy and in order to maintain an open border on the island.The report highlights areas of cooperation between Northern Ireland and the Republic.Among those are an all-Ireland congenital heart disease network to ensure vulnerable children receive treatment on the island of Ireland. The report notes the network has a single surgical centre in Dublin and a specialist childrens cardiology centre in Belfast.Other areas that will be affected include major emergencies and AE services, cancer research and health promotion. In several cases this pre-dates the Belfast Agreement and membership of the EU.There is cross-border group of officials to intensy work on child protection which has been operationally since .A north south alcohol policy advisor group was set up at the request of the two respective chief medical officers to provide advice and a  for information sharing and \"joined up action\". The EU also underpins everyday services like the operation of cross-border taxis and mobile phone roaming services.Repatriation of waste, the prevention of the spread of animal disease, flood risk management, wildfire initiatives and horse racing are also listed in the study. One of the most major issues highlighted is cross-bordering policing and cooperation between An Garda Siochana and the PSNI. Both forces have expressed concern about Brexits impact on policing, including how to deal with criminals who flee across the border in the absence of the European arrest warrant system.Nineteen areas are listed as \"avoiding a hard border\" and include issues such customs and physical checks on live animals crossing the border to rules on movement of national treasures. The movement of medicine across Ireland is also listed as Northern Ireland and the Republic is currently treated as a single entity by pharmaceutical and medical device companies and will be subjected to checks unless EU regulations apply.DUP MEP Diane Dodds said the study reflects the range of formal and informal cooperation that currently occurs between north and south, adding that in several cases the cooperation pre-dates the Belfast Agreement and membership of the EU.\"It is worth remembering that in key areas like agriculture, health and education common policies are agreed formally but are implemented separately in each jurisdiction,\" the MEP said.  data-dfpadtargeting\"\" title\"The DUP’s MEP Diane Dodds \" width\"\" \"\"  \" title\"The DUP’s MEP Diane Dodds \" width\"\" \"\"  The DUP’s MEP Diane Dodds \"Far from protecting this constructive process the much lauded backstop plan would fundamentally alter it. \"This is because it would uproot the normal templates of north-south cooperation. Control of our laws would instead be granted to EU institutions and committees, indefinitely, with no role for the Northern Ireland Assembly. \"This would be bad for the institutions of the Belfast Agreement and bad for democracy.\"Mrs Dodds said maintaining cooperation in the majority of areas would be addressed by retaining the provisions of the Common Travel Area and pursuing a comprehensive agreement between the UK and EU on free trade and customs. \"In many cases, where frameworks are highly integrated the circumstances are not unique to our Province,\" she added. \"For instance the conditions required to operate both the Enterprise service between Dublin and Belfast and the Channel Tunnel will require a very similar technical agreement with Brussels. \"The answer to the question of North-South cooperation is therefore not to isolate Northern Ireland and place us in an economic straitjacket.\" However, Mrs Dodds said that \"genuine concerns\" in areas like agri-food and healthcare must be taken seriously.

This is to ensure that staff welfare is protected and that the delivery of front line services is not adversely affected.\"With overall absence levels at Northern Irelands councils at their highest in   for two consecutive years and consistently ranking as the highest in the United Kingdom, with no indication of improvement, I have decided that councils could benefit from a more detailed report in this area.\"She said the Audit Office would investigate the matter more extensively.Overall, councils are in a financially strong position and managed their finances well in  , the report continued. The £m spent providing services to the public works out at £ on average for every person here.Councils received income of £m, % of which was from district rates.As of March , councils had outstanding loans totalling £.m. In   councils paid almost £m towards the principal outstanding balance and £m in interest costs.Use of agency staff not giving value for moneySome councils are still too heavily reliant on agency staff, leading to warnings that using them is not delivering value for money.In  , total employee costs totalled £m — around % of operating expenditure — with agency staff accounting for a further % .The overall cost of agency staff has continued to increase year on year, rising by £.m last year.Most of this increase was attributed to Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, and Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council.Agency costs at seven councils either reduced or remained relatively stable. That is an improvement on the previous year, when nine councils saw agency staff costs rise.Local government auditor Pamela McCreedy said: “In   some councils continued to be dependent on agency staff to deliver local services.“I will continue to keep the costs associated with agency staff under review across all councils, and I will also focus on the types of work they perform and theof time they have been working in the council.“There is a risk that over-reliance on agency staff over an extended period of time does not provide value for money.”Severance payouts cost £m from  to Almost £m was spent on council exit packages in the last year.Councils are required to disclose the number and costs of these payments.Expenditure includes compulsory and voluntary redundancy costs, pension contributions and other departure expenses.Over the four years from   to  ,  councils have paid a total of £.m in exit packages to staff. A total of  exit packages were agreed, with  exceeding £,.Many of the payments were linked to the reform of local government, which led to the creation of  super councils in .In   councils agreed  exit packages at a cost of £.m.

The outworkings will have most impact on those councils which have a border with the Republic of Ireland.”The report also warns thatthe UK Government and EU fail to agree a withdrawal deal, there will be no transition period and councils will need to respond immediately."},{"url":null,"title":"stephen farry twoyear cap on holiday pay would have been counterproductive","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It led to the introduction of a two-year cap on backdate claims in order to stem the huge costs of the ruling.Stephen Farry was the Minister for Employment and Learning at the time and therefore responsible for public sector pay policy in Northern Ireland, however he decided not to introduce a two-year cap.In a y statement, Mr Farry said he requested his officials to draft a consultation paper about introducing a cap, but ultimately decided not to proceed after further discussions.He said the option to rush through a two-year cap did not apply to Northern Ireland, as there could have been \"potential equality implication\" and there were indications the cap was \"potentially illegal\".\"It was unlikely any consultation and subsequent draft legislation would have been cleared by the Executive and then the Assembly. In employment law matters, some political parties were resolute in never acting contrary to the views of the trade union movement,\" he said.\"At that time, a wider Employment Law Bill had been stalled due to perceived opposition from the trade union movement for many months.\"Even with a fair wind politically, it would have taken three to four months before any legislation would have been passed by the Assembly. That would then be followed by a transitionary period of six months.\"The North Down MLA explained there would have been a year-long window for claims to be made, creating an \"articial clf-edge\" and a \"stampede to lodge claims\", to the detriment of employers.\"For context, tribunal fees as a hurdle to people protecting their rights had been in force in Great Britain for several years at that time. These were declared illegal by the UK Supreme Court in . I had resisted such measures in Northern Ireland. Employment legislation in Great Britain was often rushed and not properly thought through,\" he said.\"Ultimately, it was my judgement a two-year cap on payments in Northern Ireland was counter-productive.\"He said the matter did not go before the Executive as it was decided not to proceed with a consultation.\"It is important not to jump to conclusions on the financial implications within Northern Ireland from the PSNI judgement and make extrapolations across the public sector. I understand the Head of the Civil Service and the Department of Finance are exploring all of these issues,\" he added."},{"url":null,"title":"varadkar casts doubt on alternative arrangements plan for irish border","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

mechanism from the Withdrawal Agreement unless it had been demonstrated how such arrangements would work in practice to ensure there are no customs checks on the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland .A new body of experts has been set up in the UK to look at potential alternative arrangements.Many Brexiteers believe technological solutions could replace the backstop. But Mr Varadkar said he could not see evidence of arrangements being outlined before the October  deadline for the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.If there is a no-deal Brexit at the end of October, Ireland will be under an obligation to protect the single market.Leo VaradkarThe Taoiseach made the remarks at the end of an EU summit in Brussels as European Council president Donald Tusk said Brexit would become “more exciting” than before with a change of British prime minister but that the EU’s position had not changed.Mr Varadkar said: “We can’t accept that alternative arrangements are an alternative to a backstop unless we can see what these alternative arrangements are, know how they would work and see them demonstrated.“That hasn’t been done yet and I don’t see that being done this side of October  which is why we certainly can’t accept the deletion of the backstop.”He added: “For us, a deal without a backstop is effectively no deal because it means that there is no legal guarantee we won’t have a hard border, there is no operable mechanism by which we can avoid a hard border, it would just be a case of trying to pull it off, which I don’t think really is much of a solution.”Mr Varadkar said EU leaders had reaffirmed that the Withdrawal Agreement was not open for renegotiation and they agreed that negotiations would only take place between the UK and the EU.But he said the Irish government would have an “obligation” to protect the single market in the event of a no-deal outcome.“If there is a no-deal Brexit at the end of October, Ireland will be under an obligation to protect the single market, it’s our single market, our economy and our jobs are dependent on it,” he said.“We will have to make sure that Ireland doesn’t become the back door to the European single market.”He added that the only way he could see of being sure of avoiding a hard border was through regulatory alignment.Asked about the Tory leadership race, Mr Varadkar highlighted that both of the candidates, who remain in the running to become prime minister, had voted for the Withdrawal Agreement.He said he looked forward to holding a meeting with the new prime minister and discussing potential changes to the Political Declaration.But he reiterated that there would be “no implementation period for the UKthere is no Withdrawal Agreement and there will be no Withdrawal Agreementthere’s no

Its the UK that has the border with the Republic of Ireland and its for us to come forward with a solution that would work.\"I think everyone here would agree that what we cant have is ato border infrastructure on the island of Ireland.\"Mr Hunt added that the UK needs to show that it can keep the border open. \"I think that through technology we can do that but we have to do that in a way that doesnt trap us in the customs union,\" he said.Home Secretary Sajid Javid said he was \"% committed to the Good Friday Agreement and keeping an open border\".\"In my department, Borderforce has looked at this issue and its perfectly possible to have an open border with two dferent customs arrangements on either side of the border using existing technology,\" he said - although Ms Maitlis pointed out that the existence of the technology to do so is in doubt. \"Obviously it will take time to put that in place and it will cost money. I would have a time limit on the backstop. There will have to be some sort of compromise.\"International Development Secretary Rory Stewart said that he had visited Enniskillen and Londonderry recently and argued that Mr Johnsons plans wouldnt deal with trade tarfs for farmers in border regions.Mr Johnson said that there would \"be no tarfs or quotas\" and that he wanted a \"standstill in current arrangements\" until a trade agreement was negotiated.Mr Stewart said that the Withdrawal Agreement was legally binding and would not be renegotiated before October , and accused the other candidates of not explaining how they would enact their Irish border plans.Following the answers, the questioner Mark said that there was \"a lot of fear and confusion in Northern Irelandwe come crashing out without a deal\", adding that he had been \"hoping for more\" from the candidates.The backstop aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit, but opponents have claimed it could keep the UK aligned with the EU indefinitely and create a trade border in the Irish Sea.The backstop effectively ended Theresa Mays hopes of getting her Brexit deal through Parliament and its failure hastened her departure as Prime Minister.However, the EU has said it will not renegotiate the deal, which includes the backstop.Ballots of Conservative MPs will continue over the next few days to whittle the race down to the final two candidates. The final stage of the leadership race will begin and members will then vote on the next Party leader and Prime Minister, with the result expected on July ."},{"url":null,"title":"climate activist says mp who manhandled her has not apologised directly","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

China has retaliated with tarfs on US products.Talks to resolve the dispute broke off last month. But Mr Trump and Mr Xi are scheduled to meet next week at the Group of  summit in Osaka, Japan, to get the negotiations back on track.“Adding more Chinese companies to the US bad guys list may be seen as a way to ramp up the pressure on China,” said Amanda DeBusk, a partner at Dechert LLP and the former Commerce Department assistant secretary for export enforcement.“However, the Chinese may see this as ill-timed bullying. They cannot be seen as making concessions to the United States, so this may have the effect of hurting any chances for trade agreement.”"},{"url":null,"title":"closure derry hmrc office plan move workers belfast branded ludicrous tin eared decision","story":"A Derry MLA yesterday branded as \"ludicrous\" a decision to uproot HMRC staff from Derry and move them to Belfast.SDLP MLA Mark H. Durkan said that many of the  staff at Foyle House, on the Duncreggan Road, will be made redundant as it will be \"impossible\" for them to relocate to Belfast.In  HMRC announced that the Derry tax office would close in  .It came as part of a move to reconfgure its offices into thirteen regional centres serving every nation and region in the UK, with one of these centres being located in Belfast.In July  HMRC declared that its Belfast Regional Centre would be based at Erskine House, Chichester Street, Belfast, and expected to open in late . It is on schedule to open later this year.This week, Sir Jonathan Thompson, Chief Executive and Permanent Secretary of HMRC, sent a letter to Mark H. Durkan asserting that based on current plans Foyle House will close in September , with staff moving, where possible, to the Belfast Regional Centre.There are currently around  staff in Foyle House and Mr Thompson accepted that the majority live outside reasonable daily travel to Belfast.Mark H Durkan had asked that consideration be given to the integration of HMRC workers in Derry into the Northern Ireland Civil Service.Speaking to the Derry News yesterday, he said: “The intention of HMRC to close their offices here in September  is something I have been appealing against since it was announced in November .“I had written to Head of Civil Service, David Sterling to consider the integration of Derry staff to available DAERA positions in Ballykelly. Why this obvious solution has not been given due consideration is beyond me.“And while HMRC have acknowledged a duty of care to ex-employees, the current plan to relocate  staff members to their Belfast offices is a highly impractical approachnot virtually impossible for those with families and caring responsibilities. For many the only option they have been left with is redundancy.“It is a ludicrous and tin-eared approach to remove employment opportunities, chronically lacking in the North West, and in effect to move more of our skilled workers to Belfast.“These experienced and highly competent staff would be an asset to any organisation. The inability to provide these people some peace of mind as well as affording them opportunities to apply their skills in similar roles closer to home, has been completely overlooked.”However, in his letter Mr Thompson said, “regrettably, there are no priority arrangements for redeployment of our staff into Northern Ireland Civil Servicedepartments.“The NICS is entirely separate from the Home Civil Service and, as such, HMRC staff can only apply for roles in the NICS which may be advertised externally, including those at the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in nearby Ballykelly.”Mr Thompson added that it has always been made clear that HMRC wants as many people as possible to transfer to their new location and continue their careers in Belfast.“That is why we have committed to hold one-to-one meetings between staff and managers around a year in advance of any move, to discuss inidual circumstances.“The meetings will establish who can and cannot move and what level of support will be needed to keep people working for HMRC. The one-to-ones for this office will commence in September ,” he concluded.The letter went on to say that those who decide to travel to Belfast will be given financial support in terms of travel costs and in some cases with home moves.The option of working in other government departments would also be explored.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"creggan men mixing mayweather dream las vegas boxing encounter","story":"A boxing coach and personal trainer from Creggan has spoken about an ‘amazing’ trip to Las Vegas spent in the company of many of the fight game’s legendary characters never mind his best friend who just happens to be international footballer James McClean.James McClean recently decided to celebrate turning  by inviting a few of his close friends and their partners to go on a trip to Las Vegas.

So, my coach and GB coaches suggested I give it a go this year. My shoot was what won the event.ldquoI was neck and neck with the previous British champion most of the way round.

They have also branded claims the mercury bath poses a health and safety risk as a ldquored herring and fear that replacing the existing mechanism could potentially damage the Fresnel lens.Described as a ldquoworkshop, the January meeting lasted over one hour with the official council record of the debate that ensued only amounting to a paltry two and a half lines.The Lecale Lightkeepers vehemently argued that they had a case for briefing councillors on the impact the loss of the beam would have but, surprisingly, the request was initially rejected.Instead, council officials insisted that officers from the the Commissioners of Irish Lights would be invited to future meetings of the districtrsquos respective DEA Forums to discuss the future of the lighthouse.The local authority said this was to ensure that information could be shared and that local stakeholders and communities were fully consulted on any proposals for the lighthouse in the immediate future, before any plans are finalised.Council officials also insisted that wide ranging public consultation on the future of the lighthouse would take place.Campaigners mdash who were at a complete loss to understand why they were initially refused an opportunity to meet directly with councillors over five months ago mdash have now been told they will get a chance to brief them and outline their case for the retention of the beam.The Lecale Lightkeepers have described the plan to remove the beam as ldquototally inadequate and unacceptable and are looking forward to outlining their case for its retention.They are also pleased that having heard from the Commissioners, politicians can now have face-to-face dialogue with campaigners.Campaigners have held several discussions with the Commissioners and frequently engage with the organisation as part of the bid to retain what they have described as a key facet of Lecalersquos heritage.ldquoWe welcome the opportunity to meet with councillors to demonstrate just how passionate people are about the retention of the beam, the spokeswoman declared. It is a symbol of unity in Lecale and has brought together all sides of our erse community. It must be retained.ldquoMeeting with councillors is particularly important for us. We have put together a detailed presentation on the lighthouse issue and will outline our concerns about the future of the beam which we cannot afford to lose for a whole host of reasons.The spokeswoman said that in the interests of fairness and given the sensitive nature of the beam issue, it was important that they meet with local politicians.ldquoCouncillors have had the opportunity to hear from the Commissioners and it is important that they hear what we have to say as the group representing those opposed to this controversial proposal, she continued.ldquoThe beam must be retained for future generations given that it is an intrinsic part of the maritime history and heritage of the area and is a stunning feature of the Lecale landscape.The spokeswoman added: ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council is backing the campaign to retain the sweeping beam and it is it important that councillors hear directly from campaigners. The beam must be retained we simply cannot afford to lose it from this area and see it consigned to the pages of history..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Curran steps down from government association position  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK councillor Dermot Curran is stepping down from his role as president of the Northern Ireland Local Government Association this Friday.The group is the representative body for the provincersquos  councils and Cllr Curran will leave his position at the grouprsquos annual conference which is taking place at Newcastlersquos Burrendale Hotel.The Ardglass man is Northern Irelandrsquos longest serving district councillor, having been elected to the former Down Council in , following the reorganisation of local government.He has served as NILGA president twice describing the accolade as both a ldquoprivilege and a challenge.While stepping down as the organisationrsquos president, Cllr Curran will remain a key member of the NILGA Executive.Cllr Curran mdash who was last month re-elected to Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash has been a councillor for  years and while already Northern Irelandrsquos longest serving politician, some of his council colleagues believe that he is the longest serving in the British Isles.Dedicated to public service, Cllr Curran said he has ldquothoroughly enjoyed his second term at NILGArsquos helm and looks forward to continuing his work with the organisation.He also believes that local councils will continue to play increasingly important roles in their respective areas and that an opportunity exists to unlock the potential of local government as the hub of public services.Cllr Curran said that over recent years councils had changed dramatically, as had the political, financial and legal environment in which councillors operate.He said while local authorities had more responsibilities and power than before, they were also increasingly stretched in terms of finances and resources, an issue which has been compounded since the suspension of the Assembly.ldquoThe  councils are a key element of investment and public service delivery, but they control just % of the public purse.

However, I doubt many think that it is the cradle of horse racing, but it is.We do of course have a famous racecourse, which has just hosted a festival of racing as part of the DownTime Summerfest.Some of you, dear readers, may even know that there is an earlier racecourse in Downpatrick mdash at Old Course Road. So racing has been going on for centuries in our beautul corner of the world. And we have also played a vital role in the foundation of the Sport of Kings.The breed of horse associated with modern horse racing is the thoroughbred. A mere glance is enough to tell even the casual observer that the thoroughbred does not look like other horses.When compared to a pony or carthorse, the thoroughbred is leaner, taller and sleeker. In fact, these horses are perfectly designed for racing. They have big lungs, a big heart and long, slender legs that can move swtly.They also need special care when compared with native breeds. They have thin hair coats and so need to wear rugs or live in stables in bad weather. They need special food to give them energy to race. So these features tell you that the ancestor of the modern thoroughbred came from somewhere hot mdash from the desert, in fact. The ancestor of our racehorses is from Arabia.Back in the th century, horses were bred for work and war, not pleasure. Officers prized horses that were fast to get them in and out of battle and keep them alive. By this time, the medieval charger of knights mdash the destrier mdash was out of fashion. They were too slow and cumbersome, and soldiers no longer wore heavy suits of armour.So the horse evolved through selective breeding to become fleet of foot. There were no horses faster than the Arabian, which was specially bred to become bigger and faster than its wild cousin. The armies of the Ottoman Sultan developed special studs to create this new war machine.In , one of these fine stallions, known as the Byerley Turk, found himself outside the gates of Vienna. The Ottoman Sultan wanted to capture the imperial capital of the Holy Roman Empire, an objective he failed to achieve when the Polish King John III Sobieski led the greatest cavalry charge in history to defeat the Ottoman forces.The Byerley Turk was captured and eventually brought to England, finding himself in the ownership of one Captain Byerley.His adventures were not over though. Recognising a fine animal, Captain Byerley adopted the Turk as his war horse. In  hewas called to Ireland to fight for King William and in  he fought at the Battle of the Boyne. Indeed, Captain Byerley later attributed his surviving that battle to the swtness of his favourite war horse.After the battle, the Turk was entered in a horse race mdash in Downpatrick. Of course, he went on to win that race and go on to be one of the most famous horses in history. The Flying Horse housing development to the east of Downpatrick is named after this famous race.The remarkable career of the Turk continued mdash and now we come to his ultimate destiny. He was put out to stud in Yorkshire. His pedigree was highly prize and he became the first of only three foundation sires of the modern thoroughbred breed.Genetic testing has revealed it is his DNA that is the most common in all modern racehorses. His progeny are successful right to this day including names such as Dr Devious, Ahonoora and Indian Ridge.And it all started with a fateful race in Downpatrick over  years ago. Needless to say,Downe Vets had been around then and caring for his veterinary needs, we feel he could have achieved more..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Hurlers seeking big upset at Croke Park  ","story":"DOWN senior hurlers go into Saturdayrsquos Christy Ring Cup final at Croke Park against Meath as rank outsiders.Few pundits outside the Down camp expect anything other than a comfortable win for Meath, but say that quietly in and around Ronan Sheehanrsquos new kids on the block.The Newry man, who has close connections to several Cork hurling legends, has engendered a new-found enthusiasm and confidence in his charges.His young hurlers are a real surprise packet this season and getting to the Christy Ring Cup final is a major achievement for his fledgeling side.Sheehan has invested heavily in youth and has two schoolboys in his starting .Downpatrickrsquos Tim Prenter, who plays his club hurling for Ballygalget and Ballycranrsquos Phelilm Savage are both in their final year at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and De La Salle, Downpatrick, respectively.Both lads were in the Down Schoolsrsquo side that lted the Mageean Cup earlier in the season and both hail from famous sporting families.Prenter, who also won a MacLarnon Cup medal with the Red High a few months back, is the son of former Antrim senior football defender Kieran Prenter and his grandfather Seamus Burns was a well known member of the all-conquering Belfast Celtics basketball team that swept all before them in the s and s.Savage, whose brother Liam is also in the team, is the son of former Ballycran and Ulster midfielder Gary lsquoGazarsquo Savage, who was also a noted centre half with Ballycam Celtic in the Newcastle League.There are also several other young players in the  with Portaferryrsquos Matthew Conlon, Ronan Blair, Darragh Mallon, Tom Murray, Caolan Taggart and Eoghan and Daithi Sands all in their early s.Throw in Liatroimrsquos Oisin McManus, P J Davidson and Ruairi McCrickard and Ballycranrsquos Stephen Keith, Gerard Hughes, Huw Flynn and Liam and Phelim Savage and you have the nucleus of squad that could dominate Ulster hurling for years.In addition to Prenter, Ballygalget provide the squad with, John McManus, Danny Toner, Marc Fisher and Cathal Coulter with Newry Shamrocks providing Paul Sheehan and Jordan Murphy.Helping Ronan Sheehan from the sidelines is Cork legend Diarmuid OrsquoSullivan and the Down manager believes his support has been critical in moving the side forward.ldquoDiarmuid has been doing a bit of defensive coaching for us and he has been there for all of the Christy Ring Cup games, he said.ldquoHe would know a lot of the boys from the development squads because he wouldrsquove come and done coaching sessions down through the years.

It is important to note there was a six-month transitionary period to those regulations in which claims could be made under the pre-existing regime.\"Those working in the human resources field across the public and private sector were well aware of the signicant Bear Scotland judgement.\"Throughout, my view was that employers should act on the back of that judgement to address any deficiencies in their own pay situation.\"In early , I authorised a write-around of key stakeholders to ascertain views on the introduction of a similar cap in Northern Ireland. There were mixed views on that, with business organisations supportive, but NIPSA, NIC-ICTU and the Law Centre all strongly opposed.\"I met with some key stakeholders to discuss the matter.\"The Committee for Employment and Learning was also briefed regularly on the evolving issue.\"I subsequently requested my officials draft a consultation paper regarding the potential introduction of a cap in Northern Ireland to give me options.Willie Frazer ‘is in God’s hands’ says we Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"\"That draft consultation was prepared in August , but after reflection and further discussions with officials, I ultimately decided not to proceed.\"My reasoning was as follows:\"Any steps that curtail peoplersquos rights or potential rights as employees are not to be undertaken lightly.\"In Great Britain, the two-year cap was rushed through in two weeks.\"That option did not apply in Northern Ireland, and with good reason, for example there could have been potential equality implications which must be explored.\"A potential legislative proposal such as this required a public consultation, followed by consideration of all responses, Executive approval and Committee scrutiny of any decision to act.\"There was also legal advice that unlike in Great Britain, the measure may have needed to be advanced by primary legislation here.\"Indications were also given that the two-year cap was potentially illegal.\"It was unlikely any consultation and subsequent draft legislation would have been cleared by the Executive and then the Assembly. In employment law matters, some political parties were resolute in never acting contrary to the views of the trade union movement.\"At that time, a wider Employment Law Bill had been stalled due to perceived opposition from the trade union movement for many months.\"Even with a fair wind politically, it would have taken three to four months before any legislation would have been passed by the Assembly. That would then be followed by a transitionary period of six months.\"This provides a window of almost a year in which claims could have been lodged with the Employment Tribunal with the full potential liability on backpay. We would have seen an articial clf-edge created and a stampede to lodge claims. This would be to the detriment of facilitating the space for employers to address their own liabilities to their employees through negotiated settlements.\"By way of comparison, there was a signicant upsurge in tribunal claims in Great Britain within the six-month transitionary period for the cap. A similarnot greater surge could have been anticipated in Northern Ireland.\"For context, tribunal fees as a hurdle to people protecting their rights had been in force in Great Britain for several years at that time. These were declared illegal by the UK Supreme Court in . I had resisted such measures in Northern Ireland. Employment legislation in Great Britain was often rushed and not properly thought through.\"Ultimately, it was my judgement a two-year cap on payments in Northern Ireland was counter-productive.\"Dr Farry added: \"Crucially, it is important to note the case against the PSNI in Northern Ireland was lodged in November , and indeed could have been lodged earlierrequired. Therefore, no cap in Northern Ireland could have been applied in terms of the outworkings of that particular case.\"To clary some other matters, this matter did not go the Executive. The trigger for Executive referral under the Ministerial Code would have been a decision to proceed with a consultation.\"It is important not to jump to conclusions on the financial implications within Northern Ireland from the PSNI judgement and make extrapolations across the public sector. I understand the Head of the Civil Service and the Department of Finance are exploring all of these issues.\"Furthermore, the PSNI may yet decide appeal the Court of Appeal judgement to the UK Supreme Court.\"A spokesperson for The Executive Office said: \"A number of issues have been raised on this matter and it is only right that Departments take time to consider all these issues and establish the full facts before responding.try catch  TrendingN.I. railway line reopens after tragic incidentExclusive: Joey Dunlops family issues plea forof highly sentimental items belonging to five-time

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

I will challenge other councillors to back it.Earlier on Wednesday, Cllr Gray made a statement to Vale of Glamorgan Councilrsquos Conservative group to say he was resigning.In his statement, he said he had ldquoabsolutely no issue with the manner in which Cllr Bailey was elected as the new leader of the Conservative Group,But he said he is ldquoat least partially at odds with Cllr Bailey on three issues ndash the proposed lsquoclosurersquo of Llancarfan Primary School, the Dinas Powys Bypass and the incinerator in Barry.On the Llancarfan School proposal, which would see the primary moved to a new building in Rhoose, he said: ldquoI seconded a motion to have the executive reopen the issue consultation and this was ignored by the then cabinet but now that this dficult decision has been made I fear that any attempt to articially prop up Llancarfan School will take funding away from the budgets of Penarth schools which is something I will not tolerate.Cllr Gray said heremained ldquounconvinced that the proposed bypass around Dinas Powys, linking Cardf to Barry, ldquois an issue with a large base of support in my ward, and the efforts to give it even more prominence and funding would I believe be to the detriment of the residents of my ward.Vale council has been waiting for more than a year for Welsh Government to decide whether the Barry incinerator needs to carry out an environmental impact assessment before it can operate.Cllr Gray said any efforts to ramp up the councilrsquos rhetoric on the incinerator ldquowould do a disservice to those residents who are passionate about the subject.ldquoRaising  hope for headlines is not the reason I stood for local government and I donrsquot want to mark my success by how many column inches we are able to achieve on a wedge issue, he said.       ,params: .pushHe added:ldquoThe structures around the group that Vince is proposing seemed to be geared up to act as an opposition party and not to focus on the work of delivering core services for the benefit of the most vulnerable members of our society.ldquoI donrsquot expect everyone to agree with my decision and I donrsquot take this decision lightly ndash I am sure that there will be a great number of people who have an opinion on whether I have done the right thing or not.ldquoI need to remain true to myself and my belief in acting as a positive advocate for the residents in my ward ndash the issues that get me out of bed every morning to work hard for the residents in my ward are not the way the press views me but how I can make a positive dference to peoplersquos lives. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people.

The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is a project of regional signicance and we need to be banging the drum for funding because this scheme should be the top priority for the administration. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you

The application area also stretches or borders on  Areas of Special Scientic Interest from the boundaries of Belfast Lough to the glacial peat deposits of Benburb.“We have serious concerns about the impact oil and gas exploration will have on bioersity, on intensying our reliance on carbon-heavy industry and on people and communities here. “We consider this a regionally signicant application and, as such, the decision is likely to be taken by the Department for the Economy. “It is important that the Department hears and understands the strength of opposition to these proposals,” they said calling for the restoration of an Executive.Cllr O’Hanlon said: “Where we dfered with Councillor Lavery is that he sought to form a Council view in a Council Committee when the correct prcedure is to formally bring a notion of motion to Full Council.We advised Councillor Lavery of the proper process and said we would support such a motion. “The SDLP are opposed to fracking, just as we are opposed to parties trying to form council policy in the wrong manner.“Procedures are there to protect the public and good governance and we will continue to follow those rules.”\"  \"  N.I. railway line

Looking at overall growth, all of those questioned said they expect ‘top line revenue growth over the next three years’. But just % of company bosses said they ‘expect to increase headcount in the next three years of more than %’. John Hansen, partner in charge of KPMG Northern Ireland, said: “Successful CEOs know they need their companies to be as innovative as possible and it’s clear that the right environment is being created in Northern Ireland to do just that. “Our leaders aren’t afraid to give their teams the scope to try new ideas which may have a risk of failure and that opens up a world of potential. This level of freedom will no doubt make sure that Northern Ireland companies are at the cutting edge of innovation in the years to come.” Angela McGowan, CBI director in Northern Ireland, said: “KPMG’s  Global CEO Outlook gives local business leaders some great insights into what is on the radar for chief executives across the globe and raises some important and interesting ideas around what leaders should doing to maintain competitive advantage despite the uncertainty.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glandore_web.jpg","title":"glandore the family flexible workspace on the rise","story":"Posted on Wednesday June  by Ulster Business High-end flexible office company Glandore has expanded rapidly into an all-island family business with further growth on the horizon. Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tradeniiii.jpg","title":"new northern ireland trade alliance formed","story":"Posted on Wednesday  June  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s newest trade body alliance will take its message to Westminster later this year amid the ongoing political vacuum at home and with Brexit on the horizon. Trade NI is an alliance between Hospitality Ulster, headed by Colin Neill, Manufacturing NI, Stephen Kelly, and Retail NI, Glyn Roberts, and aims to represent a wider swathe of Northern Ireland’s private sector amid the “paralysis” surrounding a lack of Executive and therefore a lack of local political voice on the UK’s exit from the EU. The group will take its message to London on September , hosting an event to once again bring together politicians, businesses, stakeholders and the media to raise awareness of the issues and challenges facing companies here. The alliance, which has been supported by the likes of Heathrow Airport, Danske Bank and Flybe, outlined its aims at its launch in the Cathedral Quarter, Belfast, to an audience of business leaders from across Northern Ireland. “Northern Ireland is facing huge economic and political challenges ahead with Brexit, no Assembly, and a rapidly changing global economy,” the group said. “Trade NI will seek to give leadership on behalf of our three sectors and provide new policy solutions to creating a modern local economy.” “The paralysis that has been created with the lack of an Assembly and Executive has developed a situation where very little has been done to address the needs of our sectors or the economy at large. “The sht of power from Stormont to Westminster means that we must press decision makers there to implement policies and make legislative changes that will help grow Northern Ireland. Our local economy and businesses have taken a back seat and we simply cannot afford that situation any longer. “Our three organisations represent most of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland. Therefore, a louder voice needs to be heard on their behalf so that they don’t suffer in the wake of the local political issues. We want a reboot of the economic policy of Northern Ireland, in order to benefit our economy and safeguard our growing business community.” “Last year we held a NI business reception with over  people that brought together the Northern Ireland Secretary of State, MPs, lords, ministers and key political influencers in Westminster to bring focus to Northern Ireland issues.” “This was a great opportunity to be able to discuss the key concerns of the business community with national political decision makers and help them understand the priorities needed for Northern Ireland, and to promote Northern Ireland as a great place in the United Kingdom to locate or start a business.” Kevin Kingston, chief executive of Danske Bank, the main sponsor of Trade NI’s forthcoming Westminster reception, said that “Northern Ireland has a strong business community and should be considered across the United Kingdom as a thriving business hub for the global market”. “The vitality of the private sector is imperative to the strength of the Northern Ireland economy. We must ensure Northern Ireland businesses are well positioned to be able to compete in the post-Brexit environment. We will continue to work alongside the Trade NI alliance and other key influencers to make sure that Northern Ireland, as a constituent part of the United Kingdom, remains a key priority at Westminster.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
