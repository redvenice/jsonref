For comparison, 38,075 per cent of tests taken on the same day last week and 6.5 per cent were positive.Meanwhile, Covid hospital admissions nearly tripled in a week, but deaths have fallen 64 per cent.But despite fears about Omicron, South Africa is still recording far fewer overall Covid cases compared to its population size than both the UK and US.Figures from the Oxford University research platform Our World in Data show South Africa has 63 cases per million people compared to 638 in the UK and 257 in the US. Cases are rising sharply in South Africa but are starting at a low base.Professor Anne von Gottberg, a clinical microbiologist at the NICD, revealed at a World Health Organization conference yesterday the variant was behind 75 per cent of cases nationally and it \u0027does look like there is a predominance of Omicron throughout the country\u0027.Five of the country\u0027s nine provinces have confirmed Omicron cases and officials expect its prevalence to be high in the remaining four areas where positive samples have not yet been sequenced. There have only been 183 confirmed cases of the strain because only a handful of positive samples are analysed for variants.The variant has been spotted in more than 20 countries worldwide and is likely to have been spreading for weeks before South Africa raised the alarm. The Netherlands detected a case one week earlier, while Nigeria found its first case in a sample taken in October.It was even in the UK before it was first spotted by scientists last week, with nine cases in Scotland on November 20, causing speculation the strain was imported from the COP 26 climate conference or a rugby game at Murrayfield Stadium against South Africa.New images of the strain\u0027s 32 mutations were released yesterday by the Covid Genomics UK Consortium (COG-UK).They show the variant\u0027s three mutations — H655Y, N679K, and P681H, located in the lower right of the image — that could help the virus sneak into the body more easily. And the graphic shows a group of mutations — K417N, S477N, Q498R, E484A and N501Y — that are thought to help Omicron dodge antibodies that usually help fight off the virus.And N501Y, which was previously seen on Alpha, Beta and Gamma, also helps the virus bind to the body\u0027s cells more easily, allowing for it to enter the body and replicate more efficiently.Meanwhile, it has 26 mutations on its spike protein — that haven\u0027t been seen in previous variants and scientists are still probing whether they will have any impact on how fast it can spread."},{"url":null,"title":"Ex Premier League referee David Elleray asked black colleague coal mine","story":"Share this articleThe whistleblower, who was present at the St George\u0027s Park conference where the comments were made with some 30 officials in attendance, is remaining anonymous over fears of retribution.But the complaint has now sparked calls for an independent investigation into the incident, the governing body\u0027s handling of it and Elleray\u0027s general conduct.The 67-year-old was arguably the most well-known referee in the country at the Premier League\u0027s inception in 1992.He went on to officiate in the top flight until 2003, also taking charge of an FA Cup final and more than 70 international matches.After retiring, he was made an MBE in 2014 for services to football, at which time he was chairman of the FA\u0027s referee committee and held advisory roles at both Uefa and Fifa.Elleray - who taught for more than 30 years at Harrow School after reading geography at Oxford, earning him a reputation for being \u0027schoolmasterly\u0027 on the pitch - also currently sits on three FA committees.He chairs the referee committee, is a National Game representative for the Football Regulatory Authority and also sits on the youth participation committee. An FA spokesperson told inews: \u0027The FA investigated inappropriate comments made by David Elleray in 2014 and found that he breached the FA Council Members\u0027 code of conduct.

The headline business activity index was 58.5 last month, a tad higher than the flash rating of 58.6 and down only slightly slightly from October’s three-month high of 59.1. The latest survey from IHS Markit and CIPS highlights another round of rapid cost inflation, driven by higher fuel prices, wages and utility bills. Prices charged by service providers also increased at the fastest rate since the survey began in July 1996. The final readings for the eurozone as a whole show that economic growth in the private sector re-accelerated last month. IHS Markit, which compiles the surveys, says that rate of expansion was sold and remained above its historical average, mainly reflecting resilience in the service sector while manufacturers were held back by severe supply shortages. However, the strongest rates of growth were seen away from the two largest euro area economies monitored by the survey, with Germany in particular recording a weak rate of growth in November. And there was a further intensification of price pressures across the bloc, with rates of output charge and input cost inflation both accelerating to fresh highs.  Countries ranked by Composite PMI, which comprises manufacturing and services:  Near-term prospects also dimmed, as a fourth wave of Covid infections saw inflows of new business fall whilst also dampening business confidence.  The headline business activity index edged up to 52.7 from 52.4 in October, a six-month low. It was the second-lowest reading since services returned to growth in May following the third wave of infections. Hotels and restaurants are particularly weak. Phil Smith, economics associate director at IHS Markit, says:  Businesses responded to higher cost burdens by raising their own selling prices in November. The rate of increase accelerated and was the strongest since June 2011.

Add in Daniel Farke’s farewell win over Brentford and the Canaries have won two and drawn two of their last four games. Everton would kill for that sort of form. Here’s Smith on the 1-1 draw with Newcastle on Wednesday: “We look hard to beat, I can’t remember Newcastle having many chances. “We’ve felt we left some points out there. With Newcastle going down to 10 men after 10 minutes, we could have been better with the ball and we felt we should have performed a lot better. It’s a solid start and we look hard to beat.” Striker Teemu Pukki netted a superb equaliser at Newcastle but Smith says others need to ease the goalscoring burden on him. “He needs help. Looking at Teemu and speaking to him you wouldn’t know he is carrying such a weight on his shoulders. He seems a real level-headed, laid-back guy who wants to work hard for the team. “He’s one who I knew was a good player but you don’t realise how good a player until you actually work with him. His work-rate, the quality of his finishing, the quality of his runs and he sets the tempo at the top for us. “I’ve been really pleased in what we’ve got. He is setting a standard for the others to follow. But we know we can’t be over-reliant on just one goalscorer in the team. We need goals from other areas. “We’ve spoken about it, that’s why the importance of set-pieces also comes into play. If we can be a little bit more creative in those areas then we will get goals from other players. “What helps is he’s had the experience of playing in the Premier League. He’s got the experience of another season in the Championship, where he’s done really well, and he understands his own body. We help him along the way.” Pukki has five goals this season but just three other Norwich players – Mathias Normann, Andrew Omobamidele and Grant Hanley – have scored in the Premier League. “We have found a good balance in our performances this season but there is no naivety, it is one loss in eight but also one win in eight so we have to change that side of things. “You would prefer to be in a situation where you have only lost one in eight, it is a good situation mentally for the players, a reminder of the good work and they know they are not far away. “Now it is about adding in the detail to win games, we have done it many times before and now it is just about delivery.” On Eddie Howe: “I am pleased to see him back. I texted him and said I hoped it goes well, although not against us obviously. “He will still be finding his best route and best mix of players. Long term money is very beneficial, but in the short term you have to find a way to get results. Eddie will know that.” On Newcastle and the January transfer window: “Most teams hang on and hang on and push the financial margins for obvious reasons because they know they only have a certain window to do the deal. “It’s very difficult to get deals done early because everyone’s marketing each other’s players and putting their own sales pitch out. It’s not only agents by the way, the clubs do it as well and before you know it it’s on the yellow line at the bottom of Sky (Sports News). “Then of course you need a player who possibly has a reason to move. Money is obvious of course, or maybe there’s a change of manager or a falling out with the current manager. “All of these things go into it and you have a very short period to sort this out. There are a lot of people looking at each other’s players, trying to align the deal and the right deals that can matter and not get into a position where you make deals that end up not mattering and can cost a lot of money. “But maybe they (Newcastle) have got enough money to make things happen because everyone has a price in football. There are clubs I know that will just go: ‘Yeah, okay we’re going to sell’. “Newcastle might have enough money, teams have done it in the past and they might be one of them. We will have to wait and see.”While Manchester United and Arsenal try and get back to where they once belonged, I have a feeling that Antonio Conte’s Spurs could be the best bets to grab fourth place. At the other end of the table, Norwich are starting to dig it after two wins and two draws in their last four. But how many matches until Newcastle finally get a win? Maybe they’ll get one after 909.

There’s also that pesky stat that Rangnick will want to eradicate sooner rather than later: United have conceded in 15 consecutive home games in all competitions. That’s their worst streak since 1959.Here’s United’s fixture list for the rest of December: Not a bad time to take the helm, it seems. United’s next six Premier League games are against teams who currently sit 11th, 19th, 12th, 9th, 20th and 18th in the table.“I had a conversation with Michael for more than an hour and tried to convince him, but he needed a break and I understand his decision,” said Rangnick. “I am more than happy to work with the current staff because I need their expertise on the current squad.”“Yesterday’s game was exciting for the fans but as the coach they are not the games you need every day. For me it is to minimise the coincidence factor and have control of the game.”Read Jamie Jackson’s full story here …  Rangnick is due to do his first United press conference at 9am this morning and it will be very interesting to see what he made of last night’s rollercoaster win over Arsenal. Cristiano Ronaldo, the man who supposedly cannot press, and therefore will not fit into his new interim manager’s system, passed 800 goals and was the biggest reason United prevailed over Mikel Arteta’s side. A season that promises a title race to saviour may now have a top-four battle to match.  Rafael Benítez is under serious pressure, Newcastle face another must-win game at home to Burnley, West Ham host Chelsea in the early game on Saturday and, of course, Rangnick takes charge of his first game against Crystal Palace on Sunday.

Health Minister Jens Spahn noted that the number of unvaccinated residents who are infected and seriously ill is much higher than their share of the overall population.Reuters report he told reporters in Berlin “If all German adults were vaccinated, we wouldn’t be in this difficult situation.” Spahn spoke a day after federal and state leaders announced tough new restrictions that largely target unvaccinated people, preventing them from entering nonessential stores, restaurants, sports and cultural venues.

Spahn, who is likely to leave office next week when Germany’s new center-left government takes office, has opposed compulsory vaccination and made clear that he would vote against the measure.The number is likely to grow as sequencing is carried out on other positive tests from party-goers. “So far 60 people have tested positive (for Covid) with PCR tests, and four with antigen tests,” the city of Oslo said in a statement. “Seventeen are probably Omicron, but that has yet to be confirmed. So far, one case is confirmed to be Omicron after sequencing,” it said. Between 100 and 120 people – all of whom were vaccinated, including one who had recently travelled to southern Africa – had gathered last Friday for a Christmas party organised by their employer. “All of them had been vaccinated, none of them had symptoms and they had all done self-tests” before attending the dinner, city health official Tine Ravlo told Agence France-Presse. “Everything was done in line with regulations and no rules were broken,” she said.School closures in India during the pandemic have left their mark on more than the children who have seen delays to their learning. In one Kashmiri village the impact has been catastrophic on employment. Pick up a pencil anywhere across India and it is likely to come from the poplar trees of Ukhoo. Before Covid, more than 2,500 people worked in the village’s 17 pencil factories and the industry supported about 250 families. But, after nearly two years of school closures and a dramatic drop in demand for the village’s products, factory owners reduced their workforce by more than half. Workers were dismissed without pay, while many of those who kept their jobs had migrated from other parts of India, and were cheaper to employ. Now the village and its workforce are waiting eagerly for the market to revive. Rajesh Kumar, 26, from Bihar, has worked in Ukhoo for seven years. Like other migrant workers, he lives in a room on the factory premises and works 10- to 12-hour shifts. During lockdown last year, the factory owner provided food and accommodation when production shutdown for about three months. He is one of the luckier ones to be back working now.

But scientists and health officials said they had seen increasing hospital admissions in children under five, along with higher positivity rates among children aged 10-14. Wassila Jassat, from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases, said: “We’ve seen quite a sharp increase across all age groups, particularly in the under fives,” referring to hospitalisations. “The incidence in those under-fives is now second-highest, and second only to the incidence in those over 60,” she told a news conference. Scientists cited several possible reasons. One is that children under 12 are not yet eligible for vaccines in South Africa. Doctors have reported anecdotally that both children and parents testing positive have not been vaccinated, she said. NICD’s head of public health Michelle Groome said the virus was spreading faster than at any point in the pandemic in Gauteng, the province where Johannesburg and the capital Pretoria are located. “Preliminary data suggests Omicron is more transmissible and has some immune evasion,” she said.The country of 5.5 million has 3,404 people hospitalised with the illness, including 630 in intensive care. Reuters notes that Slovakia has one of European Union’s lowest rates of vaccination uptake. Here’s an updated map showing the latest caseload rates in Europe. “Given the fast pace of vaccination in India and high exposure to Delta variant … the severity of the disease is anticipated to be low,” the ministry said in a statement. “However, scientific evidence is still evolving.” Both of India’s first two Omicron patients, reported on Thursday, showed mild symptoms, the ministry added. But concern over the prospect of a third wave of infections has grown after the variant was found in the southern state of Karnataka, in one person with no recent travel history. Krishna N Das and Anuron Kumar Mitra report for Reuters that the ministry told parliament its immunisation experts were weighing the need for booster doses, after many lawmakers demanded a third shot for healthcare workers and the vulnerable. It added that discussions on vaccinating the 145 million children aged between 12 and 17 were under way. The nation’s active caseload currently stands at 99,976 – the lowest since March 2020.Approximately 50 mine workers were stood down without pay last month after they were told they would be required to have had at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine to enter the work site after 9 November, and that they would need to be fully vaccinated by 31 January next year.

The EPA report emphasises a necessity ‘to shift the focus to designing out waste and promoting reuse and recycling’. File photograph Moya NolanThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has highlighted “worrying trends” on Irish waste, with volumes increasing at the same time as a marked decline in recycling and an overreliance on incineration.Its latest report on volumes, issued on Friday, confirms key waste streams are trending in the wrong direction, coinciding with sustained economic growth. This will make it difficult to adhere to demanding European Union requirements over the coming decade, warns the EPA.Systemic change is needed across all economic sectors “to shift the focus to designing out waste and promoting reuse and recycling”, it adds.The share of municipal waste sent for incineration – with some energy generation – is up from 4 per cent in 2009 to 46 per cent in 2019, the EPA confirms.Ireland’s recycling rate for municipal waste fell from 41 per cent in 2016 to 37 per cent in 2019, while the recycling rate for packaging waste has declined from 70 per cent in 2013 to 62 per cent in 2019.“The trends show that Ireland is facing a widening gap to meet ambitious new EU recycling targets from 2025 onwards,” warns the national waste statistics summary report for 2019.Waste generation in Ireland increased significantly in 2019 with municipal waste up by 6 per cent to 3.1 million tonnes, packaging waste increased by 11 per cent to 1.1 million tonnes and hazardous waste rose by 10 per cent to 0.6 million tonnes.Director of the EPA’s office of environmental sustainability Sharon Finegan said: “A circular economy is one that is based on less waste and more reuse of materials these trends show Ireland is going in the wrong direction. Our rising levels of waste are unsustainable and need to stop.“Systemic change is needed across all economic sectors to shift the focus to designing out waste and promoting reuse and recycling.”Over the past decade in Ireland there have been dramatic changes in waste management. Only 15 per cent of municipal waste was landfilled in 2019 compared with 61 per cent a decade earlier. There has been a significant increase in the share of municipal waste sent for incineration with energy recovery over the same period, from 4 per cent in 2009 to 46 per cent in 2019.Ireland’s recycling rates for municipal and packaging waste have been in gradual decline for several years, as efforts to improve recycling have been outstripped by the growth in waste being generated and the amount being sent for energy recovery.Municipal wasteThe share of plastic packaging waste sent for incineration with energy recovery increased from 64 per cent in 2018 to 69 per cent in 2019 2½ times more plastic packaging waste was disposed of in this way than was recycled (221,000 tonnes versus 89,000 tonnes).The recycling rate for municipal waste has fallen from 41 per cent in 2016 to 37 per cent in 2019, while the recycling rate for packaging waste has declined from 70 per cent in 2013 to 62 per cent in 2019. The trends show Ireland is facing a widening gap to meet ambitious new EU recycling targets from 2025 onwards.EPA senior scientist Dr Tara Higgins said Ireland’s declining recycling rates were a significant cause for concern. But she acknowledged “measures needed to increase recycling and close the gap to new EU recycling targets” were introduced recently.These include: allowing soft plastics such as films and wraps into recycling bins continued expansion of brown bin services to households new requirements for all packaging to be reusable or recyclable by 2030 and a levy on waste recovery.The EPA estimates Ireland generated 1.1 million tonnes of food waste in 2019 up from 1.05 million tonnes generated in 2018 – food waste is responsible for up to 10 per cent of human-induced carbon emissions.About half of Ireland’s food waste is estimated to come from the processing and manufacturing sector, with the remainder arising from households (23 per cent) and the commercial sector including restaurantsfood service and retaildistribution (32 per cent). This excludes food waste arising at the primary production stage, for which data is unavailable.Ireland continues to have some significant waste infrastructure deficits and relies on export for several key waste streams, including municipal, packaging and hazardous waste, according to the EPA.This points, it concludes, to the need for expansion of Ireland’s waste treatment and recycling capacity to extract maximum value from waste materials and reduce emissions associated with transporting waste over long distances."},{"url":null,"title":"just how alarming is the covid variant and where did it come from","story":"A medical worker extracts a test specimen  at San Francisco International Airport, California, on Thursday. Photograph: David Paul MorrisBloombergThe emergence of a new variant of Covid-19 late last month sent public health officials, governments and people all over the world into a spin.Fear and uncertainty were suddenly back in a big way. Travel restrictions were imposed on at least seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa, new rules on pre-departure testing were hastily drawn up for people coming into Ireland while some countries shut their boarders to all overseas visitors entirely.But what was behind all the panic? Almost as soon as the scientific community became aware of the latest variant – now known as Omicron – the alarm bells started ringing loudly.The reason the variant was of such concern was due to the huge number of mutations it has compared to previous variants.While the Delta variant had 18 mutations when compared to the original virus, Omnicron had 50 with many of them found in the spike protein – the part the virus uses to infect cells.But what are these mutations? What causes them, and what impact might they have on the trajectory of Covid 19 in the months ahead?Gerald Barry is a virologist and assistant professor at UCD and he unravels the mysteries of the virus variants and the impact they might have for In The News.You can listen to the podcast here:Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"nphet proposes cap on households mixing over christmas period","story":"The National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) has recommended that no more than four households should mix over the Christmas period.

Nphet met on Thursday to consider advice for the Government on the latest pandemic situation, at a time when Covid-19 case numbers have stabilised at a high level and further information on the Omicron variant is being awaited. It last night sent a letter to Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly which recommends a maximum of six people at a table in bars and restaurants, the closure of nightclubs and limits on households mixing until January 9th. The recommendations are to be discussed by Ministers at a Cabinet meeting on Friday afternoon. Earlier, Minister for Justice Helen McEntee said the Government would move “as quickly as it can” to examine the latest recommendations from Nphet and to decide if further restrictions would be introduced. She said Ministers would need to be given time to “look at this advice and take it on board”. During an interview on RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland, Ms McEntee said the Government had to ensure it was clear about about what it would do in terms of restrictions and why before anything was announced.“Of course if there are impacts on businesses at any stage of this...I hope people would agree that we haven’t left people wanting,” she said. “We have always responded where business has needed additional income. Where iniduals have lost their jobs. We have always provided that support.

The Restaurants Association of Ireland (RAI) said the meeting, which heard calls for a comprehensive support package for the sector, was “positive and constructive”. “While no decision was made at the meeting, Government has confirmed that hospitality businesses will be supported over the next number weeks due to recognition that business has substantially declined,” RAI chief executive Adrian Cummins said, adding that hospitality representatives had asked the Government to establish a long-term plan for the viability of the sector.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"parts of dublin have highest rates of covid 19 in the country","story":"The national average is now 1,316 per 100,000 for the 14 days prior to Monday, November 29th.

Photograph: Alan BetsonPeople in Ireland are living in the dying days of partition, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has told an audience in the United States.In an address to the New York Bar Association about Brexit on Thursday, Ms McDonald said it was very encouraging that the US continued to be so engaged with Ireland and understood that “the Good Friday Agreement was never the final destination in the journey that we are on”.In a presentation, where she received two standing ovations, she said the agreement would outlast British prime minister Boris Johnson.She forecast that there would be a vote on Irish unification in five to 10 years and maintained discussion and preparation must take place in the meantime on issues such as infrastructure, healthcare, housing, economic policy and taxation arrangements that would apply in the future if the votes were carried.Ms McDonald said she did not accept and would challenge any assertion that a move towards Irish unity would lead to violence. She said the Government and the Taoiseach “must move from being bystanders to persuaders for unity”.As part of a wide ranging address she defended the Sinn Féin policy of MPs not taking seats at Westminster and argued that even if this policy had been dropped there would not have been sufficient numbers to stop Brexit.She also supported the introduction of an Irish language Act in Northern Ireland and strongly opposed moves by the British government to introduce an amnesty in troubles-related cases in Northern Ireland.HankeringMs McDonald said Brexit was the outworking of Britain in denial. She described it as “a product of narrow English nationalism and a hankering for the days of Empire”.“In 1962 then US secretary of state Dean Acheson reflected that ‘Great Britain lost an empire and has yet to find it’s role’. His words resonate to this day,” she said. “Britain has lost its empire and Ireland, our peace agreements and prosperity are under threat because the current British government still fails to acknowledge that fundamental fact.”The Sinn Féin leader said the Tory government in London had dragged Northern Ireland out of the EU against the democratic vote of the people.“Now Britain wishes to use Ireland as a bargaining chip, and ramp-ups interference and disruption in the north as a tactic in its confrontation with the EU,” she said. “Britain’s empire is gone but its legacy remains. We live with it in Ireland. Its scars the lives of many in our society.”Pathway to unityMs McDonald said the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement provided a peaceful and democratic pathway to Irish unity.“The Good Friday agreement was never the end point, it was never a final constitutional settlement. It is a framework, a set of rules for managing political differences today and tomorrow,” she said“It asserts the primacy of politics over conflict. The rights of all over the interests of the few. That is why agreements made must be delivered. Anything less undermines the political process.“That is why the voice of the US is so important. When Washington talks, Westminster listens. President (Joe) Biden made this crystal clear when he issued a formal diplomatic rebuke to Britain for failing to honour their agreement.”Asked from the audience about issues such as the tricolour flag and the national anthem in a future Ireland, she said these would form part of the overall discussion."},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Oil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaints"},{"url":null,"title":"cabinet office complacency blamed honours recipients addresses","story":"The glitch that saw the home addresses of honours recipients leaked was identified by the Cabinet Office a week before the incident, a report has found.Celebrities such as Sir Elton John, Gabby Logan and Ainsley Harriot Senior - as well as counter-terrorism police officers - were among more than 1,000 people to have their details exposed in the 2019 breach.The privacy watchdog, the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office (ICO), criticised the Cabinet Office’s “complacency” in handling the sensitive information, fining it £500,000 for the leak.A report found that the civil servants initially spotted that recipients addresses had been erroneously included in the public file eight days before it was published on December 27, 2019.Although staff in the department\u0027s Honours and Appointments Secretariat flagged the error on December 19, it was decided to try to hide the addresses rather than redo the report, as it was close to publication.The fact the addresses were visible were flagged again on December 24. However, they were again not successfully removed from the file. The report said that neither the press office nor digital teams then checked the files before publishing on December 24, as the email that sent the file said the formatting issues had been resolved.However, the addresses were then made visible to the public for almost two and a half hours on the Gov.uk website, where they were viewed more than 3,800 times.Steve Eckersley, director of investigations at the ICO, said: “The Cabinet Office’s complacency and failure to mitigate the risk of a data breach meant that hundreds of people were potentially exposed to the risk of identity fraud and threats to their personal safety.”Following the fine, the Cabinet Office said it had implemented “a number of measures” to prevent future breaches.A spokesman said: “The Cabinet Office would like to reiterate our apology for this incident. “We took action to mitigate any potential harm by immediately informing the Information Commissioner and everyone affected by the breach.”More from NewsTravel news latest: US confirms stricter testing policy for all overseas arrivalsSophie Raworth to take on Andrew Marr\u0026#39s Sunday morning slot until BBC finds permanent new hostOld Bexley and Sidcup by-election latest: Tories fear time is running out to shore up next test in North ShropshireCovid latest news: France\u0026#39s omicron variant rate could peak next monthGhislaine Maxwell\u0026#39s 58-page rule book for staff at Jeffrey Epstein\u0026#39s mansion revealedHS2 route map: how the high-speed rail plans will affect youMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"europes omicron panic has left continent dark place","story":"It may be tempting fate to say it, but Britain is perhaps the best place in Europe to spend this Christmas. Bavaria’s winter markets have closed, France’s bistros won’t let anyone in without a pass sanitaire, Belgium has banned private parties and Ireland’s pubs are all under curfew. But in Britain, the vaccinated and the unvaccinated can walk, work, eat and drink where they like. Unless the omicron variant changes everything, we may well see in the New Year having overcome the virus and upheld the basic values of liberty.Things are rather different in Germany, where hospitals are filling up and the government is planning to lock down the unvaccinated. Olaf Scholz, the incoming chancellor, favours making vaccinations compulsory and Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, is suggesting that all 27 EU members consider doing the same. Freedom should not mean freedom to infect others, runs the fairly clear argument. So it’s time for governments to take back control.This would be an easier argument if science backed it up, but studies so far make this a hard case to defend. Vaccines offer strong protection against serious illness but no guarantee against either acquiring the virus or passing it on. This makes it impossible to declare that a restaurant full of jabbed diners is “safe”. The no-jab, no-job argument also comes up against the case of the unjabbed who have had the virus. An Israeli study of 750,000 people showed that natural immunity was far stronger than vaccine-acquired immunity. So, on what grounds can someone with post-recovery immunity be fired?In France, vaccine passports have had some success in narrowing the uptake gap between young and old. But in Scotland they have proved a flop, with vaccination rates rising no faster than those in England after Nicola Sturgeon’s scheme was announced. Anyone proposing to make life harder for the unjabbed also needs to be honest about who they tend to be: ethnic minorities, the poor and the otherwise-marginalised.The unvaccinated that Angela Merkel is now squaring up against, in her final act as chancellor, are far more likely to live in her old East Germany where Alternative for Germany (AfD), the populists, are strongest. One poll found that half of unvaccinated Germans voted AfD in the recent election. This fits a trend. Across Europe, the anti-lockdown cause has tended to be picked up by Eurosceptic populists who find blunt ways of making their objections known. This has complicated the debate, with politicians often seeing the face of their political opponents in the various protests.The arrival of booster jabs makes the idea of compulsion harder still: if top-ups are needed every three to six months, how will this affect vaccine passports? Will people have to receive every top-up for the ongoing right to enjoy their liberty? Otto Schily, a minister in Gerhard Schröder’s government, yesterday pointed out that even Communist China isn’t considering mandatory vaccines. So where, he asked, will Merkel’s idea lead? Will Mr Scholz now yield to the activist lawyers advocating prison sentences for vaccine refuseniks?The politics of all this is just as isive in Italy, now in its 19th consecutive week of anti-restriction protests. Next week, it will bring in a “super green pass” where a negative test is no longer enough. Austria will start issuing fines for the unvaccinated from February, as Greece will do next month (but only for pensioners). Even Sweden, having defied the world for so long by rejecting mask-wearing and lockdowns, has now succumbed to vaccine passports. Britain is starting to look like the new Sweden: keeping calm and carrying on.Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, has flatly ruled out compulsory vaccination, seeing it as not just illiberal but counterproductive. “If you make the vaccine attractive, people will want it,” says one senior official. “If we start to threaten people, it all changes very quickly.” Right now, Britain has face masks on public transport. And non-binding advice from one minister to go easy on “snogging under the mistletoe”. And, so far, not much else.This shows Javid’s difference in style. Rather than leaping to worst-case hypotheticals, he’s keeping his eye on the data – and they show virus levels still under control. Among pensioners, vaccine uptake is 93 per cent and antibody levels are at 98 per cent: figures unlikely to be pushed much higher by restrictions. The omicron variant could put everything back to square one – and if so, there are no end of emergency buttons to press. But so far, there is no cause for alarm.Javid and others took plenty of political heat in the summer when they ended lockdown. The idea then was to face whatever Covid had in store when the health service was better able to take it – and specifically to be ready for winter. That’s why there is such reluctance to follow the rest of Europe into lockdown now. Why take the hit on the economy and the health service in anticipation of a variant that might not be so bad?Prof Philip Thomas, who predicted the third wave with modelling for Bristol University, envisages Covid steadily petering out over the next few weeks. Omicron has not (yet) changed his mind. Against this come studies – one from South Africa yesterday – saying there’s a decent chance that omicron has “substantial” ability to reinfect. It will be weeks, most likely, until anything is known for sure.Nothing is ever certain with Covid, and bumps (like yesterday’s case spike) are a reminder of how quickly things might change. Inside No 10, there are plenty of people ready to reach for vaccine passports, given half an excuse. But even Sturgeon had to give up on her plan to roll them out when the evidence showed they didn’t work. There are plenty in Government who think ending lockdown in summer did enough to “save Christmas” and don’t want it imperilled now.Last time around, Britain locked down longer and harder than anyone else in Europe. This time, Javid’s instinct is the opposite: not to jump too soon, trust the boosters and see what happens. Quite a gamble. But this time, it’s one the Government is willing to take.More from NewsTravel news latest: US confirms stricter testing policy for all overseas arrivalsSophie Raworth to take on Andrew Marr\u0026#39s

mothers as “postnatal people” in new guidance before issuing an apology hours later for “erasing” women.The RCM published “safer sleep” guidance for those sharing a bed with their newborns and for helping them get to sleep.  However, the guidance, published on Wednesday evening, makes no reference to “women” or “mothers”, instead referring to “postnatal people”. The publication sparked a backlash on social media, and by Thursday morning it had been removed from the RCM website.The guidance described key areas which healthcare professionals should discuss with families during pregnancy and following birth. Referring to sleeping arrangements, it said: “Postnatal people in hospital should have easy access to the call bell system, be shown how to use it and ensure it is working – they should be provided with a bed-side cot for the baby to use while in hospital.”The RCM, whose chief executive is Gill Walton, is a member of the embattled Stonewall Diversity Champion programme, a paid-for scheme that aims to help firms “become more inclusive of LGBT people”.It released a statement apologising for omitting women from the guidance, stating: “We would like to apologise that women are not mentioned in our recent safer sleeping guidance. However, following the RCM’s U-turn, the freelance journalist said it was “really important to support the RCM” because “in this highly sensitive area it is very difficult to publicly admit you have made a mistake”. “There may be questions to ask about howwhy etc but in my view today should simply be about 100 per cent support for them,” she said.Maya Forstater, a woman who lost her job after saying that people cannot change their biological sex and who went on to win a landmark appeal against an employment tribunal, also replied to the RCM’s statement on Twitter, saying: “Thank you!”The BBC recently said it would leave the Stonewall Diversity Champion programme because its participation had raised questions about whether it could be impartial on issues the LGBTQ+ charity is campaigning on.Other organisations including Channel 4, Ofcom, the Equality and Human Rights Commission and the Cabinet Office have also made similar decisions.Freddy McConnell, a trans man and journalist, lost a years-long legal battle to be registered as his first child’s “dad” or “parent” on their birth certificate. Responding to the backlash, Mr McConnell said: “It’s a shame when self-styled birth activists use social-media moments like this to further their exclusionary agendas, rather than focusing on approaches that keep all babies, birthing mothers and people, and their co-parents, safe.”More from NewsTravel news latest: US confirms stricter testing policy for all overseas arrivalsSophie Raworth to take on Andrew

hope their ball bursts. In Old Bexley and Sidcup last night, everyone’s ball burst.Having said that, there can be little doubt that the Conservatives have most to celebrate from their no-score draw against their opponents. Pundits like to play the game of Wise After The Event, pontificating – after the returning officer has delivered his verdict – about how the result in any parliamentary by-election was either inevitable or predicted. In fact, the race to succeed the late MP James Brokenshire should never even have been a race, given the rock-solid status of the Tory majority there since about the time of the Norman Conquest.But by-elections in every and any circumstance are unpredictable beasts these days no inherited majority is safe when local voters are allowed the indulgence of casting a one-off vote that cannot change the government but which can shake it up a bit. This time round, voters chose to attempt neither.Perhaps “celebrate” is too strong a word for a result that saw a 19,000 majority slashed to about 4,500. But party managers will see this result as less of the indictment of Boris Johnson’s Government that they had feared and more of a half-hearted shot across the bows of a ship that few seem keen to abandon. Yet.For Labour, it was a decent result. Their share of the vote went up by about seven per cent, while the Conservative vote slumped by 13 – a result which Labour will today claim that, if replicated across the country, would see the installation of a Keir Starmer government. Except this result won’t be replicated across the country and everybody knows that. By-election results never are, and there have been some far more spectacular local results in recent years that failed to change the national political weather. Old Bexley and Sidcup won’t either.The two-party swing to Labour was uneven, which is because a few per centage points of former Tory support went to Richard Tice and his Reform UK party, which secured nearly seven per cent of the vote, securing his deposit (which is more than can be said for the Liberal Democrat candidate).Conservative Party strategists will be keeping an eye on Reform, especially after recent comments from its founder, Nigel Farage, that he might re-enter the political arena (which came as a shock to those who didn\u0027t realise he’d left it). The very existence of Reform UK, waiting in the wings for an opportunity to split the Conservative vote in a general election, is a salient reminder to Boris Johnson that invoking the spirit of Brexit, as he successfully did in 2019, will come with certain risks next time.As is often the case, the biggest winner last night was apathy. Turnout dropped by almost exactly half, a historically low level by British by-election standards. That will add to the Tories’ relief this morning: Tory voters who stayed at home can be assumed to be more determined to vote when the main event of a general election arrives.Now attention is turning to the by-election caused by Owen Paterson’s abrupt and dramatic resignation from the Commons last month after he was accused of breaking parliamentary rules on lobbying. The North Shropshire by-election will be held in just under two weeks’ time and will, on account of the circumstances, be a very different contest from the one we’ve just witnessed in Old Bexley and Sidcup.For a start, voters reputedly dislike being asked to interrupt their Thursday to vote in a  contest that could have been avoided: voting to replace a much missed and popular MP who died too young is one thing voting to replace a candidate who departed of his own volition under such a dark cloud of alleged misbehaviour presents a particular headache for the party.And it is likely that the opposition parties, which reportedly put little effort into yesterday’s contest, will see North Shropshire as a likely victory.In other words, the Conservatives’ excuses have already been neatly prepared and dusted down. The only thing more damaging to a party’s fortunes than a by-election defeat is a by-election defeat that was unexpected. North Shropshire cannot now be counted in that category.More from NewsSophie Raworth to take on Andrew Marr\u0026#39s Sunday morning slot until BBC finds permanent new hostOld Bexley and Sidcup by-election latest: Tories fear time is running out to shore up next test in North ShropshireCovid latest news: France\u0026#39s omicron variant rate could peak next monthTravel news latest: US confirms stricter testing policy for all overseas arrivalsGhislaine Maxwell\u0026#39s 58-page rule book for staff at Jeffrey Epstein\u0026#39s mansion revealedHS2 route map: how the high-speed rail plans will affect youMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"confusing covid christmas advice top","story":"All the confusing Covid Christmas advice from top Tories - and what rules actually sayUK Covid rules have been changing recently - and Tory ministers claims about how to interpret them have been changing even more. Heres what the guidance says, and what MPs have added on topBoris Johnson switching on the Christmas lights in Downing Street Image: Tayfun Salci ZUMA Press Wire REX ShutterstockByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  Dec | commentsYet again, you’d be forgiven for being confused about Covid rules. With the Omicron iant on the rise, the government imposed new laws on face masks and travel testing in England. But that then triggered a wave of ‘freelancing’ advice from ministers and a top official that wasn’t government policy. No has been forced to deny the Cabinet are at loggerheads amid the flurry of conflicting comments.Officially, the government’s Covid advice in England is as follows.It’s a legal requirement to wear a face maskin shops, public transport, banks and hair salons. It’s also a legal requirement for all arrivals in the UK to get a Day  PCR test and isolate until it is negative. And it’s a legal requirement to isolate for  daysyou’re a close contact of a suspected Omicron case - evenyou’re vaccinated. However, it’s not a legal requirement to cut down on gatherings or close contact, work from home, or reduce travel. Masks also aren’t a legal requirement in hospitality venues. Guidance - which is voluntary - “strongly recommends” that people wear a mask “in crowded and enclosed spaces, where you may come into contact with other people you do not normally meet.” Guidance also says people “may wish to take a rapid lateral flow test” for Covid in certain situations. These include on days when they’ll be “spending time in crowded and enclosed spaces, or before visiting people who are at higher risk of severe illnessthey get COVID-.” So with that out the way, what on earth have Tory ministers - and an advisor to the government - been saying  We take you through it.‘Don’t snog under the mistletoe, much’ Cabinet minister Therese Coffey said Brits should refrain from smooching strangers at Christmas. I donapost think there should be much snogging under the mistletoe,” the Work and Pensions Secretary told ITVaposs Robert Peston. Donapost need to do things like that. But I think we should all be trying to enjoy the Christmas ahead of us and thataposs why weaposre working so hard to get the deployment of as many vaccines as possible, and of course continuing to encourage people who havenapost been vaccinated at all yet, to come forward, recognising that weaposre still trying to understand the impact of Omicron.” Askedthere should be “just no snogging ”, she replied: Well, not with people you donapost already know! No said of Ms Coffey’s comments: “It is down to iniduals to use their personal judgement”. ‘Companies may cancel big Christmas parties’ Science Minister George Freeman turned into Mr Freelance when he appeared to contradict his own boss and No. He said: “For many small businesses, four or five staff working together every day anyway, gathering to have a drink isn’t a big step up in risk. “But some companies might normally bring hundreds of people around the world to a big party. “And they may decide this year ‘is that sensible ’, given the pandemic and given where we are.” Boris Johnson ’s official spokesman responded: “On Christmas parties, we don’t want people to cancel such events.“There is no government guidance to that end.  “It’s right that post Step Four weto the position were people can use their inidual judgement.” Meanwhile Mr Freeman said the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy would not be having a “big” festive bash. But his words came weeks after the Secretary of State Kwasi Kwarteng said a party was already booked. A Business Department source said “dferent teams do dferent things” and no single party for BEIS had been planned.‘Maybe take a lateral flow test, I might wear a mask’ Health Secretary Sajid Javid tracked close to the official guidance - but that only went to show how vague it is.He said there wasn’t “any need to change” Covid rules, but said he’d take a lateral flow test before going to a Christmas party. If you are invited to a Christmas party, thereaposs quite a few people there, maybe you want to take an LFT before you go,” he said. Go to the party, but just be cautious. Askedhe’d wear a mask at the party he replied: “Maybe. “It dependsI’m walking around or sitting down - it depends. If I’m eating. People just need to make a decision based on the guidance.” Mr Javid backed the Prime Minister, urging people to “follow the existing guidance and be sensible about that.” The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: I think he was very clear about what he was saying. He was setting out that we do have a signicant testing capacity, andpeople wanted further reassurance they could use that.‘Go to nativity plays - but obviously wear a mask’Care Minister Gillian Keegan encouraged parents to attend school events - but added they should “obviously” follow non-mandatory guidance. Asked about nativity plays, she replied: “I think we’ve said go about your plans. “I mean, obviously wear a mask, be cautious, you know, all the things that people usually put in place, to be honest. “I think most people have been sensible all along, but we’re not saying to people cancel your plans and I’m sure it would be lovely to go to a nativity play right now.” AskedChristmas would be “ruined”, Ms Keegan replied: “Hopefully not”.‘Try not socialising when you don’t need to’Dr Jenny Harries is the odd one out in this list as she’s a non-political scientic advisor to the government, not a Tory minister. But the chief executive of the UK Health Security Agencytriggered the whole row earlier this week with her comments. She said working from home could be a “key” element of controlling a possible surge in future - despite No resisting the measure. She also said “not socialising when we donapost particularly need to” over Christmas could keep the virus at bay. She told the BBC : Weaposve seen that not everybody has gone back to work and Iaposd like to think of it more in a general way.Which iswe all decrease our social contacts a little bit, actually that helps to keep the iant at bay. So I think being careful, not socialising when we donapost particularly need to and particularly going and getting those booster jabs which, of course, people will now be able to have at a three-month interval from their primary course. Boris Johnson directly rejected the advice, adding: “On Christmas parties and nativity plays, we don’t want people to cancel such events.”‘We’re not in Plan B yet and don’t cancel anything’Lastly we come to Boris Johnson, who despite enacting mask laws has insisted we’re still not in his Plan B for winter. He has insisted people should not cancel anything and only need to follow the guidance. Despite saying “what Jenny’s saying there is right”, he directly rejected her advice. Askedhe agreed with her he said: “The answer is no.” The PM added: “We’re not going to change the overall guidance, we don’t think that’s necessary. We don’t see anything to suggest that we need to go for instance to Plan B, but what we do need to do is take particular precautions against Omicron until we’ve worked out exactly what kind of a threat it may present.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonCabinetBBCConservative PartyPoliticsChristmas partyCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Amid the fall-out of The Mirroraposs exclusive story, she asked whether the Cabinet Secretary had been aware of the gatherings that were taking place. Ms Rayner wanted to knowhe would be conducting an internal investigation into the use of Government property for the parties and the role played by Boris Johnson and his officials. The Labour deputy leader wrote: You will no doubt understand the seriousness of the allegations made. This Government is undermining public health messaging with their actions and we cannot let this go on unchecked. It cannot be that the Prime Minister believes there to be a set of rules for the public and a totally dferent set of rules for himself. Mr Johnson and his Downing Street staff have been accused of breaking Covid rules by attending parties at Number  in the run-up to last Christmas. The Prime Minister gave a speech at a packed leaving do for a top aide last November when the country was in the grip of its second lockdown. Then just days before Christmas, with London in tier  restrictions, members of his top team held their own festive bash in Downing Street. It is alleged that officials knocked back glasses of wine during a yuletide quiz and a Secret Santa while the rest of the country was forced to stay at home. The following day the PM aposcancelledapos Christmas for millions of people across the country.Mr Johnson refused three times to deny that the boozy parties had taken place when pressed at PMQs.  No  has claimed that Covid rules were followed at all times. But a Downing Street insider claimed there were often evening get-togethers while millions of people were observing the strict curbs imposed by the PM. The source said: “It was the only place you could get together and socialise. They happened most Fridays.” The Covid- Bereaved Families for Justice group slammed the PM, who faced demands to apologise for what appears to be a clear breach of his own rules. Member Safiah Ngah lost her father Zahari, , to the virus in February. The -year-old said: “Last Christmas is sadly one I will never forget. “One in  people in my borough had Covid- and my family were desperately trying to do what we could to keep each other safe. Unfortunately it wasn’t enough. To think that just a few miles away, Boris Johnson was throwing a ‘Christmas party’, with no care for the rules he had set, is sickening.“In September, he looked bereaved families in the eye and told them he had done ‘everything he could to keep their loved ones safe’. How exactly did breaking the rules himself fit into that  “While he was enjoying an illegal Christmas party, the people he should have been protecting were dying all around the country.” “The first thing the Prime Minister must do is acknowledge the hurt this has caused, and apologise.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Labour Partypolitan PolicePoliticsCoronavirusBoris Johnson\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Mince pies baking  Mulled wine simmering  Nope, it’s the stench of utter hypocrisy… yet again. It takes quite something to make Matt Hancock look good – and he still doesn’t, but at least he resigned when caught breaking Covid rules. Boris Johnson instead appears to be adopting the approach of frenemy Dominic Cummings. He and his staff only attended crowded parties during lockdown to test their eyesight, presumably. We all tried to make the best of it, and hark back to Blitz Spirit and the like, but Christmas  was terrible. At best. At worst it was devastating, and tragic, because many were robbed of sharing a loved one’s last ever festive season. That the restrictions were necessary didn’t make them any less painful or easier to endure. The only thing that made the depressing damp squib of a yuletide in any way bearable was the knowledge that we were all in the same boat. So to find out now that a select few REDACT  or  were in fact enjoying Christmas perks like packed parties featuring festive quizzes and enough booze to make a festive quiz seem fun is just too much. Brings a whole new meaning to the term Secret Santa, doesn’t it   Once again, it’s a case of Do As I Say Not As I Do from this hideously corrupt bunch, who do not deny that these parties took place, but insist that “rules were followed.” Something of a contradiction in terms seeing as the rules literally were that these parties could not take place. Just like when the Johnsons were caught having an overnight guest during the peak of lockdown last Christmas, presumably the Prime Minister now considers this matter closed. Remember, he only begs for forgiveness when he loses his place in a speech about Peppa Pig.

Conservative Louie French took more than half the votes in the Old Bexley and Sidcup by-election, but the Tory majority was slashed amid low turnout. Only % of those eligible to vote took part in the contest triggered by the death of Tory MP James Brokenshire in October, with , votes cast. That was down from % at the snap general election. The contest took place following damaging headlines over allegations of sleaze, claims that lockdown rules were broken in No  and the emergence of the Omicron coronavirus iant. The result could prompt Tory jitters ahead of the North Shropshire by-election to replace shamed MP Owen Paterson, who had % of the vote to Labouraposs %. But Labour and the Tories both hailed last nightaposs results in Ted Heathaposs old Bexley seat, which has been Tory since its creation. Ellie Reeves, Labour MP for Lewisham West and Penge, said: “We’re winning back the trust of people and it’s a remarkable result for us in a Tory stronghold. Tory chairman Oliver Dowden claimed this is a good result for a governing party mid-term. Scroll down for the full results  He told Sky News: “This idea Labour had made some surge ahead is really for the birds. They’ve actually got about the same vote share as they secured under Jeremy Corbyn in . “I’m not terribly worried about Labour.” Labouraposs vote share was % in  and % in the by-election. But he didnapost mention the Tory vote share dropped from % in  and % in  to just % now. In his acceptance speech shortly after am on Friday, the new MP said: “I’m incredibly proud of the campaign my team and I have run based on local issues that matter to the people who live here. “And tonight, those people send a clear message: they want an MP who will work with the Government to deliver on their priorities. “My focus will now be delivering on those promises that I made during the campaign – get our fair share of London’s police officers, securing more investment for local schools and hospitals, protecting our precious green spaces.” He promised voters he would “work tirelessly to repay the trust that you’ve placed in me and I will not let you down”. Mr French, a local councillor, said he was the first home-grown MP for the seat. “This is the greatest honour of my le. And I hope it inspires people to achieve their own dreams.  Ellie Reeves, Labour MP for Lewisham West and Penge, said: “I think it’s clear that we’re winning back the trust of people and it’s a remarkable result for us in a Tory stronghold.” She added: Boris Johnson’s incompetence and broken promises have come into sharp focus in a staunch Conservative area.“This result that should worry the Prime Minister. Restricting the Conservatives to less than % of the vote would be “great”, a Labour source said before the result was announced. A party official dismissed the suggestion from Conservative deputy chair Justin Tomlinson that Labour would have to run the Tories “very, very close”it was serious about being an alternative government.  They said: “No Conservative candidate has every got below % in this seat. If we can get them down to %, that will be great.” Mr French’s share of more than % of the vote is “almost unheard of”, the Conservative deputy chairman has said. Justin Tomlinson said: “We’re absolutely thrilled. For a Government to get over % of the vote in a parliamentary by-election is almost unheard of, and with a majority of over %. “A fantastic local candidate, positive campaign, focused on the tangible dference we’re making to people’s lives, having navigated the unprecedented challenges of Covid.” He added that the result was an “absolute disaster” for the Labour Party, saying: “They do not look like a Government in waiting.” Reform leader Richard Tice came in third, claiming his party was now “on the upward march”. A string of senior Tories, including the Prime Minister, have visited the constituency during the by-election campaign, with Transport Secretary Grant Shapps among the MPs bolstering the effort to get out the vote on Thursday. But a turnout of just % suggests the by-election contest has failed to excite the public in the constituency. Labour also had a high-profile on the streets of Old Bexley and Sidcup, with shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves and her sister and shadow solicitor general Ellie among those knocking on doors on polling day on behalf of candidate Daniel Francis. Former Cabinet minister Mr Brokenshire, who had represented the constituency since , was diagnosed with early stage lung cancer in . He held the seat in  with a large majority of , votes. A defeat in the by-election would have been a major blow for Mr Johnson, who has suffered a hit in the polls following weeks of sleaze allegations and political blunders. The constituency has always had a Conservative MP since it was created in . Former Tory Prime Minister Ted Heath held the seat - and its predecessor, Bexley - for  years.The last time Labour won in the constituency was in a  by-election. The seat is in the outer-London boroughs where the Tories and Liberal Democrats are traditionally successful. Neal Lawson, Director of the aposprogressive allianceapos pressure group Compass, said: This strong showing for Labour shows the weakness of Boris Johnson’s government and the benefits of cooperation between progressive parties. With the Lib Dems concentrating on campaigning in North Shropshire, Labour was able to increase its vote as the clear alternative to the Tories. Tributes poured in from across politics to Mr Brokenshire on his death in October at just -years-old. The popular MP was hailed by many for his kindness and decency. He was first diagnosed with cancer in  and resigned as Northern Ireland Secretary to have lung surgery. He ed to Parliament only five weeks later.Mr Brokenshire was made Housing Secretary from April  to July , and he was named as Security Minister in  by Boris Johnson. He took a leave of absence in January  to prepare for another operation, and resigned in July after struggling with his recovery. Mr Brokenshire, who had never smoked, announced in August that the cancer had progressed and he was starting a new line of treatment. Announcing his death in October, his family said in a statement: It is with deep sadness that we announce the death of James Brokenshire MP at the age of . James died peacefully at Darent Valley Hospital yesterday evening with family members by his bedside. He had been in hospital since Sunday after his condition rapidly deteriorated. James was not only a brilliant Government minister as both Security and Immigration Minister at the Home Office and Secretary of State at the Northern Ireland Office and Ministry for Housing, Communities  Local Government, but a dedicated constituency MP, first for Hornchurch from  to , and then for Old Bexley  Sidcup for the past  years.

Sajid Javid said it was not up to the Government to decide who people can kiss amid growing confusion over Covid guidance this Christmas.New restrictions have been brought in to tackle the Omicron iant, including mandatory masks in shops and on public transport, and PCR tests for all arrivals from abroad.But ministers have sowed confusion by saying wildly dferent things about the guidance - which is voluntary rather than a legal requirement - on things like social contact.Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey told Brits that snogging under the mistletoe should be avoided with people you donapost already know on Wednesday night. But Mr Javid disagreed, telling ITV News today itaposs got nothing to do with the government who you kiss, when asked about how people should behave over the Christmas period.He said: People can snog who they wish. Iaposll certainly be kissing my we under the mistletoe, itaposs a Javid family tradition and itaposs got nothing to do with the government who you kiss, or anything like that. Thereaposs guidance already out there, just be cautious and enjoy yourselves. He did not expand on what he meant by being cautious. Labour leader Keir Starmer also said he didnapost think it was for the Government to dictate who people can kiss or not kiss.I was quite surprised to see that suggestion come out of Government, he told ITV. I think it just demonstrates how they are at sixes and ninesthataposs what they are now discussing. No said of Ms Coffey’s comments: “It is down to iniduals to use their personal judgement”. Earlier this week, top official Dr Jenny Harries enraged Tory backbenchers by saying people should reduce their social contacts and avoid socialising when we donapost particularly need to.  Boris Johnson later contradicted her and said events did not need to be cancelled.But then Tory Minister George Freeman muddied the waters by appearing to suggest people should not have big Christmas parties.He told the BBC : Inidual businesses, in the end, have to make judgments on what is appropriate internally.“It slightly depends on the nature of the business. “For many small businesses, four or five staff, who are working together every day anyway, gathering to have a drink isnapost a big step up in risk. “But some companies might normally bring hundreds of people in from around the world to a big party, and they may decide, this year, is that sensible given the pandemic and given where we are  Mr Freeman also told Times Radio: I can tell you the Department of Business, we wonapost be having a big Christmas party this year. Nobody would expect us to. Later on Thursday, Mr Johnson again insisted that people did not need to cancel their festive plans.  Speaking to broadcasters after having his booster jab in London, the PM said: I want to repeat the guidance is there and Iaposm very, very keen that people understand this, we donapost want people to feel that they need to start cancelling things, to start... you talk about kids in nativity plays and that kind of thing. I donapost think thereaposs any need to stop that at all.I think weaposre taking a balanced and proportionate approach to the risk, but I want and I believe that Christmas this year will be considerably better than Christmas last year.Boss of pub group Youngaposs Patrick Dardis said some Christmas parties had already been cancelled amid concerns over the Omicron iant.He said: I think the messaging has been terribly confusing and inconsistent.

Boris Johnson insisted they should go ahead before a business minister urged them to be scrapped. One pub boss said: “It’s terribly confusing.”With Christmas approaching, families and ­festive revellers are desperate to know what they can or cannot do as the Omicron iant threat grows.But the public were left none the wiser tonight after a stream of mixed messages poured out of Downing Street, from advice on parties to kissing under mistletoe. And the muddled advice caused further outrage among a public already furious at No for holding parties last year during lockdown.  Amid fears get-togethers could spark a surge of the latest Covid iant, Boris Johnson insisted no one should cancel yuletide bashes. But hours earlier, Business Minister George Freeman sug­­gested that larger firms should scrap Christmas parties. The confusion grew further today as Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey warned “snogging under the mistletoe” should be avoided with strangers. But Health Secretary Sajid Javid said tonight: “People can snog who they wish.  “It’s got nothing to do with the Government who you kiss. There’s guidance out there, just be cautious and enjoy yourselves.” Mr Johnson, who today had his booster jab at St Thomas’ Hospital in South London, insisted “we want people to continue as they are”. He added: “People should follow the g­uidance that we’ve set out and people shouldn’t be cancelling things, and there’s no need for that at all.” But Mr Freeman cast doubt on works parties. He said: “Inidual businesses must make judgments on what is appropriate ­internally. It depends on the nature of the ­business. “For small businesses, four or five staff, who work together every day anyway, gathering to have a drink isn’t a big step up in risk. But some companies might normally bring hundreds of people in from around the world to a big party, and they may decide is that sensible given the pandemic and given where we are ”  Adding to the lack of clarity, Mr Freeman insisted his Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy would not be having a “big” festive bash – just weeks after Secretary of State Kwasi Kwarteng said a party was already booked. He added: “Nobody would expect us to. My parliamentary team, I think we’ve agreed, ­probably given the new iant, we’ll get together on Zoom and toast each other.” Mr Kwarteng had said on October : “We’ve got some arrangements in place, and I look forward to having a Christmas party as usual.” A Business Department source today said “dferent teams do dferent things” and no single party for BEIS had been planned. It is understood Mr Kwarteng’s bash is still going ahead. The boss of pub group Young’s revealed some parties had already been cancelled due to the confusion. Patrick Dardis said: “I think the messaging has been terribly confusing and inconsistent. “One moment we’re told to avoid socialising and an hour later you have Sajid Javid saying the opposite. “I think the messaging started as a complete ­overreaction and, unsurprisingly, it has concerned some people.” Royal College of Nursing Council chairwoman Carol Popplestone said the “mixed messages” from ministers over Christmas plans could create “even more worry and confusion”. Shadow Business Secretary­ ­Jonathan Reynolds urged revellers to take Covid tests before parties. But he added: “I don’t want to see people cancelling parties now. “People need to live their lives and have some fun but also it has a huge impact on things like the hospitality industry.” A further seven cases of Omicron were confirmed today in England and three in Scotland, the UK Health Security Agency said. It brings the total to . Up  people are believed to have been infected with the iant after a festive party in Norway, the world’s largest outbreak so far. The mixed messages Kissing under the mistletoe Cabinet minister Therese Coffey said: “I don’t think there should be much snogging under the mistletoe.” Askedthere should be “just no snogging ”, she replied: “Well, not with people you don’t already know.” But Health Secretary Sajid Javid declared that people can “snog who they wish” this festive season.  Big Xmas parties Minister George Freeman appeared to be freelancing when he suggested that big firms could cancel their festive bashes. He said: “Some companies might normally bring hundreds of people around the world to a big party. And they may decide this year ‘is that sensible ’” But No  said: “On Christmas parties, we don’t want people to cancel such events.” Socialising Dr Jenny Harries, of the UK Health Security Agency, said “not socialising when we don’t particularly need to” over Christmas could keep the virus at bay. But Boris Johnson rejected the advice, adding: “On Christmas parties and nativity plays, we don’t want people to cancel events.”  Testing Mr Javid tracked close to the official guidance on tests but that only went to show how vague it is. He said there wasn’t “any need to change” Covid rules but said he’d take a lateral flow test before going to a party. “If you are invited to a Christmas party, there’s quite a few people there, maybe you want to take an LFT before you go,” he said. “Go to the party but just be cautious.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Christmas partyPoliticsCoronavirusTory GovernmentCoronavirus lockdown\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden said people should “keep calm and carry on” with festive plans after ministers issued a blizzard of conflicting advice.Cabinet minister Therese Coffey said there shouldn’t be “much snogging under the mistletoe”, only for Health Secretary Sajid Javid to hit back: “People can snog who they wish.”Mr Dowden went down a slightly dferent tack - saying people were free to smooch strangersthey strictly abide by the latest Covid laws in England. That includes mandatory face coverings in shops, supermarkets, shopping centres, banks, estate agents, vets, and on public transport, with £ fines. Asked about kissing, he told LBC: “People should keep calm and carry on with their Christmas plans, as long as they abide by the mask-wearing in the settings we’ve set out, namely public transport and… retail.”  Askedthat meant they could kiss strangers at parties Mr Dowden replied: “If you wish to kiss somebody under the mistletoe, yes, the rules have not changed. “As long as they are a fully consenting adult, yes, you are free to carry on with your Christmas plans.” Askedhe’d kiss anyone he replied: “Only Mrs Dowden,I’m fortunate.”It comes hours after a government advisor warned “personally, I wouldnapost feel safe going to a party at the moment” - evenattendees were vaccinated.Professor Peter Openshaw, a member of SAGE subgroup the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group , said the chances of getting infected were too high”. The Prime Minister and Health Secretary Sajid Javid have urged people not to cancel Christmas parties despite the rise of the Omicron iant, and more than , new cases a day.  Prof Openshaw, an expert in experimental medicine at Imperial College London, said: We have not been planning to have a Christmas party. Because with things as they are, regardless of Omicron, we thought that the chances of getting infected were too high. Asked about the Prime Ministeraposs stance on Christmas plans, Prof Openshaw told BBCaposs Question Time: Personally, I wouldnapost feel safe going to a party at the moment,it involves being indoors in an enclosed space where youaposre close to other people, and people are not wearing masks. Eventheyaposve been tested and vaccinated, I wouldnapost feel safe. Mr Dowden said the Conservative Party is planning a Christmas party for staff, but insisted it is “just a normal Christmas gathering of staff in London” and “completely consistent with the rules”. Askedthere would be games - as there allegedly were during a No Christmas party while London was under lockdown rules last year - Mr Dowden replied: “It’s not a children’s party, so I wouldn’t expect there’ll be games.”  He refused to comment on the Mirror’s revelations about the No party, saying he was not in Downing Street at the time. Earlier the British Medical Associationsaid people should be encouraged to avoid large groups and meet outdoors where possible over the festive period. This goes further than government guidance, which strongly encourages wearing face masks in crowded indoor spaces, and says people may want to take a lateral flow test before going anywhere with crowds. Dr Penelope Toff, chair of the BMAaposs public health medicine committee said contradictory public health messages about Covid- are very unhelpful for everyone. Dr Toff said: There should be no confusion about what to do over the festive period. There have been persistently high levels of Covid- infections in the community in recent months, and we now have a new iant circulating, which is worrying. Stronger measures need to be implemented without delay, to prevent even higher rates of spread of the virus in the community. People need to be encouraged to avoid large groups, to meet only outdoors where possible and face masks should be worn in all public indoor spaces except when people are seated to eat and drink. In a joint statement, UKHospitality, the British Institute of Innkeeping and the British Beer  Pub Association urged those with Christmas plans not to cancel, with bookings down on previous years.

Steven McPartland already works ten hours a month as a non-executive director of Furniture Village, from which he pockets more than £, a month. But the latest Register of Membersapos Interests reveals the MP for Stevenage now puts more time in as a strategic adviser for MBU Capital Group, for which he will be paid £, a month. According to National World, MBU Capital Group is a London-based financial firm which invests in national resources, education, cannabis CBD and real estate. He took the new job on  November , and according to the register, expects to work for eight hours a month - which amounts to £ an hour.  Mr McPartland, shortly before his election in , promised: “If I became Stevenageaposs MP, I would treat it as a full-time job.” Boris Johnson has promised an overhaul of the rules governing MPs outside earnings - banning MPs from “exploiting their positions” by working as paid consultants. But Labour have argued his plans don’t go far enough, and pledged to ban all second jobs for MPs, with just a few exemptions.It emerged last night that a string of Tory MPs had given up their second jobs in the wake of the scandal. The latest register of members interests shows former chief whip Julian Smith has given up paid roles worth more than £, a year. They include Hygen Energy - a green fuel firm founded by Jo Bamford, the son of JCB mogul and major Tory donor Sir Anthony Bamford - which paid him up to £, a year as an “external adviser advising on business development”. Former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith’s register has been updated to show he is no longer a member of the advisory board of healthcare tech firm Tunstall. And Winchester MP Steve Brine’s record has been updated to say he has stepped back as a “strategic adviser” to Sigma pharmaceuticals.

With everything  he’s got to contend with Riley also suffers from anxiety and the whole experience has helped a lot with that. “Even now when he’s struggling with his illness or feelings of anxiety he’ll reflect back on the day his dream came true to take his mind off the problems of the here and now. “We couldn’t have asked for a more amazing experience.” Riley’s dream day came about with the help of Make-A-Wish UK, this year’s Mirror Christmas Appeal charity, an organisation mum-of-two Rachel, , says has offered a ray of hope to the family during some of their most dficult times.“To have time away from what can feel like quite traumatic experiences makes a huge dference,” she says. Riley, now seven, was born prematurely at  weeks in September  weighing lbs oz. “Nothing was picked up during my pregnancy but once I was in labour Riley went into foetal distress and was delivered by emergency C-section,” recalls Rachel, from Newcastle.“Virtually as soon as he was born his journey with one surgery after another began. He had his first operation at just a few hours old.” Riley was diagnosed with TOF OA, two rare conditions that meant he was born with a gap in his oesophagus. Surgery quickly after delivery meant mum Rachel and dad David, , couldn’t kiss him for the first two days of his le. It was four days before they had their first cuddle.  “It was terrying from the beginning,” recalls Rachel. “Even though he had surgery straight away, it was weeks before the gap in his oesophagus was repaired and all that time he was in intensive care.” Riley was allowed home aged seven months old. By then the tot had also been diagnosed with a range of other health problems, including hemivertebra, a congenital condition which means parts of his spine are not properly developed. He also has dextrocardia which means his heart is slightly to the left of where it should be and he has suffered from respiratory illnesses over the years.  “He’s had a tough time,” says Rachel. “But he’s such a lovely boy.” The family’s challenges don’t stop there however, with Riley’s little sister Ruby-Leigh, five, also born with TOF OA. Both youngsters were even hospitalised at the same time. “Nothing was flagged during the pregnancy with Ruby-Leigh either,” says Rachel. “Over the years she’s had multiple surgeries on her oesophagus too. “They both go to mainstream school but it’s dficult, and particularly at this time of year. Very often one of both of them will end up with a respiratory illness as they have tracheomalacia, or a floppy airway, so even a common cold can end up with a chest infection that could lead to pneumonia.” By Jason Beattie For the majority of families this Christmas will be a joyous time of presents, food and fun. But for some children the festive season will be very dferent. Across the country there are more than , young people who are critically ill. Many will be spending what should be a special time of the year in hospital. Others will have to have treatment, scans or blood tests. With your help we can give them a Christmas that they will always remember. This year’s Mirror Christmas Appeal is raising funds for Make-A-Wish UK that helps seriously ill young people make their dreams come true.It could be they want to meet their hero or heroine or feed an animal at the zoo or travel to see Santa in Lapland. The money raised could help Joshua, six, who has severe epilepsy, achieve his wish of a bedroom makeover or Summer, also six, who has acute leukaemia and dreams of a bouncy castle. Each year Make-A-Wish helps hundreds of critically ill children achieve their letime’s ambition. But to make a wish come true takes an army of volunteers, supporters and donors. That’s why every penny you donate could make a dference. Granting a wish can transform a child’s le. It gives them something to look forward to. For others it provides a special memory which makes the treatment they need more bearable.It can also help their parents who, despite doing everything they can for their sick child, feel it is not enough. Jason Suckley, Make-A-Wish UK chief executive, said: “I met the family of a boy who was recovering from brain surgery. “His grandmother told me how dficult it had been for her to watch her daughter struggle with the challenges of her son’s condition.But while they were enjoying his wish together, her daughter turned to her and said, ‘There is still magic in this world isn’t there mum ’ . “That’s just one instance that illustrates how the power of a wish lies in sharing positive memories with loved ones. “Every donation from Mirror readers will help us create those memories – bringing joy to ill children and their families during the darkest of times.” Which is why the experience provided for Riley by Make-A-Wish in January  made such an impact. “I can’t put into words just what help they’ve given us,” says Rachel, who along with partner David is a full-time carer for her children. “Even now we talk about meeting Tim. Make-A-Wish gave us tickets to see him on stage in October and he gave Riley a shout-out. We can’t thank Tim and the charity enough.” Online: www.make-a-wish.org.uk mirror Text: To donate £ text the word LIGHT to .

The six-year-old was living with his paternal grandparents, who “loved and cherished him”, when the pandemic hit. But his dad Thomas Hughes decided to move in with girlfriend Emma Tustin when the country was plunged into lockdown.Today his evil stepmum convicted of murdering the defenceless child after a horric campaign of abuse, while his dad was found guilty of manslaughter.Det Insp Laura Harrison, of West Midlands Police, said it “was the worst decision that could have been made”. “If only Hughes had left Arthur with his grandparents who absolutely doted on him, loved him and cherished him,” she told the Mirror. “The manipulation and the toxic relationship between Tustin and Hughes meant the family were cut out of Arthur’s le and didnapost play a part. “The lockdown meant professionals didn’t have the opportunity to monitor him in the same way they would do with children normally. “I do think that lockdown contributed. “The professionals who would ordinarily have been involved in Arthur’s le, such as teachers, weren’t having that contact with him and spotting changes in his behaviour or bruises on his body. “Tustin and Hughes cut off family members so Arthur was no longer seeing or speaking to him. “And when social workers went out to Tustin’s home there was an absolute manipulation of them by the defendants. “It was the only day when Arthur was allowed to play in the garden and he presented very dferently as a result. “When the professionals did speak to him they weren’t picking up on the signs they would have donehe had been segregated in a hallway. “Tustin and Hughes pulled the wood over the eyes of the professionals. They didn’t want children’s services involved.” Specialist grief counsellors were drafted in to help police left traumatised by Arthur’s death.  Veteran detectives were left in tears as they watched CCTV footage of the helpless youngster alone in his family home. They also discovered harrowing evidence that Arthur had been sadistically poisoned with salt by his dad and step-mum. DI Harrison described it as the “most traumatic” case she had ever investigated. She compared his death to the murder of Daniel Pelka, the tragic four-year-old boy killed by his mum and step-dad in . In both cases the children were deliberately poisoned with salt to increase the suffering before their deaths. “I knew when we started it was a horric case, but there have been moments that have just completely got me,” she said.  “Everyone involved has found it really haunting having to witness and experience the evil and horric torture that Arthur was subjected to. “There are real similarities with Daniel Pelka, definitely in terms of salt poisoning. “I’d not heard of it before in child cruelty cases and it’s been really hard to comprehend. But it is a haunting parallel. “A physical assault is one thing - but it’s very devious and manipulative to dose a child up with salt. It’s another level of evil. “It could only have been done as another way to control Arthur - an extra punishment. “We think maybe they did it to make him more thirsty but we don’t know because they’ve never given us an explanation. “It’s been really dficult for the officers who have to sit for hours watching CCTV footage of Arthur being isolated.  “I arranged for a trauma counsellor to come in to explain the emotions people might be experiencing and to teach coping mechanisms they could put in place. “They have been able to independently see the counsellor without the rest of the team knowing. “We don’t ordinarily get faced with CCTV like this. “The footage really got to the heart of what Arthur was being subjected to and thataposs why it’s been so hard-hitting and dferent to similar cases. “When you add in the  recordings of Arthur in distress and the brutal text messages, it sets it apart from the Pelka and Baby P cases. “We’ve been reliant on medical expert opinion and it’s been crucial. “But the actual emotional element of this case has been proved by that CCTV or hearing audio clips where he is calling out for family members, calling out for food or water, and that nobody loves him. “We all know children in our lives. You just cannot comprehend anybody being able to neglect a child over such a sustained period of time. “It was not a sudden loss of control, it was a well thought-out campaign of abuse, both physically and psychologically, towards Arthur.” DI Harrison said it was “hard to comprehend” how Hughes and Tustin tried to blame Arthur for his fatal injuries. She said: “They’ve blamed each other and they’ve blamed Arthur as well. “How can a six-year-old boy be responsible for what happened  We know he couldn’t have inflicted his fatal injuries himself. “They are both equally responsible. Although Tustin killed Arthur, Hughes encouraged the killing by actions.” The sheer cruelty of the couple was played out in the courtroom over two months. Texts between them showed their feelings towards the little boy, whose mother was previously jailed for the manslaughter of her boyfriend. In brutal messages, Hughes told Tustin to aposjust endapos Arthur and also apostake his jaw offapos and aposgagapos him. He also threatened to apostake his neck offapos and aposdash my food off his headapos. The day before the child died, his dad texted about paying someone to aposdig Arthuraposs graveapos. Tustin was equally vile, the court was told. In one message she said aposf****** launch this lying little f***apos and in another she warned she was aposgoing to chin this little c***apos.

The children are currently not in school due to concerns over covid and Toby’s type  diabetes condition.\" content\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES n _RGP_MDM_Morris_.jpg\" width\"\" \"\" The Morris family in Somerset - Charlie Morris with children Finley,  , Toby, and Phoebe,  at their home in Whitchurch, Bristol Image: Rowan Grfiths   Daily MirrorByRos Wynne JonesReal Britain columnistClaire Donnelly:,  Dec Updated:,  Dec | commentsSarah Brooks has chronic ­rheumatoid arthritis. Like many people on immunosuppressant drugs, she is double-vaccinated but hasn’t developed any ­antibodies to Covid-. Her four-year-old daughter, Ella, has a rare type of epilepsy that can be ­triggered by a virus or a fever. With Covid rates rising, and the new Omicron iant gaining ground, Mrs Brooks has taken the decision to home school her three children. But – under current government rules – now faces being fined. “We were invited for a meeting with the attendance officer and were told we face fines and or prosecution,” says Mrs Brooks . “On the same day we got a letter saying that the school itself was at the centre of a Covid outbreak. It’s bonkers.” The family have now got in touch with the Good Law Project, who have sent a pre-action letter to the local council challenging the decision to enforce attendance. Getting “back to normal” has left millions of clinically vulnerable people behind. At one time .million were official “shielders”. One in four of them has never stopped according to ONS figures. Now they are just people who can’t go out, but have no extra support. Last week, the number of pupils absent from school in England because of Covid rose by about %. Some , state-school pupils were absent with confirmed or suspected cases on November . Rather than recognising the dilemma faced by vulnerable families, the Secretary of State for Education, Nadhim Zahawi, has doubled down on the Government’s position with a letter to school leaders about “maximising” school attendance. “We are at a crucial point in the pandemic and must collectively act now to ensure lower levels of attendance do not become the accepted norm,” the letter says. “I hope you agree on the urgency.” For the Morris family in Somerset, the letter was devastating. Toby Morris, , has had Type  diabetes since he was a baby. He is a brittle diabetic who needs round-the-clock monitoring. The Morris’s are having to homeschool his sister, Phoebe, seven, and brother Finlay, , because of the risk of them catching the virus at school. Finlay, who himself has asthma, shares a bunkbed with Toby. And their mum, Abi, , has an immune condition. “Because the Government is saying no one has to shield and children should attend as normal, we’re stuck in this nightmare,” their dad Charlie,, explains. “The bubbles, isolating, all the things schools were doing to keep children safe, it’s all gone out of the window. “There are thousands of families like ours put in a position where schools are saying they can’t authorise any absence because it’s meant to now be attendance as normal – but because there are vulnerable people in our family that isn’t safe for us. “School is important – I’m a former teacher. But an education is no goodyou’re dead or suffering a chronic illness as a result of a nasty infection. Our son’s already suffered enough living with a le-long, le-limiting condition.” The family is also being supported by the Good Law Project after claiming their local MP, Jacob Rees-Mogg, failed to reply to them. This week, the Government ­introduced masks into communal areas in schools, but stopped short of further mitigations like increasing ventilation, classroom bubbles, masks in classrooms and further access to vaccinations for children. Many Year  children won’t turn  until long after winter. Even then, the vaccination programme for children is grindingly slow. Nadhim Zahawi recently met with Miriam Cates, a Tory MP and education committee member who believes “Covid isn’t a risk to children”. Andrew Lewer MP tweeted “Miriam Cates MP  I met with @nadhimzahawi about face masks in schools  our aspiration to phase them out.” Cates is known for her ­opposition to masks because “showing our faces is part of being human”. She’s also called for an end to regular testing of schoolchildren without symptoms, and says there’s “no rush” for vaccines in schools.For Ella Brooks, at home in the Midlands, catching Covid could be a death sentence. Her rare form of epilepsy means she suffers intense seizures particularly when she has a fever. These can start in her sleep and cause her to stop breathing. “Once again we are behind Wales and Scotland in terms of mitigations being adopted, despite Covid currently running rampant through most schools in England,” her mum says. “The message seems to be ‘attendance at all costs’ – but for us, that cost could be someone’s le.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “The best place for young people is in the classroom, it is vital for their education and mental health which is a priority. “All children should be supported to continue to attend school and our guidance to schools about attendance of clinically vulnerable children has been clear throughout. In line with guidance every child aged  and over with specic underlying health conditions has been offered the vaccine.” No one wants ato lockdown home schooling. And yet failing to use masks alongside mitigations like ventilation will likely end in soaring cases. Yesterday, Gwynedd in North Wales, announced ato online learning after a spike in cases. More councils may soon be following suit. “There’s this  argument you’re pro-freedom or pro-lockdown but it’s not that simple,” mum Sarah says. “We don’t want lockdown and we want schools to stay open, but we need them to be made safer and at the moment, for families like ours, they’re not. As parents it’s really stressful.” For her the choice comes down to one thing. “I’ve sat at my daughter’s bedside, watched her struggling. Her condition can be le-threatening and I have to do what I can to prevent that.”Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Tory GovernmentJacob Rees-MoggNadhim ZahawiEducationSchoolsMental healthArthritisPoliticsEpilepsyCoronavirusCoronavirus lockdown\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Illustrations released by the Genomics UK Consortiumshow that it has a worrying  mutations on its spike protein. By comparison Delta - which tore through the population last winter and has since become the worldaposs dominant strain - has seven. Experts have said Omicron, which was first identied by scientists in South Africa, is the most mutated Covid iant they have yet encountered. This morning a spokesman for the UK Health Security Agency told The Mirror that targeted testing is being carried out for the iant.  This means that not every positive PCR test is screened for the new strain.At the weekend Boris Johnson announced a range of measures aimed at halting Omicronaposs spread, including compulsory PCR testing for all travellers arriving in the UK from abroad.  Contacts of those identied as having the strain are also required to isolate for  days, regardless of whether they have vaccinated. Officials say it is too early to tell how worried we should be about the iant, with Brits urged to show caution.  The strain has been classied as of concern by the World Health Organisation . It is feared that Omicron could prove resistant to vaccines because of the number of mutations in its spike protein. This affects how it responds to antibodies in the immune system, and the way it enters human cells. This week South African Raquel Viana, Head of Science at one of South Africaaposs biggest private testing labs, said she had a sinking feeling when she discovered the new strain while genetically testing positive swabs in the country.  She told Reuters: I was quite shocked at what I was seeing. I questioned whether something had gone wrong in the process.Early indications show most Omicroncoronavirus cases are mild, the World Health Organisation has said. The official believes there is no evidence to suggest the efficacy of vaccines reduces when battling against the new iant.The organisation, quoted by Reuters, suggested most cases so far examined are not severe. They cautiously added there is still a lot not yet known about the new strain.

Suffering from concussion and a cut nose she was rushed to hospital in an ambulance where she was treated by concerned medical staff. But Cindy’s fall was not an accident at all. Instead she was suffering from factitious disorder - also known as Munchausen’s syndrome - and had collapsed on purpose. The condition, which sees someone pretend to be ill, or actively try to make themselves ill, in order to receive care, sympathy and attention, has been a lelong affliction for Cindy. She remembers faking flu when she was four and today at  still falls to deliberately hurt herself. “One time I swallowed a whole tin of Tiger Balm, because camphor is known to cause seizures and I wanted to induce one,” she admits. “I’ve probably given myself about  concussions over the years and I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve been in ambulances. I face plant and don’t put my hands out to protect myself, so I land head first on the concrete. I do it in public places like a supermarket, a bus stop or a busy street. “It’s about receiving attention and tenderness. When I’m being lted into an ambulance there is that feeling of being carried and of being loved and looked after – I feel comforted and peaceful it’s a very powerful feeling. If someone didn’t treat me with tenderness I didn’t bother doing it around them anymore. So it was unfortunate that the people who were kindest to me got the brunt of my bad behaviour.” It’s a condition that is currently being highlighted on screen in Coronation Street. Medical student Curtis Delamere has spent months convincing concerned fiance Emma Brooker and her dad Steve McDonald that he is dying from an incurable heart complaint.But shocked viewers this week saw Curtis’s doctor confirm, that as they’ve told him many times, there’s nothing wrong with his heart and that he’s suffering from factitious disorder. Curtis is only  and it turns out he has had the condition for years. Actor Sam Retford, who plays Curtis, says he hopes viewers won’t hate his character as his deception and manipulation are exposed.  As part of his factitious disorder, Curtis has lied that he has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but Sam says: “I hope viewers will have sympathy. He’s not sitting there in the morning thinking: ‘what lies am I going to tell today ’ It’s not malicious. He’s just lonely. “If we could all have a button we could press and it means that people love you, of course we would all day long, because it’s a nice thing that people care for you.” For Cindy too the problems began in childhood. “I actually can’t remember a time when I didn’t have the disorder,” she recalls. “As young as four I pretended I had flu, or didn’t feel very well. “When I was six I would purposely try to fall off swings and hurt myself. I got a few bruises and I was always a bit disappointed it wasn’t more!”  She is puzzled why it developed. “The only thing I’ve been able to think is that my Mum had really bad migraines,” she says. “She’d be in bed and couldn’tand I remember being left to fend on my own quite a bit. Maybe it was a way of getting people’s attention so I had more support.” As Cindy got older the disorder got worse and when she got to high school she began pretending to faint. “I got attention for the fainting, so that turned into pretending I had seizures. I’d shake and people said I must have epilepsy,” she recalls. “At university it got so bad that even though my EEG tests were normal, they decided to put me onto medication. “It spiralled out of control and I wound up in the hospital in a seizure monitoring unit. They were talking about brain surgery at one point to stop the seizures. That was pretty scary, but the problem with the disorder is that I’ve always wanted to be sick, so I was actually hoping that they would do surgery. That’s the crazy thing. “Over the years I’ve also taken five overdoses and all except one were part of the factitious disorder. It was a way of getting attention.”  Cindy, who lives in Alberta, Canada is one of the few people in the world to admit publicly to having the disorder. Psychiatry professor Marc Feldman, the world authority on the illness, says that it is notoriously hard to detect. He explains: “Even physicians can miss a diagnosis and many patients continue their denial. Then,the patient lies about what is going on, a therapist is not going to be able to address it, so you have to work slowly to build trust.” So determined were Coronation Street to get the storyline right that they contacted Dr Marc Feldman who did Zoom interviews with researchers and writers and also spoke atto actor Sam. He says: “Afterwards they sent me pages of scripts with specic questions, such as: ‘does this ring true ’ They wanted to get it as accurate as possible. “I’ve written so much about factitious disorder over the past  years and I was more than happy to help. It seemed a great opportunity to make the public more aware of the disorder.” The most extreme case of factitious disorder was that of Wendy Scott who was admitted to hospital  times under  pretences and had  abdominal operations. Born in Scotland she was known to hospitals throughout Europe. Sadly, when she suffered real pain nobody believed her. Eventually it was discovered that she had advanced abdominal cancer from which she died in .  Dr Feldman, who has interviewed hundreds of patients with the disorder, says: “I had one patient who instilled a caustic substance into her bladder, ultimately forcing the bladder to be removed. She now has a bag. Some of the cases are quite shocking.” The syndrome was first identied in the s and named Munchausen’s Syndrome after German aristocrat Baron Munchausen, who was known for his exaggerated story-telling. Factitious disorder imposed on another, previously called Munchausen’s by proxy, is a iant of the syndrome, in which someone fakes or induces illness in someone under their care, usually a mother with their child. The disorder has taken its toll on Cindy’s health. “There’s been a little bit of cognitive impairment, some memory issues. I notice after concussions that I haven’t been as sharp,” she admits. “I’ve also damaged a nerve in my face, so I can’t lt my left eyebrow. I’ve had lots of black eyes, bloody noses and stitches.” Cindy, who is single, has had boyfriends in the past, but kept them and all her friends and family in the dark about her condition. It was only after being diagnosed as bipolar in her s that she first confessed to a doctor. Now she is on medication for her bipolar disorder she has fewer impulses to harm herself or fake illness. Ten years ago she found religion which has also helped. “That was a lot of comfort to me – I could get attention from God,” she explains. After writing her memoir Liar, Liar, Gown on Fire, she says those close to her now understand more about the disorder and whilst many were initially angry, they have forgiven her for the deceit, Yet Cindy doubts she will ever properly recover. “I still do it sometimes I did it as recently as this summer. It’s become a coping mechanism when I’m under stress,” she says. “I don’t really think I’ll ever be cured. It’s been part of my le forever. It’s not just a matter of faking it, I actually want to be physically ill and that has never gone away. StillI get a little bit of a cough, I’m hoping its Covid.”For more information go to munchausen Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Coronation StreetHospitalsHeart diseaseMental healthSoap operasPrescriptionsFluFitness\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Dont miss out on the biggest soaps gossip!

Thousands of residents in the northeast of England still have no power six days after the mph icy blast swept through the country.Durham County Council raised the alert after recording that , homes are still living in darkness.Several schools in the area remain closed due to building damage and lack of power, heat, electricity or working phone lines, Chronicle Live reports.A caravan site in Berwick-upon-Tweed in Northumberland was one of the worst-hit spots - where several holiday homes were crushed by the force of the storm.  Today diggers were seen clearing up large amounts of debris after the caravans were ripped apart, in some cases leaving behind just the base. Kitchen cabinets, TVs and sofas were left exposed to the elements as a result, and debris can be seen on the seafront which appears to have blown over the edge of the clf. Resident Brian Burgon, , said the site was a devastation scene.  Brian said: The caravans have been broken apart like balsa wood. Itaposs a devastation scene. Brian was one of the lucky ones whose power was restored shortly after the storm.  But the electrician said the damage to the area is like nothing Iaposve ever seen before. He said: In some parts, itaposs like an atom bomb dropped. I have seen trees that snapped like twigs. Northumberland councillor Steven Bridgett said that five towns and villages in north east Northumberland still have no power after six days. He said: The number has come down signicantly from what it was.  A lot of those without power are small hamlets and farms - and some we have no way of communicating with. We have sadly had someone pass away, although they did have underlying health conditions. But having no heat and power could have been a contributing factor - it definitely didnapost help. Today we have boots on the ground knocking doors of residents with no power, finding out what they need. We are offering food and drinks and accommodationthey canapost live in their homes.

He said: Iaposve called them three times and emailed as well. The email just told me to fill out a survey.Iaposve spoke with three dferent people and they said they were going to treat it as an emergency, reports the Liverpool Echo.When I called on the Friday someone said they were going to come down in the early hours of the morning but Iaposve just been waiting since.  Keith said a big issue is now that children are able to access the train line, by using the gap in his fence, and he fears for their safety. He added: Iaposve got children climbing over as well. Theyaposre about six or seven and keep trying to come down. Thereaposs a school just down the road. We have to sit there constantly in limbo watching to make sure the kids donapost get on the wall and climb on the track again. Thereaposs also debris from the fence on the ground. If it blows in front of a train it could cause accidents. On the Network Rail website the company states: We’re responsible for the fencing that forms the boundary to the railway. If there’s a problem with our fencing we will either fix the fence or replace it. This doesn’t apply to other fences that may be parallel to our boundary measure. If there’s a gap and we can’t immediately carry out a permanent repair, then weaposll do a temporary repair first of all. If we can’t repair the fence to a safe standard, and a fence is needed to keep the railway safe, we’ll replace it with a new one of a similar size and type.  Keith said in the past he has had to have staff from Network Railaposs health and safety team on site when work was carried out on his house. He said: The fence isnapost on my property itaposs next to the railway track so itaposs up to them to replace it. When I got some work done down the side of my house, their health and safety team had to be there. They wouldnapost let anyone on the wall side of the track, so I canapost see it being my responsibility on that side of the wall. A Network Rail spokesperson said: “Storm Arwen cause widespread destruction across the country’s rail network and our engineers are working round the clock to fix the damage. We’d always encourage people to report issues with railway fencing and thank this resident in West Kirby for doing so. The local maintenance team is aware and will make the necessary repairs as soon as possible.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Railways\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The research, which has not been peer-reviewed, found people who had tested positive for Covid could pick up the virus again. It did not say how the iant will behave when spreading in a highly vaccinated population such as the UK, or whether the virus can evade the protection offered by vaccines against severe disease. The new study estimated that the risk of reinfection for November  to , when Omicron was circulating, was . times higher than in the first wave of the pandemic in early . In contrast, the risk of reinfection in South Africa was lower in the Beta and Delta waves than in the first wave. The findings suggest Omicron could cause a wave of infections in people with some prior immunity.  The researchers, from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases , looked at data from almost . million people with Covid- who had a positive test result at least  days before November . Some , suspected reinfections were identied among the ,, people . The authors concluded: Population-level evidence suggests that the Omicron iant is associated with substantial ability to evade immunity from prior infection. In contrast, there is no population-wide epidemiological evidence of immune escape associated with the Beta or Delta iants.  This finding has important implications for public health planning, particularly in countries like South Africa with high rates of immunity from prior infection. Urgent questions remain regarding whether Omicron is also able to evade vaccine-induced immunity and the potential implications of reduced immunity to infection on protection against severe disease and death. Dr Abdou Salam Gueye, regional emergency director for the World Health Organisationaposs Regional Office for Africa, told a press briefing there was concern about reinfections. She said: We monitor these reinfectionsfor the Beta and for the Delta wave we didnapost see an increase in reinfections over and above what weexpect when the force of infection changes when the wave stops. However we are seeing an increase for Omicron. And that speaks to the fact that in our population with a high seroprevalence - so where many people have had previous infection - we believe that their previous infection does not provide them protection from infection due to Omicron. However, hopefully it provides them with protection against severe disease, hospital admissions and death. She said the susceptibility of the population of South Africa is greater now because previous infection used to protect against Delta and now with Omicron and doesnapost seem to be the case. But she added: We believe that vaccines will still, however, protect against severe disease because weaposve seen this decrease in protection using vaccines with the other iants - the vaccines have always held out to prevent severe disease and admission into hospital from death. The same things that held true for the other iants, I think, to a large extent hold true for this iant. Professor Francois Balloux, from University College London , said the findings were not surprising given the number of mutations in the new iant. He said the research could not account for waning levels of immunity. He added: Risk of reinfection by the Omicron iant was estimated to be around three times higher than by the Alpha and Delta iant. The study is competently performed and highly timely as it provides the first direct evidence for the increased ability of the Omicron iant to partially bypass prior host immunity conferred by prior infection. The study does not provide any insight on the robustness of vaccine-induced immunisation against the Omicron iant. It also does not report any data on infection severity. South Africa has a low vaccination rate but a large proportion of the population has been infected during previous Covid- waves. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter The population of South Africa also tend to be fairly young with a median age of . years. As such, the results from this study are not directly portable to other settings such as Europe or North America, and more data will be needed before we can make more any robust prediction about the potential threat posed by a global spread of the Omicron iant in dferent parts of the world. Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said: This analysis does look very concerning, with immunity from previous infections being relatively easily bypassed. Might this all still be a  alarm  That is looking less and less likely. We do not yet have up-to-date information on vaccine effectiveness. However, the situation should, to some extent, be dferent with vaccine-generated immunity. The immune response from vaccination is much stronger when compared with infection-acquired immunity. Whilst there is likely to be some impact, it is likely vaccines will still provide some level of protection. The booster dose may be key here in maintaining a high level of protection. Whilst we await more data to emerge over the coming days and weeks, the message to the general public has to be: go and get all the doses you are eligible for. Keep that protection as high as possible.

A further  people who had meals at the pub on October , , were also unwell while only three diners were fine and that was because they ordered vegetarian options, , reported the Daily Star.. John Croucher, the -year-old former head chef, was handed a four-month suspended jail sentence at Reading Crown Court on Tuesday.Members of the Holy Trinity Church gathered for a meal at the pub but the meat in the shepherdaposs pie was not cooked properly the night before, the court heard.  Croucher admitted that he had been rushed and placed the meat, which had not been fully cooked, in cling film in the fridge. The next day it was cooked again with mashed potato but the temperature of the meat wasnapost checked. Croucher admitted to contravening food regulations and said: I really hate to say it but I think I was rushed. I was rushing. Remorse is an understatement. This is something I will never forget. Because of it, I am a better chef and it is just a shame the cost of it had to be what it was. Neil Billingham, the -year-old owner and landlord, admitted to three charges of contravening food regulations.  He was personally fined £,, plus £, court costs, and his company The Bobcat Pub Co was fined nearly £,. Judge Sarah Campbell said: A healthy and well person died of a gastrointestinal haemorrhage induced from vomiting. No sentence I can pass can reflect the loss caused to the family. The Crewe Arms is an important pub to the local community. I have read many references from members of the community, who all say Mr Billingham worked hard to maintain the support of the community, including Mrs Neuman’s daughter. But the judge refused to accept claims that it was a one-off mistake. While it has since gained the maximum five star food hygiene rating, at the time of the tragedy the Crewe Arms had just one star. Prosecutor Carl May-Smith pointed out how food safety officers had even been trying to help venues in the area with low ratings. He said: The pub even had the advantage of coaching from the local authority. Inspections before the offence showed there was no food safety management system in place.

Spoty Wrapped features the useraposs top artists, genres, songs, podcasts and minutes listened and generates shareable graphics. It’s safe to say that the feature is exposing some of us, with plenty of guilty pleasures sneaking onto the list. And there’s an algorithm to work out how our Spoty Wrapped is put together.According to the FAQs, Spoty will gather data from qualied users The algorithm will then narrow it down to this specic criteria:You’ve listened to at least five dferent artists You’ve listened to at least  dferent songs Streams are countedyou listen for at least  secondsThe rankings are then based on a combination of the number of plays, and the unique number of days you’ve listened. For the top five artists and top five songs, it’s all based on playcount, but the ranking of the top  songs on your playlist is dferent.  At first, it’s initially sorted by playcount, but after track , Spoty will apply ‘artist separation’ so it’s not a direct reflection of playcount. For those who enjoy a podcast whilst doing their washing up, your podcast time will count towards your general Spoty listening time. So, total minutes  music + podcasts If you listen to at least  seconds of a podcast, you’ll be eligible for at least one podcast story. Topping the artists globally this year was rapper Bad Bunny who had over . billion streams - and that was without an album release.Then we had Taylor Swt, BTS, Drake and Justin Bieber ranking as favourites all over the world.It’s hats off to Olivia Rodrigo though, who had two of her songs ‘Driver’s License’ and ‘Good  U’ in the top five songs all over the world.They were also the two top songs streamed in the UK, as well as Bad Habits by Ed Sheeran and Monteroby Lil Nas X.Now you know that there are specic calculations behind your Spoty Wrapped, you can’t really deny the fact you may have been listening to musical soundtracks all year.

Scientists are racing to work outthe new iant, first discovered in southern Africa, spreads faster, circumvents vaccines or causes worse side affects.Experts say people are presenting cold-like symptoms since receiving the vaccine and according to the ZOE Covid symptom study app, people who test positive most commonly report a headache, runny nose, sore throat and sneezing, The Sun reported.Dr Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association, said the main symptoms of Cmicron to look out for are:Fatigue Body aches Headache She described one “very interesting case” of a six-year-old girl who had “a temperature and a very high pulse rate. A World Health Organizationofficial has told the Reuters news agency that most people are not getting seriously ill, although it could still be the case.  Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, a top WHO adviser, said: “In terms of the severity profile, we have seen reports of cases with Omicron that go from mild disease all the way to severe disease. “There is some indication that some of the patients are presenting with mild disease, but again it is early days. We do have a surveillance bias right now in terms of the cases that are being detected.  “There is also a suggestion of increased hospitalisations across South Africa, but that could be the sheer fact that we have more cases. “If you have more cases you will have more hospitalisations.” Meanwhile, a health director in Botswana said  out of  people infected had no symptoms, while the other three had “very, very mild” illness. It comes as nine more cases of the Omicron iant were discovered in England taking the total across the country to .Cases have now been identied in the East Midlands, East of England, London, South East and North West.

Mr Johnson said “we don’t want people to feel that they need to start cancelling things” and insisted that “Christmas this year will be considerably better than Christmas last year”. He was speaking after business minister George Freeman appeared to muddy the waters by suggesting parties may depend on how many people are attending, while Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey suggested “snogging under the mistletoe” should be avoided with “people you don’t already know”. Health Secretary Sajid Javid “people can snog who they wish”, adding that people should be cautious but “it’s got nothing to do with the Government who you kiss or anything like that”. But Dr Penelope Toff, chair of the BMA’s public health medicine committee said “contradictory public health messages about Covid- are very unhelpful for everyone”. Dr Toff said: “There should be no confusion about what to do over the festive period. “There have been persistently high levels of Covid- infections in the community in recent months, and we now have a new iant circulating, which is worrying. ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youaposve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Sarah Beckett was doing her shopping at her local store when her e-cigarette battery reportedly exploded in her pocket. Shoppers raced to the -year-oldaposs rescue when she began to scream as her clothes went up in flames. The quick-thinking heroes doused her in water they had grabbed from bottles on the shelves, stopping her from getting badly injured. Her husband Andrew Beckett believes the cause of the explosion may have been a spare battery from an electronic cigarette that Sarah was carrying in her pocket. He told the Liverpool Echo:[She was] walking around Aldi and feels and hears something in her pocket, all seems a bit surreal but she remembers screaming and a older couple coming to her assistance. Weaposve later found out from a guy on Facebook that these batteries can shortthe positive end comes in contact with say a key or a coin.So it shorted in her pocket and exploded like a firework when you first light it, lighting her clothes, coat and jumper. Andy said luckily there were some brilliant people in the store who immediately jumped in to help after seeing Sarah, from Newton-le -Willows in distress. He said: An old couple came rushing over, as she opened her coat the red hot battery slid out of the hole it had melted and bounced along the floor still glowing orange. The old lady kicked it away, grabbed a chair from somewhere and started to douse her with water from the shelf in Aldi. The older lady stayed with her all the way through, rubbing her arms and comforting her.  Andy said he was working in North Wales when he got the awful phone call from his weaposs phone. He added: A young man then took her phone and rang me from it, I could hear her screaming and panicking in the background. I keep thinking that a few minutes earlier she would have been driving on the main roads of Newton-Le-Willows and it haunts me to think what might have happened. I think we both had a little private whimper to ourselves last night when I got her home, she was very lucky, and also very lucky that certain members of public were in the shop at the same time. People definitely need to be made aware, we didnapost have the slightest idea the dangers of a loose battery. Sarah, who was taken to hospital, is now recovering at home after receiving suspected second degree burns which she is receiving treatment for at Whiston Hospital burns unit.

Hollee Lynnea-Kolenda Darnell, , who is from the US city of Minneapolis, Minnesota, got hitched recently to new hubby, Jackson, at a ceremony in Florida. Though the day started well, a sudden bout of sickness caused her to swoon into her concerned hubbyaposs arms during their vows.Her worried sweetheart can be heard asking whether she is okay as she comes back around. Hollee - dressed in a flowing, white bridal gown - shakes her head and stumbles over to the edge of the gazebo, and vomits over the side.

The footage ended there, but the bride said there was still more bad wedding luck to come. In the caption she wrote: My baby nephew pooped on my dress right after while I was puking. Hollee later explained the reason for the sudden sickness. In a follow-up video she said she hadnapost eaten or drunk enough water during her big day, leaving her really dehydrated. She added: It was also Florida, and it was so hot and humid that day. We were drenched, it was so hot.Iaposm also prone to passing out, my doctor says I have low blood pressure and low iron. I guess I was just doomed from the start.  I wasnapost throwing up too much just because there wasnapost anything in my stomach so it wasnapost like the nasty, nasty throw up. My sister had a fan on my baby nephew, she came over to put that fan on me and as sheaposs holding my nephew, he starts pooping. And the poop goes down her arm onto my dress. The couple had already tied the knot at court a few hours before the outdoor do, which was just a small gathering with close friend and family.

The British socialite drafted in draconian rules when she took over the running of the billionaire paedophile’s Palm Beach home in Florida while it was overrun with “hundreds” of topless girls. Epstein’s former housekeeper Juan Alessi today took to the stand in Maxwell’s sex grooming and abuse trial in New York to detail how his job changed when she arrived. From the day she came to the house, she right away took over and she mentioned to me she was going to be the lady of the house,” said Alessi, who managed the Florida property from  to . The -year-old, who once visited Maxwell’s London home, said his relationship with Epstein was cordial until she arrived.  “Only I was supposed to speak to Mr Epstein when he asked me questions,” Alessi recalled as one of Maxwell’s missives. “At the end of my stay, there was a time when she say, ‘Jeffrey doesn’t like to be looked at in his eyes. You should never look at his eyes - just look at another part of the room and answer him.” Alessi went on to detail what became expected of him including ensuring “the cars had to be immaculate,” and filled with  bills while “the house had to be run like a five-star hotel.” When he was asked by the prosecutionhe ever saw females by the pool, Mr Alessi replied hundreds of times.” Asked what percentage were they topless, he said “about  per cent to  per cent of the time.” Pushed further about Maxwell’s time at the house, where Prince Andrew once stayed and which was knocked down earlier this year, the former housekeeper was asked where she slept when in the home. “She would sleep in Mr Epsteinaposs bedroom,” he replied. Mr Alessi said Maxwell, , refused to call him by his real name, Juan, instead addressing him by its English adaptation. “She called me John,” he said. Mr Alessi said he worked long hours for the couple, clocking up to  hours per sht when he began working for the financier in .

A lot of work. A lot of work,” he told the jury. Mr Alessi complained about the y checklist of tasks Maxwell had him perform, which he said was made for ten men, not one and a half. He called it very degrading to him. The full indictment against her lists six charges: conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts enticement of a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity transporting a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity sex trafficking conspiracy and sex trafficking of a minor. The defendant is further alleged to have lied under oath by hiding her participation in Epsteinaposs offences during a separate civil case. These offences are to be heard at a later date in a separate trial. Maxwell, who has been held in a US jail since her arrest in July last year, denies all charges. If convicted she faces up to  years in prison. Epstein committed suicide in August  while in jail. He was arrested a month earlier and charged with child sex offences.

The -year-old photographer explained: It could be one of those things where they werenapost actually looking and they were trying to get past, but it does look like they were looking at them. It looks pretty funny.I feel sorry for the lads because I might have caught them out there a bit, but it happens. I didnapost mean to catch anything like that. It was a complete coincidence. I remember taking the photo but I didnapost notice anything. The girls were enjoying the chance to get a photo and I was just focusing on them. Iaposm always keeping an eye out for anything that looks inappropriate but nothing like that stood out to me with this one.  I wasnapost even aware of the photo going viral, but the DJ told me about it when I went into work. Iaposm editing these at the end of my sht at about am, so admittedly every now and again I do miss something. I sort through ones that are definitely not suitable to go on.

If you donapost use the  and arenapost sure what is, itaposs essentially a breakdown of the top songs and artists that Spoty users have been listening to over the past  months.This used to just be sent as a link via an email but is now much more fun, with graphics that are sharable on social media stories on s such as Instagram. The tag #SpotyWrapped was trending on Twitter on December  and as it gained attention, a tweet shared last year by a young woman named Jewel Ham resurfaced and caused a stir. In her post, she claims that she came up with the current Wrapped story format while working as a design intern for Spoty during the summer of .Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.She wrote: I really invented the Spoty wrapped story concept as an intern project in  and they havenapost looked back since LMAO. Alongside this, she shared images of her original designs for the company.This year Jewel said she wouldnapost be readdressing the Wrapped story format, but she did share a link to an interview she did in  with MSN all about it.She told the publication that at age  she came up with the story format as part of a project she was working on as an intern at Spoty to make Wrapped appeal better to Gen Z. Jewel claims she presented the idea to the company on her last day working with them and it was well-received but she had no idea it would grow to become what it is today. She continued to claim that she didnapost receive so much as a thank you for her contribution, although this didnapost surprise her. This was not my first corporate position, so I know that’s not really the practice, she said. Because the reality is, at the end of the day, they legally have the right to. That’s the reason it’s such an issue. It’s not just Spoty personally. They’re cool people. But these corporations, they own all their intern content. Jewel added that she did enjoy her internship at Spoty, she had a good time and loved the people she worked with. She states that she also received a stipend during her internship - one which was more generous than many other companies may offer - but she knows itaposs not a substitute for a real salary or other remuneration. Stipend - that word alone doesn’t sound right for major ideas, but that’s it. How would you have any idea when you’re onboarding that you’re going to create something so groundbreaking  At the time the MSN article was published, Spoty told the publication that it was not accurate to say that Wrapped’s stories format can be credited to one intern, as hundreds of people work on Wrapped at the company. The Mirror has contacted Spoty for further comment.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

And due to the time taken for vaccines to be made and tested the doctor said it will be impossible to stop it from dominating in this time frame. Dr Hoe Nam said it is wishful thinking to believe that a vaccine could be developed before this happened.  Frankly, Omicron will dominate and overwhelm the whole world in three to six months, he told CNBC. We wonapost be able to rush out the vaccines in time and by the time the vaccines come, practically everyone will be infected omicron given this highly infectious and transmissibility. At the same time, Moderna CEO, Stephane Bancel said last Monday it will take months to develop and ship a vaccine that specically tackles the omicron iant. More positive was Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla who said shots could be ready in less than  days. In UK government is pushing people to get booster jabs as it looks to tackle the Omicron iant and avoid a lockdown over Christmas.  Boris Johnson said: “We don’t yet know the extent to which this new wave will wash up on our shores but history shows that we cannot afford to be complacent.“If we want to control the epidemic here in the UK andwe want to avoid new restrictions on our daily lives, we must all get vaccinated as soon as we are eligible.”Ten more cases of the Omicron coronavirus iant were detected in the UK on Thursday, stated the UK Health Security Agency , bringing the total to .Currently the Delta strain accounts for % of Covid infections, according to Reuters, which started becoming more common in the Indian state of Maharashtra in March .

which swung in either direction in horrendous conditions.The sides exchanged goals in the first half, with Stuart MacLean reacting quickest in the box after the Baljaffray keeper couldn’t hold a Fraser Talbot shot and the striker scored to net his eleventh goal in eight games.Baljaffray forced a succession of corners near the end of the half and were on level terms when Red Star were only able to partially clear a corner which fell to the away side’s full back and his shot via the aid of a deflection went past young Leon Murphy in the Star goal. -Into the second half and Star could have retaken the lead when Aaron Moore latched onto a drilled cross from strike partner Stuart MacLean, however, his effort was blocked by an excellent save from the Baljaffray number one.The visitors took the lead after  minutes when a cross caused confusion in the Star defence and the Baljaffray forward had the simple task of finishing into an empty net from close range.Star huffed and puffed for an equaliser, however, they were frustrated by excellent goalkeeping until the goal came in fortuitous circumstances after a long ball was nodded past his own keeper by the Baljaffray centre back meaning the sides were level with  minutes to go.Star took the lead with five minutes remaining when Aaron Moore was able to burst clear of the Baljaffray backline and finish well into the far corner to make it -.This should have been enough to see Star over the line but Baljaffray scrambled a late equaliser when Star again failed to clear a free kick and the ball was bundled over the line to see the match end -.Lochgilphead Red Star are on their travels on Saturday November  when they face their toughest test of the season so far as they take on league leaders and title favourites

November .Star stung the hosts at Cowan Park, Barrhead, with an excellent start to the match, forcing a succession of corners before the ever-dangerous Coll McCallum finished after an excellent delivery by Craig Aitken.The visitors doubled their lead after  minutes when Craig Aitken broke clear down the left and finished with an excellent effort into the goalkeeper’s far corner to put Star - ahead.Star were under pressure for much of the remainder of the half but always carried a threat on the break, with Stuart MacLean’s pace causing the home side no end of problems.Into the second half, Arthurlie forced their way back into the match and pulled a goal back after a rare defensive lapse by Star on  minutes. Star failed to clear the danger from a cross and the unfortunate Coll McCallum erted into his own net past Leon Murphy.The Arthurlie equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when winger Sean Ross cut inside before unleashing a spectacular effort into the top corner.The hosts would have been expected to go on and win the game from here but the Star defence remained well-organised and resolute and a fine goalkeeping performance from Leon Murphy ensured the Lochgilphead side ed home with a well-earned point.Star put their unbeaten league record on the line on Saturday November  when they welcome fellow Argyll side Cardross to the Joint Campus G.

They have no control over pricing and stocking policy, which is decided by the board.#Stressing that the supermarket operates a UK pricing policy, a Co-op spokesperson said: #Co-op is committed to serving and supporting its rural communities, conveniently, including areas where other retailers often do not trade due to the increased operational costs.#Like all retailers, Co-op has experienced some patchy disruption to the availability of some products, and it is working with suppliers to re-stock as quickly as possible.#Alongside well-known brands, Co-op#s award-winning own-brand products provide shoppers with choice # delivering quality and value, while also enabling customers and community causes to unlock additional value and benefits through its membership programme.#Mr Bates added: #The Co-op bosses in Manchester need to realise that the Tarbert Co-op and others in rural locations are not convenience stores. These are often the only store for miles and are therefore leline stores.#If they do not understand this, then they do not understand the communities they are serving.#Speaking on Wednesday this week, Mr Bates said he had received no reply from Co-op management.He said ##apart from an automated receipt reply, I have heard nothing further.

their Christmas festivities, despite scientists raising the alarm about the risks associated with gathering for social events.The Conservative Party chairman, Oliver Dowden, said his party had no intention of cancelling its own Christmas drinks, and that others should continue with their celebrations.It comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who received his booster dose of the Covid vaccine on Thursday, urged the public to ldquocontinue as they are within the new measures introduced to stop the spread of the virus, following the emergence of the Omicron iant.Senior Tories, including Health Secretary Sajid Javid, have looked to encourage the public to hold firm to their pre-Christmas plans, with the hospitality industry warning it had suffered a ldquoslew of cancellations after Omicron sparked fresh safety fears.Mr Dowden told Sky News: ldquoThe message to people, I think, is fairly straightforward ndash which is: keep calm, carry on with your Christmas plans.ldquoWersquove put the necessary restrictions in place, but beyond that keep calm and carry on.The former culture secretary said he understood there were ldquoconcerns about the Omicron iant of

should continue with their plans as intended, Mr Dowden said, as he encouraged people to take up the offer of a booster jab.Asked about the Toriesrsquo own party plans, he told BBC Breakfast: ldquoI think it is still planned, and I donrsquot intend to cancel it as chairman of the Conservative Party.Medical experts have struck a more cautious tone, however, urging people to avoid large groups this

Associationsaid people should be encouraged to ldquoavoid large groups and meet outdoors where possible over the festive period.The debate over social gatherings comes as scientists continue to study the possible threat posed by Omicron.A study in South Africa, where the mutation was first detected, has suggested that the iant has ldquosubstantial ability to cause reinfection in people who have previously had Covid.The research, which has not been peer-reviewed, found people who had tested positive for coronavirus could pick up the virus again, potentially causing a wave of infections in those with some prior immunity.It did not say how the iant will behave when spreading in a highly vaccinated population such as the UK, or whether the virus can evade the protection offered by vaccines against severe disease.But experts in the UK believe their research on the impact of booster vaccines could offer hope in the fight against Omicron.vw,vw,px, px\"The CovBoost study found that booster jabs may well offer good protection in the face of the iant.A team studying the effects of third doses said the bodyrsquos T cell immune response after a booster shot is such that it may provide protection from hospital admission and death.The study also backs up the UKrsquos decision to offer Pfizer or Moderna as a third shot, with mRNA jabs leading to the most signicant rise in immunity levels.Professor Saul Faust, trial lead and director of the NIHR Clinical Research Facility at University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, said the vaccines worked well against

whistles from overhead, which mark the arrival of redwings.Redwings are highly sociable ndash it is not uncommon to see them in flocks of hundreds as they roam throughout the country.Their main diet is berries and they seem to display a preference for some types over others it is believed that this is based on the softness and sweetness of the berries.In mild winters you are likely to see large flocks of redwings feasting on their favourites of hawthorns and rowans however, in harsh months they may forage for fruit in gardens or urban areas.Once disturbed, the birds will take off and seek refuge in neighbouring trees or hedges. Alongside eating berries, they also feed on small insects and mealworms.Unlike other members of the thrush family which build nests in the trees, redwings prefer to build their cup-shaped nests on the ground.The nest is usually well hidden in the dense vegetation and made out of grass, mosses and twigs.Most redwings breed in Scandinavia and Iceland, with a small number breeding in the UK, most of which are concentrated in the Scottish Highlands. The population arriving here from Iceland appears slightly darker and bigger and it is treated as the distinct subspecies coburni.Unlike many migratory birds, which remain loyal to their wintering grounds, redwings present a nomadic lestyle ndash driven by food availability, they rarelyto the same place.I have already seen my first redwings in Edinburgh but I am yet to find them in East Lothian this autumn.Last winter in Musselburgh was fabulous! I particularly remember the snowfall in January during a couple of days I took off work. I liked every minute and, despite cold hands and feet, I enjoyed walking along the Esk.At one point, I spotted a buzzard perching on a snowy branchand headed towards it.As soon as I captured the bird of prey, I heard a familiar lsquotseeprsquo call coming from the hedges.I knew the redwings must have been having a lavish meal as the call was getting louder with every step I took, but I could not see them.It amazes me how dficult it is to spot these birds, even though they are medium-sized and always in large groups.I managed to sneak inside the bush and, when I looked up, I saw at least  redwings. The birds were incredibly noisy and constantly on the move. The whole bush was bustling and I felt like I was sitting at the heart of a busy factory!Until now, I found that experience one of the most challenging. It was not easy to operate the camera in such a tight space, with twigs scratching my face the entire time. I did not have a clear view of the birds either, but I could not move as it would spook them!The low winter sun was already disappearing but, eventually, I did manage to find a gap and push the camera through. After taking a few photographs, I decided to head back home.When I ed to the same spot the following day, the redwings were gone.If you have enjoyed my pictures this year and would like to see more, I now have several designs of my WildleCalendars for sale.

meeting to discuss the future of the service, before he received a response.The X bus was suspended last year by East Coast Buses, a subsidiary of Lothian Buses, following the introduction of national lockdown restrictions.The service ran through North Berwick, Dirleton, Gullane, Aberlady and Longniddry, then directly to Edinburgh via the A.Commuters from Dirleton, Gullane and Aberlady now face an extra hour in their daily commute to Edinburgh using the  bus service, which stops at Prestonpans, Wallyford, Musselburgh and Portobello.An online petition launched by Mr Hoy calling for the reinstatement of the service has now received more than  signatures.Mr Hoy said: ldquoIn early October, my office contacted East Coast Buses, who issued a standard response outlining the reasons for continued withdrawal of the service, including challenges with recruitment, the need to prioritise key services and the focus on delivering the  service.ldquoI recognise these challenges, but I also recognise they apply across all routes across the whole of the Lothians and are not confined to the X route.ldquoAfter a number of residents living in Dirleton, Gullane, Aberlady and Longniddry reached out to me about the X bus, I launched a petition calling for the reinstatement of the service.ldquoI wrote to East Coast Buses on two occasions requesting a face-to-face meeting, and followed this up with a third letter to the interim managing director of Lothian Buses.ldquoLothian Buses is owned by the four Lothian council areas, which includes East Lothian Council. That makes it accountable to the residents of our community.ldquoThe number of signatures on the petition shows the clear strength of feeling in the area about reinstating the X bus.ldquoAt this point, Lothian Buses have their heads buried in the sand ndash they cannot keep ignoring our communities.In a letter to Mr Hoy dated November , Nigel Serafini, interim managing director of Lothian Buses, said it was the companyrsquos ldquopriority to re-establish the X ldquoas soon as driver resource permits.He added: ldquoThe X covers no additional areas that service  does not .ldquoIn contrast, the X is the only service that operates to East Linton, West Barns and Dunbar.

I cant see the situation dramatically changing in the next couple of weeks - we have to watch this space...thats genuinely where we are scientically right now.\": Latest Omicron casein Scotland not connected to othersA total of  cases of the Omicron iant have been confirmed in Scotland so far,including at leastnine which are linked and have been traced back to a single private event held on November .It is unclear whether the three confirmedtoday- two in NHS Lanarkshire and one in the Greater Glasgow area- are linked to this event or separate.One caseidentied in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde region, confirmed on Wednesday, was not linked to that event.The Omicron iant was first detected in Botswana in November and appears to be driving a rapid surge in Covid infections in South Africa, with signs that it is overtaking Delta as the dominant strain.There are concerns that its high number of mutations - including  on the spike protein used by the virus to infect cells - could make it more resistant to current vaccines and immunity.There are signs from Public Health Scotland data that the recent fall in Covid cases stopped on November  with a very small increase in positive cases by November If protection against infection is reduced, however, scientists remain confident that vaccines would still provide a strong defence against serious illness or death - as has already been seen following the emergence of the Delta strain.Prof Bauld said: \"I think we should be worried about Omicron because it really, genuinely does look more transmissible.\"We dont know about disease severity or immune escape from the vaccines, but we have confidence that eventhe vaccines are weakened in terms of transmission and infection that they will still work in terms of saving peoples lives basically. Even these current vaccines that we have.\"So I am worried, but Im not saying that these vaccines are useless - theyre still working and will still work, evennot as well, against Omicron.\": Abnormal spike in neonatal deaths not linked to Covid in mothers orbabiesProf Bauld told podcast listeners that it was \"absolutely imminent\" that boosters will be added to Scotlands vaccine passport apps, allowing people travelling abroad to show that they have had a third jag.Some countries are now requesting proof of boosters for entry as part of border controls, or for access into leisure and hospitality venues.However, Prof Bauld said she was not in favour of tougher rules on arrivals into the UK.The Scottish Government has asked Westminster to consider extending home self-isolation to eight days for travellers arriving from non-red list countries, with people only able to end self-isolationthey test negative for Covid on a PCR test taken on day eight.Currently, all arrivals have to take a PCR test within two days of entering the UK and remain in isolation until they receive a negative result.Prof Bauld said this was \"proportionate\".She added: \"Im really hopeful that we dont go in that direction [eight-day self-isolation] unless we absolutely have to.\"The main reason for that is that when you see domestic spread of this iant, then thinking about travel as the main source becomes less of an issue.\"Its too early to tellthat would occur - governments arent ruling it out - but its not the plan at the moment.\""},{"url":null,"title":"letters-snp-shouldnt-get-excited-one-rogue-poll","story":"Nicola Sturgeon is caught between a rock and a hard place and how she handles this is critical. The SNP was always a party of protest and dissent. Now it is experiencing the real dilemmas such behaviour creates for those in authority.Indyref is still in the melting pot and the manold crises in the NHS are not going away, to say nothing of all the other pressing problems in her in-tray. Ms Sturgeon has ridden her luck for many years now. Is it about to run out Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow.* JOHN Dunloplikes to submit short acerbic letters to The Herald, usually with an anti-Scottish independence slant. Perhaps he was a bit premature with his latest effort, given the result of the recent Ipsos-Mori poll showing support for Scottish independence at %. Could it be that the electorate of Scotland really do want to catch up with the rest of the modern world, including Barbados Alec Oattes, Ayr.PARTYS OVER FOR JOHNSONCOME on over to his place,Come on, hes having a party.With loads of booze and plenty of nibbles,Boris is having a party tonight.How very galling, how very Downing Street one rule for us and another for those behind the black door. While we all wearily faced another lockdown last Christmas, after a frightening year, and with the prospect of spending a dismal festive season cut off from family and friends, No  staff were merrily rocking round the clock . Whether he was present or not, the party took place within the Prime Ministers official home and on his watch.Given all of Mr Johnsons gaffes since he took office, perhaps we shouldnt really be surprised at this one, but somehow this latest example of cynical insensitivity and lack of solidarity with the rest of the population really sticks in the craw. Mr Johnson declares that all Covid guidelines were followed, but seems unable to grasp that holding the party at all was a breach of his own rules.The partys over for Mr Johnson it will take him a long time to clear up the mess.Ruth Marr, Stirling.WHATS GREAT ABOUT THE CENTRE MARK Smith claims he identies with Sir Keir Starmer because the Labour leader is \"attempting to steer the Labour Party back to the \"centre\" .Perhaps he could elaborate and tell us the last time the Labour Party was in the \"centre\". The last Labour government which I voted for in  will, in my opinion, forever be associated with the following: its kow-towing to the Bush White House and the oil billionaires which determined its policy its sycophancy towards media moguls and policies which allowed the City of London to run rampant. The upshot of course was the biggest financial collapse in the countrys history and one of the biggest foreign policy disasters in the countrys history.Is this Mr Smiths centre Many people I feel will still be in the dark about what Sir Keir stands for perhaps he has let Mr Smith in on his secret. It is worth remembering that the most effective British politician of the th century did not eschew \"radical and damaging ideologies\". This is what made Mrs Thatcher, loathe her or love her, such a towering figure.Brian Harvey, Hamilton.TOO LATE TO THE PROBLEMSTHE debate in Holyrood on Wednesday on the cases of hospital-acquired infections was enlightening. The main argument from SNP politicians was that they had carried out reviews and acted on the recommendations.Just as with the impact of Storm Arwen, the SNP is always chasing its tail trying to fight fires rather than stopping them starting in the first place.Jane Lax, Aberlour.FOLLOW SWEDEN ON MP STANDARDSANDY Macivers article suggesting paying politicians more to get better service was astonishing. For the last few decades we have heard endless justications for the absurdly-high salaries paid to executives . That has not prevented financial disasters, business failures, scandals and revelations of incompetence and corruption.Mr Maciver should perhaps study the government of Sweden, where politicians do not have official cars and drivers or other privileges. They cannot vote themselves extra money for constituency travel. They live in state-owned apartments in Stockholm but do not get allowances for homes or second homes. They have no way of claiming for duck ponds or moat cleaning.Their tax s are publicly available like most other information.In  the deputy prime minister was sacked because she made a small purchase using a government credit card, despite having already refunded the money.If our politicians received salaries comparable with those paid in Sweden and worked under similar conditions, our government would be more credible. But perhaps Mr Maciver thinks that the UK is already much better managed than Sweden Peter M Dryburgh, Edinburgh.START TREATING US AS ADULTSWHILE there can be little doubt that the new Omicron iant of Covid is cause for concern, it is interesting that we are being given very little information about the state of health of the very few people who are unfortunate enough to have contracted it. Are they seriously ill  Hospitalised  Or only mildly affected We donrsquot actually know, because it would appear that governments across the UK keep this information secret in the belief that giving this information to the public would affect their attitudes towards taking precautions. The general assumption is that we canrsquot be trusted to do the right thing to prevent transmission. Well, after nearly two years of bad decisions by our leaders during which, in general, we have followed their guidance, it may be time to treat us more like adults than children.At the start of the pandemic, most of our leaders stated that there would be an open and honest consultation with the public about measures to control the spread of the disease. It didnrsquot happen then, it hasnrsquot happened since, and it isnrsquot happening now.Dave Henderson, Glasgow.FM HAS AGAIN FAILED TO ACTTEN days after Omicron was detected in Scotland the First Minister has failed to act yet again. Unlike Austria she hasnt made the vaccine compulsory, or made it compulsory for NHS or care workers like in England.Nor has she introduced eight-day isolation for people flying into Scotland despite calling for the UK Government to do it in England.She hasnt led by example by making Holyrood Parliament online again, nor has she banned hospital visits, or shutdown or curfewed pubs and nightclubs like many European countries. In other words, once again she has done nothing but try to sht the blame where. As we head towards , Covid deaths in Scotland by the end of this winter, Nicola Sturgeon should be ashamed.David Watson, Edinburgh.IN THE LINE OF FIREJILL Stephensons letterdisplays a curious lack of knowledge, as her reference to investigations would suggest she has never heard of the presumption of innocence. In her eyes it is quite okay to lambast the SNP over its actions, but not so in relation to Mr Johnsons party. I rarely write about politics, but her letter is nothing to do with politics it is about plumbing the depths of shallowness.I much prefer to write on other matters, such as the recent discussion on the elusiveness of snipe and woodcock. It brought to mind my late fathers account of a shoot in Aberdeenshire. The keeper drew up a line of shooters to walk along the face of a gentle slope, placing the men in descending order of quality, with the best shots at the higher end. Almost at once a snipe arose at the top and flew down the entireof the line, with every man firing at least one shot at it until it reached the last in the line, who downed it. The keeper walked over to pick up the bird and, on holding it aloft, declared: \"Thatll teach ye tae flee stracht.\" We should be glad such a bird exists as otherwise, Army marksmen might have ended up being called woodcockers.George F Campbell, Glasgow.Read more: I can reassure the doubters: vaccines are safer than you are being led to believe"},{"url":null,"title":"storm-arwen-1-500-homes-scotland-left-without-power-week","story":"Around  troops have been sent to carry out door-to-door checks and offer welfare support in north-east of Scotland, where , Scottish and Southern Electricity Networkscustomers remained off supply at am on Friday.Jim Savage, chief executive of Aberdeenshire Council, said SSEN told him it hopes to get the number of customers off power down to , on Friday, though some may not be reconnected until the weekend.He told BBC Breakfast: ldquoItrsquos been a really tough week for families and communities across all of Aberdeenshire.

The forecasting ides the road network into inidual routes rather than geographic areas making it easier for decision makers to direct resources where they are needed most.#Each island is designated as a route, while the Mainland is ided into eight routes. Up until this year, the decision on how, and when, to treat the road network in the winter months has relied upon the information received from two weather stations at the Mill of Rango in Sandwick and at Kirkwall Airport, basically covering the East and West, while this has been helpful, it was a very broad brush.“The system is being closely monitored by officers throughout the winter season with view to summarise its performance at the conclusion of the trial next year. This will determinewe want to adopt this technology on a permanent basis.”Stressing that road safety remains the top priority, she said:“I want to reassure our communities thatwe are treating areas of the West Mainland, but not parts of the East for example, we are doing this because we are confident – based on the data – that the roads in the East do not require it.”There are km of priority one roads in Orkney, km of priority two routes and km of priority three roads.In line with nationally recommended guidance, the council’s Winter Service Policy - points out that the network will be treated in the morning when road surface temperatures are predicted to be below C, and in the afternoon when they are predicted to be below C.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We are still hoping for the best and hoping that our developing understanding of this iant will reduce rather than increase our concern.“I very much hope that additional protections can be avoided and while we will act on a precautionary basis, we will always seek to act out at all times in a proportionate manner.”Research is still being undertaken on the Omicron iant — which was first discovered in southern Africa — but early indications are that it might be more transmissible than the dominant Deltra strain.However, she did say that there was no evidence that the symptoms of Omicron was dferent from Delta and the disease caused is any dferent.Scientists are also working to establish what impact this new iant will have on the effectiveness of vaccines.New recommendations are set to come from the joint committee on vaccination and immunisationis set to be announced this afternoon, and this will guide the Scottish Government on the shape of the booster programme.Ms Sturgeon said that evencurrent vaccines were less effective against the new iant, that was not the same as no effectiveness, and urged more people to come forward and become double vaccinated.She also urged travel restrictions to be tightened and called on a four nations approach in order to prevent the importation of the virus from abroad.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As the trust’s chairman Dan Wise explained, it is essentially an underwater drone.He said: “This small unit will allow us to continue our collaborative research into the Orkney skate population. More specically, we will be able to get eyes underwater to look for essential fish habitat such as egg case laying grounds, nursery areas etc.“We can cover more ground with this drone when compared to ing, and the quality of the camera is greater when compared to a drop down camera – both survey styles we still do but this is another tool in the tool box.”RSPB Scotland is also going to invest in new machinery, with its £, award going to the purchase of a specialist tractor for removing vegetation.A tractor equipped with Soucy tracks will be used to cut and collect material for removal from the sites, without leaving rutted tracks or creating erosion points. This machine has signicantly less ground pressure than a normal tractor, reducing the chances of damaging sensitive habitats, and is specically designed to operate in softer ground conditions.The benefits to birdle include opening up foraging habitat, allowing flightless chicks to move around more easily, and reducing the chance of chicks becoming saturated in dense, wet vegetation.RSPB Scotland site manager in Orkney, Alan Leitch, said:“The funding means we can purchase machinery that offers us a real opportunity to upscale our annual land management efforts on the Orkney nature reserves to increase conservation benefits. These operations will help a suite of species including curlews, lapwings, and hen harriers.”The £m fund was launched in July this year and has now been extended to a total of at least £m over the next five years. On the fund in general, the Bioersity Minister, Lorna Slater, said:“Too much of Scotland’s natural environment is degraded after years of over-exploitation, but this government is committed to restoring nature and our wildle. The Nature Restoration Fund will play a big role in delivering these aspirations, and the projects we are funding today are just the beginning.#The fund kick starts a new approach, supporting longer-term, larger, landscape-scale projects across Scotland # on land and at sea # that address the twin crises of bioersity loss and climate change. Over this parliament we will invest at least £ million through the fund, delivering real change that people and nature will benefit from across the whole country.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Although folk must still enter via the south nave side door, once inside the cathedral, everyone will be able to enjoy the new glazed timber vestibule.Meredith Macbeth, St Magnus Cathedral#s historical buildings conservator, said: “We are absolutely delighted with the work so far and the new vestibule truly enhances the entryway of this wonderful building. The works are not entirely complete as the curved glass has been delayed by the supplier in Europe due to COVID, Brexit and other supply issues, but we are expecting it early . So for now the area will remain roped off from the public, but it is a delight to see the new vestibule settling in and the excited response by those who know the building so well.”Councillor Gwenda Shearer, chairwoman of OIC#s education, leisure and housing committee, said: “The cathedral really is the gt that keeps on giving to the people of Orkney and further afield.#What a beautul addition to what is a very special building. I look forward to seeing the complete, finished product which is sure to be absolutely stunning.”Elaine Grieve from the Society of the Friends of St Magnus Cathedral, who are making a substantial contribution to the costs of the work, said: “The Cathedral is so precious that it is hard to contemplate making any changes for fear they won’t do the building justice.#However, in this case, what an absolutely wonderful transformation the vestibule has made to the entrance of the building. The craftmanship is outstanding and we now have an addition which befits this treasured building loved by so many near and far.”The cathedral#s stonework also enjoyed a facelt recently.Conservation works included repointing stonework with lime mortar on the interior and exterior of the west door. Samples of original lime mortars were found deep in the constructions joints of the building and were analysed by the Scottish Lime Centre in Fe. An appropriate mix was specied, to match in manner of strength, colour and aggregate size.For anyone wishing to visit there are signs directly through the side gate, please be mindful of the restrictions in place in regards to the pandemic such as the wearing of masks and social distancing while inside.St Magnus Cathedral is managed by OIC on behalf of the people of Orkney.

Last night was the first night.”“I went down on Monday and there was no mention of it. You used to get a  per cent discount.”He added: “I was totally surprised. I only booked my ticket a week or so ago. I wasn’t advised, and it doesn’t seem astheir crew was advised – I did query it with them.”Serco NorthLink’s commercial director Jim Dow said: “We are proud to offer an extensive food and drink menu on board that is very reasonably priced and equal for all passengers.“Our commitment to working with local suppliers continues and we are proud to showcase those partnerships. “While the Islander discount code is no longer in place, all passengers do have access to a iety of choices and price points.”..Ryan Taylor has worked as a reporter since , and has been at The Shetland Times since , covering a wide iety of news topics.Before then he reported for other newspapers in the Highlands, where he was raised, and in Fe, where he began his career with DC Thomson.

It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CoGCGraduation_AlainaMaclennan_PrizeWinner-2-scaled.jpg","title":"skye graduate wins college","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe HND Sports Coaching graduate celebrated at the college’s ceremony held on Mondayin the city’s Royal Concert Hall. Alaina, who attended Plockton High School, and lives in Kyleakin, was surprised and delighted to win the prize, saying: #I am happy that my hard work during my time at college, and through the challenges of adapting to remote learning due to Covid-, have paid off.  “City of Glasgow College gave me the good foundation I needed to build and develop my future career in sports coaching.

There were no help groups, no mental health care, back then.“We went to my grannys to live for a while and then we came back to the house, the three of us, and that was it. It was a case of paddle your own canoe, really.“My dads going out to work every day as a painter and decorator and we were two young boys going out to school.“Its really just about capturing that time and the values he taught us as kids without ever really knowing he was doing it - or us realising what he was doing. The behaviours, we just kinda copied him.“Thats what I realised as I started to right this thing, that this is what it was...”Ironically, it was his grand daughters prompting that convinced him to put pen to paper in the first place.“About a year ago, my eldest grand daughter said to me - grandad, remember all the old stories you used to tell us when we were kids, about our grandad, racing the pigeons. She told me one of them, almost word for word. I thought, I really must capture those for posterity, for the family. RETIREMENT “Obviously, when retirement and lockdown came into play I had a lot more time on my hands so I sat down at the laptop to fiddle about and to write these wee stories.“As I started, this thing just took on a le of its own and became something completely dferent which was kind of a surprise to me, but a very pleasant surprise, as I really enjoyed writing it.”And I really enjoyed reading it, this simple tale of a hard-working father and his two sons making their way in the world.But the real stars of the book are the pigeons to whom Frankie cleverly lends human traits, such as the ability to talk - characters like Proud Boy, Warhorse and Bootsy.And, of course, Princess Sofia, who we come to learn resembles Frankie’s own mother.The trials and tribulations of the loft in attempting to win the biggest prizes in the sport resemble the struggles faced by Frankie’s family in an era when times were tough.But this isn’t a depressing tale rather, it is an uplting story of how families and, by extension, close-knit communities bandied together to overcome adversity. With a healthy dose of pigeon racing nostalgia thrown in for good measure.“Whilst some of the pigeon names and details have been changed the book is based on true le events,” continues Frankie.“It was never my intention to get the book published, I only started writing it as something to give the grandkids. “I really dont care about the business side of things – its just nice that people can read about my father.“I suppose people are quite surprised about the book but there’s more interest there than anything which is great.“Depending on the feedback who knows, there might even be a second one.”‘The Penzance Smash,’ published by Austin McAuley is out now."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4283615.jpg--.jpg?1638527740000\n","title":"demand high for booster jabs says trust","story":"The Seven Towers Mass Vaccination Centre is open for booster jabs for those aged over  group as per Department of Health guidance.

[Stock image]Mark BainTwitterEmailDecember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailPupils and parents have been warned to prepare for part-time education in the new year as schools try to cope with staff shortages due to Covid-related absences.Read MoreNI school funds ‘used inappropriately’ and teachers unhappy over ‘culture of fear’Sammy Wilson slammed for ‘distasteful ding dong’ tweet as DUP MPs vote against rules to combat Omicron in EnglandAnd the principal of a Co Down post primary school has said the current staffing crisis in schools has become a serious “health and safety” matter.St Malachy’s High School in Castlewellan has written to parents informing them that children will be facing some time out of class from January unless the situation improves.Many other schools are already working a system where year groups are sent home when no teachers are available, with over , staff off through Covid-related issues across Northern Ireland, and the number growing every day. Unions have called for the Executive to consider early closure before Christmas to alleviate pressure.The Department of Education has dismissed closing early ahead of the holidays, and the UK Government on Wednesday took the unusual step of also rejecting the suggestion from a NASUWT union official in Northern Ireland.When asked whether schools in England will be kept open until the Christmas break, Children’s Minister Will Quince told the Commons Education Committee: “That is certainly our plan and we want to see schools stay open.”St Malachy’s High School informed parents on Wednesday that the decision had been taken to plan for students to attend on a rotational basis in the new year.Principal Orla O’Neill informed parents: “We in St Malachy’s have reached a point where staff absence is becoming a health and safety concern as the number of staff absent is increasing day by day. Today we have  teachers off. That equates to a quarter of our teaching staff.“Like all schools we have tried in earnest to secure substitute teachers to fill these positions to no avail. We have on several occasions, contacted over  subs on a given day to try to secure cover.“I have discussed the situation with the chair of Governors and we feel that we may have to go down the route that other post primaries are taking and ask that certain year groups stay at home on certain days.“We will be putting a plan in place in the new year. This is certainly not something we want to do and we have worked hard to avoid this so far this term but the situation is such that the measures we have in place are not sustainable with the current level of absence.”Helena Macormac, director of the National Association of Head Teachers, said contingency plans need to be in place, but we do not want to see a circuit breaker”. We would prefer itthat could be avoided, but safety has to be paramount. Be prepared is what we’re saying, but we really don’t want this to happen,” she added.But she added that “ there are not the substitute teachers in the system, then schools cannot open safely.”The Department of Education said: “There are no plans to close schools early for the Christmas period. Any decision to do so would be taken by the Executive and would be based on medical and scientic advice. We all know that the best place for children in terms of mental health, wellbeing and education is in school.”The Department said it “is aware of the pressures schools have been facing throughout the pandemic and the dficulties faced by some schools in securing appropriate cover as a result of staff absence”. We are actively considering how best to support schools in responding to the issues they currently face and are liaising with Department of Health colleagues while continuing to follow medical and scientic advice.”Related topicsThe Executive OfficeDepartment of EducationMore On The Executive OfficeOmicron cases are likely to be confirmed here ‘in coming days’Social media a ‘conveyor belt’ for abuse of childrenSome NI health workers could receive bonus payment as Swann bids to avert catastrophic strike actionReport on flags and culture just kicks can down road, says Long PremiumAllison MorrisOpinionFlags report a pointless fence-sitting exercise is a waste of five years and £kMost Read‘Mark Simpson, BBC News, in the freezing cold water at Helen’s Bay...’Suspended Mid and East Antrim chief Anne Donaghy to take legal action against councilNI school funds ‘used inappropriately’ and teachers unhappy over ‘culture of fear’NI pupils told: Prepare for part-time schoolTUV Lagan Valley candidate Dr William Kitchen considering legal action over Twitter postTop VideosPlayVideo: School bully is knocked out after trying to punch a blind kid - Warning Graphic LanguagePlayVideo: Middle class madam Anglea Cosgrave - brothel queen behind one of Northern Ireland’s biggest prostitution ringsPlayWatch: New trailer for Kenneth Branagh#s Belfast releasedLatest CoronavirusOmicron cases are likely to be confirmed here ‘in coming days’Some NI health workers could receive bonus payment as Swann bids to avert catastrophic strike actionCovid- certicate scheme: lateral flow results must be registered on official government systemCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Two deaths and , new cases reportedMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageLatestRalf Rangnick open to managing Manchester United beyond this seasonThree arrested over death of woman in Co DownThomas Partey thinks Arsenal remain on upward trajectory despite loss to UnitedHe needs help: Dean Smith wants Norwich to ease scoring burden on Teemu PukkiVirgin Media TV services restored after power outage,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Pic PacemakerLisa SmythTwitterDecember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailSome health workers in Northern Ireland could receive a one-off bonus as the Health Minister launches a bid to avert catastrophic strike action.Robin Swann has said he plans to ask for additional cash to enable him to make the payment to a range of NHS employees.While he said the final details of the financial scheme have yet to be decided, it is understood it would amount to a non-consolidated payment of .% of each employee’s salary which would only be made to workers in the lowest pay bands.Revealing plans to award a bonus to NHS staff during Stormont’s health committee meeting, Mr Swann issued an appeal for workers to not go ahead with strike action.“I would ask them not to go on industrial action because I don’t think our health service will stand any reduction in the workforce or the workforce that is there,” he said.It comes after the Department of Health announced this week that health service employees will receive a % pay rise — despite the fact unions have warned it is insufficient for a workforce that has been stretched to the limit during the pandemic.Unions have refused to rule out strike action ahead of ballots to establish whether members want to accept the %.Read MoreStab vests and body-worn cameras on the agenda to protect NI paramedics from violent assaultsMr Swann was challenged during the hearing by People Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll, who described the % pay award as “insulting”.Addressing the UUP minister, Mr Carroll said: “Obviously yourself, with Executive support, are imposing a % pay offer. I’ve said before, I’ll say again, it’s insulting, it’s below what they’re worth, it’s below inflation and below the rising cost of fuel and everything .“It falls way short of what these people deserve, society going through a pandemic they have saved peoples’ lives, they have dropped their loved ones, and they were with people in their darkest hour in many cases.”Mr Swann said: I would ask them not to go on industrial action because I don’t think our health service will stand any reduction in the workforce.“I am willing and have discussed with the trade unions to prioritise a bid as part of January monitoring for additional resource for an additional non-consolidated award, but again that will need approval from the Executive and the Department of Finance.“I don’t want to see them go to industrial action, it’s not something I would ask them to do and I will keep talking and working with them to make sure we don’t get to that point.”Read MoreNI waiting list crisis: Seriously ill patients competing with each other for vital operations, senior medic warnsRita Devlin from the Royal College of Nursing in Northern Ireland said: “We have been clear from the outset that it will be our members — the nursing staff who are helping to hold the health service together — who will make a decision on whether they agreethis is a fair pay award.“Taking industrial action is not something nursing staff ever consider lightly, however, this option will be examined carefullyour members direct us to do so.”Related topicsRobin SwannDepartment of HealthPeople Before ProfitGerry CarrollThe Executive OfficeDepartment of Finance More On Robin SwannOmicron cases are likely to be confirmed here ‘in coming days’Covid- certicate scheme: lateral flow results must be registered on official government systemNI Covid booster jabs pass , as Executive confirm keeping schools open ‘priority’ PremiumUUP defends Beattie’s US visit amid ‘work from home’ guidanceCoronavirus NI: Where to get your booster vaccine as clinics ramp up programmeMost Read‘Mark Simpson, BBC News, in the freezing cold water at Helen’s Bay...’Suspended Mid and East Antrim chief Anne Donaghy to take legal action against councilNI school funds ‘used inappropriately’ and teachers unhappy over ‘culture of fear’NI pupils told: Prepare for part-time schoolTUV Lagan Valley candidate Dr William Kitchen considering legal action over Twitter postTop VideosPlayVideo: School bully is knocked out after trying to punch a blind kid - Warning Graphic LanguagePlayVideo: Middle class madam Anglea Cosgrave - brothel queen behind one of Northern Ireland’s biggest prostitution ringsPlayWatch: New trailer for Kenneth Branagh#s Belfast releasedLatest CoronavirusOmicron cases are likely to be confirmed here ‘in coming days’Covid- certicate scheme: lateral flow results must be registered on official government systemCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Two deaths and , new cases reportedMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling average‘Closing of schools must be avoided’, says Children’s Commissioner Koulla YiasoumaLatestThree arrested over death of woman in Co DownThomas Partey thinks Arsenal remain on upward trajectory despite loss to UnitedHe needs help: Dean Smith wants Norwich to ease scoring burden on Teemu PukkiVirgin Media TV services restored after power outageWomen in Media Belfast: new group’s inaugural gathering draws a large attendance,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She has also separately raised issues with her employer.The statement from Ms Donaghy’s solicitor said she is “deeply concerned” about “systemic leakage of confidential Council decision making to the media and other third parties”.“The latest instance of such leaks relates to a password protected confidential email communication sent to Councillors confirming a decision on her suspension,” KRW Law added.“Within a very short time of her receiving formal correspondence about her suspension the decision was posted on social media.”The statement added that throughout this situation “she has retained her dignity in the face of often heavy media intrusion into her family and private le”.“To date there has been zero accountability on the part of the Council on the manner in which it has conducted itself on a series of issues all of which are the subject of pending disciplinary and other proceedings,” it added.Mid and East Antrim Borough Council said in a statement: “We do not comment on staffing matters and no inference should be drawn from this.”Meanwhile, the DUP group leader on Mid and East Antrim Borough Council has claimed that the Food Standards Agency is to fund the employment of  Environmental Health Officers implementing checks associated with the Northern Ireland Protocol at Larne Port for three years.Councillor Gregg McKeen said he was disappointed at the development.“No amount of money offered by the Food Standards Agency will persuade us to comply with the damaging dictate of the Northern Ireland Protocol,” he said.“Apart from anything , this offer provides no guarantee for the ratepayers of Mid and East Antrim who could be left with a staggering bill for the long term, continued employment of these officers.“As committed to by the leaders of unionism in the Joint Declaration on Ulster Day, I am calling on UUP and TUV councillors to back us in opposing and rejecting the Foods Standards Agency’s lure of additional monies.”In response, Maria Jennings, FSA NI Director, said: “The Food Standards Agency’s priority is to ensure high standards of food safety and consumer protection. We are working with partners in government to determine the impacts of the Northern Ireland Protocol and supporting District Councils with the implementation of controls currently required within NI food law.“Funding for these controls is provided by the Department of Finance, facilitated by the Food Standards Agency.“District Councils with designated ports are legally responsible for carrying out checks on certain foods so that people in Northern Ireland can continue to enjoy a wide range of safe products.”Most ReadSuspended Mid and East Antrim chief Anne Donaghy to take legal action against council‘Mark Simpson, BBC News, in the freezing cold water at Helen’s Bay...’NI school funds ‘used inappropriately’ and teachers unhappy over ‘culture of fear’TUV Lagan Valley candidate Dr William Kitchen considering legal action over Twitter postNI pupils told: Prepare for part-time schoolTop VideosPlayVideo: School bully is knocked out after trying to punch a blind kid - Warning Graphic LanguagePlayVideo: Middle class madam Anglea Cosgrave - brothel queen behind one of Northern Ireland’s biggest prostitution ringsPlayWatch: New trailer for Kenneth Branagh#s Belfast releasedLatest Northern IrelandThree arrested over death of woman in Co DownWomen in Media Belfast: new group’s inaugural gathering draws a large attendanceSteven BeacomOpinionIrish League mid-term report - Linfield still the team to beat but it should be win or bust for Mick McDermott at GlentoranDergview ready to ‘fill Darragh Park’ for Glentoran’s Irish Cup first round visitNew pilot to help GPs identy domestic and sexual abuse launches across  NI practicesLatestTories hail by-election success as Labour claims PM should be ‘worried’Civil servant ‘tried to take own le due to prolonged racial bullying’Little Mix on it being the ‘right time’ to take a breakFixing the defence and playing with control – inside Ralf Rangnick’s unveilingMarcelo Bielsa welcomesof Leeds duo Patrick Bamford and Luke Ayling,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Butwe were all truly honest, isn’t it the side dishes we’re actually looking forward to most  googletag.cmd.push Pigs in blankets, bread sauce, cranberry sauce, roasted parsnips, stuffing… these tasty jewels beside the golden bird are arguably the best bit. We asked some celeb chefs and food writers to share their favourite festive sides, with tips for how to cook them too… . Ruby Tandoh adores a Yorkshire pudding       “My favourite side dish has to be the Yorkshire pudding,” says Tandoh, author of new cookbook, Cook As You Are. “Whether or not it’s strictly canon depends on who you’re speaking to, but I can’t imagine a better vessel for mopping up gravy. It’s the perfect counterpoint to the meaty savouriness of the Christmas dinner plate.” . Gordon Ramsay has very specic thoughts on stuffing      “Stuffing’s something that people think needs to be stuffed in the cavity of the turkey – that’s the worst place to cook a stuffing. It’s not good in there. There’s a reason why you don’t put much in that cavity,” says Ramsay, whose new recipe collection, Ramsay In , is out now.“To make a really good stuffing is something I do separately. And so, I get the ground sausage, the pork, the beef. And then from there we’ll put in some smoked pancetta, some beautully roasted pistachios, some chopped up apricot and bake it in the tray prior. And then as it comes out, we’ll add some resting juices from the turkey and let it sit and absorb.” . Donal Skehan appreciates the humble Brussels sprout…     “Brussels sprouts are my favourite. I love them every way,” say Irish chef Skehan, author of Everyday Cook. “I love them as a salad as well. Very much a winter salad – in a food processor, bag of sprouts, straight down the chute into the chopper, mix it together with some really good chunks of Pecorino cheese, and some dried cranberries or even pomegranate, would be lovely. And then just a light dressing and some nuts maybe as well, something to crunch, toasted walnuts would be nice. Youmix that together and it’s like a Brussel’s sprout slaw, but it is stunning.” . Same goes for River Cottage’s Lucy Brazier       “Sprouts with chestnuts, because I think that tastes like Christmas,” says food writer Lucy Brazier, whose new cookbook, Christmas at River Cottage, is all about the festive food season. “I could eat a bowl of that without anything .” . Gino D’Acampo gets excited about the roasted veg       “I’m a huge roasted vegetable fan at Christmas,” says the chef, celebrating his new series and cookbook, Gino’s Italian Family Adventure. “We do them with balsamic vinegar, extra virgin olive oil, parsley, a few capers, all these – amazing. Funnily enough I do like stuffing, because what is stuffing, sausage with herbs and a bit of bread  Very tasty, I like that. I hate Turkey. I don’t like turkey.” . James Martin has a buttery way with carrots       Chef James Martin loves carrots cooked in butter – Butter being the title of his new cookbook. He does them “in a style of Vichy – Vichy is a town in the south of France. They cook everything in mineral water, sugar, butter and salt to produce this amazing taste, butyou use the addition of star anise it makes carrots taste amazing.” . Mary Berry champions the good old celeriac       “I love celeriac,” says Mary Berry . “I just cook it until it’s soft. It’s knobbly. If you grow it, it doesn’t come to fruition until November. You can buy it earlier. And I cook it until it’s tender then add full-fat cregraveme fresh to it and puree it. It is delicious. It reheats well.” She also makes chestnut stuffing. “I do them the day before and I do it in small shapes and fry them, then all I’ve got to do is reheat them.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, nd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, rd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  This year is the th centenary of Partition with this week in particular marking the centenary of the signing of The Anglo-Irish TreatyLocal NewsGround shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

And they’re not alone – the research found a thirdof grandparents buy unsuitable gts for grandchildren at Christmas, closely followed by aunties , distant relativesand friends .  By asking yourself a few simple questions you can nail the art of gt-giving to both children and adults, promises Kim Brookes, who ran an online gt-registry for more than  years.   Have kids so that instead of real gts you can give friends and family novelty photo items with pictures of your children they saw on social media  months ago. — Some Boys MotherDecember ,    “Now’s the time to show your family just how much you love them by way of the perfect gt,” she says. “This is an opportunity not to be squandered, but one that causes a lot of stress at this time of year, as we really want to get it right.” Brookes, who now runs the natural scent jewellery brand, Perfino, suggests people choosing gts ask themselves these questions… . Do they really need it   Think about the person you’re buying for. You want to give them something that’s meaningful, not just for Christmas. Something that won’t be part of the re-gting cycle any time soon. So, it needs to be something they really want, rather than a short-term fad. “Subscriptions are a good option for this,” says Brookes. “Perhaps a comic or magazine – a gt that reminds them of you every month.” . Just because you love it, does that mean they will  Remember who you’re buying for and always keep their tastes and preferences at the forefront of your mind. “They may not want the chemistry set when their favourite subject is art, or the history book when they love nothing better than a murder mystery,” stresses Brookes.  . Have you really put proper thought into it  Don’t rush to buy something just because it’s there, without giving any thought to the person you’re buying for, says Brookes. “This is the worst offence,” she insists, “as it shows little consideration. Try to find some time to think long and hard about the child or person you’re buying for, and you’ll know what’ll make them happy, evenit’s not to your taste. Thankfully we’re all dferent.” . Have you gone too big    Brookes points out that while a gt recipient might love a trip to an adventure park for Christmas, and be a bit put out with a stick of deodorant, you’ll have a sense of what’s right. “And be very careful not to escalate,” she warns, “as you’ll be digging a hole for yourself on future gting occasions.” . Is it really eco-friendly  This question now has to be at the front of everyone’s minds, for your own satisfaction as well as the good of the planet, says Brookes. “I find the easiest way to do this is to trust who you’re buying from,” she says. “Most businesses will now put their eco credentials front and centre and,they don’t, look for one that does. Once you trust them, you can buy with an easy conscience.” . Have they already got it  If a potential gt is new and super-popular, it’s possible your gt recipient may already have it. If the gt’s for your own child, there’s a chance someone  may have bought it for them. “The best way forward could be to make some subtle enquiries,” advises Brookes, “andyou take the leap and buy, at least keep the receipt and be upfront about how happy you’d be to facilitate an exchange.”  . Are consumables a good choice   “We have so much at this time of year, so I’d avoid more chocolate, more sweets, more of anything unless it’s an extra-special treat – something they wouldn’t normally have, but which you know they’d enjoy,” suggests Brookes. . Are smellies always a winner  Smelly oils, creams etc may work for older children, teenagers and adults – but onlyyou know they like that sort of thing, warns Brookes, who says that, again, such items need to be really special to be a good gt. “Bath oil is my favourite thing,” she says, “but obviously it’s not for someone who only takes showers.” . Is it really appropriate  Consider whether something is age-appropriate for children and, of course, avoid anything made from plastic, stresses Brookes. . Is it going to look fabulous under the tree   It’s a minor consideration, but Brookes saysyou make the unwrapping experience a joyful one it can add that little bit of lovely Christmas sparkle to yourgt. “Ribbons, fabric, or even a drop of festive essential oil on the wrapping paper always work wonders,” she adds.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, nd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, rd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  This year is the th centenary of Partition with this week in particular marking the centenary of the signing of The Anglo-Irish TreatyLocal NewsGround shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

It opened earlier this week and seeks to gain insights from stakeholders and the wider public on the best way to shape and develop the rail network across Ireland. Mr Durkan has encouraged local people and businesses to have their say by responding to the consultation. He said: “This public consultation is an exciting opportunity for everyone to have their say on the future of rail provision across Ireland. “This island once had a thriving railway network and since coming into office SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon has committed to exploring an expanded railway network, which has the potential to be transformative for communities across our island. “The benefits of an overhaul of our current railway network are clear, it would allow us to address the regional imbalances that exist across the island, making our communities better connected and making rail a real option for people who regularly travel for work, to visit friends and family and to socialise. “It would also bring a boost for our economy, with poor public transport links regularly cited as a reason for the lack of investment outside our population centres. “More public transport options would also take more cars off our roads, which is a key part of plans to tackle the climate crisis and protect our environment. “I welcome SDLP Minister Mallon’s work on progressing this project so far and hope this public consultation marks the next step in making the revolution of our island’s rail network a reality. “I know this an issue many people in Derry feel very passionate about and would urge them not to miss this unique opportunity to give their view. “While other political parties are busy politicking, the SDLP is focused on delivering for people. After almost  years of Sinn Feacutein-DUP joint Government, the public deserve delivery. We’re up for the job.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, nd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, rd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  This year is the th centenary of Partition with this week in particular marking the centenary of the signing of The Anglo-Irish TreatyLocal NewsGround shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

My whole le came to a halt.Derry Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch aims to raise more awareness and funds for an “illness we don’t talk about enough” Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseReporter: Nicole Lang Dec   addthis, Leslie Hill was sadly diagnosed with Parkinsons disease in April . googletag.cmd.push Parkinsons disease is a condition that affects the brain. It causes problems like shaking and stfness that get worse over time. The main symptoms of the disease are shaking, slow movements and stfness. Treatments for Parkinsons disease include therapies to help with movement problems, medicines and sometimes brain surgery. Parkinsons disease is caused by a loss of nerve cells in part of the brain. It’s not yet clear exactly why this happens. Leslie’s first symptoms were shown in his handwriting when it was still neat but very small. Then, in January , the -year-old, was getting ready to go to the dentist when his left hand would not move to brush his teeth. Leslie said: “After several attempts to brush my teeth, I realised something wasnt right. I contacted my GP and was sent to the hospital to do tests. “I was kept in for five days and had numerous tests. It was then that I was diagnosed. My whole le came to a halt. “Shortly after, I became a member of Parkinsons Foyle branch. I really enjoyed and appreciated the support that I got. “I helped to organise events and helped with fundraising. I was a committee member within six months and then I was asked to become Chairman. “It is and was such an honour, I was very pleased to be voted in. I have a vice chairman, Jackie Brolly. “There is a committee of  dedicated members, nothing is a bother to them. My we Rhonda is the secretary and Wendy Stuart is treasurer. “We have approximately  members and we are all one big family. “I have been acting Chairman since September  and officially since March . During my time as Chairman, we have given approximatelyfive to six thousand pounds every year to Parkinson’s research.” Parkinson’s Foyle Branch is a self-funded charity and they depend on the generosity of members of the public to keep the branch going. Their mission is ‘Together we will find a cure, and improve le for everybody affected by Parkinson’s.’ Leslie continued: “We’re close to major breakthroughs. Funding the right research into the most promising treatments, we get closer to a cure every day. “Until then, were here for everyone affected by Parkinson’s. Fighting for fair treatment and better services. Making everyone see its real impact. “People with Parkinson’s, scientists and supporters, fundraisers and families, carers and clinicians, all working side by side. “We are impatient for change, we’re taking a stand, speaking out, chipping in, and playing our part. “I cannot thank the members of the public enough as they have been tremendous. We also organise events with the money we receive to help Parkinson’s patients. “This includes dancing to music, exercise classes, massage and reflexology classes, yoga and many more as exercise is a good medicine for Parkinsons sufferers. “In the month of March, we hold our Annual General Meeting. Then, from April to December, we have monthly meetings. “At our meetings,we have  plus members and carers and we have a guest at every one of them. “Our meetings came to a halt in March  due to the Covid pandemic, the whole world had stopped due to this deadly virus. “With our dedicated committee members, we rang round all of our members and kept in touch. The Mayor of Derry and Strabane District Council, Alderman Graham Warke is attending the Foyle Branch’s Christmas Dinner on Friday December  to celebrate all the member’s efforts during this dficult period. Leslie concluded: “I want to speak about and raise awareness for Parkinson’s because you don’t see a lot about it on the news and not many people know about this illness but, together, we will beat Parkinson’s.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, nd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, rd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  This year is the th centenary of Partition with this week in particular marking the centenary of the signing of The Anglo-Irish TreatyLocal NewsGround shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, nd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, rd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  This year is the th centenary of Partition with this week in particular marking the centenary of the signing of The Anglo-Irish TreatyLocal NewsGround shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

The event, hosted by members of the Bahai Community in County Derry, will be opened by Deputy Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Christine McFlynn. Abdul Bahaacute was born Abbaacutes Effendi on May   in Tehran, Iran. He was exiled with his father by the Persian government in an attempt to stamp out the relatively new Bahai faith. Further banished to Constantinople and Edirne, his family was incarcerated in Akkaacute, a penal colony of the Ottoman Empire next to Haa in present-day Israel, in , and Abdul would remain there for  years. Known for his kindness and charity, he was released from prison in  and travelled to mainland Europe on boats manufactured by Harland and Wolf, before travelling across North America for eight months. During this time he became known as the Angel of Peace, participating in networks that shaped international peace movements. He had tickets for the Titanics maiden voyage in , but opted to sell them and give the money to charity, and his subsequent survival prompted him to double his efforts for peace and a global society. After war broke out in Europe, Bahaacute had already ed to Haa, where he had prepared for the worst, purchasing land in Galilee to grow wheat. Whena blockade threatened the region with starvation, Abdu’l-Bahaacute fed northern Palestine: rich and poor, Muslims, Jews and Christians — a humanitarian act for which He accepted a knighthood from King George V. He died on November  . Wednesday nights event is ticketed due to restrictions on space, but some spaces may be available on the night.

In the first of a two-part series, Matthew Leslie speaks to Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University to examine le in Derry before the Treaty had been signed. googletag.cmd.push  One hundred years ago this week, the Anglo-Irish Treaty to determine the future of Ireland and its relationship with the United Kingdom was signed at Downing Street after tense negotiation. The final outcome would have profound consequences for the city of Derry who would find itself relegated to border town status once the creation of the Northern Irish state loyal to the UK had been established. The Irish negotiators in London were Arthur Grfiths, Michael Collins, Robert Barton, Eamonn Duggan and George Gavan Duffy. On the British side was David Lloyd George, Lord Birkenhead, Austen Chamberlain, Winston Churchill, Sir Laming Worthington-Evans, Sir Gordon Hewart and Sir Hamar Greenwood. What followed was the creation of the Irish Free State as a self-governing dominion within the British Empire. The British would also retain use of three ports – Berehaven and Spike Island in the south and Lough Swilly in Co. Donegal. A common assumption was this Treaty resulted in the partition of Ireland with six counties being formed as Northern Ireland and would remain part of the United Kingdom. However, partition had already been put into place on paper with the Government of Ireland Act in  with it taking effect on May , . All the Anglo-Irish Treaty did was give the devolved, and predominantly unionist government of Northern Ireland the option to opt out of being part of the new Irish Free State – which they duly exercised. But partition was not an idea born out of a hurried idea to provide a compromised or botched solution to the Irish Question. As Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University reveals, the seeds of it had been sown long before Michael Collins sat down to negotiate with Lloyd George. He said: “One hundred years ago, the issue of partition was on everyones minds in Derry and the North West. “It was first mentioned in the nineteenth century as a solution to, what was called at the time, The Irish Question – the idea that Ireland would be self-governing. “Obviously there was major opposition to that in Ulster from the unionist population. So the idea that partition may be a solution with Ulster being under Westminsters control while the rest of Ireland would be under a Dublin government really began to have an affect on Derry in the early part of the twentieth century. “Especially around the years  and  when Ulster unionism began to mobilise physically in terms of protests, the formation of the Ulster Volunteer Forceand the signing of the Ulster Covenant. “That really had a major impact on the North West – and Derry in particular. There was an eleven-year period then from  to  where partition was in the position that kind of like Brexit is today in that in the last five years or so it was the only thing that people were thinking about. “It did have an acute effect on Derry – particularly around  and , Derry was the centre of attention for the partition question because it was seen as the place most likely to see violence emerge as a result of those political discussions. “But of course everything changed following the outbreak of the First World War. After the war, isions became even more entrenched and violence became a reality instead of just a prospect.” While the British Government continued to hesitate over Home Rule for Ireland, Republican volunteers took matters into their own hands in  by launching the Easter Rising. Ultimately, this attempt to win independence from the British failed and the rebellion was crushed. However, the question of self-determination did not end with the execution of the risings leaders and a growing political force by the name of Sinn Feacutein more than made its mark with a stunning performance at the  General Election. The party went from only having six seats to  – including the constituency of Derry City. Dr Grant added: “The thing about the Derry parliamentary seat is that it was a swing seat – a bit like today with the Fermanagh and South Tyrone Westminster seat. “The Derry City seat was so contentious because most men had a vote in parliamentary elections but not in local elections – an issue that remained controversial right up to the early s. “With the parliamentary vote, nationalists and unionists were evenly split in terms of the voting rights in the city. So election results tended to go unionist-nationalist-unionist-nationalist throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth century. “So it wasnt a huge surprise when Sinn Feacutein won it in . But at the same time, it was always very close and there was huge media attention on it because it was so close. “The big thing in  was that the Irish Parliamentary Partyand Sinn Feacutein made a pact in Ulster that meant Derry was kind of pre-decided almost for Sinn Feacutein. “The IPP pulled back and gave Sinn Feacutein a free run at Derry but they would have got free runs themselves where such as West Belfast for example when Sinn Feacutein pulled out there. “Cardinal Michael Logue – who was the Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland – brokered a pact between Sinn Feacutein and the IPP as they were afraid that they would knock each other out in seats like Derry and West Belfast and let the Unionists in to sweep up the seats.”  Read more: When unionists lost control of Derry Ground shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

In the first of a two-part series, Matthew Leslie speaks to Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University to examine le in Derry before the Treaty had been signed. googletag.cmd.push  With Sinn Feacuteins electoral success in the Derry City seat in  General Election, nationalists turned their eyes on local government. The running of affairs within Derry had been in the control of Protestants Unionists since the days of when King James II unsuccessfully laid siege to the city in . However, the introduction of a proportional electoral system for council elections had been introduced prior to the  local government poll – the result of which was seismic for Derry. A coalition of Sinn Feacutein, the Nationalist Party and an independent Nationalist councillor, Hugh ODoherty, won control of Derry Council from the Unionists by just two seats with ODoherty himself being appointed Mayor of the city. Not surprisingly, the result caused resentment amongst the Protestant and unionist community which spiralled into the Derry riots of June . Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University said: “The riots of  in the city are interesting in that while partition had been on peoples minds, serious violence had not occurred in the city since  .   “The  election was signicant in that it was a landslide for Sinn Feacutein and the whole country changed politically. So there was a fear on the part of unionists of an independent Ireland. “But to my mind, the most signicant thing was the  local elections in January of that year. “The unionist minority in Derry had held control of the city since the siege in . So theyve had two hundred or so years of dominance. “Because of the introduction of proportional representation, for the first time ever, the nationalists and Sinn Feacutein took control over local government after winning a combined majority of just two. “That in turn meant the Mayor of Derry, Hugh ODoherty, was both a nationalist and the first Catholic to hold that position since . So that was a hugely signicant and symbolic event because it meant that control of local government had been taken out of the hands of unionists and into those of nationalists. “That was hugely important politically because all of the conversation in ,  and into  was about would there be partition  andthat was to happen, where would the line be drawn . “If Derry Corporation was under nationalist control, then the propaganda victory and the moral argument would have tipped the balance towards the argument that Derry should be a Free State city rather than a Northern Irish one. “So unionists were very nervous and scared of their futures because of those signicant changes that took place. Weekend by weekend throughout the year, there was violence, rioting and fighting in the streets that became more and more intense. “You had events in the south with IRA attacks and counter-attacks from the Black and Tans that made things in Derry even more intense and then it all kicked off one night in June . “It spiralled from the Diamond into the Fountain area followed by a counter-attack from the Bogside and by the end of the week, there were twenty people dead – a really, really terrible week in the citys history.”  Read more: Derry the centre of attention in Partition question Ground shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

This week marks the centenary of The Anglo-Irish Treaty that would see Derry in a precarious position in its bid to be part of the new Irish Free StateReporter: Matthew Leslie Dec Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, This week marks the th anniversary of the signing of The Anglo-Irish Treaty. In the first of a two-part series, Matthew Leslie speaks to Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University to examine le in Derry before the Treaty had been signed. googletag.cmd.push  The riots that took place in Derry in  eventually came to a close but tensions in the city were still on a powderkeg. While Sinn Feacutein held the Derry City Westminster constituencyand a Nationalist coalition in control of both the citys Council and the Mayors office, events where would decide the future of Derrys fortunes. Partition of the Ireland had been an idea since the nineteenth century but it became a reality late in  with the Government of Ireland Act. The bill meant that six of Irelands counties would form the state of Northern Ireland to be run by a devolved – and predominantly unionist – administration in Belfast. May  saw the enforcement of the Act and it left Derry cut off from the rest of Ireland – especially from the trade it had with neighbouring Co. Donegal. Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University said: “Partition – on paper – took place as a result of the Government of Ireland Act in . That piece of legislation allowed for the creation of two separate parliaments of two politically jurisdictions – Northern Ireland in the six counties and Southern Ireland in the  counties. “Northern Ireland was founded with the unionist political establishment ran the legislation to establish a parliament, set up a police force and put into place the whole mechanisms of a government.  Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University  “Whereas in the south, the whole concept of there being a Southern Ireland never really took hold because it wasnt accepted by nationalists or Sinn Feacuteiners as a solution to the issue. “So essentially, the Government of Ireland Act was just ignored. The Southern Irish parliament was never founded which meant the  counties were in a state of limbo while Northern Ireland was being founded. “It was only when the Treaty negotiations took place that the concept of the Free State of Ireland came into play. “Though it had taken place on paper, actual partition didnt take place until after the Free State had been founded. “With the partition on paper, the news of that did not go down well at all with Derrys nationalist community. “I think that once that happened, it was just a matter for them to try and keep their heads down and use the power that they had gained in the local elections earlier in  to try and argue for Derry to be included in the southern jurisdiction. “There was a twin-strategy. The ultimate outcome would be a united Ireland that was independent – whether it would be a republic or not would be another point. There was a feeling that the IRA and Sinn Feacutein could achieve their aims and there would be no worries about partition and treat it asit was something to be ignored. “Others probably more realistically thought that partition was going to happen whatever the outcome was. For those nationalists and republicans, their strategy was to argue forcefully in the press and in the political circles for Derry to be included in the southern jurisdiction. “They went out mapping, interviewing people throughout the potential border area to ask their opinion on where they would like to reside and put out the message that Derry was a nationalist city and should not be included in Northern Ireland. “They also wanted to keep control of local government so they could continue to make that point.” While nationalists in Derry went about arguing their case, Michael Collins himself was planning a campaign of destabilisation to collapse the new Northern Ireland and have Derry and the North within the Free States fold. However, events close to home would prevent that. A turn that would have profound consequences on Derry for decades to come.  The second and final part of “Derry and the Anglo-Irish Treaty”, will be in next Mondays edition of The Derry News on December .

A Christmas adventure set in Derry is available to buy at Little Acorns Bookstore on Foyle Street.Reporter: Matthew Leslie Dec Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, Once upon a time, what started as a bedtime story could become a Christmas best-seller. googletag.cmd.push Derry-based writer, Robert Campbell, has released a new childrens novel, “Sled Down!” where four animal schoolchildren from Culmore venture into the city to save Christmas. The characters, Ralph , Susan , Finbarand Bettyget wind of Santas elves crashing the sled on a test run over the River Foyle and the reindeer have escaped. Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is one and he makes his way inside Derrys Walls where he comes across an unscrupulous fake Santa Claus looking to use him to fleece the citys Christmas shoppers out of their cash. Robert,  and originally from Doagh in East Antrim, admitted the story started when he was making up a bedtime tale for his children and from there it grew into something more. He said: “Im not an author by profession although I have written other things. This is my first childrens story.  The author of a new childrens novel set in Derry, Sled Down!, Robert Campbell  “I have three young boys – Boyd , Henryand Adamand it was really a story that I told the children at bedtime and then I just sort of wrote it up properly and then published it. “The children seemed to enjoy my story. Generally they would give a pretty honest reaction on what they really think. Sothey enjoyed it, then maybe other children would too. “Without giving too much away about the plot, Santas elves have taken the sled out for a test run right before Christmas. “They have been messing about on the Foyle and have crashed the sled. “The animal children in the book get summoned by their headteacher, who has heard what has happened, to go and round up the loose reindeer and help get the sled back to their school in Culmore. “Meanwhile, around Derrys walls, there is a character who is a  Santa Claus and hes not very nice. “Hes managed to get a hold of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer himself and sets up a scheme to get people to have their picture taken with Rudolph for five pounds a go. “With Rudolph, the idea came about of where would he have gone to  following the sled crashing. “The bad Santa is not based on anyone in particular. Hes not really that bad except he is a bit of a chancer. Hes also up to a couple of other things that would not be classed as being environmentally friendly. “All the book is set in Derry. The walls get a mention as do the bridges where the elves are messing about with the sled. Culmore of course is mentioned as thats where the childrens school is. “Without giving too much away, like most Christmas tales, the day is saved by the children – although the real Santa makes an appearance as well.” Robert has been living in Derry for close to the last  years and admits that by setting the book in the city, he is paying homage to it. He added: “Im not actually from Derry myself. Im a blow-in from Doagh – near Ballyclare – in East Antrim. “My we is from Derry and Ive been living here for eleven or twelve years now. The book is probably a wee homage to Derry as well. “Its a lovely place up here. You could set a Christmas book anywhere but a festive story works perfectly well here. “Theres so many places in Derry that you could use for the book.” Robert Campbells book, “Sled Down!” is available to buy at Little Acorns Bookstore on Foyle Street, Derry or from Amazon at: https:www.amazon Sled-Down-friends-rescue-Christmas dp BKNZQN  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, nd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, rd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  This year is the th centenary of Partition with this week in particular marking the centenary of the signing of The Anglo-Irish TreatyLocal NewsGround shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

A Christmas adventure set in Derry is available to buy at Little Acorns Bookstore on Foyle Street.Reporter: Matthew Leslie Dec Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, Once upon a time, what started as a bedtime story could become a Christmas best-seller. googletag.cmd.push Derry-based writer, Robert Campbell, has released a new childrens novel, “Sled Down!” where four animal schoolchildren from Culmore venture into the city to save Christmas. The characters, Ralph , Susan , Finbarand Bettyget wind of Santas elves crashing the sled on a test run over the River Foyle and the reindeer have escaped. Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is one and he makes his way inside Derrys Walls where he comes across an unscrupulous fake Santa Claus looking to use him to fleece the citys Christmas shoppers out of their cash. Robert,  and originally from Doagh in East Antrim, admitted the story started when he was making up a bedtime tale for his children and from there it grew into something more. He said: “Im not an author by profession although I have written other things. This is my first childrens story.  The author of a new childrens novel set in Derry, Sled Down!, Robert Campbell  “I have three young boys – Boyd , Henryand Adamand it was really a story that I told the children at bedtime and then I just sort of wrote it up properly and then published it. “The children seemed to enjoy my story. Generally they would give a pretty honest reaction on what they really think. Sothey enjoyed it, then maybe other children would too. “Without giving too much away about the plot, Santas elves have taken the sled out for a test run right before Christmas. “They have been messing about on the Foyle and have crashed the sled. “The animal children in the book get summoned by their headteacher, who has heard what has happened, to go and round up the loose reindeer and help get the sled back to their school in Culmore. “Meanwhile, around Derrys walls, there is a character who is a  Santa Claus and hes not very nice. “Hes managed to get a hold of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer himself and sets up a scheme to get people to have their picture taken with Rudolph for five pounds a go. “With Rudolph, the idea came about of where would he have gone to  following the sled crashing. “The bad Santa is not based on anyone in particular. Hes not really that bad except he is a bit of a chancer. Hes also up to a couple of other things that would not be classed as being environmentally friendly. “All the book is set in Derry. The walls get a mention as do the bridges where the elves are messing about with the sled. Culmore of course is mentioned as thats where the childrens school is. “Without giving too much away, like most Christmas tales, the day is saved by the children – although the real Santa makes an appearance as well.” Robert has been living in Derry for close to the last  years and admits that by setting the book in the city, he is paying homage to it. He added: “Im not actually from Derry myself. Im a blow-in from Doagh – near Ballyclare – in East Antrim. “My we is from Derry and Ive been living here for eleven or twelve years now. The book is probably a wee homage to Derry as well. “Its a lovely place up here. You could set a Christmas book anywhere but a festive story works perfectly well here. “Theres so many places in Derry that you could use for the book.” Robert Campbells book, “Sled Down!” is available to buy at Little Acorns Bookstore on Foyle Street, Derry or from Amazon at: https:www.amazon Sled-Down-friends-rescue-Christmas dp BKNZQN  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, nd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, rd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  This year is the th centenary of Partition with this week in particular marking the centenary of the signing of The Anglo-Irish TreatyLocal NewsGround shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.    The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, nd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, rd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  This year is the th centenary of Partition with this week in particular marking the centenary of the signing of The Anglo-Irish TreatyLocal NewsGround shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.    More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, nd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, rd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  This year is the th centenary of Partition with this week in particular marking the centenary of the signing of The Anglo-Irish TreatyLocal NewsGround shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency. If [the bans] are being applied, they have to be consistent.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, nd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, rd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  This year is the th centenary of Partition with this week in particular marking the centenary of the signing of The Anglo-Irish TreatyLocal NewsGround shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Reynolds had a previous spell at the club back in - under Stephen Kenny and he admitted he felt he had unfinished business at the Brandywell. “I’m not sureI ever thought I would arrive back here but it is a club I have a good affinity with,” he said. “I really enjoyed my spell here in  and . At times I felt like it was unfinished business that I would end up here at some stage because of the relationship I had with some of the people up here. I’m delighted to be here, it’s a new challenge and there’s a lot expected from us, but we’ll embrace that and enjoy it.” City boss Ruaidhri Higgins took his time deciding on his number two and feels he has now got the right man for the job. “Alan is a fantastic coach and it is important for me to have someone of his quality and experience here,” he stated. “He knows the league inside out and will have the trust of the players, which is key. He’s been here before which always helps as well, and he will bring plenty of ideas and energy to the club. “We are comfortable with where we are in our preparations for the new season and are looking forward to getting going again in the coming weeks. ”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, nd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, rd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  This year is the th centenary of Partition with this week in particular marking the centenary of the signing of The Anglo-Irish TreatyLocal NewsGround shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

The Greencastle native played at the Brandywell between - and became one of the most beloved players in the club’s history in that time. After bursting onto the scene with a hat trick against Limerick in the promotion  relegation semi-finals in , Mark really came into his own following the arrival of Stephen Kenny a year later. Forming a lethal partnership with Gary Beckett, Mark was the lead goalscorer in one of the club’s most successful periods in the League of Ireland era, with City becoming a household name across Ireland and Europe in  and . Forced to retire due to a brain tumour, Mark scored the winning goal to hand Derry City the First Division title in what was supposed to be his final game for the club on a memorable and emotional night in Monaghan in . However, showing incredible fighting spirit, Mark ed to break Liam Coyle’s long-standing goal record with a hat trick against Mervue United in the FAI Cup in  to stand alone as the club’s most lethal hitman since entering the League of Ireland. Mark then moved to Glenavon before he was forced to retire again in , and he spent the next few years battling his illness alongside his family and we Terri before tragically passing away in , aged , after a brave battle with cancer.  Incredible le ‘The Love of the Game’ tells Mark’s story through the eyes of those who knew him best, and those who shared those precious moments with him on his journey through an incredible le. From his wicked sense of humour, to his hopes, fears and his amazing refusal to give up in the most dficult of circumstances, the story of Mark’s le is inspiring, hilarious and heart-breaking in equal measure. “Mark signied everything that was good about the human spirit,” Republic of Ireland manager Stephen Kenny says. “He was such a good person. I just loved his warmth, his humility and his smile and laughter around the group. “It was an amazing period and Mark Farren was our goal scorer. He was the player who scored the most goals. He was our first defender, our first line of attack who chased down every lost cause. He was prolic, he was quick, he was dynamic, he was skillful, he was inventive and he could score all types of goals. He could chip the goalkeeper, he could go around the keeper easily with his speed and control and he had a venomous left foot and accurate so he could score any type of goal.”  ‘Big goals’ Derry City manager Ruaidhri Higgins remembers Mark as the man for the big occasion. “He scored in cup finals, he scored on final days of the season Mark always scored in big games and big moments and always scored against the top teams as well,” he said. “You get lads who score lots of goals but they punish the lesser teams, whereas Mark scored a lot of big goals in big games and when you do that you are a hell of a player.” “When I signed for Bohemians, the likes of Jason McGuinness and Brian Shelley and Owen Heary always commented on how much they hated playing against Mark Farren. These are top players sometimes you can take your own team mates and players for granted, but that coming from opposition players who have won the lot, and for other players who constantly talk about Mark Farren highlights how good he was.” Former teammate Paddy McCourt rates Mark as one of the finest finishers he ever played alongside. “When I think of Mark Farren, the first thing that comes to mind is goals,” he added. “He was a ruthless finisher. He was a quiet, unassuming fella off the pitch, with a very dry but witty sense of humour. I always found him good company. He was quite happy to be in the background and be funny. “We had a lot of big characters in the dressing room at the time, so Mark would have been a quieter type of funny. He would have been happy to be playing pranks on people and joking about. I always found him really funny. He was just a great lad who loved being a footballer for Derry City. “I have been fortunate to play international football, I have been fortunate to play with some big clubs, but it was very rare in that time that I played with someone, who,they went through one on one, I was as confident as I was when I seen Mark Farren go through one on one. The goals that he got for Derry City speak volumes about that being true.” ‘The Love of the Game’ will be released in the coming days, with details of the launch set to come.

The Greencastle native played at the Brandywell between - and became one of the most beloved players in the club’s history in that time. After bursting onto the scene with a hat trick against Limerick in the promotion  relegation semi-finals in , Mark really came into his own following the arrival of Stephen Kenny a year later. Forming a lethal partnership with Gary Beckett, Mark was the lead goalscorer in one of the club’s most successful periods in the League of Ireland era, with City becoming a household name across Ireland and Europe in  and . Forced to retire due to a brain tumour, Mark scored the winning goal to hand Derry City the First Division title in what was supposed to be his final game for the club on a memorable and emotional night in Monaghan in . However, showing incredible fighting spirit, Mark ed to break Liam Coyle’s long-standing goal record with a hat trick against Mervue United in the FAI Cup in  to stand alone as the club’s most lethal hitman since entering the League of Ireland. Mark then moved to Glenavon before he was forced to retire again in , and he spent the next few years battling his illness alongside his family and we Terri before tragically passing away in , aged , after a brave battle with cancer.  Incredible le ‘The Love of the Game’ tells Mark’s story through the eyes of those who knew him best, and those who shared those precious moments with him on his journey through an incredible le. From his wicked sense of humour, to his hopes, fears and his amazing refusal to give up in the most dficult of circumstances, the story of Mark’s le is inspiring, hilarious and heart-breaking in equal measure. “Mark signied everything that was good about the human spirit,” Republic of Ireland manager Stephen Kenny says. “He was such a good person. I just loved his warmth, his humility and his smile and laughter around the group. “It was an amazing period and Mark Farren was our goal scorer. He was the player who scored the most goals. He was our first defender, our first line of attack who chased down every lost cause. He was prolic, he was quick, he was dynamic, he was skillful, he was inventive and he could score all types of goals. He could chip the goalkeeper, he could go around the keeper easily with his speed and control and he had a venomous left foot and accurate so he could score any type of goal.”  ‘Big goals’ Derry City manager Ruaidhri Higgins remembers Mark as the man for the big occasion. “He scored in cup finals, he scored on final days of the season Mark always scored in big games and big moments and always scored against the top teams as well,” he said. “You get lads who score lots of goals but they punish the lesser teams, whereas Mark scored a lot of big goals in big games and when you do that you are a hell of a player.” “When I signed for Bohemians, the likes of Jason McGuinness and Brian Shelley and Owen Heary always commented on how much they hated playing against Mark Farren. These are top players sometimes you can take your own team mates and players for granted, but that coming from opposition players who have won the lot, and for other players who constantly talk about Mark Farren highlights how good he was.” Former teammate Paddy McCourt rates Mark as one of the finest finishers he ever played alongside. “When I think of Mark Farren, the first thing that comes to mind is goals,” he added. “He was a ruthless finisher. He was a quiet, unassuming fella off the pitch, with a very dry but witty sense of humour. I always found him good company. He was quite happy to be in the background and be funny. “We had a lot of big characters in the dressing room at the time, so Mark would have been a quieter type of funny. He would have been happy to be playing pranks on people and joking about. I always found him really funny. He was just a great lad who loved being a footballer for Derry City. “I have been fortunate to play international football, I have been fortunate to play with some big clubs, but it was very rare in that time that I played with someone, who,they went through one on one, I was as confident as I was when I seen Mark Farren go through one on one. The goals that he got for Derry City speak volumes about that being true.” ‘The Love of the Game’ will be released in the coming days, with details of the launch set to come.

With  minutes played, the Maghera side trailed their Antrim counterparts by - to - and looked to be fading into the December chill. However, Thomas McKeagneys nd effort got St Pats moving again, and they had closed the gap to five points at the second half water break. When James Friels th minute free dropped straight to the net, it left just the minimum between the sides and Maghera outscored Garron Tower by - to - in the final ten minutes to take the spoils. The defeated St Killians side. The Derry men had started brightly too, and a Callum OKane brace had them - to - up after just five minutes, but a magnicent double save from Odhran McElhinney proved a warning for St Pats. Two huge frees from Joseph McLaughlin got St Killians off the mark, and after Niall McGarrell had put them ahead on  minutes, McLaughlins third gave them a - to - lead at the water break. Well in the ascendency, Garron Tower were swaggering, and hit three points in as many minutes from McLaughlin , Cormac McKeown and Niall McGarrell to extend the lead to five points. James Friel hit back with two long range frees, but a long range Padraig McKillop effort in stoppage time saw St Killians lead by - to - at the break. The Antrim side continued where they left off in the second half, another brace of McLaughlin frees and a McGarrell effort opening up a seven-point lead, but then things began to turn.  St Pats Knock out Our Ladys to reach Mageean semi final  The Maghera school will now meet St Killians, Garron Tower in the semi final.   Thomas McKeagney punched the air after hitting St Pats first second half score on  minutes, and Callum OKane wriggled free to point and leave them trailing - to - at the water break. Corner back Conor Shiels raised a roar from his team with a long-range free on  minutes to close the gap to three, before St Pats got the little bit of luck they were craving. James Friel sent in a long free, and despite several swinging hurls, the ball floated over them all and into the net. Another Shiels free levelled matters in the th minute, but the expected St Killians backlash never came, and McKeagney nudged Maghera in front on  minutes. A sublime sideline cut from Eoin Scullion doubled the lead three minutes later, before Conor Shiels third free opened a - to - gap. Only a goal would do for Garron Tower, but they watched in disappointment as Seanie McIntosh’s attempt at dropping the ball into the box floated over the bar, and Conor Shiels restored the three-point margin with a nd minute free, his fourth of the day. A satisfying comeback for the Maghera side, who will now contest a Mageean Cup final with either St Louis Ballymena or St Patricks Downpatrick, who meet at the Dub on Friday night.

Gemma Doherty and Morgana MacIntyre, Reporter: Domhnall MacDermott Dec   addthis, Fresh from winning Album of the Year at the NI Music Awards, the Derry Belfast duo Saint Sister are destined for big things. The group, made up of Derry born singer harpist Gemma Doherty, of the Delacroix Dohertys, and Belfast-born singer Morgana MacIntyre, are currently playing their first tour in almost two years. googletag.cmd.push I caught up with Gemma after their triumphant Nerve Centre debut last weekend: What’s it like playing for crowds again after a year of livestreams  “It was amazing to see creative people come together and make some really special online shows in the absence of live music. “That said, it’s hard to beat the feeling of people coming together and experiencing something live in a room. “I really missed the feedback you get from the audience and how that feeds into the performance. “It can completely dictate the energy of a show, and that’s just not something you can create with only cameras in the room. “I think we’ve been a lot less nervous chatting and engaging with the audience since everything has opened back up, and we’re a lot more aware of being in the moment since it was taken away from us for a while.” Which do you prefer  Stripped down shows or playing with the full band  “I absolutely love playing the shows with the full band, especially with the seven-piece or the -piece band that we got to play with for our album livestream back in June. It’s a dream to hear the full scale of the album arrangements behind us when we’re on stage. “But I’ve been really enjoying the run of more intimate two-piece shows that we’ve been playing over the last few weeks. “When you strip the songs right back to their core, it becomes all about the vocals and finding the journey of each song with just one instrument behind it. “ We seem to lock into a dferent kind of flow and it feels like we’re engaging with the audience on a dferent level.” What was it like opening for Keane in America before lockdown  “It was great craic. Those were some of the biggest venues we’d ever played and the crowds and venues were beautul. “The last show we played in the states was in the stunning Dolby Theatre in LA where the Oscars had been held just a few weeks before. “It was supposed to be a  date tour, but we got to play  shows on the West Coast before things started closing down and we had to come home.” What’s been the best part of touring again and why was it playing Derry  “Hearing people sing along to the tunes from the second album has been really special, and as I mentioned before, being able to feel the audience in the room again and react to their energy. Derry was a class gig, we loved it. “It’s always a bit nerve-racking playing in your hometown, the stakes feel higher. “But it was the warmest welcome we could have asked for, and the same in Morgan’s hometown Belfast the following night.” Did you make any changes to the new album after lockdown delayed it’s release  “Thankfully we had just got our final mixes back around the beginning of March , and by the time the first lockdown hit we were already getting it mastered. It would have been so tempting to go back in and tweak it endlessly with the perceived extra time that lockdown gave us. I’m grateful in a way that it was finished before all that, and that it got to stay true to itself before the world went a bit mad.” How did it feel to win the NI Music Award’s Album of the Year   “Thank you! There were so many great albums out this year so we were genuinely shocked when it was announced. We missed the ceremony in the Ulster Hall unfortunately as we had a show in Waterford that night but we came off stage and looked at our phones and got a lovely surprise! And we got to celebrate properly a few nights later with the hometown shows in Derry and Belfast.” Other Voices is  this year. Want to share some memories of it from over the years  “Some of our favourite experiences as a band have been with the Other Voices gang. “There Courage livestreams were so inspiring and really set the bar for what a streamed experience could be, taking hold of some of the country’s most beautul spaces and opening them up in a new way. “We did an Other Voices livestream in the Guildhall last July with the string quartet from the Crash Ensemble and I think it was one of my favourite shows of all time. “ We’ve had some of the best weekends in Dingle over the years too, playing in St James’ Church in  was a massive one. “We met Lisa Hannigan for the first time outside the church after that gig, which lead to us going on tour with her a few months later, and having her feature on our most recent album.” Saint Sister’s brilliant second album, ‘Where I Should End,’ is available in Cool Discs on Foyle Street and other good record shops.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The resulting spot kick was coolly dispatched again by Robinson.At the beginning of the second half Omagh pulled level again and the sidelines were a hive of activity, with changes being rung by both sides.Left-back Jack Kelly delivered a deep cross into the Omagh box and the hardworking Tom Crudington recycled it out to Calam Mulqueen, who made no mistake when called upon to put Down High - ahead with the clock running low.But once again Down High became complacent as Omagh turned the screw and won countless corners. The pressure took its toll and a thoroughly deserved equaliser left the tie at - with the visitors left wondering what had gone wrong.At this stage, goalkeeper Alex Truesdale was busy keeping his side in the game and made one miraculous point blank save, resembling Jerzy Dudekrsquos heroics for Liverpool in the  Champions League final.Extra-time loomed large and with the floodlights now on both sides knew that one mistake or a well-placed pass could be decisive.After a cautious start to extra-time, Caolan Lennon stepped up to take a free-kick and scored a simply stunning goal into the top corner of the Omagh goal mdasha tremendous -yard thunder strike that encapsulated his class throughout the game.Omagh Academy pushed to get back into the game and were caught on the counter when that man Robinson pounced and rounded the rsquokeeper to score and put somne breathing space between the sides.Robinsonrsquos goalscoring exploits won him the man-of-the-match award, with Mulqueenrsquos midfield battling also worthy of high commendation.Lennon was a constant thorn in Omaghrsquos side while mazy runs from Josh Ward caught the eye, with Josh McMullan working hard too. Jamie Ferguson and Matthew Nelson also battled hard..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Dunleath parkrun plans edging closer  ","story":"DETAILS of Downpatrickrsquos first ever parkrun event are being finalised, it has emerged.Dunleath Park is being lined up to host the event and while no date has been confirmed, it is hoped that it will take place next year after Newry, Mourne and Down Council agreed to provide financial support to organisers.The exact level of local authority support is currently being finalised and it is hoped that once the date of the K event and the venue have been formally confirmed that the parkrun will become an annual event for runners of all abilities.Hugely popular across the globe, the proposed Downpatrick parkrun also has the potential to provide the local economy with a boost.Downpatrick Town Committee is behind the ambitious plan for the new parkrun which it believes will bring the local community closer together and may encourage people who have never run before to get out and enjoy themselves in an event where there is no time limit and no one finishes last.Last month, the Town Committee issued an online appeal for ldquoenthusiastic and committed volunteers to come forward to help get the parkrun up and running and itrsquos hoped that the parkrun could become a weekly event and attract people from across the district to enhance their health and enjoy the great outdoors.Downpatrick area councillor Gareth Sharvin has welcomed the progress on establishing a parkrun event at Dunleath Park.He said parkruns have become popular with runners and walkers alike across the country and keen participants in the Downpatrick area have been planning the establishment of a similar event in the county town.Cllr Sharvin confirmed that he recently requested an update from Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Active and Healthy Communities department on the progress of establishing the parkrunand providing financial support to the group setting up the event.ldquoI am happy to report that the financial contribution and approach has been agreed between all stakeholders and officers are working with the parkrun organisers to finalise the details, he said.ldquoWith this great news, it should not be long until we have our first parkrun event in Downpatrick, utilising the new trail around Dunleath.Cllr Sharvin added: ldquoA parkrun will also bring people from outside the area into Downpatrick spending locally in our shops and cafes, adding to our great array of social and leisure activities on offer.News that Dunleath Park could host the parkrun comes after recent confirmation that major investment is planned for this part of the town.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is planning to create a series of new facilities, including a dedicated running track, while also in the pipeline are a cycling pump track, skateboarding track, improved planting and a new play park.In addition, soccer and GAA pitches are in line for an upgrade as part of the plan to transform Dunleath Park into a sporting and recreational hub.Itrsquos understood that the area earmarked for the proposed pump track, skateboard track and play park sit outside the parkrsquos floodplain and will enable the local authority to move faster in putting a business case together and progress towards securing capital funding.The need for new G or G pitches mdash which can be used all year round mdash at Dunleath Park also been highlighted with council officials asked to investigate the potential for this particular investment to happen..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  December 5%2C 2001

unveiled a number of buildings at High Street which have been transformed in the project which was funded by the local group and the International Fund for Ireland.Killyleagh Development Association chairman Professor Bob Elwood officially received the keys for the buildings from developer Maurice Crawford during a ceremony on Friday afternoon.Professor Elwood confirmed that both apartments in the scheme had already been let, while a cottage at the top of the street had been sold.Four shop units are also available and Professor Elwood said the association was in negotiations with business people about potential projects.ldquoIt was essential that this area was refurbished and renewed in an effort to bring new businesses and new people to the town, he said.ldquoAlthough these buildings are new, they have been designed to blend in with the rest of the street which is Georgian in style.Former Killyleagh councillor Sam Osborne said he was proud to have been invited to open the new facility.ldquoOut of all the people that could have been asked to this, I find it was great honour that the community has given me the opportunity to perform this , he said.ldquoYou only have to go back to the beginning of the year to know that this area was an eyesore and to see it now I can hardly believe the transformation that has taken place.DOWNPATRICK ndash One of Downpatrickrsquos oldest bars is in line for a major improvement scheme which could top the pound, mark.Rearsquos Hotel in Lower Market Street has been bought by two local businessmen who plan to turn the property into one of the districtrsquos top entertainment attractions.The plans, which include a major refurbishment programme, will transform the current building which in its heyday was at the centre of attraction in the town centre.Brothers Mark and Bartley Murphy are confident the major investment will result in premises on a par with the very best Belfast has to offer and say the venture will be successful.Once the refurbishment programme has been completed, Rearsquos will serve food all day and there will also be aroom which will be hired for private parties and other similar s.ldquoThe aim is to provide a facility which willbe high class and top-of-the-range and the level of investment reflects this, said Mr MarkMurphy.ldquoThe premises have been bought and work to transform them could start early in the New Year.BALLYNAHINCH ndash Ballynahinch Lions Club have recruited the help of high school students in the town to launch their annual Christmas food appeal on behalf of the needy.Pupils from Ballynahinch High and St Colmanrsquos were on hand recently to back Lions Club president Eddie Russellrsquos appeal for pub lic support for this important service to the community.This weekend, members of the Lions Club and their supporters will be on duty at shops and supermarkets in the area asking local people to contribute to the appeal.Mr Russell said the Lions Club is inviting shoppers to purchase one or more items of non-perishable food and place it in the trolley or basket provided.ldquoAt the end of the collection, the Lions will sort out the food into hampers for the needy and these will be distributed in time for the festive season, he said.ldquoThe Lions believe that at this time of year, many people in the community are anxious to support those who are perhaps not quite as well off as themselves and this project is an ideal way of doing so.SPA ndash A Spa musician is preparing to launch her first CD.

From the resulting kick-out Carew won possession before sending over a mammoth effort to put the Johnnies back in the ascendancy.With both teams displaying huge work rate, the challenge for the Johnnies was to play through the Fontenoy press and find space.Ryan Morganrsquos pace, and incisive angled runs were a crucial factor in carving a way through a Fontenoy backline that was being well marshalled by Queens Universityrsquos Niall McElroy.Cope and Madine combined to create an exceptional team score in the th minute, but the Fontenoy response was swt and the energetic Eoin OrsquoHare burst through to raise the green flag in the next phase of play.Caolan Burns and Eoin McCrickard kept the scoreboard ticking over with well taken frees for their sides.A key battle within the game was that of Johnnies centre half Oran OrsquoConnor against Michael McMullan. OrsquoConnor was readily available each time the full back line of Aaron Murphy, Adam Walsh and team captain Rory McMullan gained possession.McMullanrsquos brave block from a Shea Moorehead effort in the th minute typied the spirit within this young Johnnies team, his cousin Conor McMullan claimed the resultant rebound and found Cope who won a late free on the far sideline.From fully  yards out, Ryan Morgan launched a majestic effort that found its way to the Fontenoy net to leave just one score between the teams.

Together we can put a stop to illegal puppy farming. Buying a puppy from illegal breeders can have devastating results, she continued.ldquoOften puppies die a short time after purchase or end up with infectious diseases such as parvovirus which is expensive to treat and, often fatal. They can also suffer behavioural issues relating to fear and anxiety due to poor or no socialisation.Chief Inspector Ford said it can be tempting to buy a puppy in these circumstances and often purchasers will recognise that things are not quite right, asking people to remember that by lsquorescuingrsquo a puppy in these circumstances, they are fuelling and supporting what is a particularly lucrative criminal industry.She added: ldquoWe would encourage anyone who is aware of illegal dog breeding establishments to contact their local council and we would like to take this opportunity to thank those that have done so to date already.Council chairwoman Cathy Mason said the local authority was committed to working with its partners to address this issue.ldquoWe investigate all reports made to us, she said. ldquoRecently, animal welfare officers seized seven dogs from a property following reports the animals were kept in poor living conditions and a further  dogs were seized at an illegal puppy farm with associated poor environmental conditions.Cllr Mason said the local authority is currently investigating a case of failing to ensure the welfare needs of dogs and causing unnecessary suffering.She continued: ldquoThis is a particularly timely message at this time of year when many will be thinking of purchasing a puppy for Christmas.ldquoCouncils are the lead agency when it comes to animal welfare issues and we routinely work with other agencies such as police and Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to help us tackle this serious issue.Cllr Mason also asked people across the district for their help.She added: ldquoIf anyone sees or is are aware of anything untoward, please report it to your localcouncil dog warden immediately so we can take appropriate action and seek assistance from relevant partners..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13260524.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Hence it is that effective opposition to the protocol is severely compromised because the DUP are not willing to sacrice their idol in defence of the Union.

The prime minister, the EU and pan nationalism know this and so treat Jeffrey Donaldson’s threats as no more than empty, hollow rhetoric. They are as void of meaning as Arlene Foster’s “blood red lines” and Nigel Dodds’ “precious Union”. The stark reality for unionism is that the DUP are as much an obstacle to the removal of the protocol as are the EU and pan nationalism.If as unionists we really want to remove the protocol I suggest we must first begin by voting the DUP out of office. We have the opportunity in May . Unless and until we do so the protocol will remain.Richard Ferguson, Dollingstown ——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Well maybe, but not as low as % which is now the accepted benchmark for making cataclysmic constitutional change. Still, % must be worrying for advocates of Irish unity.One of the consequences of a  years of partition is that most southerners don’t really know people from the north. And we don’t know them very well either. If Taoiseach Micheal Martin arrived at the average house in Northern Ireland he probably wouldn’t be recognised. It’s far more likely that he would be mistaken for someone who wanted to tarmac your driveway.Give anti-vaxxers the wrong treatment. For a broken leg prescribe listening to Van Morrison’s latest albumSo this poll is a real opportunity for unionism.Let’s face it Ulster Protestants have an, often unfair, reputation for being ... how can I put this politely ...dour, sour-baked, stubborn, thran, carnaptious and frankly unpleasant. This is a real asset to be exploited.So here’s my advice to unionists. Forget about trying to make Northern Ireland work, , instead concentrate on making yourselves so thoroughly obnoxious and unattractive as to ensure a landslide No vote down south. Unionists should immediately launch a campaign to put southerners off a United Ireland. We could call it “Operation You Couldn’t Like Us”This, of course, is where Jim Allister would really come in to his own. Exposing Jim to a southern audience and letting him just be himself is bound to enrage and alienate anyone who sees him. He should set up a southern branch of the TUV and run for the Dail and get on RTE as much as possible. But don’t stop there. Unionists should go on special missions down south with instructions to annoy as many people as possible. Firstly, every time you meet a southerner make sure to always call the south “Eire”. It really winds them up. Deliberately mispronounce Taoiseach and Tanaiste – to be fair unionists are already great at doing this — and always remember to roll your eyes and sigh when anyone speaks Irish.Keep reminding southerners that a British team won the All-Ireland this year. Also keep asking southerners what the All-Ireland is. Drop in to Aras an Uachtarain*and demand to know where the Deputy First President’s Office is.Send Stephen Nolan on a  county live tour and let people stare in amazement as he claims to be the “biggest show in the country”. “Country  The  Counties is a country  ”Or best of all just drive a big bus all around the south with a slogan written on the side of it: “Britain gives Northern Ireland £ billion a year. How much are you willing to pay ”That’s the Union safe for another  years. You can thank me later.• I would give anti-vaxxers medical treatment – the wrong treatmentHow has your week been Probably better than that of a North Macedonian women’s football fan. Or a Barbadian royalist. Or a council chief executive watching ‘Spotlight’. Mine was OK until I tried to watch ‘I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here’. I didn’t recognise any of the celebrities. My son said they were all Z list nobodies and were so obscure he was surprised I didn’t get the call.I didn’t let this annoy me because I’m an easy-going person, a stranger to anger. But I’m afraid to say that this week the mask-dodgers, Covid-sceptics and vaccine scaredy cats really are starting to challenge my natural equanimity.Three DUP MPs voted against mask-wearing. What have the DUP got against masks  Fair enough the Shinners have traditionally been very pro-mask. Especially in the s, s and s but that was pre-pandemic.Worst of all there was an anti-vax protest in Belfast last week during which a woman read out an anonymous letter from a ‘real’ nurse. Among the numerous ludicrous allegations in this farrago of fabrication and fakery was the claim that medical staff were being asked to lie in hospital beds and pretend to be sick with Covid. This was simultaneously hilarious and grossly offensive to hard-working NHS staff. But what can NHS staff do when faced with bare-faced liars  How do you deal with hysterical people who compare having to show a QR code on your phone to the Nazi death camps The Hippocratic Oath requires medical people to treat the ill, no matter how stupid those people are. I’m not saying that anti-vaxxers should be denied medical treatment. Of course not. I would give them medical treatment. But I would give them the wrong medical treatment. If an anti-vaxxer turns up at AE with a broken leg simply prescribe listening to Van Morrison’s latest album. It’ll take their mind off the pain. Or even better let these self-appointed medical experts treat each other. Anti-vaxxers should play Russian Roulette with their own health the same way they do with ours. Let Piers Corbyn do Paul Frew’s ingrown toenail. Let Paddy Barnes have a go at an appendectomy. After all they’ve all done their “own research”. How hard can it be  The Commission on Flags, Identity, Culture and Traditionreport has been published, after a long delay.Setting up such a commission was the right thing to do. If Northern Ireland is to be a harmonious, stable society in which people across the community can feel respected in their identity and cultural affiliations, then the very least we can do is try to navigate a way through these thorny topics.The report is  pages long so will take some time to absorb. That it has been able to make  recommendations given the breadth of its commissioner baseis progress of sorts.But on core topics such as flying flags from lamposts and public buildings, on terrorist memorials, and on the handling of bonfires there is no agreement.That Declan Kearney, the chairman of Sinn Fein, is calling for an “orderly implementation” of the proposals hardly gives cause for optimism about the likely fate of the report.While the approach of republicans towards, for example, the Northern Ireland centenary has been depressingly intransigent, in a way it has helped to clary things. There is no generosity and there seems to be little prospect of generosity.Disgracefully, Northern Ireland has not been allowed to celebrate its th birthday — we have not even been allowed to be marked at Stormont with a centenary stone. Not even a church service of celebration of our wonderful country .What chance is there of wider agreement And what prospect is there of consensus on bonfires given that Sinn Fein and the SDLP over the summer took to the courts to try to force a resolution to a contested bonfire in north Belfast  Or when there are efforts to float the idea of two national flags flying on public buildings in NI, which would be a symbolic undermining of UK sovereignty and the consent principle ——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
