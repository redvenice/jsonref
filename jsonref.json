He is pictured in his Colonel uniform earlier this yearBut Andrew continues to enjoy the support of other Grenadiers. ‘Colonel Eddie Bolitho, who’s Lord Lieutenant of Cornwall, is very pro keeping him and is putting up a big fight,’ the source adds. ‘He’s got the backing of Major Tim Breitmeyer, who’s just stepped down as president of the Country Landowners’ Association.

They noticed a few things about Joseph Henry Loveless\u0027s life didn\u0027t seem to add up. His gravestone was actually a cenotaph, a stone with his name on it but no body buried underneath.Loveless\u0027s second wife, Agnes Octavia Caldwell Loveless, was killed with an ax on May 5, 1916, by a man named Walt Cairns, according to news articles and a wanted poster created by local law enforcement at the time.But according to another local news article on Agnes\u0027 funeral, one of her children said that it was his father in jail for the murder, not Walt Cairns. The child also remarked that his dad would be escaping soon because he never stayed in jail long.The DNA Doe Project team eventually unraveled the truth: Joseph Henry Loveless was born December 3, 1870, in the Utah Territory to Mormon pioneers. He married twice - his first wife Harriett Jane Savage orced him for \u0027abandonment,\u0027 according to Salt Lake City court records - and became a bootlegger, counterfeiter and general outlaw in Idaho.         Loveless\u0027s second wife, Agnes Octavia Caldwell Loveless, was killed with an ax on May 5, 1916Loveless used a variety of aliases during his criminal career, including Walt Cairns, Charles Smith and other variations of his given and phony names. He was also notorious for escaping custody, Bingham Redgrave said, sawing through jail bars with a blade he kept in his shoe and once managing to stop a moving train that he was being transported on to flee law enforcement.Investigators believe he died shortly after he escaped from the St. Anthony jail on May 18, 1916, where he was being held for Agnes\u0027 murder.\u0027It\u0027s blown everyone\u0027s minds,\u0027 Bingham Redgrave said of the investigation. \u0027The really cool thing, though, is that his wanted poster from his last escape is described as wearing the same clothing that he was found in, so that leads us to put his death date at likely 1916.\u0027Loveless\u0027 descendants were unaware of their ancestor\u0027s sordid past, so at this point there\u0027s not much more to go on besides speculation when it comes to the identity of Loveless\u0027 murderer.Still, with the Clark County Sheriff\u0027s Office keeping the case open as a homicide investigation, more clues may turn up yet.\u0027Who knows?

Eliot was born in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1888 and gained notoriety as a poet early in life. He was only 26 when \u0027The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\u0027 became his first professionally published poem.His best known works include \u0027The Waste Land,\u0027 \u0027The Hollow Men\u0027 and \u0027Four Quartets.\u0027The first poem in the \u0027Quartets\u0027 series, called \u0027Burnt Norton,\u0027 piques the interest of enthusiasts of the poet, says Eliot scholar Frances Dickey, because of lines that suggest missed opportunities and what might have been with his muse. The poem is named after a home in England that Eliot visited with Hale in 1934.\u0027His relationship with her seems to be deep and meaningful and it\u0027s a door he chose not to open,\u0027 she said.       Letters between poet T.S. Eliot and longtime confidante Emily Hale are displayed in Princeton, N.J. Thursday. From January 2 students, researchers and scholars can go to the Ivy League school in New Jersey to see these letters that many are saying may reveal more intimate details about Eliot\u0027s life and workThe letters could also reveal details about Eliot\u0027s conversion to Anglicanism, something he deeply cherished, Dickey says.Dickey, who served as one of the editors on \u0027The Complete Prose of T.S. Eliot\u0027, said the poet was deeply ashamed of his marriage to his first wife, Vivienne Haigh-Wood, whom he was with for more than 15 years. Dickey said the letters could reveal just how close he and Hale were and if the two ever considered marriage.\u0027Was this an epistolary romance they would carry across the Atlantic?\u0027 Dickey said. \u0027What role did she play in his emotional life?\u0027Eliot\u0027s letters to Hale began after that first marriage ended. Whatever else she was, Hale was a link to the life Eliot had left behind in the United States as a young man, Dickey said.\u0027He was really thinking more about the United States and his childhood during the period where he was in correspondence with Hale,\u0027 says Dickey. \u0027I have a feeling that having a relationship with an American woman helped him to uncover his past in a way.\u0027The unsealed boxes, which also contain photographs, clippings and other ephemera, were actually opened at the library\u0027s special collections area called Firestone Library in October for cataloging and digitizing. Daniel Linke, interim head of special collections at the library, was part of the team working on the 14 boxes. He said there was very minimal, if any, reading.He said that scholars from around the world will be traveling to Princeton in the first days they are available since they are copyrighted and won\u0027t be made available online.\u0027It will be the special collections equivalent of a stampede at a rock concert,\u0027 Linke said."},{"url":null,"title":"Girl cerebral palsy spent years therapy learning walk given puppy motivation","story":"Share this article Mrs Naif hopes that Mieka will be an emotional support dog for Briella and motivate her to progress her walking in the hopes of one day being able to walk her dog.She said: \u0027Briella faces many difficulties daily, primarily being able to move around and with her speech.\u0027Cerebral Palsy affects muscle movement, coordination and balance.

This stretches the service at a time when staff want time with their friends and families.\u0027In the first two days on which collections were scheduled after Christmas (December 30-31), we have had 276 dropped roads reported by our depots. This was due to a number of factors, the extra waste, access issues and staffing.\u0027The performance immediately after Christmas is also despite the fact that crews previously working on the garden waste service have been kept on to strengthen the resources available for regular waste and recycling services at this peak time.\u0027We would like to reiterate our apologies to households that have been affected and be assured we are making every effort to catch up as soon as possible.\u0027If your bin is not collected within 48 hours of its scheduled collection, please take it back on to your property for collection on the next scheduled date for the type of bins in question.\u0027An alternative for those with access to a vehicle is to visit one of our five Household Recycling Centres – but please be aware that as during any festive period, they can be busy at peak times.\u0027  Have you seen bigger piles of rubbish today?

They produce no emissions except water vapour and can travel 350-400 miles between refills. Even then, it takes only 3-5 minutes to refuel.Hydrogen does not occur naturally as a standalone fuel but can be made with green electricity.The drawback is that it is an explosive gas and cumbersome to store.

Electricity storage systems that hold vast amounts of energy for days.The cost of wind and solar power has tumbled in recent years, but the Achilles heel of these two sources of electricity remains they are highly intermittent, and we don\u0027t have nearly enough electricity storage capacity to keep the lights on when the wind doesn\u0027t blow and the sun isn\u0027t shining.Over the next ten years this will have to be solved. It is possible that by 2030 we could have wind and solar farms operating in tandem with hydrogen plants that convert water to hydrogen and oxygen when wind and solar power is plentiful. The hydrogen could then be burned to produce heat or electricity when wind and solar power are scarce.4. Biodegradable plastic that\u0027s widely available.It is hard to eliminate plastic because in so many ways it is a miracle substance that plays a crucial role in all our lives.The problem is that plastic takes so long to break down chemically. Today\u0027s plastic bottle will still be a hazard for sea creatures in hundreds of years\u0027 time.Microplastics have become so ubiquitous in the environment that yesterday, using data from the Medical University of Vienna, the World Wide Fund for Nature revealed that each of us consumes the equivalent of two cereal bowls of microplastics a year.Biodegradable plastics are available for some purposes, such as single-use bags, but the technology can\u0027t yet be applied to plastic in every form. In ten years\u0027 time, though, don\u0027t be surprised if all plastics used in everyday life are biodegradable.

Technology for a carbon-free construction industry.Steel and cement are two of the great sticking points on the way to zero emissions. Between them, these industries are responsible for 8 per cent of global carbon emissions. It is not just a question of energy: carbon dioxide is unfortunately a by-product of the chemical reactions used to convert iron ore into steel and limestone into cement.Nor can we do without them: we will need huge quantities of steel and cement to build a renewable energy infrastructure. If we can produce cement and steel without CO2 as a by-product — a big if — we will be on to a winner.6. Homes that can be run on batteries.Photovoltaic solar panels on domestic homes took off a decade ago, thanks to generous feed-in tariff payments. But those subsidies have ended and now the only advantage comes from using the electricity yourself.The trouble is, you may not want to use much energy in the middle of a summer day when the panels are producing maximum power. The next step will be to combine solar panels with domestic batteries that lets you store the energy for later in the day, when you do need it.Several electricity companies, including EDF, Eon and Ovo, have started to sell packages that include solar panels and batteries — typically for about £7,000 — but over the next decade domestic battery systems will become more efficient and more commonplace.

Non-belching cows and other farm animals.Meat production is a problem in tackling climate change: according to the UN\u0027s Food and Agriculture Organisation, livestock production accounts for 14.5 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. A large part of the problem is methane emitted by belching cows. Last year, a team at the University of California claimed to have reduced methane emissions from cattle by 99 per cent by adding marine algae to their feed. Garlic also helps to reduce their methane production. In the next decade, we can expect to see the world\u0027s first methane-free cattle.8. Modular nuclear power stations that cut the cost of power.Nuclear is likely to be an essential part of our future energy mix but there are two big problems with it at present: the cost, and the economic cost of an accident. Hinkley C, the first new nuclear power station in Britain in a generation, is being built only because the Government promised its operators a guaranteed price for electricity that is twice current market rates.One potential solution is small modular reactors, which would be cheaper because their standard parts could be built in factories, and safer because each module would contain far lower quantities of radioactive material.Several designs are being tested and by the end of the decade we can expect the first commercial stations to be in operation.         A California-based company, ZeroAvia, is developing a hydrogen-powered plane that it claims could compete in the market for small (10-20 seater) aircraft on journeys (stock image)9.

As a five-year trial around the River Otter in Devon ends, conservationists say the project has helped water voles, otters and birds to prosperAs part of the trial, experts from the University of Exeter examined the impact on water flow and quality, fish populations, vegetation and how the beavers affect people.Professor Richard Brazier, who led the research, said of the impact on the catchment\u0027s water flow, or hydrology: \u0027It\u0027s an amazing story, it\u0027s far more change than we expected.\u0027The beaver dams significantly slow the flow of water downstream and reduce the peak flows after heavy rain, potentially protecting against flooding.They also keep water in the streams in times of drought.Research shows the dams catch sediment and inorganic fertilisers being washed from farmland, causing plant life to flourish in the beaver ponds and boost other types of wildlife, Professor Brazier said.Despite concerns from anglers that dams could make it harder for fish to swim upstream to spawn, Professor Brazier said the research showed positive changes with fish living in the food-filled ponds, and still able to navigate the river.The beavers have also attracted tourists to the River Otter, benefiting local businesses such as pubs and cafes.There have been some downsides too, with landowners facing localised flooding or the beavers - who mostly favour willow - targeting orchard trees near the river.         The animals, which were hunted to extinction in Britain around 400 years ago, could also protect against floodingProfessor Brazier said: \u0027Overall, the social and economic benefits of having beavers in the landscape far outweigh the costs, but the costs tend to be borne by different people from those who benefit.\u0027The experts said a proactive management strategy was needed to prevent conflicts between people and beavers, and that payments, such as through agri-environment schemes, could support affected landowners.Overall, Mr Elliott said: \u0027The evidence is certainly positive in terms of showing people and beavers can live alongside each other.\u0027Because of the benefits they have I would like to see beavers reintroduced across large parts of Britain.\u0027National Farmers\u0027 Union senior countryside adviser Claire Robinson said the results from trials like that in the River Otter would need to inform a wider discussion with farmers before decisions on beavers in the landscape were taken.\u0027In the case of beavers, we do have concerns about the potential damage to farmland and the landscape caused by their physical activities.\u0027It is crucial that farmers have the tools to manage any impacts a beaver reintroduction could have,\u0027 she said."},{"url":null,"title":"Number time buyers 12 year high","story":"Share this article Mr Patel said: \u0027Even though the number of first-time buyers has stayed pretty much the same as last year, it is still encouraging to see first-time buyers top 350,000 for the second year in a row.\u0027They also represent over half of all homes bought with a mortgage, meaning the first-time buyer mortgage market share is at its highest since 1995, when they bought 53 per cent of all mortgage-financed homes.\u0027         However, there is still some way to reach the figure of 400,870 in 2006 – before the global financial crash (stock image)He continued: \u0027In recent years first-time buyers have been helped by strong competition driving mortgage rates down to near-record lows, making borrowing more accessible.\u0027Also government schemes such as stamp duty relief, Help to Buy equity loans and Help to Buy Isas will have made an impact.\u0027This combination of factors has made buying a home more accessible in recent years.\u0027This has seen the first-time buyer market bounce back from the financial crisis and perform better than other sectors, such as the home-moving and buy-to-let markets.\u0027However, as these figures show, the market may have now reached its peak and buying your first home still remains tough for many.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Keir Starmer emerges favourite Jeremy Corbyns job","story":"Share this article With less popular candidates eliminated, a final run-off would see Mr Starmer beat Ms Long-Bailey in the last round, according to the survey.The election process will be officially launched next week as Labour picks up the pieces from its worst general election defeat since 1935. Labour dropped to 202 seats and suffered a succession of historic defeats in its former working-class heartlands in the north of England.  In one particularly symbolic blow, the Conservatives won the County Durham seat of Sedgefield -

I was gathering schoolbooks when something caught my eye: lettuce leaves, lying on the carpet. Perfect! I thought, scooping them up and packing them. Now I won’t be hungry at university next year! I woke still glowing with pride.Since that dream, I’ve been thinking about how neatly education arranges life into endings and beginnings. You finish one segment, take a summer holiday, and step into the next – nervous, excited – and equipped, if you have my sort of foresight, with a handful of rotting lettuce leaves. But grownup life is more chaotic. There are plenty of potential beginnings – jobs, partners, dietary changes, but nobody has drawn up a schedule. Changes tend to be flung at you, or depend on your own efforts.In my novel Gravity Is the Thing, changes are both flung at and chosen by Abigail, owner-manager of the Happiness Cafe. Back when she was a teenager, Abigail’s brother vanished. Around the same time, she started receiving chapters in the mail from a self-help book called The Guidebook. Now, 20 years later, she’s invited to a retreat to learn “the truth” about The Guidebook.The absence of Abigail’s brother is central to her story. A missing loved one is a particularly traumatic loss because it isn’t entirely a loss. At any moment, the person could reappear. There’s no ending, so there can’t be a new beginning: life without the loved one cannot start. In Gravity, I wanted to explore the promises of the self-help industry in this context of ambiguous loss: much like hope, self-help can be both transformative and destructive.At first, the idea of choosing 10 books about new beginnings alarmed me. I couldn’t think of any. Then I realised that all novels have at least one crisis, discovery or transformation, and each of these triggers new beginnings. Essentially, then, this is a list of books that have been special to me (not the most special, those would be the books of my sisters, Liane and Nicola) or that have shaped me as a writer or person, angled to catch the light.1. Cocaine Blues by Kerry GreenwoodPhryne Fisher, sexy, sassy and newly arrived in Melbourne, Australia, decides to become a private detective. This is the first in a series that is pure, witty, intelligent escapism, each book improving on the one before. I read these in the bath, with chocolate, whenever I’m worried or sad, and everything is instantly better.2. Case Histories by Kate AtkinsonIn his own way, Jackson Brodie is just as charismatic, sexy and capable as Phryne Fisher. Case Histories, the first of Brodie’s stories, has him embarking on his new career as private detective. I read this many years ago, on a train between Toronto and Montreal, just after a miscarriage, and cried at almost every page. It was exactly what I needed. I already admired Kate Atkinson, but this was when I fell in love with her exuberant, powerful prose.3. In the Mood by Laura BloomSet in Sydney in 1946, In the Mood depicts a young couple attempting to restart their marriage after the husband’s return from war. Bloom’s writing is exquisite, and her meticulous dissection of a relationship frayed by secrets and trauma is reminiscent of Henry James (without the excessive sub-clauses). I’ve always been drawn to novels like this that take the domestic sphere as seriously as it deserves.4. Lenny’s Book of Everything by Karen FoxleeEveryone should read this children’s book set in the 1970s. Lenny’s brother, Davy, was born “six days after Neil Armstrong took his famous step and everyone was still crazy with moon fever”. But Lenny’s mother has a “dark heart feeling” about Davy, a feeling “as big as the sky kept inside a thimble”. Davy begins to grow, and does not stop, and so begin years of doctor and hospital visits, worry and hope. The kindness of neighbours, the distraction of Burrell’s Build-It-at-Home Encyclopaedia, Davy’s winning charm and Lenny’s determination, complete an immersive tale about loss and its transformative powers. It will make you sob.5. Self-Help by Lorrie MooreMost of the stories in this collection explore new beginnings of different kinds: how to become “the other woman”, how to be the child of newly orced parents. In the succinctly titled How, we learn how to start a doomed love affair: “Begin by meeting him in a class, in a bar, at a rummage sale.” Moore’s prose is poetic, sharp and devastatingly funny. Just when you think there’s nothing new to say about relationships, Moore cracks open a fresh layer and confounds you with her insight.6. Chrestomanci by Diana Wynne JonesI usually write for young people so I often read children’s books. My favourites are funny, emotionally authentic and contain practical magic. Wynne Jones’s books, like those of Ellen Raskin and Sally Gardner, make my soul breathe a sigh of relief. The Chrestomanci books are set in parallel worlds to ours, and feature protagonists discovering their magical abilities and setting out to develop them. The charming Christopher Chant appears just in time, offering elegant solutions to seemingly intractable problems.7. Dear Mrs Bird by AJ PearceA comic delight of a tale about friendship and love set against the grim landscape of London during the blitz, this novel sensitively conveys how life, even in tragedy and heartbreak, can be humorous and hopeful. Emmeline Lake accidentally takes a new job typing up letters for an advice columnist at a women’s magazine in London, 1941, which rules an extensive range of subjects out of bounds. Defying her instructions, Emmeline begins to answer them herself.8. Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine by Gail HoneymanI read this novel on an aeroplane and it made me laugh often and cry more. Eleanor, nearly 30, has been leading a precise, guarded and solitary life, holding herself together through addiction and routine. Then a singer walks on to a stage, and Eleanor falls instantly in love: “He blazed … I sat forward on my seat, edged closer. At last. I’d found him.” A marvel of humour and heartbreak, Eleanor Oliphant reveals how a new friendship can begin to unravel the traumas that are knotted deep within us.9. Dark Emu by Bruce Pascoe A book about new beginnings that stopped my breath and knocked me sideways. This is an eviscerating study of the beginnings of Australian colonialism. It collects compelling evidence that Indigenous Australians were not, as the prevailing historical narrative maintains – and as required by the law of terra nullius – wandering hunter gatherers, but had established both agriculture and dwellings.10. The Waves by Virginia WoolfThis novel opens with a group of children starting out on their life journeys, and has them guide us through to their old age and death in six exquisite, first-person accounts. I read it in high school and it was my first encounter with language so intensely beautiful. It is lyrical, inventive, self-referential and determined to excavate relentlessly in pursuit of truth.• Gravity Is the Thing by Jaclyn Moriarty is published by Allen \u0026amp Unwin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fef51de4360f2b8ddcde08339929f64a62f6ccf/0_349_2571_1542/master/2571.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2920a297cbaa11c0fa5c0ed7204da101","title":"ts eliot intimate letters to confidante emily hale unveiled after 60 years","story":"Collection of 1,131 letters may shed light on poet’s relationship with Emily HaleA collection of more than 1,000 letters from the Nobel laureate TS Eliot to his confidante and muse Emily Hale is unveiled this week, after having been kept in sealed boxes at a US university library for 60 years.The cache promises to offer an intimate insight into the poet’s life and work, and on the extent of his relationship with Hale, a source of speculation for decades.The 1,131 letters, which date from between 1930 and 1956, were donated by Hale to Princeton University Library more than 60 years ago with her stipulation they remain sealed until 50 years after either Eliot’s death, or her own, whichever occurred last. He died in 1965, and she in 1969.The two had met in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1912, when Eliot attended Harvard. They rekindled their friendship in 1927, by which time Eliot had moved to England. He corresponded frequently with Hale, who was from Boston, and who taught drama at US universities including Scripps College in California.Eliot ordered Hale’s letters to him to be burned, according to biographers.“I think it’s perhaps the literary event of the decade,” Anthony Cuda, an Eliot scholar and director of the TS Eliot International Summer School, told the Associated Press. “I don’t know of anything more awaited or significant. It’s momentous to have these letters coming out.”Their relationship “must have been incredibly important and their correspondence must have been remarkably intimate for him to be so concerned about the publication,” he added.Eliot was born in St Louis, Missouri, in 1888. His best known works include The Waste Land, The Hollow Men and Four Quartets.His letters to Hale began after the end of his first marriage to the Cambridge governess Vivienne Haigh-Wood. Scholars point to the first poem in the Quartets series, called Burnt Norton and named after a home in England Eliot visited with Hale, as significant because of lines that suggest missed opportunities and what might have been. Eliot married his second wife, Valerie Fletcher, in 1957.The Eliot scholar Frances Dickey, one of the editors on The Complete Prose of TS Eliot, said the poet was ashamed of his first marriage. The letters could reveal how close he and Hale were, and if they ever considered marriage, she said. Whatever else Hale was, she said, she was a link to the life he had left behind in the US.The 12 boxes, which include photographs, ephemera and clippings, were unsealed by Princeton University Library staff in October to be scanned for digital viewing at the library from 2 January.Susan Stewart, a professor of English at Princeton, who was present at the unsealing, said two senior librarians “stood behind a table full of wooden crates wielding dual pairs of tin snips.“They proceeded in tandem to snap the copper bands holding the crates and the wooden slats clattered to the table.”She added that what little was known about the correspondence indicated “Eliot wrote to Hale freely about his predilections, his fellow poets, and above all, his opinions as a reader”.Daniel Linke, the interim head of special collections at the library, said there was minimal, if any reading, during the unsealing.

It is fair to say that Ashley was not the only one who did not see that coming.In fact, JD Sports, along with eight of the decade’s other top 10 performers who ended 2019 in the FTSE 100, were not even in London’s blue chip index at the beginning of the decade.The flipside of Slater’s point can be seen by studying a separate list of the most valuable shares in the FTSE 100 at the beginning and end of the 2010s.Only two names have dropped out of the list: BG Group, which was acquired by Royal Dutch Shell in 2016, and Vodafone, which in 2014 sold its stake in its American subsidiary Verizon Wireless and then handed the £18bn idend back to shareholders.While Tesco’s bottom-of-the-table performance may have been partially self-inflicted, the company could also point to general sector issues, as the German discounters Aldi and Lidl increased their influence during the decade.Energy stocks also gave investors a miserable 10 years. They were booming as we entered the last decade., with the consensus view that economic growth in China would carry share prices higher still."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64f43a1fe0b44dd0a4f87e8125ff6c178a0522cd/213_796_5991_3595/master/5991.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70b6251f50b2480f127df7baaf46ffd7","title":"greggs launches meatless steak bake beef up vegan range","story":"Bakery chain hopes the £1.55 snack will prove as successful as its Quorn-based sausage rollGreggs, the UK’s largest bakery chain, will end speculation about its hotly anticipated new vegan snack by launching a meat-free version of its popular steak bake.Since the runaway success of its meatless sausage roll, the chain – which serves more than 6 million customers a week from its 2,000 outlets – has been working to develop vegan versions of its other bestselling items.The new product arrives on Greggs’ shelves at the start of Veganuary – a growing movement that encourages people to embrace plant-based diets during January.The vegan steak bake has been created to mirror some of the original snack’s features, including 96 thin layers of puff pastry but without the egg glaze. The filling is made with pieces of the fungi-based protein Quorn instead of beef, mixed with diced onions and meat-free gravy.Costing from £1.55, it will go on sale in 1,300 shops from Thursday before being rolled out to the remaining 700 outlets on 16 January.Greggs’ chief executive, Roger Whiteside, said: “Our vegan sausage roll launch was a huge success and we’ve been working tirelessly to expand our vegan-friendly offering and provide more delicious savoury food on-the-go options for people looking to reduce their meat intake.”Speculation about its successor has been mounting for months but has been rife for the last few days after a sign for a steak bake was spotted in a store and circulated on social media.The launch comes as retailers expand their vegan and plant-based offerings amid the growing popularity of flexitarian diets – where a largely vegetable-based diet is supplemented occasionally with meat.The Co-op chain is rolling out a new vegan range, called Gro, featuring 35 products, including alternatives to its steak bake, chilli con carne and sticky toffee pudding, that will be stocked in 2,000 stores and up to 4,000 independent retailers through its wholesale operation. The Co-op already offers almost 120 vegan wines but its entire beer and cider range will become vegan in 2020.This month Waitrose is doubling its vegan range, adding more than 30 new own-label and branded products, of which many are “first to market”. They include crisp-crumbed fishless goujons made from banana blossom – a flesh flower that hails from south-east Asia – and a pizza topped with vegan pepperoni.Meanwhile, diners at KFC will from Thursday be able to buy its new vegan burger – now a permanent item on its menu – after the success of an earlier trial. The fast-food chain’s usual “finger lickin’ good” chicken breast is replaced with a Quorn fillet coated in herbs and spices.More than 100,000 people have already pledged to stick to a plant-based diet for Veganuary, double the number who took part last year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d631c5f63180cc5125d509da9414bedadb78683/28_31_4882_2928/master/4882.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=852f00137808f2c49bf8c1cd29a6b7a4","title":"uk economy stagnation end 2019 survey shows","story":"British Chambers of Commerce report says long-term uncertainty is impeding growthThe UK economy ended 2019 in stagnation, under pressure from long-term uncertainty, mounting business costs and a global economic slowdown, according to a business survey.The British Chambers of Commerce’s (BCC) latest quarterly economic snapshot, based on a poll of 6,500 firms across the country in November, painted a gloomy picture of the economy at the end of the last decade.Cash flow, a key indicator of the health of businesses, improved slightly from its lowest level in eight years but remained very weak across the manufacturing and service industries.Suren Thiru, the BCC’s head of economics, said: “The UK economy limped through the final quarter of 2019.“The fourth quarter was characterised by a broad-based slowdown in the dominant services sector with all key indicators weakening in the quarter, amid sluggish household expenditure and crippling cost pressures.“Despite some improvements, indicators in the manufacturing sector remain very weak by historic standards. A faltering service sector together with listless manufacturing activity points to a downbeat outturn for UK GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2019.”Turning to manufacturers, the measures for domestic and export sales improved slightly. However, order books were negative for the last two quarters.Adam Marshall, the BCC’s director general, called on the government to use its newfound majority to take big decisions to stimulate growth.“The end of political deadlock at Westminster must also bring action to renew business confidence and tackle the prolonged stagnation that’s affecting so much of the UK economy. If ministers take action to reduce upfront costs, move key infrastructure projects forward, and to help businesses on training, they’ll be rewarded with increased investment.“However, they also must move quickly over the coming weeks to ensure that Brexit is done right. A clear future trading relationship with the EU is also crucial to many firms’ future investment and growth prospects.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/047e03eb9d1385e223b99b550f11dcf871b2c176/0_131_3936_2362/master/3936.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88a99daa4b1aa3f3d3b3be5cc7788c44","title":"questions labour win party defeat","story":"There can be no quick fixes. The party needs to take time for judgments to settle about its descent into the electoral abyssNearly a month ago Jeremy Corbyn announced he would step down after a period of reflection. This week he offered the first fruits of that process: 2019, Corbyn announced, had been “quite the year for our country and our labour movement”. Nevertheless, he added: “We have built a movement. We are the resistance to Boris Johnson.”It is hard to know whether to laugh or cry. But Labour is unquestionably going to have to do very much better than this if it is to climb out of the electoral abyss into which Corbyn led it in December. Talking about resistance to Johnson is simply displacement activity. The central truth is that Labour has to make itself the electable alternative that it failed to be in 2019. It needs to have a strategy for power. In the real world, power is hope, not the other way round.This is extremely likely to occur if Labour continues to put the cart before the horse. The leadership election is under way. But the period of reflection has barely started. It needs more time and structure. The costs were obvious this week, when the apparent frontrunner published a manifesto of vacuous generality, which posed no difficult questions and lacked substantive proposals for doing anything differently. On the basis of that article, if Rebecca Long Bailey is the answer, then Labour is asking the wrong question.If it is to be useful, Labour’s period of reflection needs some ground rules it currently lacks. These include: a recognition of the gravity of the situation, an obligation to answer difficult questions, a dispassionate study of the facts, an open-minded approach, a willingness to admit mistakes, the avoidance of slogans, and the willingness to listen to others – who should include Labour’s opponents and (increasingly the same thing) the voters. There is not much sign of any of that yet.The right questions need to be rooted in a balanced and honest appraisal of Labour’s electoral position. And the answers must avoid the habit, which affects all sides in the party, of evading difficult truths by talking about something else. So here are some of the important questions, and my own brief and provisional answers:Was Brexit the main problem? It was one of them, but Labour’s Brexit problem was its longstanding ambiguity, not its pro-European approach. Labour still needs a European policy for the post-Brexit 2020s.So was it Corbyn? The surveys say yes. His ratings were the worst ever for a Labour leader. But the Corbyn programme was not believed either. Competence matters, and Labour had not put in the hard yards on that. Corbyn would have claimed the credit for a win, so he must accept the blame for the defeat.Did Labour win the argument? No, it did not. Some aspects of Labour’s campaign cut through, but not by enough. The election result tells the story: Labour lost. To say otherwise is to be in denial. Too many still are.Was it the media’s fault? No … but. Britain’s media is politically biased and not as good as it thinks it is. It made mistakes in 2019, some of which would have been difficult to avoid. But these get exaggerated. The answer is not a more politicised media but better standards.Would a return to New Labour be the answer? Of course not – 2024 will not be 1994. New Labour must own its failures, just as the Corbynistas must own theirs. But if Labour cannot reconcile its militants and its moderates, it will pay the price. It needs to try.Should Labour be a socialist party? A big question for some, but not the main one for most. It depends what you mean by socialism. Labour ignores aspiration and the desire to do well at its peril. Inidualism and community are not incompatible. It also depends on how much it matters to you to win elections.Is it all over for Labour? No. See above. But Labour has been on a losing streak for a decade. It is now steered by a clique that have run it close to catastrophe, and who should get the boot. After 1992, many asked if Labour could ever win again. It turned out that it could. But this time things could get worse before they get better, and Labour may not win an election for a decade.Should Labour split into a left party and a centre-left party? Not if it hopes to win power in the next 20 years. The traditions need to recognise that each is legitimate.Finally, stop obsessing about the left. Most people are not interested. Think instead about problems, programmes and priorities. And we members of the Amalgamated Union of Commentators, Columnists and Allied Pundits should stop talking about Labour as “us”. Those days are gone. We must watch what happens next and allow judgments time to settle. Millions of people who want a better government and a different kind of society don’t see Labour as the answer, let alone as all-knowing and all-virtuous, for the simple reason that right now it is neither."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/329bc72de9affe5f424a555eb8b7037c04a4d245/0_50_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55ee511dd9fa31b776d002a7e00425c9","title":"heres why the uk wants to strengthen its relationship with new zealand maori","story":"The UK and Māori of Aotearoa New Zealand are looking to the past to build stronger relationships for the futureThe connections between the UK and New Zealand are such that we feel instantly at home in each other’s countries, sipping a flat white or an English Breakfast tea. We have a similar sense of humour, a similar sense of adventure, similar tastes. There is so much that feels familiar. But perhaps the greatest joy of my first two years as British high commissioner to New Zealand has been getting to know that which is less familiar: learning about and building connections with te ao Māori whānui – the wider Māori community.In my time here in Aotearoa New Zealand, I have been welcomed onto marae meeting houses from Bluff to Waitangi, and attended the annual coronation of the Māori king. I have learnt to speak (some!) Māori. I have – with my team – learnt tikanga Māori (customary practices), as well as our shared and sometimes painful history. I have built friendships. And I have delighted in seeing my children absorb Māori culture: doing their introductory pepehā, throwing themselves into kapahaka dance, and fully at ease at a haka pōwhiri (welcome ceremony), greeting by hongi after hongi after hongi.When I expressed regret, on behalf of the British government, for the killing of nine Māori by Captain Cook’s crew 250 years ago, it was met with a wide range of responses. The response that mattered most was that of the local Tūranga iwi and hapū, the descendants of those killed, who responded with tears, warmth and friendship. I also received a large number of positive messages from across New Zealand society.But for some the expression of regret didn’t go far enough in addressing the wrongs of the past. And some at the other end of the spectrum felt that I was interfering in New Zealand’s affairs – with one person even calling for me to leave the country. (As of the time of writing, no transport has been provided, so I am still here.)But the focus on me as an inidual missed the fact that the expression of regret was part of a wider UK approach. And while I am deeply invested, personally, in this agenda, it is not just me as high commissioner, it is the UK writ-large – government, people, business, cultural institutions – who want the closest possible relationship with Aotearoa New Zealand. That means with both Pākeha and Māori, with the Crown and with all the Iwi of Aotearoa. And that is a commitment that will extend way beyond my tenure here in New Zealand.Our work to address the past is part of the UK’s broader efforts to build a real and enduring partnership with Māori, and strengthen our business, cultural and people-to-people links. We have established a formal relationship with the Federation of Māori Authorities, co-hosted an Auckland Māori Business Networking event with Ernst and Young Tahi, and are mapping out what more we can do, now and in the future, to increase trade connections between the UK and Māori.There is a lot going on in the cultural and research space, too. In Gisborne, I went to the opening of Tū te Whaihanga, an exhibition of taonga (cultural treasures) that left the region 250 years ago, and are now back on loan from museums in the UK and Germany. And in November we took a delegation to the UK for He Whai Mātauranga (In Pursuit of Knowledge), a programme designed to enable greater access for Māori to taonga held in the UK, by building stronger relationships between iwi and UK cultural institutions. We also launched a UK scholarship programme, supporting three post-grad Māori museum studies students to do research in the UK in 2020, and hope that these connections, and this sharing of knowledge, will lead to even greater collaborations between the UK and Aotearoa New Zealand.Whatever we may think of those first encounters 250 years ago, the ties that are left are strong: between the UK and Aotearoa New Zealand, and between the UK and Māori. We cannot change the past, but we can learn from it and, equipped with that knowledge, begin to chart a way forward. I am under no illusions as to how much we have to do: we are at the start of this journey. But what I hope is clear is the genuine intent of the UK, its government and people, to build an enduring partnership with iwi and hāpu Māori, and with all the people of Aotearoa. For we are only ever as strong as the relationships we build.Naku te rourou, nau te rourou, ka ora ai te iwi (with your basket and my basket the people will prosper)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e354380f3dd979f81cc1a152e7706f3cfb557219/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a749c23b4dee709db0c4cd94bb32fa91","title":"nature rewild eco anxiety seas climate emergency environment","story":"We can keep our eco-anxiety at bay by working to rewild our seas and restore our environmentIt’s going to be a rough year. The fatal combination of escalating climate breakdown and the capture of crucial governments by killer clowns provokes a horrible sense of inevitability. Just when we need determined action, we know that our governments, and the powerful people to whom they respond, will do everything they can to stymie it.Witness the disasters in Australia. In mid-December, on the day the nation’s lethal heatwave struck, Rupert Murdoch’s newspaper the Australian filled its front page with a report celebrating new coal exports and a smear story about the chiefs of the state fire services, who were demanding an immediate end to the burning of fossil fuels. The response of the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to the escalating catastrophe was to embark on a holiday overseas as his country burned.Some of the Earth’s largest land masses – Australia, Russia, the US, Brazil, China, India and Saudi Arabia – are governed by people who seem to care little for either humankind or the rest of the living world. To maintain their grip on power, which means appeasing key oligarchs and industries, they appear prepared to sacrifice anything – including, perhaps, the survival of humanity.I know that the protesters who made 2019 the year of climate action will continue to step up. We will do all we can to focus the world’s attention on the greatest crisis human beings have ever faced. But with hostile governments blocking a collective international response to this emergency, the struggle will feel increasingly desperate.I admit that I’m feeling quite close to burnout. I believe resilience is the most useful human quality, and I’ve sought to cultivate it, but in 2019 I felt my resolve begin to weaken at times as it has never done before. Part of the reason is doubtless my continuing health issues: the repeated complications and procedures that have followed my cancer treatment two years ago. Sometimes it’s hard to disentangle the external and internal sources of despondency.For many people, there is no such separation. We now know that people living in heavily polluted places have higher levels of depression and suicide: air pollution has been implicated in brain inflammation and damage to nerve cells, both of which have been linked to mental illness. Research has also linked wellbeing with environmental quality: a recent study in Denmark suggests that people who grew up in places with plenty of green space have a lower chance of developing a psychiatric disorder than those who were surrounded only by artificial surfaces, even when all other factors have been taken into account.I have tried to keep my eco-anxiety at bay, to box it into my working life. But every month this becomes more difficult. The rising sense of panic I feel is entirely rational we should all be feeling it. But we can’t live with it through every hour of every day.So my new year’s resolution is to spend more time on my sea kayak. It possesses almost miraculous properties: it is a four-metre, plastic rejuvenation machine. After a day on the water, ideally paddling as far as I can, sometimes until the coast is out of sight, I feel ready for anything.But even across this experience a shadow now falls: my gathering awareness of what I should be seeing at sea, and its resounding absence. The shocking and distressing fact is that the waters around the UK were once among the most abundant on Earth, and are now among the least. Armies of bluefin tuna once stormed our coasts, harrying shoals of mackerel and herring many miles long. Halibut the size of barn doors and turbot like tabletops came into shallow water to feed. Cod commonly reached almost two metres haddock grew to a metre. Plaice were the size of road atlases. Pods of fin whales and sperm whales could be seen from the shore, while Atlantic grey whales, now extinct, roamed our estuaries. Gigantic sturgeon poured up the rivers to spawn, pushing through traffic jams of salmon, sea trout, lampreys and shad. On some parts of the seabed the eggs of the herring lay six-feet deep.Much of the sea floor was covered by a continuous crust of life: reefs of oysters and mussels, soft corals and sea pens, sea fans and sponges, peacock worms and anemones, stabilising the sediments and filtering the water column, with the result that our seas might have been crystal clear. The abundance of everything, if we were to transport ourselves back a few hundred years, would blow our minds.Now, on some days, it’s a surprise to see anything. I might, if I’m lucky, spot a flock of shearwaters, skimming the waves with their velvety wings, a couple of gannets, a solitary razorbill, the occasional small bait ball. When I kayak in Cardigan Bay, in Wales, what I hope to find above all else is dolphins. Sometimes I do, and these days are the waymarks of my life. But my sightings seem to have become less common since scallop dredgers were allowed back into even the most “strictly protected” parts of the bay by the Welsh government, ripping up the seabed and destroying most of the life it harbours.It’s all so stupid. Commercial fishing is by far the greatest cause of ecological destruction at sea, but produces less income and employment in the UK than the industries it wrecks. Recreational angling alone, which is perpetually threatened by the absence of fish, generates more jobs and money than commercial fishing. Whale and dolphin watching, ing and snorkelling would, if allowed to prosper, greatly enhance the livelihoods of coastal people. And this is to say nothing of the immeasurable improvements in the lives of everyone connected to a thriving, abundant living system.If we stop dragging trawls and dredges through it, the life of the seas would recover with astonishing speed. Because most marine animals are highly mobile during at least one stage of their development, the rewilding of the seas needs little help from humans. But we could make a few useful interventions, such as the possibly crazy but wonderful idea once proposed by two researchers at the University of Central Lancashire of transporting Pacific grey whales to the Atlantic and the less crazy but equally wonderful idea of reintroducing the Dalmatian pelican – a species that was native to the UK until the middle ages. Both species play a crucial role in marine food webs, and can fill our lives with wonder.Recharging nature recharges the human spirit. In 2020, we could all do with some of that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cb6f174f2f066d41753b926625d356beb8af32a/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0919e2e297c1141f8b1f3eb3861ab3f9","title":"music for 2020 pop classical preview","story":"The queen of pop gets intimate, Taylor Swift feels the sunshine and Stormzy takes on the world … plus, classical celebrations begin for Beethoven’s 250thby  Alexis Petridis and  Andrew ClementsKrept and Konan’s last UK live show was at the 20,000-capacity O2 Arena, a rapturously received home town extravaganza with guest appearances from Stefflon Don and Stormzy.

Amid the bass-heavy party anthems, the lyrics were frequently agonised and self-baiting, marking out the rapper – an affiliate of Kendrick Lamar’s Black Hippy collective – as one of hip-hop’s more thoughtful, conflicted figures.Tour begins 25 January, O2 Academy, GlasgowThe Madame X Tour – in which Madonna plays small venues for the first time since 1985 – has had good reviews and bad publicity in equal measure. The audience in Las Vegas booed her when her show started two hours late, and one US fan attempted to sue her for it – but critics rushed to acclaim the performances. We shall see when she comes to London, where the most expensive tickets are an eye-watering £1,200.27 January–16 February, London PalladiumThe Malian singer-songwriter has carved out a unique niche for herself, combining an acting career with an impressively wide-ranging approach to music that’s seen her collaborate with everyone from Herbie Hancock and Bobby Womack to Damon Albarn and Disclosure. It highlights a disinclination to be pinned down that also informs her solo work: her last album, 2018’s Fenfo, ran the gamut from traditional Malian kora to 60s soul influences.Tour begins 30 January, Roundhouse, LondonCarly Rae Jepsen’s career has never again scaled the commercial heights of her 2012 hit Call Me Maybe – the song with the greatest chorus of the 21st century according to Billboard – but she has instead developed into one of pop’s more intriguing characters, wresting control of her own artistic direction, making consistently fascinating albums, including 2019’s Dedicated, and gaining a noticeably older audience than her peers.Tour begins 7 February, Victoria Warehouse, ManchesterNever let it be said that rock music no longer throws up anything unexpected: the Hu garnered 25m YouTube views for their 2018 debut single Yuve Yuve Yu, on which the Ulaanbaatar quartet melded heavy metal with Mongolian throat singing. Their debut album The Gereg became a global hit in 2019, a sign that they’d hit on something truly unique.Tour begins 8 February, Chalk, BrightonThe Slow Rush is the first album by the expansive Australian psychedelicists for five years, and the follow-up to Currents, which established them not merely as an adventurous musical force but an influence on mainstream pop. Rihanna covered one of its tracks, New Person, Same Old Mistakes frontman Kevin Parker went on to collaborate with Lady Gaga, Kanye West and Travis Scott. Judging by the tracks that have trailed it, The Slow Rush elaborates on the synth-heavy direction of its predecessor.14 FebruaryA one-off gig for the largely female septet whose debut album Blume – a rare foray into jazz, or rather, a convincing blend of jazz, Afrobeat, funk, surf guitar and all points in between, for noted indie label Domino – was released to loud applause in August. But the band really come into their own on stage, adding a rawness and dynamism to their improvisations.18 February, Village Underground, LondonThe three singles thus far released from the 1975’s delayed fourth album have encompassed everything from two-step garage and distorted, yowling punk rock to monologues from Greta Thunberg. Who knows what else it might contain? Not every avenue the 1975 try to head down yields perfect results, but there’s something laudable about an arena-packing band so determined to avoid resting on their laurels.21 FebruaryGrimes’ fifth album has had a tortuous gestation: initially scheduled for 2018, it was delayed amid arguments with her record label and considerable personal strife, including the death of her former manager and negative media coverage of her relationship with Elon Musk. It is apparently a dark concept album about “an anthropomorphic goddess”, which aims to make the notion of climate change “fun”. We shall see.21 February2019 was a good year for the former Lizzy Grant. Her sixth album, the Joni Mitchell-influenced, Laurel Canyon-set Norman Fucking Rockwell!, topped a lot of critics’ end of year lists. Some publications went so far as to suggest it is one of the albums of the decade. The tour that bears its name has already visited the US and the Middle East. Her career-ning set apparently ends with the album’s epic, 10-minute long centrepiece Venice Bitch.Tour begins 25 February, O2 Arena, LondonBarrington Hendricks promoted his third album of experimental hip-hop under the Jpegmafia name as “a disappointment”. No one else seemed to agree with that assessment, though. It was more approachable and melodic than his past work, yet its sound remained chaotically eclectic – he’s claimed influences from both Ol’ Dirty Bastard and Throbbing Gristle – and his stream-of-consciousness vocal style was as manic and provocative as ever. How its glitchy collage approach works live remains to be seen.Tour begins 27 February, EartH, London called Michael Kiwanuka’s eponymous third album – a song cycle displaying the influences of gospel, psychedelic soul and Jimi Hendrix, co-produced by Danger Mouse and London hip-hop auteur Inflo – “one of the greatest albums of the decade”, evidence of how finely crafted its songs were, and how perfectly it balanced the retro and contemporary. In addition, he is a gripping live performer, capable of expanding his material without seeming indulgent.Tour begins 1 March, O2 Academy, BirminghamSaxophonist and composer Cassie Kinoshi’s 10-piece band are in the thick of London’s young jazz revival: their lineup shares members with Sons of Kemet, Kokoroko and Maisha.

Her career since has been uneven, pinballing from chart-friendly EDM to collaborations with TV on the Radio’s David Sitek, but on this tour she returns to her debut, now 20 years old and still sounding, as she would put it, young, fresh and new.Tour begins 16 March, Albert Hall, ManchesterDespite being recorded without the pair ever actually meeting up in the studio, Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey’s most recent album, Who, proved an unexpected triumph: a tough, bolshy collection of songs and a distinct improvement on 2006’s Endless Wire. Their recent live shows have been impressive too, spiking the usual classics with deeper es into their back catalogue.Tour begins 16 March, Manchester ArenaBaxter Dury already had a cult following, but his last album, Prince of Tears, was a considerable step forward and one of 2017’s best: musically eclectic, its lyrics alternately thoughtful and scabrously funny, the sound of an artist finally coming into his own. The menacing, darkly comic single Slumlord – a jaded view of the world of social media, packed with “scary people saying silly shit” – suggests its follow-up is of the same standard.Released 20 MarchIt’s five years since Dan Snaith released an album under the Caribou name, the brilliant Our Love. In the interim, he has seemed more preoccupied by his straightforwardly dancefloor-facing alias Daphni. All of which makes Caribou’s forthcoming return with a new album, Suddenly, and a series of live dates, all the more welcome. The single You and I suggests there has been no dip in the quality of his warm, melancholy electronica.Tour begins 30 March, Brighton Dome2019 was a good year for Ohio-born, LA-based rapper Trippie Redd. His mixtape A Love Letter to You 4 entered the US charts at No 1, evidence of his shift from Soundcloud cultdom to mainstream success. Stylistically varied or hopelessly unfocussed, depending on your perspective, its best moments suggested an artist who could turn his hand to anything from guitar-heavy emo rap to straight-up club bangers.Tour begins 4 April, Brixton Academy, LondonStyles has by some distance the most successful solo career of any ex-One Directioner. There have been more takers for his brand of pop-by-way-of-classic-rock than his former bandmates’ dalliances with R\u0026ampB and Sheeran-esque acoustic whimsy. Whether recently released second album Fine Line will repeat the commercial performance of his eponymous debut remains to be seen, but the level of devotion Styles inspires suggests it will.Tour begins 15 April, Birmingham ArenaSaucerful of Secrets, in which the Pink Floyd drummer and a range of musical associates including Spandau Ballet’s Gary Kemp charge through key tracks from Pink Floyd’s pre-Dark Side of the Moon repertoire, could well have flopped. Instead, it’s been a huge success, garnering praise from his former bandmates and fans alike. These gigs come under the banner of More Games for May, a reference to Pink Floyd’s 1967 gig at the Royal Festival Hall.Tour begins 23 April, G Live, GuilfordJustin Vernon’s musical progress from his folky debut For Emma, Forever Ago has been one of the more interesting in alt-rock, taking in detours to electronica, R\u0026ampB and hip-hop: his most recent album i,i featured cameo roles for everyone from rap producer Wheezy to Bruce Hornsby, which gives you an idea of its breadth. It’s also pleasing that experimental music can end up in venues this big.Tour begins 26 April, Wembley Arena, LondonNick Cave’s most recent live activities have involved solo performances and an unmoderated audience Q\u0026ampA – a kind of IRL version of his Red Hand Files website, where fans are invited to ask him anything. This tour, however, brings back backing band the Bad Seeds, in the wake of their wildly acclaimed 2019 album Ghosteen. It will be intriguing to see how that album’s beatless songs work in arena-sized venues.Tour begins 2 May, Birmingham ArenaAn offshoot of Radio 3’s beloved Unclassified show, this series of gigs at the Southbank Centre pitches modern classical composers against artists working in the field of electronica. Owen Pallett and Daniel Avery offer new compositions in earlier instalments, but this final show features electronic sound artist Tim Hecker alongside composer Daniel Elms. 7 June, Royal Festival Hall, LondonThe Radiohead frontman’s solo tour is named after his 2014 album Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes rather than its 2019 successor Anima. He is accompanied by producer Nigel Godrich and visual artist Tarik Barri providing live projections. Thus far, the setlist has occasionally taken in Radiohead tracks, but largely concentrated on Yorke’s solo oeuvre and the work of his supergroup Atoms for Peace. By all accounts, the live performances add a drive and focus to his experimental electronica.Tour begins 19 June, SEC Centre, GlasgowThe news that Diana Ross will fill the Sunday afternoon “legend” slot at this year’s Glastonbury festival was greeted with widespread delight: it’s a combination that looks about as close to a nailed-on success as it’s possible to get. But Glastonbury is merely one stop on a UK tour, and if the setlist is anything like that of her acclaimed Vegas residency – heavy on Supremes hits and her Chic-produced disco era – it’s going to be a treat.Tour begins 30 June, Leeds ArenaThis year’s British Summertime gigs in Hyde Park include a pop extravaganza headlined by Little Mix, and Pearl Jam performing with the Pixies as support, but the pick of them may be the arrival in the UK of Taylor Swift’s self-styled Lover Fest, wherein she eschews her usual stadiums in favour of taking her most recent album around the world’s festivals. “The Lover album is open fields, sunsets, + SUMMER,” she explained on Instagram. “I want to perform it in a way that feels authentic.”11 July, Hyde Park, LondonThe breakout teen sensation of 2019, whose debut album When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? spawned five US platinum singles, returns to the UK for a series of arena gigs. The sense that her home-produced brand of dark electronics, adolescent psychodrama and gothic sci-fi imagery is a cut above has been bolstered by critical acclaim and comparisons not to her pop peers, but Nirvana – the latter courtesy of Dave Grohl.Tour begins 21 July, Manchester ArenaYou can get a sense of how far Stormzy has outstripped his UK hip-hop peers by the sheer geographical variety of dates on the tour supporting his second album, Heavy Is the Head. His sound is still rooted in British grime, as evidenced by recent single Wiley Flow, but his gigs take in not just Europe but the Middle East, China and Australasia. The biggest shows, however, will be in Britain: a stadium-sized victory lap.Tour begins 2 September, O2 Arena, LondonThe mammoth Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour enters its third year with a string of UK dates. Thus far it has proved notable not merely for its vast commercial success – the first leg alone grossed $125m – but the degree of acclaim it’s received. It is a beautifully staged two-and-a-half-hour extravaganza in which the hits are rolled out with considerable gusto – apparently for the final time.Tour begins 2 November, O2 Arena, LondonBeethoven will dominate the concert schedules in his 250th anniversary year, and his only opera, Fidelio, gets a new production at Covent Garden, with Lise Davidsen and Jonas Kaufmann heading the cast. Before that, however, the BBC Symphony Orchestra begins its year with the European premiere of David Lang’s contemporary take on the Fidelio story Claron McFadden is the unnamed woman struggling to save her partner from wrongful imprisonment. 11 January, Barbican, LondonFor more than a quarter of a century John Adams’s first was indelibly associated with Peter Sellars’ original 1987 production. But recently there have been a whole new generation of Nixon stagings, including John Fulljames’s version, first seen in Copenhagen and now shared with Scottish Opera. Joana Carneiro conducts a cast led by Eric Greene as Richard Nixon and Mark LeBrocq as Mao Tse-Tung.18-22 February, Theatre Royal, Glasgow 27-29 February, Festival Theatre, EdinburghThe Philharmonia reconstructs the historic concert that Beethoven gave in Vienna on 22 December 1808, which included the premieres of his Fifth and Sixth Symphonies and the Fourth Piano Concerto, as well as the Choral Fantasy. Esa-Pekka Salonen conducts the monumental programme, which also includes movements from the Mass in C and the concert aria Ah! Perfido.15 March, Royal Festival Hall, LondonThis Canadian-born, London-based composer is one of the artists-in-residence at the 73rd Aldeburgh festival. As well as Tracery, a new multi-speaker, split-screen installation, there’s the first performance of a work commissioned for soprano Juliet Fraser and the Bozzini Quartet, and the UK premiere of Miller’s A Large House for string orchestra and percussion.13, 16 and 20 June, Snape Maltings, Aldeburgh"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/749606117f427ed866bc206c93c721e86c825704/0_171_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3315d3b4a5fc49b54fb6b60338fb4788","title":"do you have a favourite tree share your pictures and stories","story":"As part of a new series, we’d like you to tell us about your favourite tree and why it’s special to youAs deforestation continues to threaten green space around the world, and the ’s Christmas appeal launches to tackle it, we’d like to celebrate our trees.Outside of their ecological value, many of us have sentimental attachment to trees.

But 12 months on, what has changed? Has there been any tangible improvement?While some brands continue to pump out clothes like there is no tomorrow (which if they carry on, there won’t be), many of us are rethinking the quantities of clothes we buy. Greta Thunberg was i-D’s most memorable cover star, “the girl who changed the world”, who turned up for the interview dressed in a purple puffer jacket, bright-pink snow trousers and rubber boots. “Her wardrobe is limited, she doesn’t want new things,” the magazine reported.In July, the Swedish Fashion Council cancelled Stockholm fashion week to explore more sustainable options, and Extinction Rebellion called for London Fashion Week to do the same. London fashion week went ahead as planned but the final day was marked by a symbolic funeral where XR Fashion members grieved for the industry.Never has the fashion and textile industry been such a focus of attention, primarily because of its disproportionate contribution to greenhouse gas emissions – 1.2bn tonnes of CO2 per year according to Greenpeace, more than that produced by international shipping. In August, 32 companies representing around 150 brands signed the Fashion Pact at the G7 summit, promising to cut greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 and to ban virgin plastic from packaging – by 2030. Considering that, according to the UN, we only have 10 years left to limit global warming to 1.5C, these are hollow targets.It’s not only the environment that the industry continues to disregard. The fire in December at the New Delhi bag factory, where around 100 people were sleeping overnight, resulted in more than 40 deaths. “Six years on from the Rana Plaza factory collapse, most brands still have far too little visibility of their supply chains,” said Carry Somers, co-founder of the organisation behind the #whomademyclothes campaign, Fashion Revolution. “Transparency leads to accountability which leads to change.” The Fashion Transparency Index is also pushing the industry towards greater transparency with year on year improvement for many of the brands listed. In a welcome move towards transparency, H\u0026ampM announced back in April that it would share details such as production country, supplier names, and names and address of factories with its customers. It has been a year of big statements by famous names, perhaps the boldest being Gucci’s claim in September that it was now carbon neutral. The greenwash radar went into overdrive. “The best way to get to zero emissions is to close the company, but then 18,000 people will lose their jobs. When we talk about the environment, we need to keep that in mind as well,” said CEO Marco Bizzarri. “Offsetting is better than not doing anything…”While some industry leaders are at least starting to send out positive messages, policy makers are not so enthusiastic. In June, the government rejected recommendations made by the environmental audit select committee to regulate the fast fashion industry, including a charge of 1p for each garment to fund better clothing collection and sorting, and a ban on incinerating unsold clothes or sending them to landfill. “The government is out of step with the public, who are shocked by the fact that we are sending 300,000 tonnes of clothes a year to incineration or landfill,” said the former Labour MP Mary Creagh, who chaired the committee.Despite the government’s inability to legislate, fashion activism was on the rise. In September, 62,000 people took part in Oxfam’s Secondhand September campaign, pledging to buy nothing new in an attempt to stem the flow of the 11m items of clothing sent to landfill every week in the UK. And an alternative to Black Friday is gaining momentum in the form of Buy Nothing Day. “In a world of overconsumption and fast fashion, one of the most radical things we can do is to keep our clothes in use for as long as possible,” declared the designer Christopher Raeburn, who closed the tills at his two stores and spent the day doing on-the-spot clothing repairs instead.The willingness to embrace new ways of shopping that disrupt the high-volume, fast-fashion model, such as resale platforms (Vestiaire Collective and Depop both popped up at Selfridges this year and continue to grow their audiences) and rental (witness the takeover of the (British) Fashion Awards in December by rental platform My Wardrobe HQ) – is tangible.Bethany Williams scooped the prize for best emerging talent for menswear at awards, having already won the Queen Elizabeth II award for design earlier in the year. She was also shortlisted for the LVMH prize and is nominated for the upcoming Arts Foundation award (winner announced in January). Her business model gives back to the social enterprises she works with to weave cloth from waste materials, and to charities who benefit from a percentage of her profits. Now that’s progress.

Moreover, the collective performance was good, built on spirit, hard work and sound game management, even if it came against a United team who were loose at the back and bankrupt in creative terms.Arsenal might have scored more in the first-half but the goals from Nicolas Pépé and Sokratis Papastathopoulos gave them more than enough to defend. United had arrived in decent form, their confidence up and it was a chance for them to close on fourth-placed Chelsea, who had drawn at Brighton earlier in the day.The game felt well set for United, given their preference to sting on the counterattack against teams who play on the front foot but they never got going. Even in the second half, when they had the territorial advantage, they struggled to create anything of note. Arsenal sat back, denying them the chance to break and that was pretty much that.Arteta has made intensity a priority and Arsenal started positively just as they had done against Chelsea on Sunday. Once again, they took an early lead and it was a big moment for Pépé, the £72m record signing, who profited from close range after Sead Kolasinac’s low cross had flicked off Victor Lindelöf’s heel. United wanted an offside against Kolasinac, who had collected a pass from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, but VAR confirmed the left-back was level.This was once the fixture of the Premier League season but a glance at the league table before kick-off told its own story. Those clashes, in which players such as Patrick Vieira and Roy Keane were prominent, were frequently underscored by spite and there were bits of niggle in this one, the tone set when David Luiz went through Anthony Martial in the first minute. He escaped a booking but Kolasinac did not when he pulled down Daniel James in the next action. The referee, Chris Kavanagh, was a busy man, ruling on a host of borderline incidents.United flickered at the outset before settling into a strangely passive groove, their only ploy being to play balls up the channels for their pacy attackers. It was too predictable. In the continued absence of the injured Paul Pogba and Scott McTominay, Ole Gunnar Solskjær played Fred and Nemanja Matic in central midfield and they were sluggish, to put it mildly the former’s performance summed up by the 90th-minute free-kick that threatened the top tier of the stand. In front of them, Jesse Lingard was anonymous as the No 10.Harry Maguire, who laboured at the back, sent a free header at Bernd Leno on 45 minutes – United’s only first-half chance – and, by then, Arsenal were 2-0 up, the second goal following horrible defending on a Pépé corner. Marcus Rashford was statuesque as Alexandre Lacazette darted in front of the near post to flick on and, although David De Gea reacted smartly to save, the ball came off Lindelöf again and Sokratis lashed home.The goal had been advertised, with Arsenal having tightened their grip from the half-hour mark. Lacazette turned Maguire brilliantly inside the area before toe-poking wide – he had to unload the effort quickly – while Lucas Torreira shot narrowly past the post after stealing away from Fred. United’s sloppiness was reflected by a botched clearance from De Gea, which hit Lacazette and broke for Pépé. He stepped away from Matic and curled a shot against the post. Arsenal won the midfield battle, with the fit-again Granit Xhaka enjoying an encouraging 90 minutes.Solskjær had been determined to concentrate on the players who were at his disposal but, inevitably, Pogba’s absence provided a subplot. It was revealed after the game that the midfielder needs surgery on the foot injury that has wrecked his season and the operation would rule him out for the rest of the month.It should mean that a January transfer is out of the question but, with the battle lines drawn between the club and Pogba’s agent, Mino Raiola, there have to be questions about how much longer the player wants to remain at Old Trafford. Raiola has said that United are “out of touch with reality and without a sporting project”, a club that would “even ruin Maradona, Pelé and Maldini”.Arteta’s team are not ready to maintain the physical demands he makes of them and they dropped deeper from the beginning of the second half. United took up residence in the Arsenal half, as Solskjær swapped Lingard and James for Mason Greenwood and Andreas Pereira.The latter had a sight of goal when he was played through by Matic only to hit the side-netting but that would be as good as it got for United, with their desperation being reflected when Aaron Wan-Bissaka tried to win a penalty with a e. Like his team, he got nothing. For Arsenal, to borrow a line from Sokratis, the fun is back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6821484be2a7367f5dc8a95b6062ca366a0a0251/127_88_3373_2024/master/3373.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e425bf819638221228ea9c9c7fc59995","title":"brighton chelsea premier league match report","story":"The transfer window is open and, on the evidence of yet another careless attacking display, Chelsea need to dip into that £150m budget. Frank Lampard spent the majority of a scrappy contest bemoaning his team’s sloppiness in the final third and they paid a heavy price, suffering another stumble in the race to qualify for the Champions League when Alireza Jahanbakhsh came off the bench to rescue a deserved draw for Brighton with an astonishing bicycle kick.Inconsistent and imprecise, Chelsea have not won successive Premier League games since the start of November and they could not complain after failing to withstand a spirited comeback from Brighton. Lampard, who was outmanoeuvred by Graham Potter’s tactical alterations, had much to ponder.It was a disappointing effort from Chelsea and the lack of incision should convince the club to take advantage of their transfer ban being lifted as speculation mounts about moves for Jadon Sancho, Moussa Dembélé, Wilfried Zaha and Timo Werner.“It was an incredible equaliser but I think we deserved it,” Lampard said. “In the first half, if we are ruthless, the game is out of sight. We had opportunities to play people in who could score, to keep doing what we did in the first 20 minutes. We came off that slightly. We allowed them to feel they’re in the game and they’re a good team.“The Christmas period has probably been a small showing of our season. Tottenham was a fantastic performance. Arsenal showed great spirit for a young group. Southampton, we struggled to break a team down and lost at home. Then today we should have the mindset to kill it and we don’t.”Lampard was fuming and he stonewalled suggestions Chelsea could include Olivier Giroud as part of an £80m deal to sign Zaha from Crystal Palace. “The idea of that deal is something I have never considered,” the Chelsea manager said. “I won’t talk about Zaha because he is not a player of ours. If we have to do business we will do it in the way we see fit, to try to make us better, and that’s behind closed doors.”Nonetheless Chelsea’s forwards should be worried. Christian Pulisic flattered to deceive before being replaced by Callum Hudson-Odoi, who was just as ineffective on the left, and Willian offered little on the right. There was a lack of care in the decisive areas and Lampard grew irritable as the first half wore on, grumbling when Tammy Abraham spurned a chance to add to César Azpilicueta’s 10th-minute goal, shooting when he could have released Willian.Not that it was all about the big team’s failings. This was Brighton’s first ever point against Chelsea and they might even have snatched all three after Jahanbakhsh’s stunner, only for Kepa Arrizabalaga to repel Neal Maupay’s low drive. Arrizabalaga would also make a fine stop from Aaron Connolly, whose introduction at the break gave Brighton more urgency. “I thought the players were amazing,” Potter said. “You go toe to toe with Chelsea and if you make mistakes they punish you. We had to adjust because our structure wasn’t so good in the first half. We got better.”Chelsea, back to 4-2-3-1 after ditching their 3-4-3 system 34 minutes into their victory over Arsenal, started well, and took the lead after Reece James, included at right-back after a surprisingly quick recovery from an ankle injury, won a corner. Willian crossed to the far post, where Kurt Zouma headed down for Abraham to shoot from close range. Aaron Mooy blocked on the line but the ball broke to Azpilicueta, who turned in his third goal of the season.At that stage, with Brighton uncomfortable in a midfield diamond, Chelsea should have pulled clear. But perhaps it was too easy. Chelsea’sintensity faded and Brighton threatened before half-time, Maupay teeing up Leandro Trossard to test Arrizabalaga.Brighton, who will be without Dan Burn for two months after the left-backbroke his collarbone in a collision with James, were improving.Potter jettisoned the diamond and he made another alteration during the interval, removing Yves Bissouma for Connolly.The change meant Brighton were using a 4-4-2 and Potter was rewarded for throwing caution to the wind. Arrizabalaga denied Connolly but the breakthrough arrived when Lewis Dunk’s header led to Jahanbakhsh’s moment of magic. The Iranian winger had ended his long wait for a Brighton goal during last weekend’s win over Bournemouth and his second in two games means Chelsea must ask themselves some tough questions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90b59ac2e215bf71ae3fa8c9ffb9a9a3592b9847/292_90_1611_966/master/1611.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6cd0246a266ee1bfa6a09342f7027af7","title":"jose mourinho southampton coach idiot var ballboys","story":"José Mourinho called one of Southampton’s backroom staff “an idiot”, accused the St Mary’s ballboys of being coached to waste time and said VAR should be rebranded as his Spurs side lost Harry Kane to a hamstring injury in a dispiriting 1-0 defeat on the south coast.The Tottenham manager admitted he was booked for being rude to the Southampton goalkeeping coach, Andrew Sparkes, after venturing into the home dugout to air his frustration at what he felt was Sparkes’s time wasting. “I think the yellow card is fair because I was rude, but I was rude to an idiot,” said Mourinho. “For some reason I was rude.

On that occasion Isaac Hayden’s dismissal left Bruce’s team a man short this time, an injury to Fabian Schär shortly after half‑time, and with all three home substitutes already used, virtually rubber‑stamped Rodgers’s latest victory.It needs stressing that, well before fortune started frowning on Newcastle, James Maddison’s excellence had already indicated Leicester would cement their grip on second place. Maddison was outstanding in midfield, at times making even the 10-point chasm between his side and Liverpool seem surmountable.“We played very well,” Rodgers said. “We want to finish as high as possible. The potential excites me.”By way of exacerbating Geordie gloom, his goal originated with Florian Lejeune’s horribly underhit pass being intercepted by the Spaniard. All that remained was for Pérez to cleverly dodge Schär’s lunging attentions and direct a right‑foot shot into the far corner.Poor Lejeune had little chance to compose himself before making another awful mistake. This time his appalling clearance was intercepted by Ricardo Pereira, prefacing Maddison’s goal. After shifting the ball on to his left foot, Maddison unleashed a drive which, in whizzing inexorably into the top corner, simultaneously sent defiant messages to Liverpool and Manchester City and destroyed any remnants of new year optimism still lurking on the Gallowgate End.Bruce’s scope for tactical adjustment was negated by the late first-half hamstring and groin injuries to Jetro Willems, Javier Manquillo and Jonjo Shelvey which necessitated their swift replacement by DeAndre Yedlin, Emil Krafth and Sean Longstaff.With all three substitutes on and the second half barely under way Schär then pulled up with another hamstring pull, promptly hobbling off.Deja vu descended. Once again Newcastle were down to 10 men and struggling badly against a Leicester side who, by way of variation, slowed the pace to exhibition level before the substitute Hamza Choudhury scored his first senior goal.Choudhury’s dangerous tackle during Leicester’s League Cup win here in August left Newcastle’s much missed Matt Ritchie requiring two ankle operations and his every touch was duly booed.Not that the vitriol raining down from the stands prevented Choudhury meeting Wilfred Ndidi’s pass and unleashing a rising shot which consigned Bruce’s side to a third successive defeat.“I’ve never known four players injured within 15 minutes,” the Newcastle manager said. “It’s bizarre. To play so many games over Christmas is ridiculous and this is the consequence. But Leicester are very good.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d02a0917ba3c4cc7a32f52cb0a570866ba4780c4/2_152_3460_2076/master/3460.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0b70568f2f310625e7460887eb31db2","title":"manchester city everton premier league match report","story":"Manchester City end the festive period with nine points from their four games after two Gabriel Jesus strikes handed Carlo Ancelotti a first defeat in charge of Everton via a characteristically relentless display.Pep Guardiola said: “We played top, I am so delighted about the performance. Teams who have been champions and are far away from the leaders can give up and finish seventh or eighth. Maybe we will but not because we don’t try.”City’s sole reverse of the Christmas programme came last Friday at Wolves in a result that, surely, killed any hopes of catching Liverpool. Instead, their FA Cup defence begins on Saturday, with the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg against Manchester United on Tuesday, then in February the restart of the Champions League all competitions on which City can now focus intently.The notable name in the home lineup was Claudio Bravo, the hardly reliable goalkeeper playing a second successive time because of Ederson being ill following a one-match suspension. The last time Bravo faced Everton – in January 2017 – he allowed four goals from four shots and he added to the count here by being culpable for Richarlison’s consolation.Ancelotti initially made the same number of changes as his opposite number before Bernard suffered a cut leg in the warm-up, so Tom Davies was drafted in for the Brazilian.The opening period proved low grade. An error from Ilkay Gündogan had Guardiola muttering and Davies pouncing as Everton transformed defence into an attack that ended with Gylfi Sigurdsson flipping the ball to Séamus Coleman: his effort was tipped behind for a corner by Bravo.When Gündogan later tried his own chip into Riyad Mahrez, Jordan Pickford was less sure: he dropped the ball and Everton were relieved to clear.João Cancelo has struggled for form since joining City yet he appeared to have created an opener for Phil Foden only for VAR to rule Mahrez offside. Ancelotti had a consoling word for Guardiola who smiled and later agreed with the decision. “I think it was offside,” said the Catalan.VAR’s next involvement was confused as it checked for a possible penalty despite Mahrez seeming to be flagged for offside or handball or both. The spot-kick was not given but the contest had been disrupted and, inevitably, the invective-filled anti‑VAR chants had a second airing.At this juncture both benches were unhappy regarding their respective players’ output. For Guardiola it was Kevin De Bruyne and Foden momentarily losing their deft touch for Ancelotti it was his men’s sluggish pace and an insistence on passing back to Pickford, instead of looking forward and for the positive.Better from City was a Mahrez swivel and shot, then a Gündogan effort which also warmed Pickford’s fingers. Really, though, the entertainment level was down, in a sign perhaps of the Christmas and New Year slog. Another was found in the number of offsides committed by tired players – Mahrez a particular perpetrator.Still, City had dominated the ball and when they do they often prosper. Foden had a snap-shot, gathered by Pickford, and as the break neared Mahrez had two clearer chances but steered the first wide and seemed surprised to receive the second.The average fare continued after the interval. Benjamin Mendy sold De Bruyne short so he had to stick a boot out and watch the ball sail into no-man’s land, much to Guardiola’s chagrin. Next Bravo punted possession straight out when Cancelo was the target.Then, though, came a moment to remember. Gündogan slipped a pinpoint pass into Jesus, who in an instant had beaten Pickford with a finish that was the Brazilian’s 13th goal this season.From the restart Everton claimed a corner – to Guardiola’s annoyance – but despite a second one following when Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s header deflected out there was no equaliser.The contest had opened up. Suddenly Eric García was curving a ball along the left to Mahrez as City upped pace and so opportunity. Soon they had a second goal, with this one straight from the Guardiola playbook. De Bruyne passed to Foden, who found Mahrez, who in turn played in Jesus and he calmly finished low past Pickford.City were coasting but then Bravo added to the catalogue of howlers by passing direct to Richarlison. From here there was an inevitability about how the No 7 would bundle home Theo Walcott’s deflected attempt.At the close Calvert-Lewin upended Fernandinho. The managers disagreed as to whether the booking the foul received was sufficient punishment but it did not affect the outcome."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d83f0db7d64635a4f4267836d7205f56239a63f/0_59_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=016d912928c458e177e51dfd32fd31df","title":"west ham bournemouth premier league match report","story":"As second comings go, David Moyes could not have scripted his any better. Two goals from the captain Mark Noble and one each from Sébastien Haller and Felipe Anderson ended West Ham’s run of four successive defeats at home and took them out of the relegation zone at the expense of a disjointed Bournemouth side.Out of work since he was jettisoned by West Ham’s owners in favour of Manuel Pellegrini in May 2018, how Moyes must have relished the “olés” which rang around the stadium in the closing stages as his side cantered to victory. Only a few days into his second spell as manager he has already shown what a difference a new face can make – something that even Bournemouth’s owners may even have to consider at some point given the lack of fight in Eddie Howe’s side here.“I don’t think I could have had a better start but the players have to take all the credit,” Moyes said. “Their attitude and commitment got the supporters behind us and that was key for us today.”The former Manchester United and Everton manager had spoken of the need to restore confidence among his players after the disastrous run that cost Manuel Pellegrini his job, yet after Aston Villa’s victory at Burnley, West Ham found themselves in the relegation zone before kick-off – almost exactly the same position as when Moyes took over from Slaven Bilic in November 2017.Last time it took Moyes until his fourth match to record his first victory but with less than half of this campaign remaining, he knew there was no time to waste. Bournemouth looked like perfect opponents to kickstart the home side’s campaign given Howe’s visitors had lost seven of their previous nine matches before this. Howe also made four changes to the side which lost at Brighton on Saturday with Callum Wilson leading the line despite enduring a run of 12 matches without a league goal.Moyes, who admitted this week that he had not been able to stop smiling since his reappointment, emerged just before kick-off to a decent reception from the home supporters and spent almost the entire first half prowling the technical area, clearly enjoying being back in his natural habitat.After a slow start, the 56-year-old’s enthusiasm was rewarded in the 17th minute when Robert Snodgrass’s cut back found Noble in acres of space and the captain’s shot from distance took a massive deflection off Lewis Cook to totally wrongfoot Aaron Ramsdale in the Bournemouth goal.Taking the lead – albeit through a huge slice of good fortune – seemed to immediately lighten the mood among the home supporters and it was not long until they were celebrating again. Haller, without a goal at the London Stadium since the defeat to Crystal Palace in October, has looked an increasingly dejected figure in recent weeks but the way he volleyed home a cross from Ryan Fredericks illustrated just why West Ham were prepared to pay £45m to sign him last summer.Noble’s second soon after from the penalty spot when Harry Wilson was somewhat harshly adjudged to have brought down the veteran midfielder almost lifted the roof off this vast arena. Having failed to score more than one first-half goal so far this season, suddenly West Ham had three.Bournemouth’s woes can be traced back to Wilson’s last league goal in the 3-1 victory over Southampton at the end of September. Howe’s side briefly found themselves in third place back then but, like Haller at West Ham, the lack of goals for their main striker has coincided with their plunge down the table. They have not looked so vulnerable since the 2017-18 season, when they were in the bottom three at Christmas before a seven-game unbeaten run catapulted them up the table. On this evidence that kind of form looks beyond them but Howe will at least be encouraged by a better performance after the break after they switched to a back three.Asked if his players are suffering from a lack of confidence, he said: “I don’t think it takes a rocket scientist to see it’s damaged. It’s the first time we’ve been in the relegation zone for a long time but I almost think that is a good thing for us because it’s going to refocus energies. We need to change something.”Felipe Anderson rounded off a fine inidual performance with the fourth goal following a wonderful cross field pass from Declan Rice with his left foot. Further evidence that this was West Ham’s day came when Aaron Cresswell was shown a red card for a dangerous tackle on Ryan Fraser, only for VAR to overturn referee Graham Scott’s original decision. Moyes will just hope that his good fortune can last a little longer this time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e2bd575a66e4295fbb59127f8aaed10880b5ce4/34_0_2779_1667/master/2779.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a56f8b80b8e183281e833e5847a3ef3","title":"beginners guide to saving","story":"We all know squirrelling away some money is sensible – but that doesn’t necessarily make it appealing. Here’s how to get in the habitMuch like going for a run or eating your greens, saving your cash offers long-term benefits, but is not always appealing. And, let’s face it, there are always good reasons not to lock your money away – confusion over different accounts, fear of making the wrong choice, or feeling as though you don’t have enough money to make it worthwhile can all outweigh the best intentions. But, as the NHS’s Couch to 5K programme taught us about exercise, things are a lot less overwhelming if you start small and build up.Don’t worry if you have been putting it off for years – you can’t be too old to start saving. Whatever your age, you need to decide that saving is something you want, or need, to do, says Iona Bain, the founder of the blog Young Money. After all, she points out, “saving is only possible with motivation”.If you are struggling to feel driven, she has advice: “Saving gives you choices in the future. Once you start understanding that it’s still your money, just put somewhere safe in case you need it, you start finding that motivation that will make saving much easier.”Don’t start a savings account if you have expensive debt to pay off – you will be better off clearing an overdraft or credit card, as they charge higher interest rates than you can earn. But once these debts are cleared, you can start to think about building a nest egg.One option is to set up a monthly standing order to pay into a savings account just after you have been paid. The logic here is that if you cannot see the money in your current account you will not spend it. This is a good choice if you know how much you can afford to save each month.If you don’t, you can squirrel away money throughout the month using a round-up feature. Offered by the new online banks, including Revolut, Starling and Monzo, as well as Lloyds TSB and Halifax, these let you round up any spending to the nearest £1 and put the difference into a savings pot. So, if you spend £1.45, you will be debited £2, of which 55p will be squirrelled away.Alternatively, you could wait until the end of the month and sweep what is left in your current account into your savings. You can do this with any bank, but First Direct’s 1st account can be set up to do this automatically.As with Couch to 5K, it can be helpful to have a goal. Small, short-term targets are good at first, because they are achievable and will get you into good habits. It might be tickets for a show or an activity you have wanted to see for a long time, a new pair of jeans or a night away. Whatever it is, work out how much you need and when you need it.Once you have achieved your aim, do not close your account. You are in the habit now, so keep going.Bain says not to worry too much about savings rates at this point, but if you want an extra incentive, a website such as Savings Champion will show you the best-paying accounts. If you want to be able to withdraw your money in the next year, take a look at easy-access accounts.If you are saving for a property, think about using a Lifetime Isa. If you want to save for the long term, start exploring pensions and other investments. Some of these have minimum payment levels as low as £1, although small investments may disappear in fees, so you will need more to make it worthwhile – £25 a month is more typical and meaningful.“If you are investing over a short time period, certainly fewer than five years, then you should stick with cash, even though interest rates are currently at very low levels,” says Patrick Connolly, a chartered financial planner at the advice firm Chase de Vere. “This is because, if you invest in the stock market and it falls in value, you will have very little time to claw back any losses.”A good starting place if you have a small sum and do not want to take much risk is a fund that tracks the UK stock market. The Money Advice Service, an independent body set up by the government, has a useful guide on how to buy investments, with links to sites where you can research potential purchases."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06dabb5757bd783ae8707a3ee95005f4fd73fe9b/0_485_1949_1169/master/1949.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bcb88fd783453407e204a2a73dfbd1c","title":"how to have more fun in 2020","story":"This is the year to start taking happiness seriously. But how – and where do you find the time? Here are the tips and advice you need for a pleasure-filled yearThe last time I felt joy was at an event that would be many people’s vision of hell: a drunken Taylor Swift club-night singalong in the early hours of the morning a few weekends ago.I certainly experience joy, either as peaks of euphoria or in quiet, unexpected bursts. But as I go about my everyday business – sprinting to meet deadlines, standing in front of the open fridge – I wouldn’t say it looms large.I am not alone. Many of us treat joy like the good china, only warranted on special occasions. Even if we know it is within our reach, we may not see it is within our control.But this is a mistake, according to happiness experts. Nataly Kogan, the author of Happier Now, says: “Happiness and emotional health are not extras, or bonuses, or nice-to-haves – they’re actually at the core of what helps us live well.”Seeking joy may sound frivolous, but being happy has been shown to promote habits and behaviours that are important to our health. A 2017 study of roughly 7,000 adults found that those with positive wellbeing were more likely to be physically active and to eat fresh fruit and vegetables. Being happy has also been linked to better sleep, better weight management, lower stress levels, an improved immune system and even increased life expectancy.Despite the myriad benefits of joy – and the obvious incentive that it feels good – many of us don’t prioritise it. But experts point out that our resources and energy are finite what we put off will fall by the wayside. So, as with any goal, the first step to a joyful life is to make it a priority – which may mean you need to let go of other commitments – and then do the work. In other words, we need to start taking joy seriously.As the founder and chief executive of the wellbeing business Happier, Kogan helps companies to improve their workplace culture and professionals to foster joy in their lives – lessons born out of her experience of career burnout and personal dissatisfaction in her late 30s. She likens herself at the time to a ship on the ocean – fine in favourable conditions, but at the mercy of any storm.Now 44 and based with her family in Boston, Massachusetts, Kogan says she has landed on practices and tools to harness happiness as a steady, sustainable presence in her daily life. The first of these is not to think of happiness as something to pursue at a later date, when your life is in order. “I lived with this idea of: ‘I’ll be happy when ...’ as I know so many people do,” she says. “We have to look at emotional health as a skill, not a destination. And, as with any skill, when you practise, you do better.”So, what can we do to make 2020 a more joyful year?Start by identifying where joy is most lacking. Sarah Waite, a London-based psychologist, suggests the “wheel of life”, a personal development exercise derived from the Buddhist theory of balance. Draw a large circle, ide it into eight or 10 segments and label each to reflect a different area of life that you want to assess.There are templates online, typically along the lines of fun and recreation, physical environment, career, finances, personal growth, romance, family and friends, and health. Shade in each wedge to reflect your level of satisfaction.The finished circle should be an overview of the areas of your life that you feel you have under control, and those that may need further attention. When it comes to deciding where to allocate resources, “it’s not necessarily the one you’ve marked the lowest it’s the one you really value the most,” says Waite. It may be that your job is not a priority for you, so it doesn’t matter if it remains only two-thirds filled.The goal is to get perspective and clarity. The brain has evolved to be much more sensitive to negatives than positives as, historically, it has been more important for us to be attuned to hazardous situations than satisfactory ones. This “negativity bias” distorts our perspective, meaning it is hard to make a good decision under stress, says Kogan. “People can focus on things that are not ‘as they should be’ … We all have our stories of why we are not happy, at work or otherwise.” But small, practical steps taken to boost joy in one part of life can improve happiness across the board as momentum builds.Kogan’s first tip is to start by writing a list of what you like about your job, no matter how small. “Be specific, think broadly and don’t judge your list as you write it.” It doesn’t matter what they are, or how many there are the idea is to shift your mindset.Kogan suggests making it a daily habit to note three small, highly specific things that you are grateful for every morning, perhaps before you reach for your phone. “It’s not about pretending that nothing is wrong, it’s about helping your brain to get out of that negativity spiral.”Just three weeks of this consistent “gratitude practice” has been shown to establish new neuron connections facilitating optimism, with the effects lasting for six months. Mindfulness and self-compassion are similarly powerful, says Shamash Alidina, the author of Mindfulness for Dummies and the co-founder of the not-for-profit Museum of Happiness – and more attainable than people may think.Many equate mindfulness with clearing one’s mind of thoughts entirely. This means they often give up out of frustration, says Alidina – but “it’s not about not thinking, it’s about being aware”. Spending just a few minutes noticing your thoughts pass you by like clouds, experimenting with what Alidina calls your “flexibility of attention”, can equip you to stop negative spirals before they start. “People associate meditation with being calm or relaxed, but it’s really just about not getting lost in your thoughts,” he says.Finding lasting happiness is also about what we do, particularly what we do for others. Kogan says it is important to have a sense of purpose – to find what she calls “the bigger why” among our deadlines and meetings. “It’s not possible to be a happy human being if you don’t feel like what you’re doing is meaningful,” she says.Assessing your to-do list – particularly tasks you find mundane or frustrating – through the lens of “Who does this help?” can increase motivation, lift your mood and improve your ability to manage stress, she says. “When you say: ‘This project is going to help a lot of people’ – my team, customers, readers, whatever – your stress has context and you feel more resilient getting through it.”Helping others may seem like a circular way of boosting your happiness, but Kogan says even small gestures, such as pulling out a chair for a colleague or checking in with them about their day, releases oxytocin in the giver and the receiver. Over time, it also fosters a sense of belonging at work and can lead to office friendships – one of the most common factors in job satisfaction.The mindset shift encouraged by practising “intentional kindness” means it is worth doing for your own happiness, says Kogan. At 3pm every day, she receives a reminder to “be kind”. Sometimes that is as simple as texting someone she hasn’t spoken to in a while and telling them that she’s thinking of them: “I cannot tell you how much that means to people.”It is well known that strong relationships are important to happiness, but what those look like – and how to forge them – can be ambiguous. “Happiness can feel very abstract,” says Gretchen Rubin, the author of The Happiness Project. “My approach is to think about what you want, then break it up into manageable, concrete actions that you can actually take.”In terms of improving relationships, that might look like making a regular time to call or meet a friend, committing to attend a reunion or throw a party, or having a daily exchange with someone in public. Every five days or so, Rubin’s family email each other an update on the “boring everyday stuff” of their lives, freed from any pressure to entertain or an expectation to reply. “We realised that, by staying in touch with the little minutiae, we would feel more connected – and it’s absolutely working.”Making warm greetings and goodbyes habitual at home is another small but effective shift (“I always think that I don’t want to be less enthusiastic than my dog,” says Rubin). Such low-level commitments are less daunting to start and easier to keep up – and they make a real impact. We all have different definitions of happiness, Rubin says, whether it be joy, peace, satisfaction, bliss. “My way of thinking about it is: today, next month, next year – are there things you can do to be happier?” she says. “And if there are, why not do them?”If Rubin comes across an improvement at home that she can make in less than a minute, she does it immediately. For her, “outer order contributes to inner calm”, so happiness can be as simple as a clean kitchen bench or a decluttered shelf. “It feels trivial – and yet over and over people say: ‘When I have control of my environment, I feel like I have control generally,’” says Rubin. “Like making your bed every morning – it gives people a lift, more than really makes sense.”Often this is understood as minimalism – but there are many happy, successful people who take pleasure in being surrounded by their possessions, says Rubin. It is not a moral failing to prefer abundance, and making your personal space reflect your values and interests “can be very pleasing”.Ingrid Fetell Lee, the author of The Aesthetics of Joy, agrees. “We’ve been taught to think about our homes through the lens of other people: what’s trendy, what the design books say,” she says. As a result, many of us are out of touch with how our spaces measure on our own “joy meters”. We may view a neutral grey palette as the height of sophistication when, in fact, what brings us pleasure is a neon front door.Even the presence of different shapes can have an impact, with people finding angular objects more subconsciously anxiety-inducing than round ones. Rounded objects also tend to make environments more playful, says Lee: “Not only because your mind is unconsciously set at ease, but because you’re less worried about bumping into sharp edges.”Play is an effective mood-booster that is often neglected in adulthood. Rubin says she marks holidays such as Halloween and St Patrick’s Day with themed meals, just because, while the Museum of Happiness’s pop-up installations in London and Manchester later this month are testament to the transformative effects of a ballpit on otherwise sober adults.To bring some of that spirit into your home, Lee advises trying to imagine you are visiting for the first time: “Notice how it makes you feel, almost the physiological sensation in your body, as you move from room to room. What are the things that, when your eyes land on them, make you smile or feel drained?”The key is not to feel burdened by your possessions. “Owning less means you are surrounding yourself with only your favourite things,” says Joshua Becker, who writes the blog Becoming Minimalist. Being intentional with the things that we own – and, by extension, our money – means that our lives align with our values and passions: things that really matter to us. “Minimalism removes distractions so that we can free up our money, time and energy on those things that bring us real joy in life,” says Becker.Play, gratitude and kindness may factor into a life full of joy, but so can discipline. A sense of control is more important to happiness than many people realise, says Rubin. Prosaically enough, this is inextricable from exercise, sleep and good money management. Too often, happiness is located solely in the moment, she says, when it could be achieved through giving up sugar or alcohol, or setting an alarm to go to bed on time. “Sometimes, to be happier in the long run, we have to ask more of ourselves or deprive ourselves of something,” says Rubin. “A happy life is not one that’s focused only on the present.”In the same vein, putting off a difficult or boring task can detract from your daily experience more than getting stuck into it. Waite says she rolls her eyes at the framing of self-care as “baths and candles”: “I love those things, but if doing your tax return is really making you anxious, maybe the kindest thing you can do for yourself is to make a start.” It may not be what is typically understood by joy, but sustainable, long-lasting happiness involves recognising that there are many shades on the emotional palette.Research shows that occasionally accepting the presence of harder emotions means you experience them less intensely and for less time. In fact, the first step towards a joyful life may be letting go of your ideas of what that looks like – and recognising that it is down to you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/253a53ff66775895f9923f559f90660161e8103b/69_0_2778_1667/master/2778.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b30d3945f29c9e2c827e504128b7d21f","title":"surprising psychology behind being perpetually late","story":"There are as many reasons for unpunctuality as there are habitually tardy people – and the underlying reasons can be complexSometimes, one of my psychotherapy clients will be late. “The tube got stuck I do apologise.” If it happens once, I don’t treat it as significant. But some clients are perpetually late – perhaps just five or 10 minutes, but always – and out of breath when they get to the door. Then I am curious about what is behind their pattern of lateness, what it means and what purpose it serves.There are probably as many reasons for unpunctuality as there are habitually late people. Sometimes it seems unfathomable, but not always. One client remembered that his mother always spent so long in the bathroom that she made him late for school. She told him that it didn’t matter, and early people are uptight anyway. In his unconscious, being on time for things had got mixed up with being disloyal to his mother and therefore bad. Once he had found this narrative, he lost his compulsion for lateness.Punctual people may believe that late people are passive-aggressive and that their time is more valuable than those who wait for them. But reasons for lateness are generally more complex. The reason may be the opposite of arrogance. It could be that they don’t value themselves enough. If this is the case, might they be unable to see how others could possibly mind their non-appearance?This explanation may work for social situations, but why miss planes, boats and trains? Perhaps it is an unconscious testing of the theory: “If I were a worthy person, the train would wait for me.” Since it doesn’t, the feeling of not mattering is reinforced.One client I had kept thwarting her own attempts to succeed in her career, and bad time-keeping was part of this. When we unpicked what success would mean to her, she uncovered an old family belief that people with money were evil, bad people. Faced with a choice of not progressing or being evil, it was no wonder she kept up with the self-sabotage programme.Late people often have a sunny outlook. They are unreasonably optimistic about how many things they can cram in and how long it takes to get from the office to the restaurant, say, especially if it is nearby. My book editor and I often have lunch in a cafe next door to her office and she is always seven minutes late, because she leaves at 1pm. I think she believes she possesses a teleporter, yet, by the time she has chatted to a colleague in the lobby and waited for the lift, she is seven minutes late. I am considering getting there seven minutes late myself, except, as an early person with my own set of neuroses, that would make me ill with anxiety.Lateness can also be caused when we have a reluctance to change gear – to end one activity and start another. We don’t like getting up, we put off going to bed. Stopping something we are absorbed in to do something else can be annoying. It takes willpower to carry out. But if we don’t change gear in time when someone is waiting for us, we are in danger of being judged as selfish.Some late people choose to accept that they are terrible timekeepers and that they can’t do anything about it. Yet punctual people think they know that late people could decide to be on time and follow through.It is only when the latecomers make the decision to be punctual that they change. It must be a conscious decision if they merely make a woolly attempt to “try” to be on time, they won’t be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4d3a5e732aa8f5834eff51015163c214db33e49/0_0_8688_5213/master/8688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cabf86cb73b7a85c25fda5736a2aa936","title":"great expectations the quest for perfection has cannibalised my identity","story":"Perfectionism is associated with a long list of psychological disorders, the problem is notoriously hard to treat and it’s on the rise“You need to practice self-compassion,” my psychologist says to me. This is our sixth session and as per usual he is struggling to find a phrase, a point – anything – that will help me move past the need to seek perfection in every part of my life.“Yes, but how?” I ask, again. We talk about the usual techniques: not beating yourself up when you think you’ve failed not automatically falling into a vortex of self-loathing at minor rejections.“This experience does not reflect on you as a person,” he repeats, explaining that what I perceive as abject failure is a mere blip on the horizon, a simple fact of life.I listen hard, I really do. I understand everything he says on an intellectual level and I want to stop this ever-present stream of self-criticism before it gets too late.The problem is the quest for perfection has cannibalised my identity.Perfectionism is a personality trait but psychologists classify it as a risk factor for a host of disorders, including (but not limited to) obsessive compulsive disorder, eating disorders, social anxiety, social phobia, body dysmorphic disorder and workaholism.It also confounds treatment. Dr Simon Sherry, a Canadian neuroscience professor and clinical psychologist, tells me perfectionists make for very difficult patients. “It can sabotage treatment at every level.”Perfectionists are often undone at the first stage of therapy, says Sherry. They are reluctant to seek treatment, because to do so would be to admit they have failed. And if they do manage to get themselves in front of a therapist, they tend to have unrealistically high expectations of treatment, making them more prone to giving up before therapy has time to take effect.“They also struggle to play nicely, have intense conflictual relationships with other people and struggle to connect with others,” Sherry explains. “All this can interfere with helping establish the complicated alliance that needs to be built between client and therapist.”Tracey Wade is a professor of psychology at Flinders University in Adelaide and a leader in the study of perfectionism. When I call her up to talk she is preparing a training session on how psychologists and therapists can best treat perfectionism.“What usually interferes with perfectionists getting better is that they tend to block therapy,” she tells me. “Clients believe that their therapist is judging them and that they’re not working hard enough in therapy.”According to psychologists Paul Hewitt and Gordon Flett, there are three types of perfectionists: the “self-oriented” type who keep strict standards for themselves and are motivated by avoiding failure at all costs the “other-oriented” type who set perfectionist expectations for others and the “socially prescribed” form who believe that others expect them to be perfect.While people can suffer from a mixture of all three, each type is enough to cause a high level of anxiety on its own.I’ve lost count of how many psychologists I’ve seen over my lifetime. All I know is that it’s roughly an equal number of men and women, aged between 35 and 60.They have ranged from formal and less formal their treatment approaches have varied from cognitive behavioural therapy to experimental exercises designed to reprogram my brain to work for me, rather than against me.Some have given me books others have told me to stop reading into it.“What can I say that will make you feel better?” my current psychologist asked me at our last session. I’d been crying again and he was running out of ideas of how to help me. “You’re supposed to come out of these sessions feeling better, not worse.”“I’m waiting for you to say that one phrase that will make it all click for me,” I replied.“There is no one thing that will help – you have to start small.”I left feeling more frustrated than ever before. In the past, I’d been able to change some of my more destructive habits after having one conversation, so I don’t understand why therapy is not playing along.While perfectionism has always existed, never before have we seen it manifest itself so strongly in one generation. After conducting one of the largest-ever studies on perfectionism, Sherry and his colleague Dr Martin Smith found that perfectionism has increased substantially over the past 25 years, and that it affects men and women equally.“In this new society young people are evaluated in a host of new ways – almost every aspect of their lives is turned into metrics, and they are rated, ranked and tested on every single thing they do, down to how they look.”Perfectionism is also partly genetic, and it is also strongly influenced by the environment a child grows up in.Sherry says that over time children internalise the conditions put on them by perfectionist parents and then take them into their own relationships.“We need to encourage parents to love their children unconditionally,” he tells me. “We don’t want parents to react catastrophically to minor mistakes that their children make and see minor mistakes as massive problems.”According to Sherry, loving your children in proportion to their achievements (such as only rewarding them when they get high marks) “over time leads to them internalising these conditions, and then crashing in terms of their self-esteem and mood when they don’t get a promotion, or a sought-after achievement”.This is not just a low mood: people who are perfectionists are at higher risk of suicide, and are more likely to drop out, self-criticise and suffer from a lack of self-compassion.So is there hope?Over time I’ve come to realise that the biggest obstacle to my own treatment is the belief that perfectionism fuels my ambition. I didn’t take the problem seriously.For years, I wore my perfectionism like a badge of honour. “I strive for perfection,” I told myself, “which means my standards are extremely high and will result in higher-quality work.”While I did achieve high results, I’m starting to realise this may be in spite of and not because of my perfectionistic tendencies.Wade says fear is a strong motivator for perfectionists, and “people are afraid to let it go because of their belief it achieves things for them”.So how do you convince a perfectionist that what they consider to be a “high standard” and “being productive” is actually unattainable?“Most studies and clinical observations show that perfectionism is the opposite of productivity,” Sherry says. “Perfectionists tend to have more episodes of depression, be more absent and are prone to negative emotions such as guilt and anxiety.“Over time, perfectionists may start to unravel – they become less conscientious, organised, disciplined, reliable and goal-focused, and more neurotic and emotionally unstable.”I ask all the experts if there is a way to change the belief that perfectionism is fundamental to success. To truly change it – not just intellectually – but deep within your heart. For Wade, it’s all about changing your mindset from “must” to “it would be nice”.“Research shows that when you start to change your thinking from ‘should’ to ‘it would be nice, but it’s not the end of the world’, it becomes more about excellence rather than perfectionism.”For Hill, it’s about “deriving value in yourself by what you add to others”, and perhaps he’s right. Perhaps shifting the outlook from bettering ourselves to helping others is the ultimate antidote to a society where inidualism – and the insatiable need to be the best – has caused far more harm that we ever anticipated.So as we continue to navigate a system that sets us up for failure – all the while demanding success at every turn – it’s worth asking ourselves: how far are we willing to go to present as the perfect human? And in the end, is it worth it?As someone in the midst of it, I can honestly say no."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d81d2772bf09f0310ec758b57402de8257b2bf75/262_853_4659_2795/master/4659.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6d78a4c2f1c46405d725a34d535503a","title":"new year celebrations around the world in pictures","story":"Revellers have bid farewell to a decade that will be remembered for, among other things, the rise of social media, the Arab spring, the MeToo movement and Donald Trump"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c232e461abd4d0bde8e55dda6bf3b82a7e9ddde5/35_0_2778_1667/master/2778.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9617b9add8df07379b5842575d438a5","title":"can you learn to love the job you have","story":"We can’t all follow our passion. But taking a few simple steps can make a huge difference to your happiness – and your performance in the officeWhat would it take to make our working lives better? Steve Jobs once said about work that it was our life’s mission to “do what you love”, but for most of us it is the compromise of “finding what you can put up with”. So, if most of us are never exactly going to love work, what can we do to make it a little less awful?For starters, let’s be honest about what work is like. According to the magazine Management Today, the average Briton spends 16 hours a week in meetings, hostage to the drone of people they vaguely recognise. This is why most of us have learned that to survive in the modern workplace we need to master the “I’m not listening, but want you to think I am” nod, along with the subtle art of checking WhatsApp under a notebook.But there are simple steps we can take to start rebalancing this relationship with our workplace. Researchers have found that even the most miserable job can be redeemed by taking back a little control.When workplace experts study what makes a good day at work, the answers are common sense. We say we have had a satisfying time when we have “made progress in something meaningful”. For many of us, stranded in a vast, open-plan savannah, playing email Tetris, the idea of progress feels unobtainable.This may be because one of the biggest challenges for human brains is switching between activities. Various attempts to measure our attention have suggested that, when we switch tasks, it takes between eight and 20 minutes for our attention to focus fully again.This is where the author Dan Pink has a valuable tip. Pink’s approach is to do one action, his MIT (most important thing), before he does anything else. This way, if the MIT takes up to an hour of concentration, he has made progress on something before the email onslaught begins.Yes, this might be embarrassing to suggest – but if anyone laughs, point out that researchers say going for a walking meeting can be one of the easiest ways to revive your mojo.Interestingly, walking needs to be used appropriately: it is a powerful way to liberate ideas, but it is not the most effective way to resolve complex logical puzzles. The researchers also found that the power of walking lingered after the walk. Taking a stroll before undertaking a creative task fostered a significant uplift compared with staying seated. Other research, from a paper published in 2012, said that going for a 50-minute walk in nature can have a strong effect on our ability to concentrate.Are your colleagues still sniggering? Just ignore them – safe in the knowledge that JK Rowling said night-time walks are the surest way to overcome writer’s block.British workers are well versed in eating al desko, but taking a step away from our workstations for a proper recovery more than pays its way – and not just at work. Psychologists from Baylor University in Texas found a relationship between people skipping lunch breaks and feeling exhausted at the weekend.Despite this, many of us feel a silent pressure to work through lunch. But there is good evidence that stepping away from our desks improves our work, too. Our attention is measurably worse later in the day – a 2006 study of workers at a medical centre in North Carolina found that the likelihood of a medical error occurring was four times higher at 4pm than at 9am. Our afternoon selves, rendered dopey with tiredness, simply are not as effective – and taking a break is one of the best ways to get back some of our zing. Research at Harvard University found that giving schoolchildren five-minute breaks every hour improved their results over the course of a day, whereas a lack of breaks saw their results spiral downwards (with the biggest declines among the least able pupils).If you need more persuading, think about this: skipping an hour’s lunch over the course of a year is the equivalent of five weeks’ holiday. So, make plans to meet a friend or to go to the gym – it could improve your whole week.Researchers at Harvard found that workers were crushed by the daily burden of emails and the need to be contactable at all hours. The worst afflicted were management consultants, who often checked emails if they awoke to go to the loo in the night. Modest changes, such as taking one evening a week off email, were suggested. The management consultants couldn’t quite bear this, so they devised a scheme where one person was always checking night-time emails, while the rest of their colleagues had the evening off. The participants were euphoric. The mere thought of having a night off email duty seemed to have a measurable impact on their stress levels.Bruce Daisley is the European vice-president of Twitter.

Its performance and those of Northern and West Midlands Trains have prompted city mayors to demand immediate improvement.Bruce Williamson, of the pressure group Railfuture, said: “Welcome to another decade of misery for rail passengers. How on earth is the government going to meet its climate commitments by pricing people off environmentally friendly trains and on to our polluted and congested roads?”The government said it was trialling new fares to reflect modern working and travelling patterns as part of a “year of action” towards improving the railways.Commuters on some Govia Thameslink Railway routes will be able to buy tickets providing better value for part-time and flexible workers. On some LNER routes, much cheaper off-peak single-leg tickets will be available. Currently most long-distance singles cost virtually the same price as a return fare.The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said the government would reform rail to “ensure the focus is always on putting passengers first”. He added: “Delivering such significant change will take time, but passengers can have total confidence that these trials will help provide the evidence needed to develop wider reforms to the fares system and a significantly better service.”A full review of how the rail system operates was commissioned by Chris Grayling as transport secretary in the wake of timetable chaos in 2018, and its findings are due to be published shortly. The former British Airways boss Keith Williams, who is chairing the review, has said fares will be one key area for reform.Labour pointed out that rail fares were being cut in Germany while they increased in the UK. The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said: “It shows that this government is not serious about supporting either public transport or tackling climate change, road congestion or air quality.”The TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said: “Working people have had enough of overcrowded and unreliable services. The number one priority should be running a world-class railway service, not subsidising shareholders.”The RMT union said rolling stock companies, which lease trains to operators, had paid £2.4bn to shareholders in the last 10 years.The Rail Delivery Group, which speaks for the industry, said there was continued investment with more than 1,000 new carriages and more than 1,000 additional services coming in across the UK in 2020.However, politicians across Britain are losing patience. The mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street, has given Abellio-run West Midlands Trains an ultimatum to sort out its “simply woeful service” by the end of January or he will formally request that the government ends its franchise.Meanwhile, the mayors of Greater Manchester and Liverpool, Andy Burnham and Steve Rotheram, have repeatedly urged the government to strip Arriva of the Northern rail franchise and said TransPennine Express should be next, after weeks of delays and cancellations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcefa048633e1577923539796b6756644b8309da/0_559_849_509/master/849.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9d1aa50b397f2912aaf3ed86ca1bad5","title":"sugar sweet rave united belfast david holmes iain mccready","story":"Thirty years ago, David Holmes and Iain McCready’s event brought together communities who hated each other but needed to vent their fear: ‘Religion wasn’t a barrier any more’‘Doing music as a career didn’t even register as something that was possible,” recalls DJ, producer and composer David Holmes. “Growing up in the Troubles, you just never felt things like that happened to people like you.”Thirty years ago, Holmes was working as a hairdresser in a Belfast salon with fellow music obsessive Iain McCready. Holmes had been booking bands since the age of 15 and McCready was running underground hip-hop nights in the city. “We’re both blessed with a personality of not waiting around for things to happen,” says Holmes. “So we put on our own nights.” On 23 December 1989, the pair launched Sugar Sweet – initially called Base and then briefly The Face – a night that brought acid house and rave culture to Belfast with a mighty thump. Earlier this month, the pair threw a one-off 30th anniversary party to celebrate.Throwing such parties wasn’t straightforward, given the Troubles were still ongoing. Holmes was born in 1969, the same year British troops were first deployed in Northern Ireland (in an operation that lasted until 2007). “We were a Catholic family living in a majority Protestant neighbourhood so we were open targets,” he recalls. “My house was pipe-bombed when I was four. I was in the bath. The Troubles was just a fucking lottery of death – people dying because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time.”The combination of political tension, exhilarating new music, euphoric new drugs and a brand new place to experience them was a potent concoction. “Everything was so fresh and raw,” says Holmes. “All week you’re getting searched, there’s roadblocks, it takes three hours to get home – people are being shot on your fucking doorstep. But when you’re living in that moment, you don’t feel that you’re being affected by it.”Holmes and McCready could immediately sense the crowd letting go. “If you spend Monday to Saturday living in fear and paranoia, once you cross into that club and you’re hearing this music from all over the world, while being psychedelically intoxicated, all that shit just disappears,” Holmes says.“The Troubles manifests itself in your psyche in ways that you cannot even understand, so when you’re on that dancefloor and religion isn’t a barrier any more – the atmosphere was just beautiful. There was all this energy released. These communities fucking hated each other but among them you had groups of people whose religion was music.”Many DJs were too scared to come and perform but the likes of Andrew Weatherall and the Dust Brothers (before they became the Chemical Brothers) played. Orbital named their track Belfast in homage. “The Orbital night was insane,” Holmes remembers. “Chime was the anthem at the time and people were crying on the dancefloor – literal tears of happiness. People were becoming incredibly enlightened and having a really serious emotional reaction because of what was going on politically.”Paul Hartnoll of Orbital remembers it as being special. “It was incredible,” he says. “We’d play tracks like Satan and it used to clear dancefloors the length and breadth of the UK. In Belfast everybody stood there with their hands in the air and just roared with excitement.”Hartnoll not only remembers a surging intensity to the crowd but also deep gratitude. “We did our set and we could not leave the stage. People were clambering on to shake our hands and say thanks.” A demo track they had at the time needed a name and the city provided it. “It was to try and give something back to Belfast that reminds us of our lovely time there and the warmth of the people.”The night grew steadily until it filled its 500-odd capacity each month and queues formed to get in. The sound quality was a big pull. “We always had the most amazing soundsystems,” McCready says. “In 1989 to spend over a grand to hire a system was a lot of money. It had to be brought in via an 18-wheeler truck.”Another ace that Sugar Sweet held was access to acid house’s Chicago heartland, thanks to Holmes’s mum. “Due to the Troubles I had a brother who left Belfast for Chicago because his best friend was shot dead on the corner of our street,” Holmes says. “My mum would go and visit him, which was like winning the lottery. She found Gramaphone Records, the best dance music record shop, and she’d bring back all these white labels. I didn’t have a fucking clue what they were – it was proper raw dance music fresh out of Chicago.”Aesthetically, the night was aiming for something like a psychedelic 1960s party. Projections of 16mm films were screened on to the walls, alongside giant weather balloons, and giant custom-made flags. “Although they did end up accidentally looking a bit fascist,” recalls Holmes. “Because of the colour scheme and the SS for Sugar Sweet.”The close-knit music community in Belfast, along with reliable doormen, meant violence was unusual in the club. Nor did it become a magnet for police. “The police were aware and I’m sure they had a few undercover boys in,” McCready recalls. “But the people that were dealing were not operating along sectarian lines. It was people flying to London and buying a few pills to bring back. There was nothing dark or sinister going on in the background – it wasn’t like paramilitaries were running drugs in the place.”Holmes also suggests that while acid house might have been front-page tabloid fodder in England, it was less of a focus in Belfast. “The police had bigger issues on their hands,” he says. “It went largely unnoticed here for a few years because of all the other distractions.”Holmes recalls kick-out time for the club leading to some unusual scenarios. “The lead singer of the Sandals was last seen wandering through Sandy Row, which is a real serious loyalist neighbourhood, wearing a woman’s dress with a lampshade on his head saying ‘peace and love’ to everybody on the street.”The club’s cultural impact went further than the music, says Holmes, who went on to score films by Steven Soderbergh and Michael Winterbottom alongside a string of solo albums. “It inspired so many people who didn’t want to have a real job,” he suggests. “There’s something about that sense of togetherness, especially when you’re staring down the barrel of a gun, that gives you that extra bit of inspiration to think, ‘I want this to be more than once a month – I want it to be my fucking life.’ You can go down a very dark path in Belfast growing up during that time and I think the majority of people who came to this club chose something else.”It had the same impact on Holmes and McCready themselves. “We were going through the same experiences,” Holmes says during a one-off anniversary party to celebrate. “We were having the best nights of our lives. I’ve DJ’d all across the world and none of them have come close to some of those nights at Sugar Sweet.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79bcee38dd5a53d675260a3f78c730d5094e58bb/0_181_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=548c5926d135b1f31289ef980fb97aff","title":"the strange world of tiktok a look back","story":"This week we are returning to some of our favourite episodes from 2019.

Right now anyway, Keir Starmer looks to be heading for a fairly emphatic victory,” he said.So far only the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, and the shadow treasury minister, Clive Lewis, have officially said they want to run to be the next Labour leader.Phillips, who represents Birmingham Yardley, and the Wigan MP, Lisa Nandy, are expected to stand while the former Labour minister and home affairs select committee chair, Yvette Cooper, is understood to be weighing up her options as to whether she will vie for the leadership for a second time.The party chairman and Corbyn ally Ian Lavery – who lambasted the party’s performance for their muddled stance on Brexit – might also run. A former National Union of Mineworkers chair who supports leaving the EU, he would be the most leftwing of all the potential candidates.The poll will be interesting reading for all those who said they were using the Christmas break to decide whether to launch official campaigns and gain the signatures of MPs needed to get on the ballot.There is little difference between the popularity of the candidates between men and women, although Long Bailey is fractionally more popular among male members.“It certainly doesn’t look as if Labour’s members are necessarily persuaded that it’s time the party had a female leader. They seem more interested in picking the best person for the job, irrespective of gender,” said Bale, who co-wrote Footsoldiers: Political Party Membership in the 21st century with Webb and Monica Poletti.Starmer is also shown in the survey to be more popular than Long Bailey in all age groups but particularly with those aged over 60. He also was more popular with middle-class members by 14 percentage points over Long Bailey.Much of the reflection among members after the election has been on whether Labour needs someone from the north of England to reconnect to voters in former heartland seats that fell to the Tories.However, the most northern of all the MPs – Lisa Nandy – does not seem any more popular among Labour members living in the north than with those in other UK regions.Labour’s northern members seem to be just as keen as members from other parts of the country on Starmer, who represents Holborn and St Pancras in north London.Bale said: “For all the talk of Labour needing some ‘northern grit’ in order to help it regain its so-called northern wall seats and working-class voters, it looks like the membership are more interested in who they think will do the best job than where or what background they come from.”The survey of 1,059 Labour members, weighted by age, gender and region, was commissioned from YouGov by the Party Members Project, which is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council and run by Prof Tim Bale (Queen Mary University of London) and Prof Paul Webb (University of Sussex)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12fc09030701044d3a2961a0b79a66c973c99f20/0_282_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=374788617e09d1531494ebdb2f655d88","title":"what to expect in 2020 politics weekly podcast","story":"’s political editor, Heather Stewart, rings in the new year and looks at what to expect on the podcast in 2020Follow us on Twitter: @Heather and @DaniS1006"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b75d979e61e6b55514d4aa25b9fcf460792fce53/0_426_2320_1391/master/2320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e82c72e142c9898ca25ea4985d297a5e","title":"if you speak multiple languages which words get lost in translation","story":"Share your favourite words or terms that just don’t translateA new study has demonstrated that while words for emotions such as “fear”, “love” or “anger” are often directly translated between languages, there can be differences in their true meaning, depending on the family the language belongs to.For example, while the concept of “love” is closely linked to “like” and “want” in Indo-European languages, it is more closely associated with “pity” in Austronesian languages.The team behind the research say the way particular experiences are interpreted as emotions appears to be shaped by culture.Are there words you know which can be directly translated, yet have subtle differences in meaning?

We’re increasingly experiencing unseasonal heatwaves, dangerous flooding and extreme weather,” explains WWF climate change specialist, Isabella O’Dowd. “The government, businesses and iniduals have an important role to play in reaching the UK’s climate change targets. Right now, people want to know what they can do to help mitigate the effects of climate change.”In the past year, the climate crisis has shifted from 11th place to third place on the list of people’s concerns in WWF’s monthly public opinion poll, just behind the NHS and Brexit. This year has also seen high-profile global youth climate strikes and Extinction Rebellion protests. In addition, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2019 report stresses that it will be impossible to keep global temperatures at safe levels unless greenhouse gas emissions are reduced in all sectors, including land and food. As a result, more people recognise that climate breakdown isn’t abstract. It’s not a threat affecting remote communities, or far away in the distant future – it’s happening here and now.The climate and nature crisis is already accelerating so many human-induced influences on our planet – from the destruction of vast areas of rainforest in the Amazon to the collapse of bee populations. As more species become endangered, including one-third of all insects globally, the ecosystems that we all rely on become more fragile.With such astonishing loss of bioersity and habitat, planet Earth is much more likely to reach irreversible tipping points. Environmental breakdown is inevitable if we continue this unsustainable consumption of fossil fuels.Mark Wright, WWF’s director of science, hopes that environmental issues will be at the top of the agenda for political leaders: “Attitudes are shifting and now we need a step-change – the UK government needs to take radical steps to meet its target for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.”WWF climate experts estimate that net-zero could be achieved much sooner than the current 2050 target if we act now, but that calls for fundamental changes to the UK’s outdated energy infrastructure. Historically, the UK has been one of the biggest emitters and has an important role to fully decarbonise our energy system as quickly as possible. We need to make the energy greener and develop a more resilient smart system, as O’Dowd explains: “Our grid needs to be flexible so it can better manage supply and demand as we transition to more renewable energy. By equipping every home with a smart meter, power can be adjusted on a local and national level so the system is more energy efficient.”O’Dowd describes smart meters as “the enabler”, and they will undoubtedly be integral to the transition towards a low-carbon economy. To facilitate innovation, the government has pledged to offer every home and small business in the country a smart meter in the next few years – to date about 15.6m smart meters have been installed nationwide. “Smart meters allow consumers to understand their own energy use, and, with information from the in-home display, customers can start making small, money-saving changes such as switching off appliances which aren’t in use.”The government estimates that £650m of energy gets wasted in the current distribution system, travelling from where it is generated to the point it reaches our homes. Smart meters can help reduce loss in energy by accurately forecasting demand and using more low-cost and renewable energy. “We need to ramp up our wind power and solar generation in order to reach our 2050 target of net-zero, but these renewables don’t have an easy route to market,” says O’Dowd. “We want to push the government to raise its ambition – we know the technology exists and solutions are there but we need government support and its investment in our grid network to help that transition.”Ultimately, a smart energy system will generate, distribute and use energy much more efficiently. At a national network level, a more flexible infrastructure will use energy storage, for example via batteries or heating, and will shift demand away from peak periods, because when demand is highest, more of the electricity we consume is generated by polluting coal stations.In conjunction with the University of Oxford, Environmental Defense Fund Europe, and WWF, the National Grid has created a carbon intensity forecast that predicts the generation mix for the next four days in each region of the country. Energy users can enter their postcode and find out when the best time is to access green, clean energy. If your washing machine has a timer, you can set it to run at night, for example, when demand is low and more of the system’s energy is generated by renewables. In homes with solar panels, it might make sense to use electricity at midday if the sun is shining.As the smart energy system becomes more interactive with advanced technology, smart meters will play a part in allowing the shift to more staggered night-time charging for electric car batteries to minimise carbon emissions and keep costs down. In the future, this management could become automatic, with more widespread “time-of-use” tariffs. Local peer-to-peer trading could become more commonplace so consumers could more easily trade the excess energy they generate from solar panels. And perhaps the carbon intensity forecast might one day be reported alongside the weather.The Committee on Climate Change states that to reach our 2050 net-zero emissions target, we must reduce our carbon emissions by 15m tonnes a year, every year, starting now. “We’re in a rapidly changing world in terms of bioersity loss, habitat destruction and climate change, so we’re heading into uncharted territory,” says Wright. “We are clever and technologically savvy, so we may be able to cope with what the world throws at us in the future, but is that a world we want?” he asks, adding that as the climate changes, we’ll need to adapt quickly.For WWF, adopting smart meters is just one of the small changes we can each make, that our power companies do for us, that will help the overall system. It adds that smart meters help us to make changes to our power use – at a national, regional and domestic level – in ways that help cut emissions, which we need to do rapidly and deeply if we are to tackle the climate emergency.Wright says: “To feed the growing population in a world with more extreme weather events, increased flooding and rising sea temperatures, we’ll have to farm crops differently – we might need to start growing novel varieties of crops that are better suited to the environments of the future.” In order to have this capacity to adapt, we need to protect bioersity, on land and in the sea – every species plays a vital role in these ecosystems.“Nature rewards the patient – every species has a story to tell, even little beetles and velvet worms. If you allow nature to tell you its stories, you’ll unravel a real tapestry of life. We will be poorer if we continue to unpick that.”Part of Britain’s commitment to creating a more sustainable, low-carbon future includes making our energy network “smarter” – implementing digital tech to make our energy system more responsive to increased demand and variable wind speed. By collecting data on our energy use through smart meters, our network can better understand, plan for and balance out peaks and troughs in demand, making it easier to integrate renewable energy sources.This article was paid for by Smart Energy GB, a government-backed organisation tasked with informing Great Britain about the smart meter rollout."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01c1b4657ba7312bd0e8d362a78ac39d9426539a/0_182_5059_3036/master/5059.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af5ec0d8b58a897edb1fd389ca058787","title":"my house would only let good people in how kids see their homes of the future","story":"From houses that speak to you to magnifying glasses on the roof for energy, we take a glimpse into the future through the eyes of our youngest generation Fynn Rodell, 11: ‘The sun will heat my oven’I’m going to have loads of tech on my house to make it carbon neutral. I’ll have a wind turbine on the roof to generate electricity for lighting. There will be solar panels on the front door for more energy, and a magnifying glass on the roof to focus the sun’s heat for my oven. A vent will help suck the heat in and spread it around the house for extra heating when I’m not cooking. There will be a smart meter in the house to see how much energy I’m creating and how much I’m using.I’ll grow plants on the roof for insulation, to reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and for insects to live there.The turbine on the roof will also power a water cleanser, so I can turn rainwater into drinking and washing water. I’ll have a toilet vacuum like on an airplane so that I don’t waste much water.Rosabela O’Selle-Goncalves, seven: ‘My house will say good things to you if you help the environment’In my house of the future the door should be brown, the house should be peach, and the roof should be red. There wouldn’t be much made from plastic, because if the plastic gets in the rivers it kills the animals.If you do really good things the house will see it and say good things about you because you’re helping the environment. It might say bad stuff if you ruin the environment, or it won’t speak to you.I would like that to happen – it’d be very nice for the house to look and speak to you because it’ll make you feel happy.My house would be medium-sized and you wouldn’t need keys, it would open if I put my hand on the door, but if a stranger put their hand on it, it wouldn’t open. It would know if people coming to the house were good or bad and would only let good people in.It wouldn’t have loads of food because it’s bad for the environment to waste it. To get water you don’t turn a tap on, you press a button and tell it how much water you want. When I walk in the lights will go on and if I leave they go off.Indy Williams, six: ‘Animals that have lost their habitats can come and live with us’In the future, my house will have solar panels on the roof to generate electricity for the TV, maybe a wind turbine too. We’ll still have our pet cats, but if other animals have lost their habitats then they can come and live with us as well. There’ll be a sliding door to the garden where we keep our bikes and also grow tomatoes, cucumbers and pomegranates.In the winter, all the inside walls will be covered in sheep’s wool so the house will be all cosy, like the inside of a slipper. We’ll have small windows and very big windows because it’s nice to have lots of sun, but not when you’re asleep. In the summer we’ll have a street party where no one will smoke or use plastic.Arianna Burke, nine: ‘A robot will sense when you’re wasting energy’I believe environmentally friendly homes of the future will have light switches that switch off in an hour or two when no one is inside.I think there would also be some sort of robot that senses if devices like the TV are on and knows whether people are there or not, and if not, it switches them off. I also think all houses should have solar panels on them automatically when they are built.Rai Rodell, nine: ‘I’ll collect rainwater for animals to drink’I’m going to have lots of animals in my house and in my garden. I’m going to grow food in the garden for me and my animals, and some seeds for the birds. I’ll put bird boxes on the roof so they have somewhere to live.The balcony will shelter the outdoor animals when it rains.

Do you think there’s no greater pleasure than a brilliant story brilliantly told?You do? Well, have I got good news for you. Which is: BBC One’s new series Dracula is a pure and joyous BELTER. It’s in three parts of 90 glorious minutes each, adapted by Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss. And it is basically Sherlock but about Dracula. And peak Sherlock at that: seeking always to entertain the audience, revitalising the story while revelling in its absurdity, clever without being clever-clever, and strewn with comic and dramatic flourishes that give you the feeling that this is not just a treat but a tribute – to the author, to the season, to you as an intelligent viewer.Everything you need is here. A dark, unmappable, labyrinthine castle. Gnarled hands resting on balcony ledges, their unseen owner lurking in shadowy recesses. Terrified locals. Bats. Babies crying. Primal fears inescapably roused.The story unfolds within two timeframes, the Now and the Then. In the Now, where we begin, a strangely deformed man is being interviewed in a nunnery by Sister Agatha (Dolly Wells) who – and I’m calling it now – is quite the best nun of all time, and not just because she has no time at all for God. “Like many women my age I am trapped in a loveless marriage, maintaining appearances for the sake of a roof over my head,” she says briskly. She is investigating the man’s tale of escape from someone he calls Count Dracula. The man’s name is Jonathan Harker and he is played by John Heffernan with the same utter conviction brought to the story by the rest of the cast via a script and direction that are all refreshingly devoid of any shred of cynicism. You may point, as apparent disproof of my assertion, to Sister Agatha’s response to Harker’s failure to realise the significance of an SOS message written in English in the heart of eastern Europe: “You are an English man,” she explains. “A combination of presumptions beyond compare.” But you would be wrong. She is simply a truth-teller, unfettered by convention. This is quite different. Also, top nunning. I will brook no riposte.Harker was brought by a fisherman to the nunnery, having been found washed up on the banks of a nearby river muttering about forces of evil. He looks a half-formed thing – bald and white and smooth, a cross between Voldemort and Ryan Reynolds’ irradiated Deadpool – as well, it turns out, he might.Harker is a lawyer who was sent to talk a mysterious client through some legal issues at his castle. That’s the Then. The client is an unsettling, old, old man with a – Transylvanian, is it? – accent who says exactly the things you want an old, old man with a Transylvanian accent and an unmappable castle to say. Things such as “I don’t drink … wine”, and “The people around here have no flavour”. “Perhaps you mean ‘character’?” suggests Harker gently. “Perhaps,” replies the old, old man. When asked if there is anyone else living in the place, he replies “No. There’s no one … living here.” It is around this point that you find your bum wriggling its way more firmly into the sofa. The client takes a shine to him, and so Harker must stay. His health fails, he gets weaker by the day – but the years fall away from Dracula until he stands revealed as Danish actor Claes Bang, embodying exactly the wolfish charm and diabolic spirit you love to see in a prince … wait, what am I saying?! The prince of darkness.It’s a bloodstained love letter to a classic, beautifully and delicately scented with just the faintest hint of ham gothic yarns need a homage to all the great Counts who have gone before, but still entirely its own thing. And again, like the best of Gatiss and Moffat’s Sherlocks, with the searching intelligence that promises to flesh out the foundational story. Enjoy sinking your teeth into it all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c351b297d326b18f4cba676fab50f48166aefc37/118_0_5383_3231/master/5383.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df1b500b6824677999852cb3316de352","title":"messiah review its homeland with a divine twist","story":"A young preacher wants to share his message of peace, love and fantastic cheekbones with the world in Netflix’s potent new thriller. But the CIA have other ideasIs he the messiah? Or is he a very naughty boy?These are the animating questions of the 10-part Netflix drama Messiah, a political thriller built around the advent in Syria of a young preacher man (played with grace, charm and passion by Mehdi Dehbi).He catches people’s attention by fearlessly urging them to set aside old isions and listen to his message of peace, love and unity, which seems to incorporate the best of most of the main religions. This is very generous of him, considering he also possesses a set of cheekbones upon which he could hang a new and very self-centred one. For what I suspect are a variety of spiritual, aesthetic and carnal reasons, his following soon grows in numbers.However, the CIA (particularly the agent Eva Geller – played by Michelle Monaghan – who is recently widowed and nursing a secret, possibly fatal, illness, because non-prophets are also interesting) is sceptical. Alongside assorted other cynical parties, the intelligence agency is not convinced that he is our saviour newly born to Earth. It runs him through its databases and finds no trace of him, but reckons he can only be either a con artist or a terrorist who has found a new way to bring about a war.The latter view looks increasingly probable as our lord of the cheekbones leads a group of Muslim refugees out of Damascus, after (as they come to see it) conjuring a sandstorm that spikes the guns of Isis just as they are about to take the city, and up to the border of Israel.He is arrested by the police and interrogated by Aviram (Tomer Sisley), a soldier in the Israeli army. The prophet seems to have unwarranted knowledge of his personal history. As a result, Aviram deletes the tape of their interview. This comes back to bite him when the high priest of the zygomatic arch pulls off his second apparent miracle and escapes from a locked cell overnight.After only a brief pause at Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem – to preach the maxillofacial word and heal a boy shot in front of him by trigger-happy police excited to be closing in on their escapee – the prophet next appears in the US, seemingly having saved a pastor’s daughter from a tornado (and indirectly preventing the debt-ridden pastor from torching his church for the insurance). The seeds of another following are sown. Unsurprisingly, the CIA is no more keen on the home-soil outpost than it was on the original.As the series goes on, the influence of social media and investigations into the potentially holy one’s motivations by old-fashioned “proper” journalists (represented by Jane Adams, playing a dogged CNN reporter called Miriam Keneally) add further layers of complexity. The whole thing is like Homeland, with a ine twist.However, the twist may already have been spoiled. Muslim Arabic speakers have complained that one of the names the writers have used for Zygoman translates as something that gives away the ending a hazard, these people say, of the writers borrowing names and iconography from a religion and a culture they don’t fully understand.Whether this is the case, or an elaborate multiple bluff is in play, Messiah is potent stuff packed with fine performances. My feeling is that, even if the show’s creators had only a basic understanding of the relevant religious and cultural considerations, the mistake being asserted by viewers would be quite difficult to make. I hope that the people behind a multicultural series that deals with Jewish and Muslim conflict had the sense to hire all sorts of experts to protect sensitivities and highlight potential problems – but perhaps I am being overly optimistic.Even in the earliest episodes, Messiah is capable of delivering gut punches – the flashback to Aviram holding a cloth over a boy’s face as he struggles for breath, for example – that surprise you into noticing how far you have been sucked in. Perhaps the fact that the show becomes so harrowing so fast, and is compelling throughout, is a sign that we are hardwired for hope – the man standing in front of me promises to end all human suffering – and programmed deeply to seek answers and invest in those who purport to provide them. I have no saviour to turn to, and if one appeared I would probably be among the very last converts, sitting canker-hearted as water jug after water jug was turned to wine. But I believe in television, and I believe in Netflix’s latest offering to us. Salvation from the outside world for at least 10 hours lies within."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9efe2a5d505a27d8cdef37729d4c22cf64eb3292/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e886a4322365f54db5a7a4cb6a8c7c91","title":"tv shows to get excited about 2020 preview","story":"The Love Islanders are back to lift our winter blues, Phoebe Waller-Bridge returns to the small screen, and there’s evil on the wardsby  Stuart Heritage,  Kate Abbott and  Hannah J Davies(ITV2) The UK’s most talked-about reality show gets a spin-off.

But which one is capable of beating Trump?Democrats overwhelmingly agree that their top priority in 2020 is to remove Donald Trump from office. But which of the many Democrats running for president is best suited to the task remains a source of deep anxiety and ision less than five weeks before the Iowa caucuses.After more than a year of campaigning, the Democratic presidential primary enters the final sprint before voting begins on 3 February in Iowa in a familiar but fluid state: Joe Biden in the lead, trailed by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren with Pete Buttigieg also showing signs of strength in the early states.Democrats fear Biden is too old, gaffe-prone and does not excite the activist base. They also worry Sanders and Warren are too far left and will alienate moderates. And they worry Buttigieg is too young and inexperienced.“Suddenly every candidate has clay feet. Voters are worried. There is no perfect candidate but there never is,” said Elaine Karmack, a veteran of Democratic presidential campaigns who studies primaries as a scholar at the Brookings Institution.Fear of another Trump election has turned Democrats into self-professed pundits, determined to suss out the most “electable” candidate. The perception that Biden is best placed to beat Trump, at least among some voters, has strengthened his resilience despite a series of stumbles and controversies. A central thesis of Biden’s campaign – which he increasingly states in blunt terms on the campaign trail – is that he is the candidate most likely to reassemble a Democratic coalition by appealing to white working class voters who Trump won over in 2016 and to black voters who are critical to the Democratic base.But rising in second place is Sanders, who rebounded from a heart attack in October and sinking poll numbers earlier this year. His “comeback” has reinforced – and even expanded – his standing among the party’s left wing after months of watching Warren rise to to the front of the pack.The policy debate and jostling between the party’s many factions has framed much of the contest until this point. Biden and Sanders, the only candidates to have previously run for president, represent the ideological poles of the primary field – and two competing theories of how to beat Trump.Biden argues Trump is an aberration who can be defeated by the election of a president with the goodwill and experience to unite the country and restore the nation’s standing abroad. Sanders believes Trump is a symptom of an American political system and economy warped by money, greed and inequality. In his view, rooting out Trumpism will require not only a Democratic president but sweeping political and economic reforms.The ide over which path to take in 2020 has emerged as a central fault line in the Democratic race.“In this primary we must commit to being aspirational – to really explain what we expect the next president to build not just by refuting what Trump has done but by building a vision for a future that comes after Trump,” said María Urbina, the national political director for progressive group Inisible. “If you’re not excited to vote for somebody, your neighbors and your friends – everyone who we need to turn out this election to beat Trump’s turnout machine – are probably not going to be very excited to vote for them either.”Warren rose steadily last summer to the top of the field with a registry of plans that would fundamentally remake the US economy but she has receded in recent months amid criticism over her health care proposal. Warren and Sanders, ideological allies whose supporters overlap, are now tangled up for second and third place. Progressive groups are taking sides even as the candidates refuse to go after one another out of fear of antagonizing the other’s supporters, which one of them would need to consolidate to win the nomination.Moderates, meanwhile, are hopeful that the two will ide the left and keep each other from capturing the nomination. But after years of losing factional feuds, progressives are emboldened by their political prominence in the race.“The beauty of having more than one progressive candidate in the race is that they have a large, strong base and they have the resources and infrastructure to go all the way into the 2020 calendar year,” said Rebecca Katz, a liberal political consultant. “It’s possible we could be in a situation where they are two of the last candidates standing – and that’s a good thing for the progressive movement.”Even as polling paints a steady picture of the primary race, the contest remains far from settled.Perhaps one of the biggest uncertainties is Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor who entered the race in late November. His strategy for winning the nomination is unorthodox: he won’t contest the early states that every other candidate is scrapping over. Instead, he has poured tens of millions of dollars from his personal fortune into TV and digital advertising into the big, delegate-rich Super Tuesday states going to the polls on 3 March.But there is plenty of time for other surprises before then.One of the most significant developments in the race so far came in November, when Kamala Harris, a US senator from California and the only black woman running for president, abruptly ended her campaign. Her departure sparked a debate among Democrats over how the most erse primary field in political history has stratified into a top-tier of only white and mostly male candidates.No candidate of color has yet qualified for the next debate in January in Iowa, as the first voters prepare to actually cast their ballots. But the Democrats will now have to compete for media attention with the Senate impeachment trial expected in January. For the senators running for president, this will require time off the campaign trail and in Washington to participate as jurors in the trial.Several candidates have staked their campaigns on a strong finish in Iowa, including Buttigieg, Sanders and Amy Klobuchar, the US senator from Minnesota. Biden’s team has signaled that it has low expectations for Iowa. Instead, Biden expects to pull ahead in South Carolina, where he maintains a strong base of support among black voters.﻿On the campaign trail and the debate stage, the candidates will make their closing arguments to voters. After months of debating policy and politics, their final pitches are expected to focus on the issue that matters most to Democrats: why they are the party’s best hope of beating Trump.“Right now, the biggest priority for Democratic voters is who can beat Donald Trump,” said Michael Starr Hopkins, a Democratic strategist who previously worked on John Delaney’s 2020 presidential campaign.“It’s not the whole game but it’s the most important part of it because if you thought what Trump did in his first term was bad, imagine what he is capable of in a second term.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85ea2d700ca650d1b8045ead99d9c539d431be60/0_16_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad934410504ff003288b6d3c61c5ebf1","title":"what are your hopes for the next decade","story":"As the end of the year approaches, we want to hear what you hope the next 10 years will bringAs 2019 draws to a close, we want to find out your hopes, dreams and desires for the next decade.The 2010s have provided the world with an array of defining challenges: from the rise in political populism to the fight against the climate emergency.

But after she signed a retraction statement 10 days later, she was charged and a dozen men aged between 15 and 22 who had been arrested over the incident freed.Her mother said the woman, who had been due to begin university in September, was experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), hallucinations and sleeping for up to 20 hours a day as a result of the condition hypersomnia.During a five-month trial, the Briton claimed she had been forced to change her account under pressure from Cypriot police, telling the judge she was “scared for my life”. On Monday, she was ruled by a judge to have wilfully indulged in public mischief.The teenager, who spent a month in Nicosia general prison before being bailed at the end of August, has been prevented from leaving Cyprus since July. She could face up to a year in prison and a €1,700 (£1,500) fine when she is sentenced on 7 January.Within hours of the court decision being announced, calls for a boycott appeared on social media. The storm erupted as Britain’s Foreign Office, in a highly unusual step, also raised “serious concerns” over the woman receiving a fair trial.On Monday judge Michalis Papathanasiou, sitting in Famagusta’s district court, pronounced that prosecutors had proved her guilt beyond reasonable doubt.The verdict has also put the government of President Nicos Anastasiades on the defensive.As one of the region’s most popular destinations, with an economy greatly dependent on the tourist industry, calls for a boycott have taken the affair to another level. UK tourists top the league tables of arrivals, and Politis, a leading daily, described the Mediterranean country as being “up against the wall”.But while the government spokesman, Kyriakos Kousios, expressed sympathy for the Briton’s mother, he also described public reaction to the case as “exaggerated”.The island nation’s court system, like its judiciary, was entirely independent of the state mechanism, the spokesman insisted. As a former crown colony, Cyprus’s legal system is based on British law.“As a government we cannot, under any circumstances, intervene in a pending case before the court,” he said, repeating that court proceedings were initiated only after the student retracted her original complaint. “What would happen if a Cypriot was brought before a court in the UK? Would the government intervene and would the Cypriots campaign to boycott England?” he asked.Her lawyers have argued that, in contravention of EU community law, a statement retracting the rape claim was signed by the teenager with no lawyer present and after eight hours of police interrogation that was neither videoed nor recorded. Determined to clear her name, they have vowed to take the case to Cyprus’s supreme court and, if necessary, the European court of human rights.On Monday Papathanasiou argued that, motivated by anger, the teenager had falsely levelled the rape claim against the Israelis, when she realised video clips of her having consensual sex with one of them had been recorded by others in the group on their mobile phones.Her testimony before the court had been “evasive” and “contradictory”, he said. Protesters, led by women activists, have deplored the judgment, calling it the product of a system that remains insensitive to gender and rape.As condemnation of the verdict spreads, so does internal dissent over the way the case has been handled. On Tuesday a former attorney general, Alekos Markides, added to the criticism, saying the matter should have been wrapped up long ago instead of assuming such international proportions. “It should have ended with the one-month prison sentence and not assumed such dimensions,” he told a local radio station.As an offence, causing public mischief was among the lightest on the statute books, he said. Blaming the international outcry on the court’s obstinacy, he also criticised the legal system for targeting “a 19-year-old tourist who we have kept in Cyprus for five months now, a … girl who has a clean criminal record … who we have forced to collect donations to cover her legal costs and have forbidden from travelling to her country. This rigidity of the court has provoked reaction internationally.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5df3f91d11cc92fd02293bd51fa76647e50a8af/0_14_2900_1740/master/2900.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8690f5e1b91f2d486e84e02a92dee90b","title":"huge rise in number of people trying to cross channel to uk by sea","story":"French officials say more than 2,300 people wer picked up last year, up from 586 in 2018The number of people making desperate attempts to cross the Channel by sea from France has quadrupled over the last year.French officials say almost 2,358 people were picked up in the Channel attempting to reach the UK by boat or swimming in 2019, compared with 586 in 2018.In total in 2019 there were 261 crossings or attempted sea crossings, mostly by small, overloaded inflatable craft, leading to four deaths. Fifty-five percent of the attempts were unsuccessful. The most desperate attempted to swim the Channel, which is 20.7 miles across at its narrowest point.On Tuesday more than 40 migrants, including eight children, were intercepted in the Channel by the Border Force. Dozens more, including a pregnant woman, were picked up in the Channel in the days after Christmas.On New Year’s Eve an inflatable craft, carrying six males with hypothermia, according to French rescuers, was intercepted after getting into difficulty nearly seven miles (11km) north of Dunkirk. The migrants were taken to Calais.In the last year, the number of attempted crossings has soared despite repeated warnings from the French authorities and migrant support organisations of the danger in the Channel, one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world, from traffic, strong currents and icy water.After meeting the British home secretary, Priti Patel, in August, the French interior minister, Christophe Castaner, said it was in both countries’ interests to stop “irregular crossings” of the Channel.The Home Office said patrols on French beaches had doubled and drones, specialist vehicles and detection equipment had been deployed to deter crossings. It said it had sent back 125 illegal migrants who had arrived by sea in 2019 to show its “determination” to return those entering the country illegally to Europe where they should seek asylum.Natalie Elphicke, the Conservative MP for Dover, said France needed to do more to stop boats setting off from its coast."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ce2277ef0b22f01ecc3d165afbb7c55408d2bf6/0_886_4222_2535/master/4222.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e43d0445e8bafe867e32ca3d700ab9b6","title":"mexico amlo el chapo same power past presidents corruption","story":"López Obrador took a blow at his predecessors while claiming Mexico’s era of corruption is ‘gone to the garbage dump of history’Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, closed out 2019 with a parting shot at his predecessors, saying the imprisoned drug kingpin Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera had once wielded the same power as the country’s president.In a video message from the southern city of Palenque on Wednesday, López Obrador recounted his administration’s successes in its first year and highlighted its challenges foremost surging violence.He claimed without offering any evidence that he had already done away with the high-level corruption that was rampant in previous governments, but said it was crucial to draw a bright line between criminal elements and authorities so that the two sides do not mingle as they had in the past.“There was a time when Guzmán had the same power or had the influence that the then president had ... because there had been a conspiracy and that made it difficult to punish those who committed crimes. That has already become history, gone to the garbage dump of history,” López Obrador said.It appeared to be a reference to the indictment and arrest last month of Mexico’s former public safety secretary Genaro García Luna. García Luna was public safety secretary in Felipe Calderon’s Cabinet from 2006 to 2012. Before joining Calderon’s government, García Luna led Mexicos equivalent of the FBI, the Federal Investigative Agency, under Vicente Fox.He was charged in federal court in New York with three counts of trafficking cocaine and one count of making false statements. He had been living in Florida and was arrested in Texas.US prosecutors allege he accepted millions of dollars in bribes from Guzmán’s Sinaloa cartel and in exchange allowed it to operate without interference.Guzmán was convicted on drug conspiracy charges in New York. He was sentenced this year to life in prison.López Obrador came to power a year ago promising a “hugs not bullets” approach of tackling the social roots of crime instead of confronting the cartels head-on.But his vaguely defined strategy has itself come under intense criticism after a string of high-profile violent crimes, including an ambush which killed 13 state police officers, the murder of nine members of a US-Mexican family and the humiliating release of one of Guzmán’s sons after cartel gunmen besieged an entire city after he was briefly detained."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3b1f9ea06fffaba52b8b0d8cb51058e9772f6a6/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83e0472b4642248fa7411ad1a6105106","title":"new years day rally hong kong","story":"Police detain 400 and fire teargas as anti-government protests continue into 2020A huge New Year’s Day march in Hong Kong has ended in mass arrests and street clashes as the anti-government movement – now in its eighth month – continued into 2020.Police detained about 400 people on charges including illegal assembly and possession of offensive weapons after the rally on Wednesday, which organisers said was attended by more than a million people. It was one of the largest numbers of arrests in a single day since the unrest began.But the march had begun in a mood of carnival celebration – there were protesters in costumes and families with children and elderly people. Marchers chanted slogans including “Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our era”.Riot police fired teargas rounds in Wan Chai district after protesters threw objects at officers who had arrested several people for allegedly vandalising a bank.Some protesters retaliated by throwing molotov cocktails at the police, but many in the crowd were caught by surprise as the march was expected to be peaceful and most did not wear protective gear.Police demanded that the protest organisers, the Civil Human Rights Front, immediately call off the demonstration, but large crowds continued to march and police declared that they were taking part in an illegal assembly.As night fell, police used water cannon on crowds in Wan Chai and the financial district of Central. Protesters laid bricks across the main thoroughfare in Central in an attempt to impede the police’s advance towards the area.A police statement said protesters had blocked roads with barricades, dug up bricks from pavements and set fires to banks and cash machines.At a late-night press briefing, Senior Supt Ng Lok Chun blamed radical protesters for “hijacking” and disrupting the march and said police had fired teargas because they were surrounded by protesters who were throwing objects at them.There had already been a bleak start to 2020: shortly after revellers counted down to midnight and shouted “Happy new year!”, police in the central district of Mong Kok shot teargas at protesters who set off fireworks and set fire to roadblocks.On Tuesday night police deployed water cannon to disperse protesters while armoured vehicles cleared roadblocks. The crowd had gathered outside a metro station where people were leaving flowers to commemorate protesters rumoured to have died during a clash with police four months ago. The government denies that the deaths occurred.The anti-government movement in Hong Kong, sparked by an extradition bill that would have allowed iniduals to be sent to China for trial, is showing no signs of abating. Protesters say they will not give up unless the government meets their demands, which include universal suffrage and an independent investigation into police brutality.As of last week, 6,494 people had been arrested since the movement started in June, some as young as 12, according to the police.Many in Hong Kong, including pro-democracy supporters, are weary of the frequent violent confrontations in the movement and are seeking new directions in their attempt to press the government into conceding to their demands.Some are urging fellow Hong Kongers on social media to use economic means to put pressure on the government instead, including joining trade unions so that they can launch strikes and other collective actions more effectively.“We want to show our determination to the world that we will not back down on our resistance against an authoritarian regime,” said Mary Chin, a former bank employee in her 40s.The Civil Human Rights Front condemned the police’s abrupt revocation of its permission for the march, which it estimated was attended by a million people.“The government has shown its unwillingness to listen to the voices of the mass and it has infringed on their right to assembly,” it said in a statement. “Hong Kongers shall not back down and peace shall not resume with the ongoing police brutality.”In his new year address, the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, acknowledged that “the situation in Hong Kong has been everybody’s concern over the past few months” as he called for “a harmonious and stable environment” for Hong Kong.Sounding relatively conciliatory compared with earlier, more threatening remarks, Xi said in the televised address: “Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability is the wish of Hong Kong compatriots and the expectation for the people of the motherland.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d98d1eec15c83c872ae75b942d840422e8ca7a9/0_119_4057_2434/master/4057.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe16ea12a168d2f204362ac8ebac643b","title":"resurgent austrian greens in coalition deal with centre right party","story":"Sebastian Kurz, who leads the People’s party, can now return to power with small majorityAustria’s main centre-right party and the Greens have agreed on a coalition deal that will return ex-chancellor Sebastian Kurz to power.Both Kurz and Werner Kogler from the Greens, who led the negotiations between the two parties, told reporters in Vienna they had hammered out a government programme that would be presented to the public in detail on Thursday afternoon.“These were demanding negotiations, but the result is a very good one,” Kurz said. “Both us and the Greens will be able to honour the central election promises we made.”Kogler agreed, saying: “It wasn’t easy, but that’s also not what we were elected for.”“It is possible to reduce the tax burden and to ecologise the tax system,” Kurz said, referring to the core campaign pledges of both parties and hinting at the deal’s contents. The Greens said they wanted an investment package in environmental measures and to make products that damage the environment more expensive.The 33-year-old Kurz’s People’s party embarked on negotiations with the Greens in mid-November, weeks after it emerged as by far the biggest party from the election. In the vote in September, the Greens, who had not previously been part of a federal government in Austria, saw their support soar and returned to parliament after a two-year absence.The two parties have a combined 97 seats in Austria’s 183-seat parliament. Kurz’s return to power would mean him taking back the title of the world’s youngest sitting head of government from the new Finnish prime minister, Sanna Marin, who is 34. If the Green party’s delegates formally approve the coalition deal at their party convention on Saturday, the new government could be sworn in as early as next week.Kurz led a coalition with the Freedom party for 17 months until May, when a video showing then Freedom party leader Heinz-Christian Strache offering favours to a purported Russian investor prompted Kurz to pull the plug.Parliament then ousted Kurz in a no-confidence vote.

But it will take more than a dinner to clear the structural obstacles to a relationship that is critical to what Europe can achieve in 2020.“The Franco-German relationship is the single most important relationship in the EU and it’s in a totally toxic condition,” said Mark Leonard, the director of the European Council on Foreign Relations. “And it’s going to get worse before it gets better.”There was always going to be a yawning gulf between the styles of Macron, 41, an ambitious, impatient and at times arrogant first-time French president, and Merkel, a cautious, pragmatic, consensus-building fourth-time German chancellor. But if, on matters of substance, their overarching visions coincide more often than they erge, the two leaders’ very different domestic situations have compounded their personal differences, making the relationship unproductive – or worse.Macron, halfway through his mandate at the Élysée Palace and revelling in powers that are not far short of royal, is increasingly frustrated, not just with Merkel’s slow pragmatism, but with her weakened authority since announcing she would not run again when her term ends in 2021.Worse, her grand Christian Democrat-Social Democrat coalition is ided, bent mainly on survival and frightened even to consider fresh elections in which it would be challenged by the surging popularity of the nationalist Alternative für Deutschland party (AfD) on the right and the Greens on the left.“Germany is in political paralysis, incapable of taking a major decision, and will probably remain so until elections in September 2021,” said François Heisbourg of the International Institute for Strategic Studies. “Hence Macron’s frustration: France has ideas Germany is sticking its fingers in its ears.”The makeup of Germany’s current coalition would anyway prove problematic for the French president, who himself faces re-election in 2022: the centre-left SPD dislikes his proposals on developing the EU’s military and security capability, while the conservative CDU opposes his plans for the eurozone and economic integration.“Macron basically bet the farm on building a new relationship with Germany, reforming France and working with Berlin to reform Europe,” Leonard said. “He appointed German-speaking ministers and spent his first year wooing the Germans – but nothing materialised. So he pivoted.”This year, Leonard said, the French president – currently trying to push through contested pension changes at home – has “not hung around for Berlin, or even shied away from upsetting it. His approach has been to launch his initiatives, try to build relationships with other countries, and involve the Germans later. It hasn’t gone down very well.”Others, too, have been annoyed by Macron’s tendency to act first and consult later: the French president has, often alone, insisted on a shorter article 50 extension imposed his line-up for Europe’s top jobs vetoed EU accession talks for North Macedonia and demanded, with the aim of keeping Russia out of China’s clutches, “a new architecture of trust and security” with Moscow.But Berlin in particular has been vexed, culminating – after Macron told the Economist that Nato was “brain dead” – in Merkel reportedly informing her French counterpart, at an anniversary dinner commemorating the fall of the Berlin Wall, that she understood his “desire for disruptive politics” but was “tired of picking up the pieces”. Hence the Savoy dinner.The picture is not entirely bleak. Away from the headlines, steady, day-to-day bilateral work continues. Berlin and Paris are still pushing ahead where possible, albeit incrementally.German-French cooperation was “like two sides of an accordion”, a German diplomat said. “Sometimes you pull it apart a bit, then both sides come back together again. Each side knows they are joined to each other. And they know they can only produce a nice sound together.”The Franco-German relationship “is certainly not in crisis”, said Heisbourg. “But in a way, it would almost be better if it was, because then we would have a real discussion, and the chance of decisions and some substantive action.”Heisbourg added that Germany’s EU presidency, in the second half of the year, “for which Berlin surely will want to achieve something concrete”, might yet produce some progress. But Leonard was less sure.At root, he said, the problem was structural: most French voters think neither France nor Europe is working very well for them, so Macron has “no alternative but to be an agent of change and disruption” most Germans reckon things are going pretty well, so Merkel has the opposite imperative.“Why this matters,” Leonard said, “is because while it’s true that France and Germany can no longer set the EU agenda and just expect all the others to follow, if there is no consensus between Paris and Berlin, really, nothing is possible.”Ever since the 1950s, the relationship between France and Germany, the continent’s economic powerhouse and its diplomatic and military leader, has been the EU’s engine: when it works, Europe moves forward when it doesn’t, Europe stalls.The EU’s big decisions in 2020 – its new budget, eurozone reforms, carbon neutrality, digital taxation, relations with Russia – would be difficult even if France and Germany could agree and were prepared to act, Leonard said. “If they can’t and they’re not, it’s going to be very, very difficult indeed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a277d5a506700e484d4a86c7c27ac7f446c36f46/996_370_2316_1390/master/2316.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8abc8789c761d321b859cec40de61fa","title":"carlos ghosn prepares to speak as japan comes to terms with saviour who fled","story":"Wife dismisses reports husband escaped inside an instrument case as world awaits full explanation from fugitiveThe world will have to wait until next week for what could be the only definitive account of how Carlos Ghosn managed to leave Japan months before he was due to stand trial for alleged financial misconduct.The former Nissan chairman who fled the country to Lebanon while out on bail, will speak to the media in Beirut next Wednesday, media reports said, in a public appearance that could provide answers to myriad questions swirling around his daring escape.Few countries will be monitoring Ghosn’s comments more closely than Japan, where his work to turn around Nissan earned him something of a saviour image. The official response in Japan has been a mixture of condemnation – including by his own lawyers – and disbelief that a high-profile suspect under strictly monitored house arrest could have fled overseas, apparently without a passport.Ghosn was carrying one of his two French passports when he left Japan, according to a Japanese media report. Public broadcaster NHK said the court had allowed him to keep a second French passport as long as it was kept “in a locked case” with the key held by his lawyers.The most widely circulated account of his escape – that he was carried out of his Tokyo residence in a wooden case for a musical instrument and spirited out of the country on a private jet from Kansai International airport in western Japan – has been challenged by Carole Ghosn.She described the account as “fiction” on Wednesday, but declined to provide details of her husband’s exit.Japan’s government has yet to publicly comment on Ghosn’s escape, news of which broke as millions of people left Tokyo and other major cities to spend the New Year holidays in their home towns.“When I saw the news I thought, if you have the money you can do anything you like,” said Chiaki Kurimoto, a part-time worker in Osaka . “It’s just like a spy movie. I still can’t come to terms with how he managed to get out of Japan like that. He made the security authorities look silly.“I’d been following Ghosn’s struggle with his former Nissan colleagues and was looking forward to seeing how it played out, but his escape means the story has ended prematurely.”Rui Morimoto, a 20-year-old university student, said he was disappointed that the man credited with rescuing Nissan from near-bankruptcy two decades ago had decided to flee. “Ghosn said he had done nothing wrong and was seen as a business hero, so he should have taken on his accusers fair and square in court.”While some sections of the Japanese media had expressed sympathy with Ghosn over his long detention before he was released on bail for a second time last year, newspapers were united in their condemnation of the former auto executive’s latest actions.“Running away is a cowardly act that mocks Japan’s justice system,” said the conservative Yomiuri Shimbun – a sentiment shared by the liberal Tokyo Shimbun.Masahisa Sato, an MP from the ruling Liberal Democratic party, described Ghosn’s actions as “an illegal departure and an escape, and this itself is a crime. Was there help extended by an unnamed country? It is also a serious problem that Japan’s system allowed an illegal departure so easily.”The filmmaker Kazuhiro Soda acknowledged that Ghosn had broken the law by skipping bail, but said in a tweet: “Many people are reluctant to blame him, probably because the arbitrary and unfair application of the law under the Abe administration has become a norm.” Soda added the episode was proof that the rule of law in Japan “is in crisis”.Masaru Kaneko, an emeritus professor at Keio University, suggested double standards had been at work in Ghosn’s treatment, contrasting his arrest and long detention with the decision not to take action against Noriyuki Yamaguchi, a high-profile TV journalist who is close to Abe’s administration, over allegations that he raped reporter Shiori Ito. Yamaguchi has consistently denied the allegations, although Ito won damages in a civil lawsuit last month.Reuters quoted two sources close to Ghosn as saying the 65-year-old had met Lebanon’s president, Michel Aoun, soon after his arrival in the country and was in a “buoyant and combative” mood. The agency repeated claims made by the Wall Street Journal that the plan to get Ghosn out of Japan had been three months in the making.“It was a very professional operation from start to finish,” one of the sources said, adding that Ghosn had thanked Aoun for the support he had given him and his wife Carole while he was in detention.It is unclear how much Ghosn, who has remained silent since releasing a statement on New Year’s Eve, will reveal when he speaks to the media on 8 January, a year to the day since he proclaimed his innocence in his first public appearance since his arrest in November 2018.He is likely to be come under pressure to offer a full account of the circumstances behind his arrival in Lebanon on Monday morning, but is reportedly unwilling to share details of his escape to protect people who helped him in Japan.Ghosn, who is of Lebanese origin and holds French, Lebanese and Brazilian passports, insisted in the statement he had not fled justice after being charged with underreporting his income, transferring Nissan funds to an account in which he had an interest and other charges for which he faced up to 15 years in prison.“I am now in Lebanon and will no longer be held hostage by a rigged Japanese justice system where guilt is presumed, discrimination is rampant, and basic human rights are denied, in flagrant disregard of Japan’s legal obligations under international law and treaties it is bound to uphold,” the statement said."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"\u0026lsquoWithout continuous developments and insights from basic research, applied research may eventually wither away\u0026rsquoMoving from Catholic maintained to integrated status may be key to keeping doors openVivian Geiran says he is also concerned at the rise in short prison terms being handed downParty proposal amounts to charge on where property is located, rather than on the building itselfThe two men are being sought for interview by UK police over deaths of 39 peopleProposals for project include closure of level crossing at notorious traffic bottleneckNegotiations to begin at Stormont in effort to reach accord and avert Assembly electionsNew master of maternity hospital believes move will not happen in his seven-year termAlmost 150 unlicensed boards seized since new regulations and fee introducedINMO says 2019 was the worst year on record for overcrowding in hospitalsDriver of other car and two teenage passengers taken to hospital for treatmentVaradkar and Coveney promise \u0026lsquorecord high\u0026rsquo employment and 11,000 social housing unitsGirl weighing 3.23kgs born at 12 minutes past midnight, mother and baby doing wellSimon Harris \u0026lsquoappalled\u0026rsquo by protest by 100 people outside National Maternity HospitalSite manager new war exhibition behind former Cork prison\u0026rsquos rising popularityFear of immigrants can be exploited in terms to support narrow populism says archbishopGroup fires volley from Wexford lighthouse in tradition dating back 300 yearsWoman had tugged pontiff\u0026rsquos arm during a walkabout in VaticanBail granted before Christmas but issues with raising cash delayed releaseDublin Castle service to remember those killed in the War of Independence"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4128385.1577904478!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"two weeks for ni parties to clinch deal on devolved government","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNorthern Ireland has been without a powersharing government at Stormont since January 2017. Talks aimed at restoring Northern Ireland’s devolved government are to resume at Stormont on Thursday with less than two weeks for the parties to reach a deal or face fresh Assembly elections. Each of Northern Ireland’s five main parties will participate in bilateral discussions with the Northern Ireland Secretary of State Julian Smith and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Mr Coveney travelled to Belfast on Wednesday for a meeting with Mr Smith ahead of the resumption of formal discussions. He also held informal meetings with several of the North’s political parties. Mr Coveney said on social media that this year could be “a new beginning for politics in NI with leadership and generosity from all sides”. In a New Year’s Day video posted by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Mr Coveney said that “we are determined to work with all of the parties in Northern Ireland to get the devolved government back up and running again, to get the institutions of the Good Friday agreement functioning again, to bring communities together and to ensure that Northern Ireland can make decisions for itself”. Northern Ireland has been without a powersharing government at Stormont since January 2017, when the Assembly collapsed following a controversy over a botched renewable heating scheme. The legislation which gives civil servants the power to keep Northern Ireland running in the absence of a devolved government expires on January 13th. Mr Smith has said the parties must reach a deal by then or he will call an election. The latest round of talks on restoring Stormont ended without agreement before Christmas, with both Mr Coveney and Mr Smith blaming the DUP for scuppering the chances of a deal, a charge the DUP “flatly rejected”. What are the stumbling blocks?The outstanding issues are said by all parties to be “on the margins”, and relate to matters such as an Irish language Act, the sustainability of any reformed Stormont, and reform of the petition of concern – a vetoing system that allows parties which have 30 signatures to block motions even if these motions have majority support.DUP leader Arlene Foster said that as the talks recommence “we will be there and stand ready to restore devolution through a fair and balanced deal. A Northern Ireland that is going to keeping moving forward must be one where everyone feels at home, but must also be one where no one feels their culture is being marginalised.” Over the Christmas period each of the parties has spoken of their determination to see agreement reached and Stormont restored. Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said the outstanding issues could be resolved and “the choice is now for agreement, or elections. But the current situation cannot continue.” In his homily on New Year’s Day, Bishop of Down and Connor Noel Treanor said: “We await and expect in the coming days what Pope Francis’s message describes as a renewal of political will, so that new ways can be found to reconcile and unite iniduals and communities.” "},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Smoke from Australia\u0026#39s bushfires shrowds New Zealand as glaciers turn brownSurge in drugs dispensed to Scots suffering from Parkinson\u0026#39sAustralian bushfires: The numbers that highlight sheer scale of unfolding catastropheAustralia bushfires: Get out now, tourists told, as warning triggers exodus ahead of state of emergencyKeir Starmer is clear Labour leadership favourite, according to poll of membersMPs question Labour Deputy leader candidate\u0026#39s suitability to hold high office after claiming \u0026#39Zionism is the enemy of peace\u0026#39Three British Airways cabin crew die in New Year\u0026#39s Eve car crashNumber of children taken out of school for term time holidays soarsCheaper flexible fares to be trialed for part-time workers, Government announces Eating disorders soaring amid warnings over impact of social media Army chiefs say controversial  \u0026#39snowflake\u0026#39 recruitment campaign was most successful in a decade as new series is launchedNHS slimming classes see 90,000 Britons lose average of five pounds Season tickets to increase by up to £200 for strike-hit South Western Railways passengers, watchdog figures revealMan in custody on suspicion of double murder after New Year\u0026#39s Day attackSebastian Kurz agrees coalition with Greens after breakthrough talksQuest for the perfect smile is putting Instagram generation at risk Priti Patel is to examine ways of deporting illegal migrants more quickly and in greater numbers Up to 40 per cent of crown courts stand idle as crime rises, new figures revealComment: A united Britain will have the upper hand over a ided and declining European UnionWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/12/28/TELEMMGLPICT000219930201_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqNdHjho4yuasGnqh3Gh7sI_TwTgkHysXt0p2zeRK5KVw.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"putin 20 russias younger generation have lost capacity imagine","story":"Still strong: Vladimir Putin delivers a speech during a rally marking the fourth anniversary of Russia\u0026#39s annexation of the Crimea region in Moscow.

We all know the fatalistic logic: the real power lies with the governments of countries such as China, or with the banks that fund the oil industry. What can you or I really achieve with our reusable coffee cups and vegan sausage rolls, other than occupying a rather smug patch of moral high ground, or worse still, creating a comforting illusion that masks the real problem?But there is another point of view. If we take the climate crisis seriously, how can we not want to try, even in some small way, to be part of the solution? Can we really expect the countries and companies that produce the most carbon to change if we don’t show willing to make some small sacrifice in our own lives? And if we all do something, won’t governments and corporations be encouraged to reflect the wishes of the people, even if they are motivated just by winning our votes and taking our money?I’ve sensed this urge to do something while speaking to colleagues recently. And it’s the desire to contribute that has prompted us to create this series of blogs, under the banner “20 Pledges for 2020”. It started on the Lifestyle desk. Did I know, asked one of our staff, that our deputy travel editor was going flight-free for a year? For someone who must receive more invitations for all-expenses-paid trips to the sun than anyone I can name, this was no casual commitment. Then I heard there was a colleague who’s going vegan, and another determined to switch to an electric car. And so the list went on.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWe’re not immune to the bigger challenges and responsibilities of the media. During our recent coverage of the UK general election, we set out to make climate the most important theme for our coverage. Looking back, we led our site and our Daily Edition app on climate issues more than any other major British publisher over the same period – no small achievement – but I can’t say we managed to make it our number-one subject it was perhaps inevitable that the NHS and Brexit dominated the political agenda even on our pages. So one of the blogs you’ll see starting over the next few weeks will be from our politics team, pledging to hold politicians to account over the climate.As for me, I’ll be blogging about how The Independent can use its reach and influence to help fight the climate crisis. This was a challenge set for me directly by our environment columnist Donnachadh McCarthy, who is also part of the media team of Extinction Rebellion. I had always been confident that The Independent was not part of the problem. I’m proud to have worked here at the time when Michael McCarthy, our former environment editor, and the late Steve Connor, our science editor, helped to blaze a trail with their reporting and analysis. The natural world was not always such a fashionable cause back then, but you knew they were on to something from the level of pushback we received – even if sometimes it was impossible not to chuckle along.Created with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

It’s not like we’re The Independent, we can’t just stick a headline saying ‘Cruelty’ and then stick a picture of a dolphin or a whale underneath it. I mean, that’s just cheating, that’s rubbish.” (With apologies to real fans, I’ve filtered out the fruitier adjectives.) It’s amazing to think how recently such large parts of the media were sceptical towards “climate zealots”, and still are.But Donnachadh put a challenge to me a few months ago: when you look at the Indy, is it really clear that we’re living through a crisis? Couldn’t we be doing more? He was right, of course, and we will do more, so I’ll be blogging to keep you up to date with the changes we’re making.There are three phases to climate journalism as far as I can see. First, journalists had a job to do to convince sceptics that the science is right: mankind’s use of fossil fuels is heating our planet. Then there was the second phase: how fast was the world warming, can we limit the rise to 1.5 degrees, 3 degrees, or more? That’s still a crucial debate, and a subject we will continue to track. But the 20 Pledges blogs belong to a third phase: what exactly are we going to do about it – from government policy, financial regulation and international treaties to our own compromises and choices?Before someone helpfully points out the obvious, I realise that none of us writing these blogs is perfect. I’ll start by holding my hand up: for one thing, I fly from our London office to see our US-based staff, just as our reporters often take flights to report on stories around the world, so I’ll be writing more about that in a future blog post.But this project is not about pretending to be perfect, or virtue-signalling, or being diabolically hypocritical, and we certainly aren’t setting out to preach (there’s enough climate puritanism online already). If, or when, we slip up along the way – when the trip to review a new hotel is too tempting, if the smell of a bacon sandwich catches us at a moment of weakness – we’ll write about those times too. So what are we hoping for? We hope it gives us a richer perspective on some of the more important climate stories we cover in 2020, and that by sharing our own experiences we might encourage others to share theirs too. We’ll try to use our voice to encourage change from governments too.You may want to make a pledge yourself and write a blog through the year about it with us, in which case please do get in touch. You can email all of us writing these blogs at 20pledges@, and you’ll find all the blogs, running through the year, appearing at www.news20-pledges.Your pledge may not exactly change the world by itself, but if you share your story, you never know whose mind you might change along the way.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That means no popping into M\u0026ampS for a multipack of pants. No rummaging through Primark for sale socks. And certainly no scrambling through Topshop for a last-minute party dress.\u0026nbspI write about fashion as part of my job, so I\u0027m constantly keeping an eye on new boutique brands and emerging designers, who, in all honesty, I\u0027d rather give my money to than high-street brands. Not just because it supports new talent, but because the clothes tend to be more innovative and you\u0027re less likely to show up somewhere wearing the same damn polka dot dress as every other woman there. When I first announced to my friends that I’d be giving up fast fashion, they didn’t even flinch, saying: “You think you’re too cool to shop on the high street anyway.”\u0026nbsp That said, there can be no denying that your money goes further on the high street. So I love the odd haul at Zara, H\u0026ampM, or \u0026amp Other Stories that usually happens after I’ve walked past and been seduced by something in the window. And while I’d rather source my clothes from unique second-hand shops I’ve visited on trips abroad, or designer-loaded charity shops in wealthy areas of London – there are still plenty of occasions where I have to hit the high street to get what I need because of some kind of urgent wardrobe-related mishap, like a broken zip or ripped trousers.\u0026nbspThere’s also my occasional splurging habit to consider. Occasionally I save up to buy a special piece from one of my favourite (more expensive) brands: Ganni, Rixo, APC… In my head, these are more eco-friendly purchases simply because they cost more and I’ll keep them for longer. But my logic – that more money automatically means more sustainable – is obviously flawed and based on, well, nothing.\u0026nbsp I have no idea if these purchases count as fast fashion or not because I’ve never bothered to ask. Now I will have to.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesCreated with Sketch.The best dresses of the decade Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Actor Saoirse Ronan was a delight to watch in Greta Gerwig\u0027s Oscar-nominated debut, and while there were many notable outfits throughout the 2002-based film, this one remains the most meaningful. Towards the end of the film, Lady Bird goes prom dress shopping with her mum in a scene that sees their fraught relationship come to a head when Lady Bird asks “I just wish... I wish that you liked me”. Finally, she tries on this pink sparkly gown but her mother, Marion asks, “Is it too pink?” The girlish tulle gown with full skirt is reminiscent of the one worn by Molly Ringwald in the cult 1980s coming of age film, Pretty in Pink, worn as a feminist statement. OPPaul Thomas Anderson’s 2018 film Phantom Thread, centres on fictional fashion designer Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his love affair with waitress Alma (Vicky Krieps).SYYes, you read that right. Balloon dresses. Jaws literally dropped when Central Saint Martins graduate sent models down the runway in balloon concubines that the models then popped, causing the outfits to slowly slide down onto the model\u0027s bodies, eventually becoming dresses. We\u0027re still not sure how he did it either, but the dresses sparked a frenzy on social media, with editors and fashion insiders all regaling at Tjaerands\u0027 sheer creativity. OP450 47 - Moneypenny\u0027s gown in Skyfall, Amanda Wakeley, 2012In what is unquestionably one of the most glamorous on-screen gowns of the decade, Naomie Harris turned about a thousand heads in this gold Amanda Wakeley gown. The column-shaped, one-shouldered dress features three straps and was constructed with fabric that fanned out from the waist to reveal folds and cuts like a sunray, twisting around Harris\u0027 torso and elevating the power and authority of her character, who remains one of the most memorable “Bond Girls” of all time. OP550 46 - Suzy Bishop\u0027s pink dress in Moonrise Kingdom, 2012This dress in Wes Anderson\u0027s 2012 Moonrise Kingdom embodies all the childhood innocence and nostalgia that defines the film. From its bubblegum-coloured hue and its Peter Pan collar to the Sixties A-line cut and the knee-high socks it\u0027s worn with, this dress was one of the best costumes in cinema from the last decade. No, it wasn\u0027t grand. And it certainly didn\u0027t look expensive, either. But, like the film itself, the dress is an homage to childlike nativity and it couldn\u0027t have been more appropriate. OPFor springsummer 2020, Rodarte designers Laura and Kate Mulleavy shunned a traditional runway show and instead chose to present their latest collection via a series of ethereal portraits.SYWhen Adut Akech stepped on stage to collect the award for 2019\u0027s model of the year, she received a standing ovation. The accolade marked a major step for the fashion industry in terms of ersity, which Akech spoke about in her rousing acceptance speech. This is for the young women and men who found representation and validation in my work, she told the crowd of designers and celebrities. I want them to never be afraid of dreaming big like I once did. Her words were bolstered by the boldness of her gown on the night: an emerald green, Christmas tree-esque Valentino gown with a bow for a bodice and a thigh-high slit. It was power personified. OPFor his 2012 adaptation of Leo Tolstoy classic Anna Karenina, director Joe Wright asked costume designer Jacqueline Durran to ensure that the leading lady (played by Keira Knightley) be dressed in costumes in the style of 1950s couture, despite the story’s 19th-century setting.SYAs a frequent front runner on the red carpet, it comes as no surprise that Janelle Monáe arrived at the 2019 Met Gala with one of the evening\u0027s best looks.SYGetty Images for The Met MuseumRodarte tutus played a starring role in the acclaimed thriller in which Natalie Portman plays a ballerina who slowly finds herself slipping into madness while practicing for a performance of Black Swan. The black tutu, worn when Portman\u0027s character dramatically casts off her innocent facade and embraces her dark side as she transforms into the Black Swan, was worn with bold feathering eye make-up, bloodshot eyes and a dark red lip. There was a scandal surrounding the dress, too. Given that neither Kate nor Laura Mulleavy (the designers at Rodarte) were part of the Costume Designers Guild, they weren\u0027t eligible for an Oscar for best costume for their work on the film. This later prompted the film\u0027s chief designer, Amy Wetcott, to respond publicly by saying the designers\u0027 involvement with the tutus had been exaggerated. Regardless, the film\u0027s tutus – and this one in particular – remain a significant part of the film\u0027s visuals. OPBaz Luhrmann\u0027s The Great Gatsby is a visual feast for many reasons but for fashion fans in particular, it is the film’s costumes that really capture the hedonistic era of the 1920s.SYWhy limit your red carpet look to just one dress when you can have four? That was the thinking behind Lady Gaga\u0027s look at the 2020 Met Gala, where the singer first stepped out in a fuchsia caped gown that had a 25-foot train. Accompanied by designer Brandon Maxwell, Gaga then began to unzip the colossal dress to reveal a corseted black number beneath complete with opera gloves. After applying some lipstick in front of the cameras, the 33-year-old then unzipped again to reveal a third look: a bright pink column dress. Finally, it was time for Gaga to offer one final ensemble: a black crystal bra with matching knickers and fishnet tights. Paired with her doll-like make-up and platinum hair, Gaga\u0027s four looks perfectly captured the playful spirit of the camp-themed event. OPWhen Priyanka Chopra married Nick Jonas in early December 2018, the pair paid tribute to the heritages of their families by having both Christian and Hindu ceremonies to mark the occasion.SYJared Leto, holding a model of his own head while clad in blood red robes on the 2020 Met Gala pink carpet, was quite a striking image. The gown was designed by Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele who showed similar looks at his autumnwinter 2018 show, sending each of the models down the runway with a fake severed head. According to Michele, each head took roughly six months to make. We are the Doctor Frankenstein of our lives, Michele told British Vogue at the time. OPGetty Images for The Met Museum1550 36 - Sansa Stark\u0027s armour dress, Game of Thrones, 2019For the final episode of Game of Thrones, the character of Sansa Stark, played by Sophie Turner, wore a dress that symbolised the journey she had been on to become Queen of the North.SYRihanna\u0027s outfit at the 2018 Met Gala where the theme was Heavenly Bodies: Fashion \u0026amp The Catholic Imagination, is not one anybody is likely to forget any time soon. Given that RiRi had modeled her look on the Pope, the highest member of the Catholic church, some people accused her of religious appropriation and said the look was disrespectful and sexualised Catholicism. OP1750 34 - Jemima Kirke and Lena Dunham\u0027s Met Gala dresses, Christopher Kane, 2019The famous friends put the sisterhood front and centre with their co-coordinating Met Gala looks designed by Christopher Kane. Both were apt ensembles for the event\u0027s camp theme, though they were apparently rather difficult to get into, with both women reportedly having to use lubricant in order to put on the latex dresses. While the dresses were created especially for the actors, the looks reflected the playful eroticism in his autumnlwinter 2019 collection. OPGetty Images for The Met MuseumWhen it comes to making an entrance, Celine Dion knows what she\u0027s doing. Zeigfeld Girl.SYIn recent years, actor Lupita Nyong\u0027o has become one to watch on the red carpet, delivering several impressive looks throughout awards season.SYLily Rose Depp, the daughter of of Johnny Depp and Vanessa Paradis, enjoyed her second stint as a Chanel runway model in 2017, closing the fashion house’s Spring Haute Couture show. As is customary with any Chanel couture show, the final look was a bridal gown. For the showstopping moment, the 17-year-old was dressed in a ruffled blush pink gown featuring a voluminous skirt and sleeves with a corseted bodice, a Peter Pan collar and a large belt. SYSimple, playful and vintage Keira Knightley\u0027s wedding dress was famed for its understated elegance. Yes, it was Chanel couture (springsummer 2006), but unlike most celebrity wedding gowns, this one was unfussy, featuring a simple pale grey hue, a ruched strapless bodice, and a hemline that skimmed the knees as opposed to the traditional sweeping train. The gown matched the occasion, with Knightley and husband James Righton reportedly tying the knot in front of a small group of close friends and family in the south of France. Proving herself to be a supporter of sustainable fashion, Knightley even re-wore the dress (as seen here) to an charity event in London just a few months later. OP With a wardrobe consisting of printed playsuits and bleached denim, Eleven from hit sci-fi show Stranger Things became somewhat of a fashion icon as soon as the first series hit our TV screens. Stranger Things images shot up 40 times in the months following the launch of the first season, and while Eleven\u0027s pink frock has proved popular, global search platform Lyst has also witnessed a surge in searches for trucker caps and Eighties printed T-shirts inspired by characters Dustin and Chief Hopper, showing the all-round fashion clout of the show. SYActor Elle Fanning made waves with her style throughout the Cannes Film Festival but it was this 1940s-inspired look she wore to the Once Upon a Time In… Hollywood premiere that made headlines.SYWho could forget that fateful moment when Jennifer Lawrence – then at the early stages of her career – tripped and fell because of the cut of her dress as she went to collect her Academy Award for best actress for her role in Silver Linings Playbook ? Lawrence took it in her stride and got herself up before making light of the moment in her speech. The dress she wore has become instantly recognisable thanks to this moment. Strapless, fitted and with a voluminous skirt, the Dior gown suited the occasion perfectly and made Lawrence\u0027s fall one of the most graceful in history. OP2550 26 - Kendall and Kylie Jenner’s Met Gala dresses, Versace, 2019Kendall and Kylie Jenner made the grandest of entrances to the 2019 Met Gala, coordinating in bright feathered dresses. Kendall opted for a show girl-inspired bright orange feathered dress, while Kylie chose a lavender feathered gown and matching wig. Social media users instantly made plenty of comparisons to the Jenners\u0027 looks including Scooby Doo\u0027s Velma and Daphne, the sisters from Ella Enchanted, and the twins from White Chicks. On the carpet, Kendall said she and Kylie really “went for it” and designed their outfits with Donatella Versace. SYGetty Images for The Met MuseumWhen Pippa Middleton walked towards Westminster Abbey behind her sister on the 29 April 2011, few could have predicted the impact her gown would have on the world. Kate might have been the one getting married that day, but Pippa\u0027s name was in almost as many headlines thanks to the way that cowl neck ivory gown hugged her figure. Unfortunately, while many praised Sarah Burton\u0027s flawless design which had 58 buttons down the back, the moment led to an unsavoury amount of sexist commentary, with many people focusing on Middleton\u0027s body over everything else and lauding her as a sex symbol. But Pippa was able to make light of the scenario when, a few years after the wedding, she teased in an interview with the Daily Mirror that the dress fit “a little too well”. OPWhile Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u0027s red carpet choices are always commendable (she favours cult womenswear label Galvan and their signature jumpsuits), this one is her most famous thanks to a viral photograph of the Fleabag creator sat in a throne-like chair at an Emmys after party, cocktail in one hand, cigarette in the other and surrounded by her four statuettes. The photo was hailed as epitomising old school Hollywood glamour and feminist empowerment, earning Waller-Bridge\u0027s sequin covered gown much praise and adulation online. OPPrincess Eugenie married Jack Brooksbank on 12 October 2018.SYSerena Williams made it clear during her first match at the US Open that she would not let organisers dictate what she wears on the court.SYDuring the summer of 2019, it was almost impossible to set foot outside or scroll through Instagram without spotting Zara’s now-iconic black and white polka dot dress. The humble “printed dress”, as it’s called on the retailer’s website, costs just £39.99 and has been spotted on dance floors, in festivals and at several wedding receptions. Some women even got married in the dress. The retailer has since made it available in other colour ranges, including olive green, black and deep red.OPThe hit heist film American Hustle was set in New Jersey in 1978. While the male cast revived some serious crimes against fashion, from boxy suits to micro perms, the movie’s female stars, Jennifer Lawrence and Amy Adams lucked out.SYIf anyone is going make a sartorial statement on their wedding day, you could always count on Kate Moss. For her nuptials to Jamie Hince in 2014, the British model wore a custom John Galliano gown with sheer detailing and a floral sequin skirt. According to Galliano, the dress was inspired by Zelda Fitzgerald, the troubled wife of The Great Gatsby author F. Scott Fitzgerald. While the marriage might not have lasted – Moss and Hince split in 2016 – the impact of the model\u0027s stellar gown will certainly stand the test of time. OPWith the theme of “Camp”, this year’s Met Gala was always going to be one of the best for red carpet ensembles.American Vogue: “He envisioned me this California girl stepping out of the ocean, wet, dripping”. The reality star later revealed that the corset she wore under the dress was so tight she had to take corset-breathing lessons and struggled to sit down the entire night. SYGetty Images for The Met MuseumIn 2016 supermodel Bella Hadid attended the Cannes Film Festival wearing an Alexandre Vauthier gown that featured a slit that went above the thigh. The look prompted hundreds of headlines around the world and instantly became one of Hadid’s most memorable in addition to firmly heralding her arrival into the fashion industry. OPFor Bill Condon’s live-action remake of Beauty and the Beast, the director enlisted the help of Academy Award-winning costume designer Jacqueline Durran to create Belle\u0027s (Emma Watson) famous yellow gown. The dress itself featured multiple layers of yolk yellow-dyed organza and 2,160 Swarovski crystals and it took a team of seamstresses more than 12,000 hours to make. The significance of Watson’s gown was bolstered by the fact that it lit up our screens a mere two months after Emma Stone’s similarly sunshine yellow gown did the same in La La Land. Yellow went on to reign as the colour of the season that year and was soon dubbed the next millennial pink, earning the nickname “Gen Z yellow”. OPOPIf Instagram had a fling with a tutu, their child would look something like Viktor \u0026amp Rolf’s slogan dresses. With messages like “I\u0027m not shy, I just don\u0027t like you,” “Sorry I\u0027m late, I didn\u0027t want to come,” and “NO,” these voluminous tulle gowns made quite the statement when they graced the runway at Paris Couture Week in January. Not only did it suddenly seem like all our darkest and most millennial thoughts were suddenly displayed on gargantuan tutus, but said tutus went on to almost break the internet with the countless memes they prompted. People shared the photos in WhatsApp groups, tagged themselves on social media, and captioned them with things like ”Mood”. OPFor the 2019 Grammy Awards, rapper Cardi B arrived on the red carpet wearing a look straight out of a Botticelli painting. The Little Mermaid. SYIn 2012, Angelina Jolie quite literally stepped out in a black Atelier Versace gown that came with a thigh-high slit, revealing much of the actor’s leg. Jolie posed for photographers with her right leg pointed outwards, to exaggerate the slit and ensured that almost every image showed her in that pose. Showing true dedication, Jolie even maintained the pose when she presented an award on stage. The stance generated a flurry of memes and a hashtag: #AngiesRightLeg. OPDressing a First Lady for the inauguration is a momentous occasion, and one that many designers consider to be the greatest honour of their career. So, when Michelle Obama chose a relatively unknown name within the fashion sphere for the occasion, critics were taken by surprise. For her debut as First Lady, Obama chose an ivory, one-shouldered gown designed by 26-year-old Jason Wu, who was a relatively little known designer at the time. Like the rest of the world, Wu had no idea that the Obama was seriously considering wearing one of his designs and claimed that he wasn\u0027t even sure that the white chiffon dress she wore was his until the phone began to ring. “It\u0027s difficult to describe,” Wu said the following afternoon, after appearing on the morning shows. “I was over the moon. I know I am an unusual choice for a first lady.

Over the years, numerous brands have tried to copy the Versace gown but no one has managed to do it justice quite like J.Lo herself. In September 2019, the singer gave the fashion pack a dose of nostalgia at Milan Fashion Week by closing the Versace show wearing an updated version of the gown 20 years later. The crowd rose to its feet as J.Lo walked the room before linking arms with Donatella Versace for the final applause. The gown is also the reason we now have Google Images. Following Lopez’s 2000 appearance, people were so fascinated by the dress that they tried to search for photos on Google.

But Porter’s gown didn’t just defy sartorial conventions by blending a suit with a dress, it subverted gender norms and reflected a key societal shift. In the last year, we’ve seen more and more brands create unisex lines, showing that there is no such thing as dressing according to your gender and giving way for all of us to feel a little bit more liberated about the clothes we wear. Speaking about the gown to Variety, Porter described wearing it as a form of activism. “I knew that that tuxedo gown at the Oscars would create a conversation surrounding what gender means, what all these rules we put on everybody in life,” he said. “We’ve gotten past a problem with women wearing pants. When women wear pants it’s powerful. When men wear a dress it’s disgusting. We’re not doing that anymore. I’m not doing it.” OPWhile Meghan Markle opted for a white Givenchy wedding dress designed by artistic director Clare Waight Keller for her wedding ceremony, the bride turned to Stella McCartney for her reception gown.

The elegant dress drew compliments the world over and prompted many a copycat design before the actual dress itself became available to buy online for £3,500. According to McCartney, Markle chose her because she is a female British designer. I think being a woman and being a women’s woman played a part,” McCartney said.

Items photo-shopped onto the dress by social media users included pepperoni pizza and a Gregg’s sausage roll, but it was memes that reimagined RiRi’s gown as an omelette that acquired the most notoriety. To this day, you can ask anyone engaged with popular culture about the omelette dress and they will immediately know what you’re talking about.

Countless actors, presenters and nominees – including Meryl Streep, Jessica Chastain and Emma Stone – chose to wear all-black clothing in protest of sexual harassment in the entertainment industry and beyond. The move was a symbolic show of solidarity with victims of sexual harassment as part of the Time’s Up movement. Speaking about her decision to wear black to the event, Allison Brie said: I am wearing black to stand in solidarity with all of the women who have come out about being sexually harassed and abused. I\u0027m so in awe of the bravery it took for the first few to come forward. They are heroes. Out of all the women who attended the 2018 globes, just three chose not to wear black.

I wish that you liked me”. Finally, she tries on this pink sparkly gown but her mother, Marion asks, “Is it too pink?” The girlish tulle gown with full skirt is reminiscent of the one worn by Molly Ringwald in the cult 1980s coming of age film, Pretty in Pink, worn as a feminist statement.

The column-shaped, one-shouldered dress features three straps and was constructed with fabric that fanned out from the waist to reveal folds and cuts like a sunray, twisting around Harris\u0027 torso and elevating the power and authority of her character, who remains one of the most memorable “Bond Girls” of all time. OP550 46 - Suzy Bishop\u0027s pink dress in Moonrise Kingdom, 2012This dress in Wes Anderson\u0027s 2012 Moonrise Kingdom embodies all the childhood innocence and nostalgia that defines the film. From its bubblegum-coloured hue and its Peter Pan collar to the Sixties A-line cut and the knee-high socks it\u0027s worn with, this dress was one of the best costumes in cinema from the last decade. No, it wasn\u0027t grand. And it certainly didn\u0027t look expensive, either. But, like the film itself, the dress is an homage to childlike nativity and it couldn\u0027t have been more appropriate.

This is for the young women and men who found representation and validation in my work, she told the crowd of designers and celebrities. I want them to never be afraid of dreaming big like I once did. Her words were bolstered by the boldness of her gown on the night: an emerald green, Christmas tree-esque Valentino gown with a bow for a bodice and a thigh-high slit. It was power personified.

The black tutu, worn when Portman\u0027s character dramatically casts off her innocent facade and embraces her dark side as she transforms into the Black Swan, was worn with bold feathering eye make-up, bloodshot eyes and a dark red lip. There was a scandal surrounding the dress, too. Given that neither Kate nor Laura Mulleavy (the designers at Rodarte) were part of the Costume Designers Guild, they weren\u0027t eligible for an Oscar for best costume for their work on the film. This later prompted the film\u0027s chief designer, Amy Wetcott, to respond publicly by saying the designers\u0027 involvement with the tutus had been exaggerated. Regardless, the film\u0027s tutus – and this one in particular – remain a significant part of the film\u0027s visuals.

That was the thinking behind Lady Gaga\u0027s look at the 2020 Met Gala, where the singer first stepped out in a fuchsia caped gown that had a 25-foot train. Accompanied by designer Brandon Maxwell, Gaga then began to unzip the colossal dress to reveal a corseted black number beneath complete with opera gloves. After applying some lipstick in front of the cameras, the 33-year-old then unzipped again to reveal a third look: a bright pink column dress. Finally, it was time for Gaga to offer one final ensemble: a black crystal bra with matching knickers and fishnet tights. Paired with her doll-like make-up and platinum hair, Gaga\u0027s four looks perfectly captured the playful spirit of the camp-themed event.

SYSimple, playful and vintage Keira Knightley\u0027s wedding dress was famed for its understated elegance. Yes, it was Chanel couture (springsummer 2006), but unlike most celebrity wedding gowns, this one was unfussy, featuring a simple pale grey hue, a ruched strapless bodice, and a hemline that skimmed the knees as opposed to the traditional sweeping train. The gown matched the occasion, with Knightley and husband James Righton reportedly tying the knot in front of a small group of close friends and family in the south of France.

Unfortunately, while many praised Sarah Burton\u0027s flawless design which had 58 buttons down the back, the moment led to an unsavoury amount of sexist commentary, with many people focusing on Middleton\u0027s body over everything else and lauding her as a sex symbol.

I can now finally communicate freely with the media, and look forward to starting next week.”Neither Mr Ghosn’s lawyer nor a spokesperson for the Tokyo prosecutor’s office had any comment when contacted about his whereabouts.A Nissan spokesperson declined to comment.According to state media, Lebanon\u0027s General Security Directorate intelligence agency said Mr Ghosn entered the country legally and no legal measures would be taken against him.Lebanon does not have an extradition treaty with Japan, according to Japan’s justice ministry, making it unlikely that he could be forced to return to Tokyo to face trial.It was unclear how Mr Ghosn, who holds French, Brazilian and Lebanese citizenship, was able to leave Japan, where his movement and communications had been monitored to prevent him fleeing the country of tampering with evidence. His lawyer in Japanese said he retained possession of all three of Mr Ghosn\u0027s passports.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

One unidentified person told the newspaper Mr Ghosn did not believe he would get a fair trial in Japan and was “tired of being an industrial political hostage”.He is reportedly set to hold a press conference in the coming days.A Nissan source told Reuters: “I think he gave up fighting the prosecutors in court. It’s outrageous”.Mr Ghosn was arrested on 19 November, 2018, shortly after his private jet landed in Tokyo. He faces four charges – which he denies – including concealing income and enriching himself through payments to dealerships in the Middle East.Nissan sacked him as chairman after internal investigations found misconduct ranging from understating his salary while he was its chief executive, and transferring $5m (£3.8m) of company funds to an account in which he had an interest.Mr Ghosn has claimed he is the victim of a boardroom coup, accusing former Nissan colleagues of “backstabbing” and describing them as selfish rivals bent on derailing a closer alliance between the Japanese carmaker and its top shareholder Renault, of which he was also chairman.His lawyers have asked the court to dismiss all charges, accusing prosecutors of colluding with government officials and Nissan executives to oust him to block any takeover of the by Renault.The case has brought scrutiny of Japan’s criminal justice system, which allows suspects to be detained for long periods and prohibits defence lawyers from being present during interrogations that can last eight hours a day.Mr Ghosn was released from prison in March on a $9m (£6.9m) bail, among the highest ever paid in Japan, after the court rejected an appeal by prosecutors to keep him behind bars. He had since been under house arrest.France’s junior economy minister Agnes\u0026nbspPannier-Runacher\u0026nbspsaid she was “very surprised” by news of Mr\u0026nbspGhosn’s\u0026nbsparrival in Lebanon, adding she had heard of it through the media.She told broadcaster\u0026nbspBFM-TV\u0026nbsphe was “not above the laws” but was entitled to consular support from France.Brazilian-born, of Lebanese descent and a French citizen, Mr Ghosn began his career in 1978 at tyre maker Michelin. In 1996, he moved to Renault where he oversaw a turnaround at the carmaker that won him the nickname “Le Cost Killer”.After Renault sealed an alliance with Nissan in 1999, he used similar methods to revive the ailing brand, leading to business superstar status in Japan, blanket media coverage and even a manga comic book on his life.In a 2011 nationwide poll about who the Japanese would like to run their country, Mr Ghosn finished seventh – two places ahead of Barack Obama. In another survey, he was named the man Japanese women most wanted to marry.​Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In 2008 this share was just 38 per cent.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.People take part in the Loony Dook New Year\u0027s Day dip in the Firth of Forth at South Queensferry, as part of Edinburgh\u0027s Hogmanay celebrationsSurfers at Tynemouth on the north east coastDeer graze in the morning mist as cyclists ride by in Richmond Park, LondonNight sky after the sunset at Whitley Bay in NorthumberlandThe Harlequins players arrive at the stadium prior to the Gallagher Premiership Rugby Big Game 12 match between Harlequins and Leicester Tigers at Twickenahm StadiumGetty Images for HarlequinsA car drives through floodwater near Harbridge, north of Ringwood in Hampshire, after the river Avon burst its banksParticipants in the Old Surrey and West Kent Boxing Day Hunt in Chiddingstone.

I can now finally communicate freely with the media, and look forward to starting next week.”Neither Mr Ghosn’s lawyer nor a spokesperson for the Tokyo prosecutor’s office had any comment when contacted about his whereabouts.A Nissan spokesperson declined to comment.According to state media, Lebanon\u0027s General Security Directorate intelligence agency said Mr Ghosn entered the country legally and no legal measures would be taken against him.Lebanon does not have an extradition treaty with Japan, according to Japan’s justice ministry, making it unlikely that he could be forced to return to Tokyo to face trial.It was unclear how Mr Ghosn, who holds French, Brazilian and Lebanese citizenship, was able to leave Japan, where his movement and communications had been monitored to prevent him fleeing the country of tampering with evidence. His lawyer in Japanese said he retained possession of all three of Mr Ghosn\u0027s passports.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

One unidentified person told the newspaper Mr Ghosn did not believe he would get a fair trial in Japan and was “tired of being an industrial political hostage”.He is reportedly set to hold a press conference in the coming days.A Nissan source told Reuters: “I think he gave up fighting the prosecutors in court. It’s outrageous”.Mr Ghosn was arrested on 19 November, 2018, shortly after his private jet landed in Tokyo. He faces four charges – which he denies – including concealing income and enriching himself through payments to dealerships in the Middle East.Nissan sacked him as chairman after internal investigations found misconduct ranging from understating his salary while he was its chief executive, and transferring $5m (£3.8m) of company funds to an account in which he had an interest.Mr Ghosn has claimed he is the victim of a boardroom coup, accusing former Nissan colleagues of “backstabbing” and describing them as selfish rivals bent on derailing a closer alliance between the Japanese carmaker and its top shareholder Renault, of which he was also chairman.His lawyers have asked the court to dismiss all charges, accusing prosecutors of colluding with government officials and Nissan executives to oust him to block any takeover of the by Renault.The case has brought scrutiny of Japan’s criminal justice system, which allows suspects to be detained for long periods and prohibits defence lawyers from being present during interrogations that can last eight hours a day.Mr Ghosn was released from prison in March on a $9m (£6.9m) bail, among the highest ever paid in Japan, after the court rejected an appeal by prosecutors to keep him behind bars. He had since been under house arrest.France’s junior economy minister Agnes\u0026nbspPannier-Runacher\u0026nbspsaid she was “very surprised” by news of Mr\u0026nbspGhosn’s\u0026nbsparrival in Lebanon, adding she had heard of it through the media.She told broadcaster\u0026nbspBFM-TV\u0026nbsphe was “not above the laws” but was entitled to consular support from France.Brazilian-born, of Lebanese descent and a French citizen, Mr Ghosn began his career in 1978 at tyre maker Michelin. In 1996, he moved to Renault where he oversaw a turnaround at the carmaker that won him the nickname “Le Cost Killer”.After Renault sealed an alliance with Nissan in 1999, he used similar methods to revive the ailing brand, leading to business superstar status in Japan, blanket media coverage and even a manga comic book on his life.In a 2011 nationwide poll about who the Japanese would like to run their country, Mr Ghosn finished seventh – two places ahead of Barack Obama. In another survey, he was named the man Japanese women most wanted to marry.​Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It protects against non-lung forms of TB but is far less effective against TB infections of the lung, which is the major cause of illness and deaths.Researchers from the US\u0026nbspNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (Niaid) and University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, have shown changing the dose and route of administration increased the vaccine’s ability to protect\u0026nbsprhesus macaques\u0026nbspfrom infection following exposure to the TB causing bacteria.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.People take part in the Loony Dook New Year\u0027s Day dip in the Firth of Forth at South Queensferry, as part of Edinburgh\u0027s Hogmanay celebrationsSurfers at Tynemouth on the north east coastDeer graze in the morning mist as cyclists ride by in Richmond Park, LondonNight sky after the sunset at Whitley Bay in NorthumberlandThe Harlequins players arrive at the stadium prior to the Gallagher Premiership Rugby Big Game 12 match between Harlequins and Leicester Tigers at Twickenahm StadiumGetty Images for HarlequinsA car drives through floodwater near Harbridge, north of Ringwood in Hampshire, after the river Avon burst its banksParticipants in the Old Surrey and West Kent Boxing Day Hunt in Chiddingstone.

The scientists assessed the immune responses after 24 weeks and found intravenous vaccination resulted in the best protection.Six months after vaccination, the researchers exposed the animals to a virulent strain of TB-causing bacteria and tracked the animals for three months.Nine out of 10 animals vaccinated intravenously were highly protected six showed no detectable infection and three had only very low counts of bacteria in lung tissue. All unvaccinated animals and those immunised via the skin or aerosol routes showed signs of significantly greater infection.NHS to slash waiting time targets for cancer diagnosisRevealed: Dozens of hospitals ignoring NHS safety warningsStudy author JoAnne Flynn, professor of microbiology and molecular genetics at the Pittsburgh Centre\u0026nbspfor Vaccine Research, said: “The effects are amazing. When we compared the lungs of animals given the vaccine intravenously versus the standard route, we saw a 100,000-fold reduction in bacterial burden. Nine out of 10 animals showed no inflammation in their lungs.”The researchers cautioned that before the method could be used in humans further research is needed to ensure it is both safe and practical. An intravenous vaccine requires more skill to administer and carries a higher risk of infection.“We’re a long way from realising the translational potential of this work,” Ms Flynn said. “But eventually we do hope to test in humans.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In 2008 this share was just 38 per cent.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.People take part in the Loony Dook New Year\u0027s Day dip in the Firth of Forth at South Queensferry, as part of Edinburgh\u0027s Hogmanay celebrationsSurfers at Tynemouth on the north east coastDeer graze in the morning mist as cyclists ride by in Richmond Park, LondonNight sky after the sunset at Whitley Bay in NorthumberlandThe Harlequins players arrive at the stadium prior to the Gallagher Premiership Rugby Big Game 12 match between Harlequins and Leicester Tigers at Twickenahm StadiumGetty Images for HarlequinsA car drives through floodwater near Harbridge, north of Ringwood in Hampshire, after the river Avon burst its banksParticipants in the Old Surrey and West Kent Boxing Day Hunt in Chiddingstone.

The bird, floating on the seawater beneath a cliff, held a stick in its beak.It began to scratch its back with the stick – the puffin, as Ms Fayet watched, was using a tool.Ms Fayet, a puffin expert who studies how the birds migrate and feed, wrote about the crafty bird in her notebook. But she had no photo evidence of this first-of-a-kind sighting. “It was just one observation, and I was busy doing something else,” she said. As unusual as this was, Ms Fayet said, she “kind of forgot about it”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesUntil it happened again. In July 2018, Ms Fayet was studying another group of puffins at Grimsey Island in Iceland, about a thousand miles from Wales. She planted camera traps on the island and recorded “loads and loads of puffin behaviour”.Another puffin used a scratching stick. This time, the action unfolded in front of a camera: The bird spots a stick and grasps it with a cartoon-bright beak. The bird makes a burbling sound. It turns, as if to face the lens. And then it scratches its chest feathers with the stick’s pointy end.Created with Sketch.Science news in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.120 Over 400 species discovered this year by Natural History MuseumThe ancient invertabrate worm-like species rhenopyrgus viviani (pictured) is one of over 400 species previously unknown to science that were discovered by experts at the Natural History Museum this year220 Jackdaws can identify \u0027dangerous\u0027 humansJackdaws can identify “dangerous” humans from listening to each other’s warning calls, scientists say. 320 Turtle embryos influence sex by shakingThe sex of the turtle is determined by the temperatures at which they are incubated.

This was not some nesting behaviour gone awry. Puffins collect soft grass for their nests, then hurry into their burrows with beaks full of bedding. The puffin in Iceland dropped the stick after it finished scratching. Hours later, the camera recorded the stick, still discarded, on the ground.This behaviour “fits all current definitions” of tool use, said University of Oxford zoologist Alex Kacelnik, who has studied toolmaking crows and was not a member of the puffin research team.Outrage over trophy hunts to Iceland to kill puffinsMs Fayet sent the recording to her colleague Dora Biro, an animal behaviour expert at the University of Oxford. The video immediately excited Ms Biro because, as she said, “this was a puffin, this was a seabird – and tool use had never been reported in seabirds before”. Together, with their colleague Erpur Snaer Hansen, the biologists described puffin tools in a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Studying animal tools can help scientists understand the origins of our own Stone Age, which began when our ancestors picked up rocks around 2.6 million years ago. But tools wielded by beak, paw or snout are rare. Scientists have observed tool use in fewer than 1 per cent of species, which are erratically scattered among animal groups. Chimpanzees and several other primate species use tools. Yet so do sea otters, fish and even some insects, such as ants that sop up honey in spongy matter.Several bird species use tools. Crows in the Pacific, for instance, use hooked twigs to catch grubs. But back-scratching is an unusual form of tool use that the scientists called “body care”. The only other type of body care observed in wild birds, Ms Biro said, is “anting”, in which birds cover their bodies in insects. Bug juices, biologists suspect, can act as chemical defences against bird parasites or fungi.The puffin in Iceland may have been trying to rid itself of ticks. “At the time, when these observations were made, there was also a particularly high parasite load on the birds that year,” Ms Biro said. A scientist who reviewed Ms Biro and Ms Fayet’s paper suggested the stick could have had chemical properties, too. (That’s hard to say the twig was dry, and the scientists don’t know what sort of plant it was.)Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

After all, why use a stick when a beak could do? He wondered whether the irritants on the puffins could be “toxic or particularly distasteful” – like a smear of boat fuel, perhaps – “hence the birds may have wanted to avoid beak contact”. In experiments, New Caledonian crows, the grub-fishing species, will use sticks to touch objects the birds perceive as dangerous, such as rubber spiders, he said.Or, maybe, the satisfaction of an itch well-scratched is just one of those things that transcends species.University of Oxford\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Brexit doesn’t make a difference, but we do know that the criminals are using this to try to drive more business.”A joint action plan\u0026nbspsigned in January 2019 saw the UK pay £6m for increased security along the French coast, which has resulted in many more migrants intercepted by French authorities and turned back.But the number getting through has rocketed, and just 125 people who arrived in the UK by boat in the past year have been returned to the European mainland.Migrant boat arrivals to UK increase six-fold in 2019 Woman ‘thrown in jail’ while delivering gifts to migrant campsChild among 49 migrants rescued from boats crossing English Channel Pope warns migrants fleeing injustice met with ‘walls of indifference’“When this increased massively this time last year, we had the home secretary declaring a state of emergency. Now this is something that we just expect.“The numbers have increased massively in the last couple of weeks. We do normally see an increase in clandestine migration over Christmas – that’s been a pattern for decades. But this is the first time that we’ve seen this quite so dramatically in small boats.”​The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailThe perception that the sea crossing is an easier way into the UK has driven up the number of attempts, and led to some migrants making their own efforts to cross the Channel without the assistance of smugglers, said Ms Moreton.“It’s one of the more successful routes across,” she said. “The number of efforts that you have to make to cross are smaller than trying to conceal yourself in a lorry or the back of a vehicle. But it is also much, much more risky.“Until very recently\u0026nbspit’s been the purview of organised crime, these are things that people pay a lot of money to be put onto.“But as it becomes more and more successful it’s more reported in the media, we’re now starting to see people that we think are trying to do this on their own. There’s the gentleman in flippers, two in a kayak, that type of thing.”Border Force boats deployed in the Channel were there primarily to prevent loss of life\u0026nbspand did not necessarily deter would-be migrants, said Ms Moreton.“Once the vessels are in the water, it’s quite common for the migrants on it to threaten their own lives if they’re approached – particularly by a French vessel,” she said. “If they’re approached by a British vessel, they’re quite happy.“Their aim is to get to the UK, and the Border Force vessels aren’t there to deter them from setting sail, they are there to ensure that they reach the other side alive.“There are arguments around that\u0026nbspbut at sea the general rule is that life is paramount.”Ms Moreton said that those arriving by small boat have generally been coached in the stories they should provide to enhance their chances of successfully claiming asylum.But almost half of those intercepted already have asylum claims in other EU countries, which can be traced by fingerprints.While there have been prosecutions for people smuggling in the French courts\u0026nbspthey have not been enough to prevent the trade, she said.The joint action plan agreed with France in January 2019 included more than £6m of British investment in security equipment, CCTV and surveillance on the French coast.The Home Office said an “enhanced action plan” announced in October aimed to make “attempts to cross the Channel in small boats an infrequent phenomenon by spring 2020”.The government department pledged that British and French authorities would increase intelligence-sharing on smuggling gangs, and engage “directly with migrants\u0026nbspto change their behaviour and deter them from making the journey to the UK”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It took all that time as well as a variety of different investigative techniques – from the latest DNA profiling to more traditional documents – for investigators to find out his identity, and finally inform a surviving relative about what happened.The mystery over the torso began in 1979. A family who were going through Buffalo Cave in the hope of finding arrow heads came across human remains, wrapped in burlap and buried beneath the ground.

In his televised address, Aoun proposed a government that includes both technocrats and politiciansThen, in 1991, another person going through the same cave system found a mummified hand, and further searches found an arm and two legs that had also been wrapped up and put inside the cave. That was the last that investigators would find in the cave, despite intense efforts from organisations including the FBI.Scientists were able to find some information about the man whose body had been discovered, including the fact that his body could have been there for 10 or more years. Though they could tell the body had been cut apart using tools, there was no way of knowing what had killed him.Researchers then turned to DNA techniques in an attempt to find the identity of the body. Local authorities sought the help of the DNA Doe Project, which seeks to use scientific testing to find the identity of remains so they can be returned to their families.Man executed 13 years ago may be proven innocent by DNAThat turned up much more information about the man, including that his relatives arrived in Utah with\u0026nbspthe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. His probably grandfather had four wives, and so the man had a vast number of relatives, researcher\u0026nbspLee Bingham Redgrave told the Associated Press.By searching through a variety of candidates – and discovering a number of strange facts, such as the fact that a grave belonging to\u0026nbspJoseph Henry Loveless didn\u0027t actually include his body – researchers were able to find their candidate. They discovered through archive research that he was accused of killing his second wife, and that though he was sent to prison for the crime he was experienced at breaking out of jail, and did.Investigators think he died soon after breaking out, in 1916. They still don\u0027t know how, or why his body came to be placed in the cave, but hope that keeping the case open could lead to further clues about what happened to him.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It also means Austria will join fellow European Union member states Sweden and Finland in having the Greens in government, albeit in a junior role, at a time of growing calls for urgent action on climate change.After a final round of coalition talks on New Year’s Day and two days of leaks of new cabinet members’ names, Mr Kurz and his Green\u0026nbspcounterpart said they had struck a deal, as widely expected. They held off, however, on providing details of their plans – those will be presented to the public on Thursday.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“We have reached an agreement,” Mr Kurz told reporters standing next to Greens leader Werner Kogler. “We succeeded in uniting the best of both worlds,” he added.The two will become chancellor and vice chancellor of the new government, and the Greens will control just four of 15 ministries, roughly reflecting their performance in the 29 September election. Mr Kurz’s People’s Party (OVP) won with 37.5 per cent of the vote while the Greens came in fourth with 13.9 per cent.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Photographer Matt Roberts reacts to seeing his sister\u0027s house destroyed by a bushfire in Quaama, New South Wales, AustraliaA man rides a donkey cart against the last setting sun of 2019 in Lahore, PakistanA Skycrane drops water on a bushfire in Bundoora, Melbourne, Australia.

The previous night, street protests erupted across Lebanon after President Michel Aoun defended the role of his allies, the Shiite movement Hezbollah, in Lebanon\u0027s government, cutting off several major roads. In his televised address, Aoun proposed a government that includes both technocrats and politicians“It is possible to reduce the tax burden and to ecologise the tax system,” Mr Kurz said, referring to core campaign pledges of each party and hinting at the deal’s contents. The Greens said they wanted an investment package in environmental measures and to make products that damage the environment more expensive.For the Greens, many of whose supporters viscerally oppose Mr Kurz and his trademark hardline on immigration, going into government with him was a tradeoff between the compromises of power politics and the chance to shape policy after campaigning for rapid action on climate change.Sebastian Kurz declares victory in Austrian electionWhether their coalition can hold for five years will depend on whether the Greens can show they have obtained concrete results in at least some key areas. They will control a sprawling ministry covering the environment, transport, infrastructure and energy, officials say.“On climate change we have possibly agreed on more than we could have imagined beforehand,” Mr Kogler said. “Austria should become a European and international leader on climate change issues. More on that tomorrow.”For Mr Kurz, regaining the reins of power is also a chance to soften his image after 17 months in coalition with a far-right group that shared his views on immigration but was also prone to antisemitic and xenophobic scandals. Immigration is likely to remain a point of friction with the left-wing Greens.Allying with the Greens, who campaigned on “clean environment, clean politics”, is also a chance to turn the page on his association with the Freedom Party (FPO). Their coalition collapsed in May after FPO leader Heinz-Christian Strache was caught in a video sting offering to fix state contracts.Mr Kurz’s party will control the finance, interior, defence and foreign ministries, with Mr Kurz appointing party loyalists such as Vienna OVP chief Gernot Bluemel as finance minister and OVP Chairman Karl Nehammer as interior minister. Neither has a wealth of experience related to their future portfolio.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He arrived with his mother and father and his eight brothers and sisters after two days of walking. He recalls seeing many dead bodies lining the sides of the tracks that led to Uganda’s northern border. The family were fearful of abduction by rebel groups or becoming caught in crossfire between the government and militia groups. David enjoyed school immensely in South Sudan but said his school had closed due to conflict. He attends Alaba School at Bidi Bidi Refugee Settlement. David dreams of a better life for his family.Sarah, 14, arrived to Kigeme refugee camp from DRC in 2012. Her parents, now unemployed in Rwanda, worked as rag traders. They made the decision to flee the fighting for the safety and relative calm of Rwanda. They were made to feel very welcome by the host community. Sarah is enrolled in class, three years behind where she should be, due to conflict, and she really enjoys her schooling. GS Gasaka school, run by Education Above All Foundation and UNHCR, is providing her the environment to allow her to dream one day of becoming an accountant so she can help her family live a better life.Nakato 19, was born and raised in Yumbe, Uganda. A graduate from Aruma High School, she has aspirations of becoming a journalist. She is actively involved in a movement called “Raise up and Talk” to help empower the younger generation to share their experiences and stories as a form of therapy, to help process the trauma from a life in conflict. Forestal, nine, is in second grade at Marescot School, Haiti. The school is funded through the partnership between non-profit buildOn Haiti, and Educate A Child (EAC), who have constructed 58 schools, as well as training 959 teachers. Forestal explains how she was given up by her father after the death of her mother. She now lives with her auntie as a “restavek” (child in domestic servitude) where she performs chores around the house for at least two hours a day including laundry, sweeping and mopping floors. She can only recall seeing her father once in her entire life. “It was only for one day, but it was really great, we had so much fun,” she says. Forestal hopes that she can see him again – but he lives and works in Port Au Prince, more than three hours away by car.Furaha, six, attends Buremba Primary School. She is a member of the Batwa “Pygmy” tribe, forced out of their native home in the Bwindi Forest to make way for a national park protected as a Unesco World Heritage Site. She lives in Kitahurira settlement camp, about 2.5km and a three-hour walk from her school. The construction of schools and training of teachers in remote areas of challenging geography ensures those hardest to reach have a right to education. Building Tomorrow Uganda through its partnership with Education Above All Foundation has enrolled 53,373 out-of-school children back into quality primary education in Uganda.Niyosenga,12, arrived from Kiyiri, DRC, in 2016. Her mother was killed in the fierce fighting which swept through towns and villages. She made the journey with her father and grandmother to the relative safe haven of Uganda to join the 1.2 million refugees. Niyosenga remained out of education in DRC until the age of nine as the long walk to school was too dangerous with roads closed by police or rebel militia.To help pay for Niyosenga’s school fees her father grows maize while her grandmother, 72, weaves baskets.Jasme, 10, is enrolled at a buildOn school in Perigny. Her two brothers and three sisters all attend the same school. Unlike the reported 300,000 restavek children that live away from their biological parents, Jasme lives with her family.Esperence, 10, goes to Perigny school. Seated on a bench at the end of a long dark corridor, overcome with emotion, he explains how he was given up by his biological parents at the age of eight. He now lives with his auntie and is a restavek child. The term restavek comes from the French rester avec, to stay with. Discussing the work around the house he has to complete as part of his daily chores, he explains: “I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs.”Yean, six, lives in Phnom Penh. Yean’s mother, a widow, feels helpless as she simply cannot earn enough to support her family. Today, Yean lives with her 80-year-old grandmother Khzm Men in Sensok 5, a settlement in the village of Kohmouta on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The settlement was relocated from one of the capital’s inner city slums areas. Yean attends public school on the periphery of the settlement but due to the informal school fees system in Cambodia, she is forced to consider dropping out due to lack of funds. Yean is desperate to continue her education to fulfil her dreams of becoming a nurse, but without assistance her dreams seem out of reach.Charles, 16, lived with his mother and father in DRC. The Marekera family were forced to leave because their son was persecuted for being an albino. His father was repeatedly beaten after refusing to sell Charles to witchdoctors, who believe teeth, fingers and eyes brought good luck to those who bought their body parts. The transition for Charles arriving in Uganda from DRC has left him with large gaps in his education. Leaving as a senior in secondary school, he now finds himself back in primary school – and facing a similar stigma as an albino in Uganda. His long walks to school are interrupted by strangers attempting to lure him away to profit from the sale of his body parts. Charles explained: “I will never feel safe, however my safety now is less important to me than getting an education. I am determined to get my diploma and have a job where I can help protect the rights of other albinos.”Athar, 21, a beneficiary of Al Fakhoora, a programme of the Education Above All Foundation, was the youngest member to join the writers’ association, aged 14. She stressed the importance of explaining what is happening to the Palestinian people. Five years ago the conflict changed her life forever. She said: “The house was full of our relatives, suddenly everything went dark. I tried to get out of the house, I felt a pain in my leg and there was so much blood. I lost consciousness and woke in the ambulance. Hospitals ran out of anaesthetic so doctors stitched injuries I sustained without it, it was incredibly painful. I heard the news that my father was killed. Losing him was incredibly difficult for me as we were so close.” As a child, Athar had dreamt of becoming a writer or a poet. She said: “My father was my inspiration, encouraging me to write, since his death I have struggled to write anything. For me education is like food or fuel, an energy that gives me power to keep going.”Moza was born and raised east of the Tigris river that ides the city of Mosul. Her parents and five siblings have lived in a two-room concrete dwelling for 10 years. Farhan, Moza’s father, works as a labourer carrying blocks on construction sites across the city. He is in need of a hernia operation, which will cost £200, and finds work extremely difficult. He can’t afford six months off work to recover. The family income is only £62 per month, which barely covers bills. They are forced to take credit from shops to be able to eat. Moza is due to enrol back into schooling. However, at present, she cares for her mother who suffers respiratory problems due to a lodged bullet in her lung after being caught in crossfire during the conflict. She doesn’t know what to expect as she has never set foot in a classroom. Two years beyond the normal enrolment age of six, she still has great dreams of working with NGOs to help residents displaced from the city.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Ali, nine, a Syrian refugee family from Deir ez-Zur district in eastern Syria arrived in Lebanon in 2011. They fled their home with several neighbours by bus toward a safer haven in Lebanon at the outbreak of civil war, which tore through their country. Heavy shelling bombarded their bus and the remainder of their journey had to be made on foot. Nine-year old Ali Ahmed’s father, an agricultural labourer explained that life in Lebanon was hard as they struggle to pay basic bills such as food and rent. As with most Syrian refugees, they are in debt to their landlords and to local shops owners. The collective family income is barely enough to cover any of their bills. Ali, one of the family’s 10 children, attends school 10km from home and dreams, one day, to be able to return home with his family to Syria.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Owen, 16, has been enrolled in Buremba Primary School since 2007 and is one of eight siblings. Now in older years at school, he must pay more money. His parents are peasant farmers and work the land digging and picking tea, this means they must work most days to be able to keep up the payments. Buremba School is one of 60 new schools constructed under the Building Tomorrow and Educate A Child programme in Uganda.Afat, 12, left his home in Deir ez-Zor, Syria six years ago, forced out by the civil war which displaced millions of people, in his case to the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. He is one of the thousands of Syrian refugee children sat in doorways of Lebanon’s many tents, shelters and makeshift homes dreaming of an education. Instead, he works 11 hours a day collecting scrap metal which he sells for around £2.50. He knows he has a right to education, but he is concerned to help provide for his family. He dreams of one day being able to return home to Syria with his family, to a better life.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added: “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Ikiriza, 5, Kamwenge District, Uganda. Ikiriza who is five years old lives in a small house with his nine brothers and sisters. His parents can’t afford school tuition fees for all the children, leaving Ikiriza with little choice but to fund his own education by working weekends carrying plastic jerry cans of water from the lake for various households of the neighbourhood in Kamwenge district. For this, he earns the equivalent of 5 US cents a day, which helps contribute towards his school fees at Bisozi Primary. He dreams of one day becoming a doctor so that he can help his father who suffers from ill health.Rami, six, lives at Beach Camp, on the sea front amongst the heart of the fishing community al-Shati in the northern Gaza Strip. Rami walks amongst the rubble of shelled buildings, a reminder of past and present conflicts. Restriction to employment and travel have meant many Palestinians are confined in Gaza. Some bright lights still shine as Rami attends grade P1 in school and dreams of becoming a footballer one day.Abdul 10, with his gaze to the floor, wrapped in blankets, huddles by the family stove. His father, Muhammad, emerges from the black of the adjoining room clutching an armful of medical documents written in French, a language he cannot read. His son is two years overdue a heart operation that would save his life. Srey, three, lives in a small dark room with her parents, siblings and relatives. A total of eight people live in a cramped, damp space in a makeshift barn of corrugated metal on the edge of the railroad tracks in the urban slums. The CYMCA Facility drop-in centre, funded in partnership between EAA and Aide et Action, provides emergency education to around 80 children in the area.Joender, six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela arrived in Ipiales, Colombia, after a 33-day journey mainly on foot. He is one of 3.5 million Venezuelan refugees that have left their homes following a catastrophic economic meltdown of his country leaving its citizens starving with no access to food, employment, medical services or education. He holds a packet of crackers, a kind donation from one of the many generous Colombians offering support to the Venezuelan people.Kennedy, 13, displaced to Uganda. He is another statistic of the 2.3 million South Sudanese refugees that fled the outbreak of civil war. Uganda alone shouldering 800,000 refugees. Kennedy was denied a normal childhood and instead became a witness to violence, torture and death in war. Not surprisingly, Kennedy’s family were unwilling to send him to school with threat of armed attack, abduction or recruitment by militias. On arrival in Uganda, Kennedy was still held back from attending school and fulfilling his dream of becoming a doctor. His parents were simply unable to afford the cost of a pair of shoes required for enrolment.“The canvas Billingham bags which carry the tools of my trade. They have sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world listening with me to every word of every story. I feel torn staring at them, joy at returning to my loved ones and the heartache of those I had to leave behind. Now they sit on the polished floor of my room, zipped up and lined up. I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away.….”David, 13, arrived in Uganda in July 2016 fleeing the civil war that broke out in South Sudan.

Not surprisingly, Kennedy’s family were unwilling to send him to school with threat of armed attack, abduction or recruitment by militias. On arrival in Uganda, Kennedy was still held back from attending school and fulfilling his dream of becoming a doctor. His parents were simply unable to afford the cost of a pair of shoes required for enrolment.“The canvas Billingham bags which carry the tools of my trade. They have sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world listening with me to every word of every story.

I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away.….”As each year draws to a close, emotions you\u0026nbsphave tried to control finally take grip. I feel torn – from the joy at returning to my\u0026nbsploved ones and the heartache for those I\u0026nbsphad to leave behind. I am staring at my canvas camera bags, which sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world.\u0026nbspNow they sit on the polished floor of my room, zipped up. I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away…Here I have compiled a collection of photographs and memories, comprising the stories of some of the most marginalised children in the world.Winter: Abdul, a Syrian refugee aged 10, is seated in a makeshift shelter, perched high among\u0026nbspthe rugged snowy mountain caps of Arsal, Lebanon. He holds his father’s hand as they both huddle\u0026nbspby the stove for warmth. He has the haunting stare of a boy who knows he is\u0026nbspgoing to die, an expression that cuts through the paraffin haze of the dark room as temperatures fall below zero. Mohammed, his father, gaunt from grief, explains\u0026nbsphis son is two years overdue for an operation that could save his life.\u0026nbspWith no means to finance it, he raises\u0026nbsphis hands to the sky in hope that his prayers would be answered.\u0026nbspI remember waiting to see my doctor as a child. I knew my turn would come Abdul knew his would not.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSpring:\u0026nbspVenezuelan refugees who once ate together as families around their own tables\u0026nbspnow eat from rubbish bins on their hands and knees to survive the crisis in their country. All the while, their president publicly feasts\u0026nbspin lavish establishments. Roughly 3.5 million Venezuelans, among them doctors, lawyers and teachers, have left their country, out of starvation and fear.Joender, aged six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela, arrived in\u0026nbspIpiales, Colombia, exhausted and hungry. He was offloaded with his family from a galvanised lorry like cattle, after a 33-day journey, mostly on foot, where they were forced to beg for food to survive. His cupped hands are\u0026nbsprewarded with a packet of biscuits donated by a local in the town. He clutches\u0026nbspthe packet like a prize. Having never begged for food myself as a child, I could not begin to understand the internal dialogue in doing so. I knew I could simply open a fridge door\u0026nbspJoender\u0026nbspcan’t.Summer:\u0026nbspEsperence, aged 10, is a Haitian “restavek” or child slave. He was\u0026nbspgiven away by his biological parents to a more affluent household and\u0026nbspforced into a life of domestic servitude. The feeling of being abandoned proves\u0026nbspto be too much for him. Standing in the kitchen and washing dishes, he simply shrugs his small shoulders, and one by one the tears roll\u0026nbspdown his face. Hours each day are spent cleaning, sweeping and washing.\u0026nbsp“I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs,”\u0026nbsphe says.\u0026nbspNearly 260 million children aren’t in school – do we care? Forced into a life of domestic servitude, Haiti’s child slavesThe global challenge to ensure all children can go to schoolThe importance of a solid work ethic was engrained into me at a young age. However, I remember the luxury of choice: I knew I could say no. Esperence knows he cannot.\u0026nbspAutumn: Mamoke, aged 10, has never set foot in a classroom. Abandoned by her parents along with her siblings, she now lives with her grandmother at the mercy of abject poverty. In a dark room in remote north western Tanzania, she explains\u0026nbsphow not going to school saddens\u0026nbspher. But she nonetheless still dreams that somehow she could become a teacher to help others like her with no access to education. I didn\u0027t have a choice.\u0026nbspI had to go to school. Mamoke didn’t have a choice, but that was because the right of education was unavailable to her. I realise I have taken so much\u0026nbspfor granted in my life. Children around the world live with no access to healthcare, displaced from their home, going to sleep hungry, growing up in conflict and with no\u0026nbspeducation.I did not choose my career any more than I chose my life. It chose me, and it is the greatest privilege, a blessing and a burden in the same breath. I\u0026nbspwill continue to hold the world to account, hoping\u0026nbspit will eventually force the changes that will create better choices for those who deserve them.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

When he is at home he just loves to snooze on his bed.He is what we call mph couch potatoes. He does have a medical condition where he cannot go in the heat. There is no medical treatment with that and he has a specic cool coat he wears in the summer.Car ridesA good snooze in his bedNeeds:Quiet environment lose to the Dogs TrustA reliable routineA home without children or other dogsTo find out more about Stevie you go here.Stevie is seven years old with little grey hairs sprouting around this snout.Louise says Stevie does get asked about but she believes that because he has been them for so long it raises questions, despite the Dogs Trust being able to successfully re-home nearly  greyhounds in the time hes been in their care.She said: In theory he shouldnt be a dficult dog to re-home but since he has been with us for so long it raises a few suspicions.He would need someone who has had lurcher and greyhounds before because they tend to be loyal as in once they have one they tend to stick to that breed.Stevie loves gnawing on a good bone when it comes to celebrating Christmas and his birthday.However Stevie isnt the Shrewsbury shelters only pooch who has been unlucky in love.A gentle giant named Lilly has been a resident at the Dogs Trust since June .The Rottweiler was dumped at the shelter after the family she came from suffered a breakdown in marriage, leaving her anxious about trusting new people.Louise said Lilly requires a similar home to Stevie but it could take weeks of introductions and further behavioural training before she could be successfully re-homed.She said: You need to spend quite an extensive amount of time with her. She is really worried about new people and once she finds one person then thats it.She needs a strict adult-only home and behaviour training and she is a dog who was initially worried about everything.Lilly also suffers from age-related arthritis and needs help getting into vehicles, but loves going on car rides and can go for group walks with other dogs.She has managed to develop a close bond with one of the volunteers at the Dogs Trust, proving she can learn to trust humans again.Likes:CuddlesWalksCar ridesNeeds: A quiet homeBehavioural trainingMultiple visits to form bonds with potential adoptersToabout Lilly you can go hereLouise added: She is very suspicious and it would require a prolonged introduction.Its hard to say how long it would take but it would take multiple weeks. It is a matter of trying to create this situation for Lilly where she associates new people with positive things.Somewhere down the line the emotional trust left her sometime ago.People are breedist and she is a big, powerful dog and because we say she cant have contact with children and she has specic needs combined that with her breed it would go against her.She isnt some demon dog but we are hopeful weve managed to capture her personality and shes been through a lot in her le.She was the emotional collateral damage in the stress and breakdown that leads to a orce.Louise and the volunteers at the Shrewsbury Dogs Trust have not given up on finding a home for Stevie and Lilly, but they dont recommend adopting a dog for Christmas.She added: We should be able to transfer that relationship that we have established in the centre to a home.We never put down a healthy dog and we have never given up on them.It ties in with the message the dog is for le and not for Christmas and because they are looking for a peculiar environment it makes it tricky and dficult sometimes.Both loving dogs are available for adoption now.If you have what Stevie and Lilly are looking for then contact the Shrewsbury Dogs Trust call   or visit www.dogstrust.org.ukOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Sunday Political Editor David Wooding hands out his annual gongs – The Wooders.Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson deluded herself she would be the next PM and toured the land in a coach bearing her giant mugshot on the side.But she didn’t even manage to win her own seat back.At least it cheered up the second most annoying party leader, the SNP’s Nicola Sturgeon, who punched the air in glee at claiming her Scots rival’s scalp.You wait two years for a Labour star to jump ship — then he does it twice in a few weeks.Following his aborted leadership bid, Chuka Umunna launched a new party, Change UK.But he became so fond of change, he did it again and joined the Lib Dems.Now he’s coping with more change after voters booted him out.Expelled left-winger Derek Hatton is readmitted into the Labour Party after a -year wait — only to be kicked out again  hours later.Comeback king Nigel Farage launched the Brexit Party.But within hours, pranksters registered its email address as a porn site.He was swamped with offers from East European women offering a “stress-free” massage.Bet he needed a rub down after his party bombed in the election.John Bercow stood down as Commons Speaker after ten years and was then accused of demanding £million to appear on TV’s I’m A Celebrity.He denied the claims but Brexit-backing MPs would happily have paid Remainer Bercow handsomely to get him out of the Westminster jungle.Naughty-but-nice Trade Secretary Liz Truss attended The Big Sausage event in Norfolk, saying it was, “ticking rather a lot of my boxes”.Asked to try a Gloucester Old Spot banger, she enthused: “That’s one of the best offers I’ve had all year.”It perhaps explains why Liz enjoyed working in a well-hung Parliament so much.Housing minister James Brokenshire showed off his new kitchen which boasts FOUR matching ovens.The revelation must have left the PM wondering where to put his “oven-ready” Brexit deal.It prompted one stunned MP to ask: “Is he running a pizza business on the side ”A miserable year for Jeremy Corbyn as his party and football team tanked.After his election defeat, the Labour leader assured fellow Arsenal fans he wouldn’t be applying for the vacant job of Gunners team boss.Just as well, as he’d probably borrow £billion to buy more left wingers and strikers but remain neutral on whether to play in Europe.Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg was dubbed “insolent” and “insufferable” when he reclined almost horizontally on the Commons’ green benches during a late-night Brexit debate.He refused to budge, amid cries of, “Sit up, man!”But the posh wind-up merchant smiled and nodded when one angry MP sarcastically suggested he should be supplied with a pillow.Spoon-bending psychic Uri Geller vowed to use his “telepathic powers” to stop Jeremy Corbyn becoming PM.After the election, he claimed he influenced Boris Johnson’s landslide victory by giving him a spoon energised with “mind positivity”.Chris “Failing” Grayling quit as Transport Secretary after a string of Brexit planning blunders — including awarding a cross-Channel ferry contract to a firm with no ships.Labour Deputy Leader Tom Watson shed st in two years by giving up sugar and taking up exercise.He became so thin that Corbynista “assassins” missed their target in a plot to oust him.Slimline Watson then decided to cast off his ­political baggage and quit as an MP.Shadow Education Secretary Angela ­Rayner has been showered with compliments about her figure after going on a “half-portions” diet.She quipped: “Fat birds don’t win elections.”Neither do slim turkeys when Corbyn is leader.Boris Johnson almost botched his leadership bid after a “screaming row” with his girlfriend over a wine stain on her sofa.Police were called by neighbours who reported “a lot of smashing” from the home he shared with Carrie Symonds.What happened next remains secret.Perhaps it was a ­cover-up — by an upholstery firm.Cops ordered a McDonald’s outlet to stop selling milkshakes during a rally by Nigel Farage in Edinburgh — in case they were used as missiles by customers.The Brexit Party boss completed the visit unscathed, only to be “milkshaked” in Newcastle.Loveable No pup Dilyn outshines ­Cameron, May, Johnson and even Larry the Downing Street cat.The seven-month-old Jack Russell-cross from an animal rescue charity moved in with BoJo’s girlfriend Carrie and always steals the show at official receptions.A real yappy ending.Hapless Karen Bradley admitted she didn’t believe a word she said as Northern Ireland Secretary.She dropped a clanger by saying that killings by the military and police during The Troubles were not crimes — then rowed back, insisting: “I want to be very clear. I do not believe what I said. That is not my view.”Boris Johnson brandished a kipper at his leadership hustings.But his claim that he couldn’t have it delivered by post because of EU rules proved very fishy.Channel  replaced no-shows Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage with melting ice sculptures during a debate on climate change.Viewers probably judged their performance to be less drippy than Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson’s.Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson was sacked after an inquiry into who leaked details of a National Security Council meeting over plans to allow Chinese telecoms giant Huawei to help build Britain’s G network.Downing Street said the PM had, “lost confidence in his ability to serve”, but he soon ed to Cabinet.All sounds a bit, er, phoney.Boris likened himself to The Incredible Hulk as he vowed to break free from EU shackles.But when he showed schoolkids an image of the superhero during a school visit, a boy pointed at the huge muscles and said: “You’ve got boobies.”She failed to secure a Brexit deal and lost the Tories’ majority.Yet Theresa May soldiered on with everyone against her.When toppled, she didn’t quit Parliament in a huff or carp endlessly from the backbenches but showed more loyalty to her successor than he gave to her.Mrs May could prove to be the finest ex-PM Britain ever had.Remainer lawyer Gina Miller blew thousands trying to stop Brexit — but unwittingly helped deliver it.Her court victory gave Brexit-blocker MPs the right to vote down Theresa May’s “soft” departure deal.But it set off a chain of events that put Bojo in No with a majority big enough to force through a much cleaner Brexit. Thanks, Gina.They spent the past three and a half years plotting to stop Brexit at every turn.But at the General Election, voters sent them a clear message: Leave Parliament.So good riddance to Dominic Grieve, Anna Soubry, David Gauke, Laura Pidcock, Chuka Umunna, Jo Swinson, Philip Lee, Antoinette Sandbach and Sam Gyimah. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But just before we say goodbye to this year, I’ve been thinking about all the brilliant women who did brave, groundbreaking and seriously inspiring things in .Here, in no particular order, are my pick of those who really stood out — and hopefully will continue to do so for some time to come.It’s been a very mixed year for her. The country has had a tumultuous time, going to the polls and with two Prime Ministers.Her grandsons were apparently feuding and she had to be seen to be laying down the law to Prince Andrew.History may well judge  as her second annus horribilis.Yet somehow, this amazing woman has been the very definition of a dignied, strong and steady leader, offering us the stability and reassurance we as a country so desperately need.Yes, I know women’s football has been going on for years.But  was the year our Lionesses put it firmly on the map.Not only that, they have also inspired a generation of girls to get their boots on and play, knowing they can be just as good as boys on the pitch.So although it’s a shame it’s taken this long, we all owe them a debt of gratitude.I have long admired Emily for asking the hard questions on BBC’s Newsnight.But this year, in the face of the extreme hotting-up of Brexit, culminating in December’s General Election, her coverage has been second to none .Then her grilling of Prince Andrew in November was a masterclass in conducting a good interview — clinical, forensic and meticulous, without a hint of deference.Never shouty or confrontational, she gave Andrew the space to show himself to the public so they could make up their own minds about his culpability in his relationship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.She also somehow managed not to make herself the storyalthough when Prince Andrew described Epstein’s actions as “unbecoming”, she took the chance to look as disgusted as we all feel.“Unbecoming ” she said. “He was a sex offender.”In short, she nailed him.That photo of her wearing the world’s most beautul dress, martini and cigarette in hand at the Emmys after-party, said it all.Earlier in the night she had won three of the four Emmys she was up for — just more in a long line of awards and accolades this year, during which she proved the brilliance of Fleabag was not a one-off.Her sharp, witty and totally original writing on Killing Eve showed she is seriously clever as well as unbelievably glamorous.And her portrayal of women is original, transgressive and totally refreshing.No wonder she was drafted in to give her input and perspective on the next Bond movie.I have a feeling that in  we will realise Phoebe Waller-Bridge is only just getting started.She has had her first baby, conducted her first royal tour and guest edited Vogue. Oh, and she met Beyonce.All in all, not a bad year! She has also managed to consistently put on a brave and happy face while on the receiving end of more criticism than most of us could stand.But it is her le-long passion for and commitment to feminism I admire most.On International Women’s Day, she said: “Men can understand that they can be feminists,” and should feel comfortable about women being by their side, rather than behind them.As we know all too well, not everyone likes a strong woman. But because she is strong, my view is that she will win over her critics in the end.Leave it to the women to organise, unite and provide support to local women in their community and provide support for those affected by the terrible tragedy of the Grenfell fire.Their aim is to provide a networking  and discussion forums for women and arrange positive actions and initiatives that will help the community. But above all, they want to remember — which is why they organise a monthly silent walk in memory of their “lost angels”.My heart breaks for them that they have to do this.But what a brilliant reminder of the power of organisation and women coming together to support each other.Earlier this year, at an equal pay tribunal brought against the BBC by the TV and radio presenter, Samira said she: “Could not understand how pay for me, a woman, could be so much lower than Jeremy Vine, a man, for presenting very similar programmes and doing very similar work . . .“I just ask why the BBC thinks I am worth only a sixth of the value of the work of a man for doing a very similar job.”On behalf of every woman who has felt she should have said something, should have done something, should have spoken out, stood up or walked out when they knew they were being paid less than men in similar roles, but who felt they had no choice but to put up with it, I salute her.I also want to give a mention to the captain of the US women’s soccer team.Yes, she is a great player. But people have lined up to criticise her because she is another strong woman who seems genuinely not to care what people think of her and what she says.They describe her in the US as a “badass” and there is no doubt that she is outspoken on every issue going.But it is her ongoing campaign to normalise gay relationships in sport that really resonates with me.Working in a sport where no male has ever come out as gay while playing in the Premier League, it seems sad — and unacceptable — that people can’t be open about being gay.I think Megan is helping to change that, though.Asked in an interview how it felt to lead the US team, she replied: “Go gays!”She continued: “You can’t win a championship without gays on your team. It’s never been done before. Ever.”Could any collection of amazing women be complete without a mention of the -year-old schoolgirl who has started an international revolution Everything this young woman has done — and she has done more than anyone I can think of to raise awareness about the climate emergency — has been made so much more impressive because of her tenacity in the face of such extreme criticism.Most of the youngster’s critics seem to be men of a certain age who are, I guess, threatened by someone so young and female being so bold, opinionated and unconcerned about what they think.Amazingly, the insults and attacks seem only to have empowered her further and fuelled her determination to make the world listen to what we need to do to try to stop climate change in its tracks.A slip of a girl — and a teen at that — is changing the world.Bravely, and in the face of extreme confrontation at times, she has created a movement where millions around the world follow her and listen to her.She has turned down many accolades because she is not in it for the adulation. She really just wants to make change happen. Truly inspirational.A bit like female Prime Ministers, female newspaper editors are a rarer breed than male ones.Women have such an important role to play in journalism and in fighting for equality.And now, for the first time in  years, there will be a female editor of the Financial Times, which really is groundbreaking, given the paper has been such a bastion of male power for so long.Roula is going to do a magnicent job, not least because she is so focused on increasing newsroom ersity and attracting more female readers, which gives her an obvious spot among my Women of the Year.And a final mention must go to Dr Nyla Raja, purely for personal reasons.She has transformed my skin this year.Everyone needs a great facial and a little help . . . and boy, does she deliver!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Child mortality is at record low levels. Famine virtually went extinct. Malaria, polio and heart disease are declining.Ever since I wrote The Rational Optimist, in , I’ve been faced with, “what about. . . ” questions: What about the great recession, the euro crisis, Syria, Ukraine, Donald Trump  How can I possibly say that things are getting better, given all that The answer is: Because bad things happen while the world still gets better.That is to say, our population and economy would grow, but we would learn how to reduce what we take from the planet. And so it has proved.Scientist Andrew McAfee documented this in his book More From Less, showing how some nations are beginning to use less metal, less water and less land.This does not quite fit with what the Extinction Rebellion lot are telling us.But the next time you hear Sir David Attenborough say: “Anyone who thinks you can have infinite growth on a planet with finite resources is either a madman or an economist,” ask him this: “But whateconomic growth means using less stuff, not more ”For example, a drink can contains  grams of aluminium, much of it recycled. In  it contained  grams.Substituting the former for the latter is a contribution to economic growth, but it reduces the resources consumed per drink.As for Britain, our consumption of “stuff” probably peaked around the turn of the century. The evidence is there.In  Chris Goodall, an investor in electric vehicles, published research showing the UK was now using not just relatively less stuff every year, but absolutely less.Events have since vindicated his thesis. The quantity of all resources consumed per person in Britain fell by a third between  and , from . tonnes to . tonnes.That’s a faster decline than the increase in the number of people, so it means fewer resources consumed overall.Think about your own home. Mobile phones have the computing power of room-sized computers of the s. I use mine instead of a camera, radio, torch, compass, map, calendar, watch, CD player newspaper and a pack of cards.LED light bulbs consume about a quarter as much electricity as incandescent bulbs for the same light. Modern buildings generally contain less steel and more of it is recycled. Offices use much less paper.Even in cases when the use of stuff is not falling, it is rising more slowly than expected.For instance, how much water the world consumed in  was half as much as experts in the s predicted. Inventiveness allowed more efficient irrigation for agriculture, the biggest user of water.Until recently, most economists assumed these improvements were almost always in vain, becauseyou cut the cost of something, people would just use more of it. Make lights less energy hungry and people leave them on for longer.But Andrew McAfee argues that doesn’t hold up. Suppose you switch from incandescent to LED bulbs in your house and save about three-quarters of your electricity bill for lighting. You might leave more lights on for longer, but surely not four times as long.Efficiencies in agriculture mean the world is now approaching “peak farmland”. Despite the growing number of people and their demand for more and better food, the productivity of agriculture is rising so fast that human needs can be supplied by a shrinking amount of land.In , Jesse Ausubel, of The Rockefeller University in New York, and his colleagues argued that thanks to modern technology, we use  per cent less land to produce a given quantity of food compared with  years ago.By  it is estimated that an area the size of India will have been released from the plough and the cow.Perhaps the most surprising statistic is that Britain is using steadily less energy.John Constable, of the Global Warming Policy Forum think tank, points out that although the UK’s economy has almost trebled since , and our population is up by  per cent, energy consumption has fallen by almost ten per cent.This is not necessarily good news, Constable argues. Although the improving energy efficiency of light bulbs, planes and cars is part of the story, it also means we are importing more embedded energy in products, having driven much of our steel, aluminium and chemical industries abroad with some of the world’s highest energy prices.In fact, all this energy-saving might cause problems.Innovation requires experiments . Experiments require energy. So cheap energy is crucial.Thus, energy may be the one resource that a prospering population should be using more of.Since its inception, the environmental movement has been obsessed by finite resources. The two books that kicked off the green industry in the early s, The Limits To Growth, in America, and BlueprintFor Survival, in Britain, both lamented the imminent exhaustion of metals, minerals and fuels.The Limits To Growth predicted thatgrowth continued, the world would run out of gold, mercury, silver, tin, zinc, copper and lead well before . School textbooks soon echoed these claims.This caused the economist Julian Simon to challenge the ecologist Paul Ehrlich to a bet that five metalswould cost less in  than in .The Stone Age did not end for lack of stone, Simon said, arguing that we would find substitutesmetals grew scarce.Simon won the bet easily, and Ehrlich sniped that: “The one thing we’ll never run out of is imbeciles.”To this day, none of those metals has signicantly risen in price nor run out. A modern irony is that many green policies advocated now would actually reverse the trend towards using less stuff.A wind farm requires far more concrete and steel than a system based on gas. Environmental opposition to nuclear power has hindered the generating system that needs the least land, least fuel and least steel or concrete per megawatt.Burning wood instead of coal in power stations means the exploitation of more land — and even higher emissions. Organic farming uses more land than conventional methods.Technology has put us on a path to a cleaner, greener planet. We don’t need to veer in a new direction. To do so risks retarding progress.As we enter the third decade of this century, I’ll make a prediction.By the end of it we will see less poverty, less child mortality, less land devoted to agriculture.There will be more tigers, whales, forests and nature reserves. Britons will be richer and each of us will use fewer resources.The global political future may be uncertain, but the environmental and technological trends are pretty clear — and pointing in the right direction. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Employers such as the MoD and the NHS had said they were safe.But it simply wasn’t true . . . and at least  rogue operators were free to roam in a “scammer’s paradise”.To add insult to injury, the victims — some of whom have reported feeling suicidal — are now being fined for unknowingly participating in these schemes, which broke tax laws.And who’s to blame  Tony Blair and his Labour government, who relaxed rules around HMRC enrolment in , allowing dodgy pension schemes to sign up with virtually no checks.This was supposed to bring “security, dignity and comfort in old age”. Instead it has unleashed a nightmare.Perhaps instead of lecturing us on Brexit, Blair should reflect on his devastating legacy.IN her bid to become the next Labour leader, Rebecca Long-Bailey has promised “progressive patriotism”.It sounds as nonsensical as the party’s economic policies. After all, there’s nothing “progressive” about this vile, anti-semitic version of the party.Nor is there anything “patriotic” about Long-Bailey’s loyalty to Jeremy Corbyn, the man who counts Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRA as his friends.So it comes as no surprise that Corbyn’s cronies are apparently trying to shorten the Labour leadership contest in order to boost Long-Bailey’s chances and “stitch-up” other hopefuls.Her proclamation of patriotism shows utter desperation.Labour spent years treating anyone who’s proud to be British as lowle scum, only to have that backfire on them at the election.Many are proud of this country and enthusiastic about Brexit.It’s a bit too late for Corbynistas to pretend they feel the same.IT looks set to be a very happy New Year for many British workers.Chancellor Sajid Javid has announced that the minimum wage for over s will rise by p to £. an hour in April.After years of “Spreadsheet Phil” Hammond and his Brexit fearmongering, this is exactly the boost Britain needs — both for the economy and spirit.So let’s join the three million who’ll be toasting Mr Javid on New Year’s Eve. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Things can only improve on the last four years of anger, ision and political paralysis.A period which should have been pivotal to our country saw it barely governed at all. That all changed at pm on December .Boris Johnson’s thumping election win gives us the greatest opportunity for radical renewal since at least .That means finally achieving Brexit  days from now and then, we hope, rapidly ­striking trade deals with Brussels and the world’s greatest economies.It means a dramatic, imaginative ­Budget to turbo-charge both those “left-behind” regions which voted Tory for the first time and the wider economy.We share too the  vision of our readers: For huge NHS investment to continue and a long-term social care solution be put in place.That tax breaks and rate cuts must renew our dilapidated High Streets and help small firms thrive and create jobs.That rough sleeping must be slashed, even ended. That wages must be driven up and food banks rendered redundant.That the Tories must continue striving for a cleaner environment without ­caving in to economy-wrecking panic.And we of course share the desire for a kinder, more united country — echoed by the open letter from faith, ­culture, sport and business leaders.The Sun is optimistic about that too.In fact we do not agree we have suffered a “decade of ision”. Yes, it was tough financially. But we were far from ided at, say, the  Olympics.The anger in our Parliament, offices, factories and homes was caused by Brexit, specically by some Remainers’ refusal to accept defeat, and by a Labour Party engulfed by the hostile hard-left.The Brexit heat is fast dissipating now. Boris’s triumph saw to that. Many Remainers are making their peace with it . . . and even seeing its opportunities.Which leaves but one obstacle to the national healing.No one has done more to ide us than Jeremy Corbyn, his thuggish, often anti-Semitic followers and his obnoxious media apologists.Their relentless hatred and dishonest demonisation of opponents toxied both political discourse and Labour’s election fortunes.Yet none of the contenders to replace Corbyn grasps this reality: They can remain a Twitter-obsessed, Tory-hating clique of middle-class Marxist posers calling each other “comrade” but disconnected from working people.Or be viable, mainstream contenders for Government.

Whichever box we ticked in the election, millions of us vote green with our lestyles.A recent survey of Sun readers showed  per cent recognise climate change is real and that  per cent of us worry more about our environmental impact now than they did five years ago.And  per cent of Sun readers want to make their habits greener still.Some of them make their voices heard.Retired receptionist Eileen Webster, , says “climate change is the big issue facing the next generation”, while Anna Lubecka, , demands new PM Boris Johnson, “start making good plans for climate change”.Attitudes to environmentalism have shted so much that being green is now no longer the preserve of lentil-munching hippies and Swampy, it is totally mainstream.No trendy bar would now dare put plastic straws in their cocktails.We’ve all got used to carrying Love Island-style water bottles and happily adopted reusable coffee cups. This year they pulled off a plastic-free Glastonbury, despite a few hiccups.We’ve long stopped grumbling about taking our own bags to the supermarket and got used to stuffing our pockets with them when we leave the house.So now in England, the average person uses less than a tenth of the number of single-use plastic bags than we did five years ago. Only around ten a year, compared to  in .As electric cars have improved, we’ve all been seduced — and not just by Tesla’s new “bulletproof” Cybertruck. Overall, demand for electric cars has jumped, with the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders finding that this November alone electric car sales leaped by . per cent, with more than three times as many new battery-electric vehicles registered as in the same month in .Nowhere  is it clearer that green has become the new black than in fashion, where criticism of fast fashion has led to trends for vintage, second hand and renting rather than buying.On the high street, companies such as HM have launched their “conscious collection” , fashion bible Vogue has championed sustainable designs, while French President Emmanuel Macron’s “fashion pact” — presented at the G summit and intended to make the industry more sustainable — has been signed by more than  brands, including Nike, Zara and Gap.All these changes prove how far we have come and the impact Greta has had.Hearing her, strong and calm, on Radio ’s Today programme this week, what struck me is that now another change is needed.This time a sht not in our actions, but in how we approach the environmental debate.It’s not beliefs but attitudes that need to change. Until now, environmental issues have been too isive.Butwe want real change we’ve got to move beyond blame.It puts people off environmental issues when campaigners hector and shame them.When wealthy celebrities such as Sir David Attenborough criticise normal people for taking holidays with cheap flights, or actress Emma Thompson jets back from America to harass normal people driving to work.In the same way Extinction Rebellion threatens to lose potential supporters when it starts fights with commuters trying to board their morning train or cause mayhem in central London.The real danger is that by being so aggressive, these green campaigners risk putting people off.Greta seems to know this. She is much calmer than she used to be when speaking in public.Rather than getting angry or emotional, instead she has stressed the importance of just, “listening to the scientists”.As usual, we could learn from her.The reality is most people want to be green.We are all concerned about global warming, pollution in the seas and the kind of planet we are creating for our grandkids. But you can’t shame people into doing something.Diesel drivers — especially White Van Man — shouldn’t be harassed just for getting to work. I’m sure they would buy more environmentally friendly vehiclesthey could afford to.Likewise, no one should be shamed for taking a flight — who knows what other measures they might be taking, such as living in a carbon neutral home What the planet needs least is more fighting.

Of course some of the display was literally hidden, because for some reason the BBCaposs helicopter decided to be downwind of the explosives and couldnapost see for a massive black cloud of smoke. And London Mayor Sadiq Khan has been accused of planting political messages in the display in previous years. Last year the display appeared to have an anti-Brexit tint to it - We Are Your Friends, Stay and Donapost Leave Me Alone were among songs chosen for the -minute soundtrack, which featured artists from Ireland, France, Sweden and where. And the London Eye was lit up to resemble a giant EU flag. But this yearaposs alleged message was a bit more ambiguous. During the display, the White Stripesapos Seven Nation Army was played. Of course Corbyn fans seized on this as a reference to The Absolute Boy. And while the inclusion of the song might have been a cheeky nod to Islington Northaposs once and future backbencher, there is another possibility. You see, as well as being an anthem beloved of the many, not the few, Seven Nation Army is frequently sung at sporting events.  One such sporting event, the football European Championship - or Euro  - is being held in London this year. The song was also sandwiched between two other sporting anthems.

The pair were also neck-and-neck among working-class members. The majority of Labour members backed Remain and Sir Keir has been seen as a strong voice for them around the shadow cabinet table.

He changed his ways when his dad, Jason, , suffered a stroke and sepsis , and was left fighting for his le.  Now  months on, Brandon from Wakefield, West Yorkshire, is a buff st with huge muscles and aspirations to compete at World’s Strongest Man. Personal trainer Brandon said: When I set out all I knew was I wanted to be as strong as I possibly could and I didn’t care about the effects that had on my body. “I had a passion to get strong and was inspired by Eddie Hall and the bodybuilders I followed online. “I took on board what they did and caved in to the pressures to eat loads of food. “I had an obsession to get strong and wanted to go all out.“My mentality was to eat as much as I physically could, regardless of how fat it made me. “I was willing to do anything to be the strongest and I started eating at least , calories a day. “It made me feel awful but I was getting really strong. Brandon used to weight st a was a ‘fit and active’ teenager and professional rugby player with Castleford Tigers when he was . But he fell out of love with the game and turned his attention to weightlting, and started piling on the pounds in .  He read about Worldaposs Strongest Man Eddie Hall, and how the st champion ate , calories a day. While doing a six-day-a-week weightlting routine, Brandon went from eating a regular diet to gorging between , and , calories a day. In an average day he would eat eight rashers of bacon, four slices of toast, four eggs and an ice cream protein powder smoothie for breakfast. He would then snack on beef jerky, cakes and muffins before a lunch of FOUR burgers and a pint of milk. A typical tea time would see Brandon eat out at steakhouses or burger bars, or scoff a large portion of takeaway fish and chips.  He said: “I used to eat so much that it made me feel sick and I was sleepy all of the time. “But in terms of strength, I saw massive improvements. “I went from lting kg to kg in  months. This did make me feel happy but not for very long. “I was pleased that I was able to lt a lot but it didn’t really fulfil me.” But a near-death experience for his dad, Jason, , made Brandon to realise his diet was putting his health at risk. He weighed st lbs, had piled on nine stone in just over a year, and would get out of breath just walking up the stairs.  “I realised I needed to start living a healthier le and that I was putting pressure on my heart”, he said. “I wonderedI’d end up in that position.” Brandon began to gradually slim down his meals and his waistline, adding cardio to his workout routine, and eating , calories a day. Brandon now eats “little and often” - six  calorie meals a day, such as eggs and oats for breakfast, beef and rice with vegetables and chicken, potatoes and greens.

Overweight or slow-moving hopefuls who would normally be rejected for service will be offered a month’s course to help them fight the flab.The Army is also relaxing long-standing rules banning asthma and eczema sufferers from joining up.It comes as top brass today launch a £.million advertising campaign promising “long-term confidence” with a military career. Head of Army recruiting, Colonel Nick MacKenzie, said of the fitness camps: “Those people with borderline fitness, they are a bit slow on their run, or they were a little bit too large, we coach them through a four-week course that they then meet the minimum standard required. If they don’t come up to standard required then they don’t get in. We are giving people a chance because it is good to give people a chance. “One part of it is about fitness, some of it is about confidence.” Col MacKenzie said applicants with asthma or skin problems will be ­considered on a “case by case” basis. Since September, up to  recruits have completed the soldier ­development course at Pirbright in Surrey. The new drive follows years of bungling of Army staffing targets by recruitment firm Capita, which failed to meet intended levels every year.

But it’s not all doom and gloom. Despite an onslaught of online competition, some high streets are thriving. As we enter the New Year, the Mirror – which is championing town centres with our High Street Fightback campaign – highlights three of the many inspirational places that are standard-bearers for how it can be done. Buzzing as we have the best community spirit It’s am on a Friday and Belper’s main street is bustling. The town lies at the heart of the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site. Industrial pioneer Jedediah Strutt built one of the world’s first water powered cotton spinning mills here in . But, like many towns, it has had its fair share of challenges in recent years. Chocolate maker Thorntons and a clothes company closed their factories in the early s, and textile maker Courtaulds shut its plant in , with hundreds of job losses. But you couldn’t tell the impactyou took a walk round the Derbyshire town’s centre now.  There is hardly an empty shop, and along with a few chain stores – including Boots, Wilko, Card Factory and Hays Travel – there are an array of independents. They include two butchers and a greengrocer, gt shops, plus the wonderful looking Ritz Cinema. But above all, there is a genuine buzz about the place. Chris Gregory, co-owner of the fantastic Beaurepaire Patisserie cafe, echoes many the Mirror spoke to about why the high street is doing well. He said: “It’s got the best community spirit. Whenever an event is put on it’s really well attended.” Chris, , who is born and bred in the town, and his partner have another shop in Belper and added his sister plans to open an interiors store here. He said: “The shops don’t become available that often and go really quickly.” Julia Greening has had her furniture and interiors shop, Sundial, for  years. She appealed for people not to take local shops for granted, saying: “If you let shops go, they are lost for ever.” One reason for Belper’s success is a band of business owners who have worked tirelessly to promote the place. They include Laura Armstrong, who runs menswear shop Strut, and chairs the Love Belper committee. The Love Belper website has been a big hit, while its use of social media has drawn visitors in from further afield. Laura, , said: “We have people coming from Derby because they say it’s dying on its feet.” Laura, who praised Belper town council for its support, said trading for her is hard, despite all the efforts. It proves how even high streets that are pulling out all the stops still need people’s backing to flourish. Transformed after tough times  Five years ago Treorchy was just another part of the Valleys struggling to come to terms with the collapse of big industry. But take the time to stroll down the high street now and you realise an inspiring transformation has slowly taken place. Treorchy has nearly  shops. Whereas a decade ago many were struggling or empty, the town now boasts an occupancy rate of %. The vast majority of these businesses are independent and most are run by women, giving the high street a refreshingly cosy vibe. This transformation has been the result of a lot of hard work by business leaders here who realised action had to be taken. They came together under the stewardship of Treorchy Chamber of Trade chairman Adrian Emmett, who has watched the membership soar from  to . The traders have launched a series of initiatives, such as the Visit Treorchy website, to attract people to invest. Adrian explained that, underpinning it all, is a “circular market” in which each business prioritises buying from each other. He said: “Towns like this did not have the confidence. They needed to believe in themselves and we needed to change the mindset. I like to think we’re doing that and the confidence is back.  “I am so proud of how much we have achieved.” Holly Thomas, , who is the very proud owner of the Number  gt shop, said: “I think the reason it has worked is because we have all come together.” Zoe Davies, , who has run the Fusion beauty parlour for  years, is delighted by the way Treorchy’s high street has been transformed. She said: “It was worrying at one point when you saw all the empty shops but now it is thriving and it is nice to be part of it.” Plenty to smile about in the friendliest port  The number of people visiting the award-winning shops here has rocketed. Civic chiefs from across the country go to Amble, Northumberland, to learn the secrets of its success. It was shortlisted in  for the Great British High Street champion award after winning the coastal community category three years ago.  Traders in what is known as “the friendliest port” are seeing the benefits of the “Harbour Village”, part of a £.million Government investment. A £, national bird sculpture trail is to come.

Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, to use his full name, will grow up as one of the must privileged children in the world in the British Royal Family. Heaposs also the first born of superstar royal couple, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, who clearly dote on him, so itaposs perhaps not surprising that a report of their first Christmas together claims he was showered with gts.As the Mirror has reported , the new family spent Christmas at a luxurious £million waterside estate and mansion in Canada, understood to belong to a Russian oligarch. And itaposs there, according to a source who spoke to US , that the new parents bought Archie books, building blocks, a baby ball pit, the source said.They added that itaposs not all about extravagant gts for them. This would chime with a description of the royal couple by American comic and chat-show host, Ellen Degeneres, who said they were the most down-to-earth, compassionate people. Indeed, Harry and Meghan were so keen to give their son a normal le, they chose at birth to not give him the courtesy title Earl Dumbarton or style him Lord Archie Mountbatten-Windsor, instead taking it upon themselves to decide he should just be a plain aposMasterapos. Building blocks are a classic present for newborns as they learn to navigate the physical world and develop their coordination skills.With books, parents Harry and Meghan will be able to read to their son and start him on the road to developing language skills - something which is likely to be important as he surely grows up into a sought-after public figure. And a ball pit is perfect for when he just wants to thrash around and be boisterous, like many other infant boys his age. It was also reported that Archie - like his cousin and future king, Prince George - is already showing his confident, outgoing side. As a baby, at his first aposmeet and greetapos, in  Prince George seemed bold and confident, going straight for the biggest toy in the room.  And it would seem Archie is no dferent. The source told Us: “You can tell Archie’s going to be a confident social butterfly. “He loves being entertained and interacting with people. Some children get shy or nervous around new people, but not Archie. He’ll go to anyone without kicking up a fuss!” The Duke and Duchess chose to spend the festive period on Vancouver Island as opposed to staying with the rest of the Royal Family at Sandringham. Meghan, , and Harry, , were also joined by the Duchessaposs mum Doria Ragland - who briefly lived with the couple when they first brought Archie, now seven months old, home to Frogmore Cottage .Locals reported they had seen Harry and Meghan out jogging in the Canadian town of North Saanich and others had spotted them hiking in Horth Hill Regional Park on Vancouver Island. Harry and Meghan also shared a photo of their Christmas card in the run-up to December .The adorable photo shows the Duke and Duchess of Sussex laughing in the background with Archieaposs cute little face in the foreground. The family is sat comfortably on the floor in front of a Christmas tree, complete with flashing lights and baubles. Meghan and Harry have been criticised for deciding to spend Christmas away from Prince Philip and the Queen on what could be their last Christmas.

Months before falling for Prince Harry , Meghan posted a blog on her now defunct lestyle website The Tig in  to set out her goals and explain why she never quite achieves them.Listing her resolutions, she wrote: Run a marathon. Stop biting my nails. Stop swearing. Re-learn French. These make my New Year’s resolution list nearlysingle year. The marathon hasn’t happened. The swearing comes in lulls triggered by being overworked or feeling mighty cheeky after a couple drinks. Then there’s the French – a language I studied through high school and then lost as I immersed myself in speaking Spanish with the Argentinians during my stint in Buenos Aires. I have put my little Rosetta Stone headset in my eager ears every year, resolving to do interviews en français, but much to my chagrin, it hasn’t stuck. And when it comes to the biting of the nails – well, it still happens with a turbulent flight or a stressful day. It’s unladylike. But then again, so is the swearing. Dammit.  The now  year old admitted that she ditched the resolutions for  and instead chose to aposapproach le playfullyapos and aposleave room for magicapos. Meghan met Harry weeks later after being set up on a blind date, leading to a royal wedding in May  and the birth of their adorable son Archie in  - so it looks like it worked.

Simone added: “ I went out shopping with my friend, bought a pregnancy test in Poundland and did it in Debenhams toilet.  “I surprised Chris, put the test in a little box and wrote in the card ‘oops we messed up’ . “He thought I was winding him up - we were petried, we weren’t ready to go through that sort of thing again. “But we went for a scan and there was a heartbeat so that was it.

Julie Farquhar, , ballooned to a size  thanks to “social eating” – and the problem got even worse after her mum, Vera, ­tragically died in November . Tipping the scales at st lb, Julie ­struggled to do any basic activity. She got breathless walking around the house and found it hard to keep up with her three ­children, Dillon, , Keigan, , and Lois, nine. “My size made me miserable and I always felt like I was on the sidelines of le,” she says. “I wasn’t really getting as involved as I should because my size was holding me back.” Unbeknown to Julie, her mother’s biggest hope before her death at just , was for Julie to lose weight. But for a year, the opposite happened as she ate through her grief. Julie finally decided to join her local Slimming World group with her two sisters, Lindsey, , and Katie, . And, in  months, she had lost an ­incredible eight stone and was down to a size . After hitting her target weight on Christmas Eve  – st lb – she got a touching message from her mother’s friend, Helen, to tell her how proud she was – and how worried her mother had been. Julie, an early years’ practitioner from Oldmeldrum, Aberdeenshire, said: “It was awful to hear that Mum had been so worried about me – especially in those last few months – but I know how proud she would be to see how well I’ve done. “It really has changed my le. Instead of just surviving, I’m finally living!” The mum of three admits she had always struggled with her weight and, as a teenager, was two dress sizes bigger than her friends and a size . But it wasn’t until she met her husband John, now , in April , that she really began to pile on the pounds.  She says: “We’d have nights in with ­takeaways, go out for meals or have friends over and snack on crisps and wine.” The couple married in June . However, in the three years they had been together, Julie, who is ft in, had gone from a size  to a size . And the problem only got worse, in , when Vera was diagnosed with breast cancer, and Julie moved into her home to care for her. She says: “When Mum moved into a hospice in August , I’d grab breakfast on the run so I could be with her, then we’d have tea and cake in the day. It became easier to grab a McDonald’s when I headed home. And rather than eating a balanced diet, I just ate rubbish.” Vera passed away in November , but Julie’s weight continued to spiral, and she was soon a size . “I could barely walk up the stairs without getting out of breath and did absolutely no exercise,” she explains. “So, when my sisters joined Slimming World in January , I went too because I didn’t want to miss out!” And soon she saw a huge dference. “I started to think more about what I was putting in my body” Julie says. “Instead of grabbing the easiest thing, like a jar of sauce to chuck on some spaghetti, I’d make it and know what ingredients I was putting in. I naturally found myself eating more fruit and veg and the weight was just falling off – it was so easy.” "},{"url":null,"title":"rail fares rose twice fast","story":"NewsRail fares rose twice as fast as wages over past  years as prices go up againIn the decade since , fares for commuters have risen by % but the average weekly wage has only risen %.

In the decade since , fares for commuters have risen by %. But the average weekly wage has only risen %, according to a TUC analysis of official figures. The shocking revelation by the TUC comes as commuters ing to work today have been hit with a .% rail fares rise. And the trade union body says the increase cannot be justied when the private rail companies have paid out more than £.billion in idends to shareholders in the past five years. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: “Working people have had enough of over-crowded and unreliable services. “The number one priority should be running a world-class railway service, not subsidising shareholders. “No more excuses - the government must end the failed privatisation and put trains back in public ownership. This would free up money for much-needed upgrades and lower ticket prices for working people.” Some British commuters are spending seven times as much on train season tickets as counterparts in Europe. TUC research also shows someone on an average salary travelling from Chelmsford in Essex to London will have to fork out % of their pay for season tickets . But comparable commutes would cost a mere % of the average salary in France, and % in Germany and Belgium. Pressure group the Campaign for Better Transport is pressing for a full reform of the rail fares system. Darren Shirley, CBT chief executive, said: “Rail passengers are tired of rising fares and broken promises. “Only total reform will start to restore passengers’ faith in the rail network, and ensure the railways are more affordable and better value for passengers.” The Government sets the January fare increase using July’s Retail Price Indexlevel - which critics say is a discredited and out-dated statistic. If the more appropriate Consumer Price Indexhad been used to set fare increases, regulated fares - including season tickets and standard s - would have risen by .% today, according to the CBT. Robert Nisbet, director of nations and regions for industry body the Rail Delivery Group, said: “We know that no-one wants to pay more to travel, and rail companies have, for the third year in a row, held average fare increases below inflation while continuing to deliver investment in new trains and extra services that will improve journeys for customers.  “In , we will work together to run , extra services a week and roll out , more train carriages as we replace half the country’s train carriages. “We will also continue to push for changes to regulations that would make rail fares match how people work today and tackle crowding on the busiest long-distance routes.” The Department for Transportis expected to publish a white paper based on the findings of the Rail Review in the coming weeks.

TV news presenters Hannah and Lewis Vaughan Jones spent years battling with infertility. But just before Christmas the pair announced the arrival of Matheson Calon Tallett Vaughan Jones - or Sonny for short - who they described as perfect in every way.Weaposve been through many years of heartache, but weaposve got the best Christmas present at the end of it all, said CNN news anchor Hannah, who gave birth to Sonny on December , Wales Online reports.We have been very public about it for the past three years or so, but in the years before that it was very private and painful - and there was a lot of shame involved which anyone going through infertility will be familiar with. But we have been lucky. We are the very, very lucky ones. Lewis, originally from Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, said it was harrowing watching his we going through round after round of IVF which involved frequent injections and hormone treatment. We wanted a family, but frankly we didnapost think it was going to happen for us, said Lewis, a freelance news presenter for BBC News and ITV News. In fact, I think weaposd already emotionally moved on. We said to each other that this was going to be our last round [of IVF]. And it was the last little embryo that we had left. Weaposd sent it off for testing and the results came back inconclusive, so we didnapost think it was going to work at all.  But weaposd come this far, so we made the decision to put the embryo back in and, unbelievably, it grew to become Sonny. The couple, who live in Twickenham, said they spent around £, on private IVF treatment after being given one round for free with the NHS. They said the odds of having a baby were severely stacked against them. Weaposd been through so much disappointment and we were emotionally ready to move forward with our lives, said Hannah, . But when the pregnancy test came up as positive I really couldnapost believe it. We didnapost allow ourselves to get too excited in the first  weeks or so until weaposd had the viability scans.  There was huge, huge relief when they said the growth and development was fine. Hannah, who gave birth to Sonny via c-section weighing exactly lb, said there were a few dficult moments during his first few days of le. He lost a lot of weight in the first week which we panicked about. We already thought we were terrible parents and didnapost know how to keep this little human being alive. But heaposs now finally caught up to his birth weight.

Whitney Chardoulias, , her husband Andrew, , who have six kids between them, have travelled across nine states and covered ,-mile in the six months since leaving their home in Muscatine, Iowa, in the US. The couple, who are owners of dog breeding business, Cedar Bend Labradoodles, spent ,on renovating the -foot bus and splashed out ,on a new engine. Their impressive converted home includes a kitchen, living room, toy room, bathroom with a tub, king size bed and three bunk bedsWhitney was inspired to go on the trip by families she saw on Instagram who had converted school buses and travelled the country.When Whitney told Andrew about the idea  he was quickly convinced it was a good thing to do and they started planning their trip right away. Among the states the couple and their kids have visited are Colorado, South Dakota, Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Kentucky and Indiana, Whitney said: Quincy was two we spent four and half months in Biloxi, Mississippi. I grew up inland in Muscatine, Iowa, and never really saw the ocean or a beach before. Our place was right by the beach and I loved it so much and dreaded coming home,” Whitney said. “I had seen other families on Instagram living in a converted bus and travelling the country and I was so envious. I remember telling Andrew I didn’t want to be old and grey and wishing we had travelled more. I told him about the busses and asked him ‘why not us ’  “He bought the idea and when we told friends and family, they were against it at first. My mum was especially convinced that our kids would be kidnapped or mauled by bears. They have all come around to it now though and our friends think it’s really cool. When not travelling, the bus sits on land at Whitney’s parents’ farm. During the day the couple work on their dog breeding business while the children attend school, but next year the couple are hoping to start home schooling so that they can travel more frequently. Due to cold nights the family are now temporarily all sleeping in the farmhouse at night while sorting out the insulation on their bus, but as soon as that is fixed they intend to get back on the bus full time.  Their converted home includes a full kitchen, living room, toy room, bathroom with a tub, king size bed and three bunks. There is also extra sleeping space on a sofa that opens into a double bed. Due to cold nights the family are now temporarily all sleeping in the farmhouse at night while the couple improve the insulation on their bus, but as soon as that is fixed they intend to get back on the bus full time. The  couples four kids Quincy, seven, Fletcher, four, Rowe, two and River, one have joined them for all of the trip.  Andrew has two other children with a dferent mother Brenna, , and Bria, , who travel with them on some of their adventures. Whitney said: “Our kids have been excited every step of the way and we’ve covered more than , miles now across the states of Idaho, Wyoming, Nebraska, Colorado, South Dakota, Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Kentucky and Indiana, “The kids are at school during the daytime and me and Andrew both work on our dog raising business and helping maintain the farm. “The best thing about this journey is travelling and seeing our children experience new things. Every time we get back ‘home’ they ask us when we are leaving again. Also I love only having to clean  sq. feet each day, though I must admit I don’t enjoy doing the kids bunks. “For a large family it’s been very good for our budget too and I would guess that we spend only around £,a month.

Learning a new skill, getting organised or making more effort with loved ones are popular New Yearaposs Resolutions - but vows to eat better and hit the gym are always the loudest, especially after all that Christmas boozing. However despite all that January  determination, most of us have swapped the lentils for pasta and put our gym kit back in the wardrobe before we even get to Valentineaposs Day. But this year, personal trainer Steve Ahern, from Nottingham, is on hand with some top tips on how to actually stick to your resolutions in . He believes there are several core mistakes that people make when it comes to getting into shape in the new year, which really hold them back in terms of reaching their goals. Start slow and be patientWe donapost have the patience and thataposs why people stop so quickly. We want it now. You need to start slow and be patient. Rome wasnapost built in a day. I know itaposs corny, but itaposs true. Itaposs great that youaposre doing something butyouaposre not building the base itaposs very hard for it to last. People end up going to the gym five or six times a week, theyaposre not letting their body rest and recover. Then they donapost see any changes so they move onto something . Be consistent. If youaposre just doing a day here and there youaposre never going to see results. Do something you love Not many of us can honestly say we would rather go out for a run than sitting in the pub or chilling out on the sofa with a brew. But spending time finding something you actually like doing can make all the dference when it comes to sticking to your fitness plan.  Steve said: If you hate going to the gym, donapost go to the gym. If you hate running, donapost go running. Find something you like doing. Le is far too short to do something that you hate. Donapost worry about other people Another of the big problems is comparing yourself to others, especially when it comes to seeing results. Steve also says that social media can have an extremely negative impact on peopleaposs fitness dreams as they are constantly looking at filtered and edited photos of people working out. Weaposre all dferent. We all get dferent results at dferent times. Weaposre constantly scrolling on Instagram looking at all these people and asking why we donapost look like that. People donapost look like that  .  Embrace every emotion Itaposs fun getting into shape and getting fit and strong, but weaposre all going to make mistakes. Without failure what is success  Itaposs the perfect opportunity to learn from it. Le isnapost rosy  . If you keep going after a failure youapose not just strong physically but emotionally and mentally. Learn the basics and the correct form While itaposs tempting just to jump in and hit the ground running, Steve says itaposs vital to make sure youaposve got the basics down before you start working towards your big goal. This means learning the techniques and making sure youaposre doing things correctly. If form isnapost right youaposre going to get injured which can put people off all together and set them back. A lot of time ego takes ovr. People are worried about what they can lt rather than how they do it. Donapost forget about your food While itaposs easy just to sign up to a load of gym classes, Steve highlights that you need to work across the boardyou really want to see changes. Without the proper nutrition you can train all you want but itaposs not going to work.

I’m not coming here and saying this or that.“They are  points clear of us in the league, deservedly so, so they are doing a lot right.“They are the ones at the top of the league so credit to them but we showed why we should be so disappointed that we are so far behind.“There is a real belief we should have come away with three points.“Performance-wise, it was night and day from what we have given in previous derbies.“But it is the result that is the important thing and we are disappointed that we never got all three points.“It was important to show to our fans that we can turn up and dig in when we need to.“I thought some of the stuff we played was brilliant. In the second half, I thought we were excellent.“Graham Dorrans and Fin Robertson controlled everything that happened in the game.“Disappointment is the over-riding emotion probably but I might look back over it and say: ‘You know what, a point after going behind so early is good.’“But there is just real disappointment over how superior we were in the second half but we have not got the win.”After Nicky Clark had put United in front after just five minutes, the away side came back into the contest after the break with Dorrans smashing in a low volley shortly after the restart to open his scoring account for the club.James added: “It was a lovely goal.“He has getting himself into positions where keepers are pulling off world-class saves.“He is getting close to full fitness. His body is good and he plays  minutes.“You are seeing a bit of dig, as well. There is no fear there from someone who has had two years out with a knee injury.“I know exactly what has gone on with his knee and ankle because I have been so close to him.“Seeing him flying into tackles, you are pleased that there is no holding back and that he’s walking away from it.“Listen, Graham Dorrans is too good for this league. That is why we are delighted to have him.”The Dens gaffer is also delighted to have Dorrans around to help with the development of -year-old Robertson after the youngster put in an accomplished display in his first-ever Dundee derby.“It has been a bit of a learning experience for Fin to have both Graham and Paul McGowan in the same midfield as him,” added James.“Looking back, I probably shouldn’t have left him out of the previous derby at Tannadice.“I’ve been advised not to say it because maybe you are doubting yourself but, looking back, I shouldn’t have done it because he has proved how consistent he can be. Big games don’t faze him.“I put him out there because he is one of my better players and deserves it.“He needs help but he is getting it.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/11/5dd654f1b50c52.55400866-558x372.jpg ","title":"dundee city council spends more than 500k on christmas lights over last three years","story":"Dundee City Council has spent more than half a million pounds on Christmas lights since .The figures, obtained through a Freedom of Information Request by the Eveningshow how much money the local authority has spent on the festive lights for the years  ,   and  .In  , £,. was spent, which increased to £,. in  .For the year   they spent £,..

because a lot of them have done very well this season.#Lawrence is the obvious one because of his goals but the two young full-backs have done really well and the goalie has been outstanding, too.“So I would imagine a number of clubs and other managers have been watching us.“The chairman has stated all along that the most important thing is to be promoted so we can’t afford to be making too many changes in January.”Robbie, however, conceded that everyone has their pricetheir resolve is tested.He added: “Obviously in football, everyone has their price and clubs are selling clubs – even Celtic and Rangers fall into that bracket.“That’s the business model of every club in Scotland, you give players the  to play.“Everyone’s got their price but the price of going up would outweigh what we’d get you’d imagine.“There is pressure on players because of people watching them and speculation but you have to handle that as a footballer.“I’d rather have that than sitting down the bottom of the

These were # and indeed remain # a #must have# for everyone who navigates their way among the many lochs and islands of Scotland#s west coast. They were colloquially known as the #Blue Book# and published at that time as a hardback. He also served as CCC Rear Commodore -.#Mr Brown also provided an extract from the book #Clyde Cruising Club, The First One Hundred Years -# which states Ralph Mowat received an RYA Award for services to yachting in  but refused to accept honorary membership of the club. In recompense, his widow Mary was elected an honorary member in , after his death.Tighnabruaich man Alan Wilson contacted Clyde sailing legend Ian Nicolson, who was fairly sure he recalled racing against the #Fulmar# in the s.Mr Nicolson said:#Old Man Mowat, as I remember him, was a typical ex Royal Navy officer. He treated me as a young upstart, which I was, but we got on well because I wrote a bit for Clyde Cruising Club publications. He lived in Clarkston on the edge of Glasgow.#Clyde Cruising Club itself cannot help with information on the Fulmar.

just two years.Persecution of the iconic birds as well as changes in land use had led to numbers dropping across the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway in recent decades.Ahead of the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project being launched almost two years ago it was believed that there were only two-to-four breeding pairs left across the whole area.Conservationists had identied enough habitat spread across the two rural local authority regions to comfortably cater for as many as  birds.Eaglets were taken from nests in the north of Scotland by ornithologists to prepare for release in the south.In early  five custom built aviaries were constructed in the Southern Upland hills to allow the first of the eaglets to become accustomed to the new territory.While the work of bringing a new generation of golden eagles to the Borders continued, outreach officers staged school and community visits to provide education on the endangered species.This month, with four eagles now successfully introduced to the south of Scotland, bosses at the project revealed that , people have now supported their work by either volunteering or taking part in the outreach sessions.Philip Munro, community outreach officer for the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project, told us: ldquoIt is fantastic to see so many people are so passionate about protecting this iconic species in the south of Scotland.\"We are absolutely delighted with the support, which plays an absolutely vital role in protecting golden eagles.\"We need to keep building on this so that we can ensure that we can see even more of these magnicent birds across the south of Scotlandrsquos skies for generations to come.Funded by Heritage Lottery and LEADER Scottish Borders and DG, the project aims to bring together all countryside users

south of Scotland and one in the Scottish Highlands, Borders College, the Scottish Raptor Study Group, Kielder Bird of Prey Centre, HMP Dumfries, and local businesses like Wild Tree Adventures.Earlier this year, the Philiphaugh Estate near Selkirk also announced that it plans to open a Golden Eagle Centre which will support the projectrsquos conservation and community engagement work.Francesca Osowska, Scottish Natural Heritagersquos chief executive, said: ldquoThis is a fantastic milestone.\"Golden eagles are such an amazing part of Scotlandrsquos bioersity, and an integral part of building a nature-rich country for us all.\"Wersquore passionate about ing golden eagles to places where they used to be plentul ndash and it looks like we have thousands of people on our side!\"A huge thank you to all the wonderful volunteers and project participants.The first four birds which were moved to the area have settled into their new habitats and are now fending for themselves.Support from volunteers and participants plays a pivotal role in helping the iconic species continue to grow and thrive in the area.One volunteer was shortlisted as Student of the Year by the Scottish Rural College, largely for her work on the project.Charlotte Martin, a Countryside Management student at SRUC, first heard about the Project when Philip Munro delivered a talk at the college.She said: ldquoHaving previously worked in areas where golden eagles were part of the fabric of the area and very much accepted and admired, alongside my career in farming with employers who farmed commercially yet with great respect for wildle, I was very excited by the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Projectrsquos aims.\"I badgered the project team to let me volunteer and have since been helping at public engagement events, which I thoroughly enjoy.As well as colleges, the outreach team have also visited many schools across the Borders.Michelle Hoppeacute, principal teacher for Yarrow

Ireland will resume on Thursday morning.The latest process, which was initiated in the wake of the general election, was paused over the festive period after a pre-Christmas deal failed to materialise.Three years on from the collapse of the devolved government, the Stormont parties have until a January  deadline to strike a deal to revive the institutions.On that date, legislation to give civil servants additional powers to run Northern Irelandrsquos struggling public services expires and Secretary of State Julian Smith will assume a legal obligation to call a snap Assembly election.The latest push to restore powersharing broke up the week before Christmas, with UK and Irish governments singling out the DUP as the party standing in the way of a deal.The party rejected the claims, insisting it would not be ldquobounced into a ldquoquick fix that falls apart when tested.--vw,vw,px, px\"Round table talks at Stormont House before Christmas failed to secure a breakthrough --Devolution can only be restored once the DUP and Sinn Fein ndash the regionrsquos two largest parties ndash agree terms to re-enter a mandatory coalition executive in Belfast.The other three main parties ndash the SDLP, Ulster Unionists and Alliance ndash are also involved in the talks process convened by the UK and Irish governments.While they could take positions in any new executive, their sign-off on a deal is not essential and a government could be formed in their absence, with those parties having the option of going into opposition.Expectations of a breakthrough rose after the DUP and Sinn Fein both suffered bruising results in the general election.With many interpreting the outcome as a public judgment on the partiesrsquo failure to do a deal, stalled efforts to restore the institutions appeared to gain fresh momentum in December.However, proposals to reform a contentious cross-community voting mechanism in the Assembly have emerged as a key sticking point in efforts to finalise an agreement, with the DUP unhappy about what is being countenanced.The DUP is also seeking changes to ensure the devolved institutions are more stable in future and cannot be readily pulled down.Proposed legislative protections for Irish language speakers are another crucial element of the negotiations.The Stormont parties are also seeking firm commitments from the UK government on a financial package to accompany theof devolution ndash money that would likely be targeted at the regionrsquos crisis-hit health service.--vw,vw,px, px\"Simon Coveneyspeaking with Julian Smith during a meeting last year --Irelandrsquos deputy premier Simon Coveney and Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith were in Belfast on New Yearrsquos Day for pre-talks discussions ahead of the resumption of formal exchanges with the political parties.Mr Coveney urged the parties to show leadership and generosity.He said the new year offered a chance for a new beginning and urged all sides not to disappoint the public again.The leaders of the DUP and Sinn Fein used their respective new year messages to restate a desire toto government.DUP leader Arlene Foster said her party stood ready to restore devolution through a ldquofair and balanced deal.ldquoA Northern Ireland that is going to keeping moving forward must be one where everyone feels at home but must also be one where no one feels their culture is being marginalised, she said.While Ms Foster warned that a focus on a potential border poll would lead to a ldquowasted decade, Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald insisted a united Ireland was within reach.But the republican leader added: ldquoThere is no contradiction in working for Irish unity and working for the restoration of the Executive and Assembly ndash they are all part of the Good Friday Agreement.ldquoThe outstanding issues can be resolved. The time for acrimony and ision is over. The time for slogans and soundbites is over. The test now for every party that has talked up getting back to work is to go back to the Executive table and deliver.Stormont imploded three years ago this month when the late Sinn Fein deputy first minister Martin McGuinness resigned in protest at the DUPrsquos handling of a botched green energy scheme.That dispute soon widened to encompass traditional rts over issues such the Irish language and the toxic legacy of the Troubles.A logjam over proposals to reform the petition of concern voting mechanism was one of the main reasons a deal failed to materialise before Christmas.It was designed to protect minority rights but politicians have accused each other of misusing it for their own ends.Discussions around change are focused on making it more dficult for one party to use the petition to block controversial legislation.The parties are also considering amending Assembly rules to make it harder to collapse the institutions..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Talks resume to restore NI powersharing"},{"url":null,"title":"carlos-ghosn-spend-rest-life-lebanon","story":"Having long protested his innocence, former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn has committed a clear crime by jumping bail and can neverto Japan without going to jail.ldquoSo he now has burnt his bridges to Japan, Stephen Givens, a lawyer and expert on Japanrsquos legal and corporate systems, said on Wednesday. ldquoThis is going to end in basically a stalemate with him spending the rest of his le in Lebanon.How exactly Mr Ghosn fled surveillance in Japan and emerged in Lebanon, or who might have directed the dramatic escape, remains unclear.The Tokyo District Court revoked his bail, Japanese media reports said, meaning authorities would seize the . billion yenMr Ghosn had posted on two separate instances to get out of detention.Mr Ghosn was first arrested in November , released and then rearrested.The court was closed for the New Yearrsquos holidays on Thursday and could not be immediately reached for comment.Mr Ghosn had been out on bail while awaiting trial on ious financial misconduct allegations.

He promised to talk to reporters next week.He said he wanted to avoid ldquoinjustice and political persecution.ldquoI am now in Lebanon and will no longer be held hostage by a rigged Japanese justice system where guilt is presumed, discrimination is rampant, and basic human rights are denied, in flagrant disregard of Japanrsquos legal obligations under international law and treaties it is bound to uphold, the statement said.--vw,vw,px, px\"Carlos Ghosn: Details of his daring escape from Japan may be confirmed in a promised talk with reporters next week --His lawyer Junichiro Hironaka denied all knowledge of the escape, saying he was stunned.

One report said he sneaked out from his Tokyo home hiding in a case for a musical instrument.Lebanonrsquos minister for presidential affairs, Selim Jreissati, told the An-Nahar newspaper that Mr Ghosn entered legally at the airport with a French passport and Lebanese ID.France has reacted with surprise and confusion, denying any knowledge.Speculation is re that a foreign or Japanese government, or both, might have been involved, or maybe simply turned a blind eye to allow the escape and spare the public from a potentially embarrassing trial.With him missing, Mr Ghosnrsquos trial is suspended.But a trial is still pending against Nissan as a company and Greg Kelly, another Nissan executive. Mr Kelly, an American, has said he is innocent.Mr Kellyrsquos allegations overlap with those charges against Mr Ghosn related to the under-reporting of Mr Ghosnrsquos future compensation.

It is a scary premonition.ldquoYoursquore just getting old, was a recent diagnosis from a family member! It was said with affection, of course, yet the ring of truth gave it an unhelpful sting. Age, of course, is just a number and state of mind and I have much to keep me youthful.What did help was meeting up with an old friend last week. As we sat together sharing memories of our youth and the shenanigans we got up to  years ago, I had a disorientating sense of time. It seemed impossible that so many years had passed since the moments we remembered had taken place. Those moments were so present for us. As another clicheacute says, it was asit was yesterday.We both complimented each other on how young we looked but I think this was because we both saw the younger person underneath the wrapping made by time. Society judges so much by appearance, we all do. But when we meet an old friend, even when we have not been in touch for many years, we see the person we knew, eventhe exterior has changed. As the philosopher Henry David Thoreau once said: ldquoItrsquos not what you look at that matters, itrsquos what you see.Who can say honestly they have not judged someone because of what they look like  I am as guilty as anyone . As I said, we all do it on the bus, in the queue at the supermarket while we wait our turn, everywhere. We glimpse at people, avoiding eye contact, but making immediate judgement on the way they look. Sometimes itrsquos negative, sometimes envious, sometimes positive and admiring but always superficial. And I know, like everyone , I too am likewise judged.Itrsquos a human habit, perhaps a primeval instinct in which we must quickly judge people for our safety. But of course outward appearance gives no clue to someonersquos character and real qualities. We must know something of that person first before we can judge on that.And this means seeing beyond what we look at. And to do this we need eye contact, a smile, a friendly gesture and the exchange of some words. We need to connect to the person inside. And the irony is, while there are more of us than ever sharing ever-bigger spaces, we are ever more disconnected from each other.The truth Irsquove come to realise is that you donrsquot have to be an old friend with someone to see their inner self, you just need to see beyond what appears to you. We have another primeval instinct and that is to detect the warmth of a character. But we cannot do thatwe only see what we look at and make no attempt to connect.My resolution, even before New Year, is to do this more often. To smile, say some friendly words and not judge or assume things. I think we actually all need more of this, with people we donrsquot know as much as those we do.As someone once said, a stranger is a friend you havenrsquot met yet. Well maybe you have, but you just havenrsquot spoken to them or really seen them for who they are."},{"url":null,"title":"talented-ross-high-school-pupil-reaches-futurechef-finals","story":"Bartek Kocot, an S pupil at the school, cooked up a winning meal for judges and will now represent East Lothian at the regional level of the competition, organised by Springboard FutureChef to inspire young people to cook.Bartek was chosen to represent Ross High at the heat because of the standard of his cooking in class and his efforts to practise dishes outside of school hours.He competed against four other pupils at the school in their own heat, then in round two competed at an event at Edinburgh College, Granton Campus last Thursday against pupils from secondary schools in Edinburgh and the Lothians.The dishes were judged by professional chefs Glyn Stevens, Stephen Frost and David Bell.Due to his success, he will now compete in the penultimate round of the competition ndash the regional finals, which will take place in Glasgow on February  ndash ahead of the national finals, which are held in London later next year.His dishes were: herb and panko crusted cod with mashed potato, sweet potato with a parmesan crisp and berry poached pear with cookie snap biscuit and cream cheese.Jenner Hart, home economics teacher at the school, said: ldquoWe are all so proud of Bartek, especially as he designed the dessert himself.ldquoThe judges normally only choose one pupil out of Edinburgh and the Lothians however, they said that the standard of dishes was so high that they decided to choose Bartek from East Lothian and Katie from Castlebrae Community High to represent Edinburgh City.ldquoThey said they were very impressed and that they have never seen such a high standard of dishes at the local final.ldquoWe were lucky enough to have executive training chef from the Apex Hotel John Newton as Bartekrsquos mentor so thank you to him for all his expertise and support.Ross High headteacher Paul Reynolds said: ldquoI am thrilled for Bartek.

Among the steps being considered is the creation of a -space car park between Woodbush and Church Street.Furthermore, the councilrsquos transportation team is looking at the possibility of extending the car park at the railway station, which has  spaces, while potentially putting time restrictions on the car park at Abbeylands, which is home to more than  spaces.A planning application for the new car park, which would be accessed by Lamer Street and Woodbush, has been submitted by the local authority to its own planning department.The car park, which is described as being on land adjacent to the Coastguard Cottages, could also provide parking for the nearby Assembly Rooms, which have long been earmarked for development.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said: ldquoThe proposed car park is promoted to meet demand and to compensate for future road space enhancement within Dunbar town centre. It has also previously been identied that the Coastguard site could potentially provide parking for any new flats in the Assembly Rooms.A metal staircase linking the car park to the adjacent Church Street and the town centre is also included as part of the proposals.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, had mixed thoughts on the scheme.She said: ldquoLargely, there is a demand for parking.ldquoHowever, these car parking spaces would require traffic to move past a very small group of cottages that have enjoyed a degree of privacy in effectively a cul-de-sac all the time they have been there.ldquoInitial messages I have had from residents are of horror.ldquoThe prospect is that green space will be tarmacked over and become a pretty signicant car parking lot.The spokeswoman for the local authority highlighted the proposed car park was part of a wider project surrounding parking in the town.She said: ldquoThe project that transportation is considering has nothing to do with the Assembly Rooms but rather a straight forward look at available space to act as long stay and to change Abbeylands parking to short stay.ldquoThe council is currently negotiating with Transport Scotland and Network Rail to increase the capacity of the rail station car park to stop indiscriminate parking on local streets.

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road. Hopefully the improvements will manage that well.ldquoI continue to have concerns about developments being put in place with inadequate attention to overall infrastructure needs and the impact on surrounding residents.Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, added: ldquoThough we do not want this amount of housing in this location, we hope that the improved junction will channel much of the traffic generated onto the A and away from Musselburgh.ldquoThere are already serious traffic problems at the bottom end of Monktonhall Road and at the Tesco roundabout. Evenjust some of the traffic from the development around QMU comes this way to access facilities in Musselburgh, we fear the road system will clog up totally.ldquoWe have no problem with the junction improvements. Our issue is with the amount of housing proposed, which is totally inappropriate.Councillor John Williamson added: ldquoThe planned developments will technically be part of Musselburgh, although the vast majority of the new housing will be on the western side of the A with the only direct access to Musselburgh itself, as far as Irsquom aware, restricted to public transport and cycle pedestrian access.ldquoThe only full vehicle access will be via Newcraighall or Old Craighall Roundabout, which means that it will be dficult for the new communities to feel an integral part of Musselburgh.A spokesperson for QMU said: ldquoWe welcome news of the approval of planning permission for the A QMU road junction which will help unlock the full potential of the site for the development of the Innovation Park.ldquoQMU chose to move to East Lothian partly because of the opportunities to work with employers to develop the land immediately adjacent to the new campus.ldquoThe decision is the

had caused a ision between neighbouring community councils and saw nearly  objections lodged with East Lothian Council.And at a meeting of the local authorityrsquos planning committee last Wednesday, the proposal was rejected against the advice of council officials after planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire branded the development a ldquobad neighbour.Mr Hampshire told fellow committee members that he was concerned that allowing Skyrora to test rocket engines on the land, which is central to the councilrsquos future economic plans, could put other investors off.He said: ldquoThis is not a good neighbour ndash it is a bad neighbour development and my concern is this may deter potential investors from taking on development at the Cockenzie site.Skyrora had lodged an application to create a rocket engine testing site on the land, which is owned by the local authority, with plans to carry out five -second tests each month.But while it applied for temporary use of the site for five years, Skyrora told the planning committee that it envisaged the possibility of not just expanding its presence in the community but potentially bringing a manufacturing facility, described as the size of an Ikea store, to the area.And while Prestonpans Community Council supported the move as offering potential for jobs and the economy, neighbouring Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council objected.At the planning committee meeting last week, Bryan Hickman, chairman of Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council, recalled a public meeting in the summer which attracted several hundred people.He said: ldquoVirtually everyone who was there was against it ndash ranging from our youngest residents to pensioners.ldquoThe feeling, rightly or wrongly, in the community is that they do not want it.During the council meeting, residents raised concerns about the storage of key elements of fuel on the site for days prior to testing, as well as the impact of burning kerosene into the atmosphere.While Skyrora insisted that the engine tests would be a ldquoclean burn producing mainly water, resident and biochemist Dr Brian Hall told the committee that he estimated about , litres of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide could be released during each -second test.Calum Miller, on behalf of Prestonpans Community Council, urged councillors to approve the plans, pointing out that the power station site had lain empty now for six years.He told them: ldquoThe council has the opportunity with this Skyrora application to dispel the myth that we are too remote from Edinburgh to attract business.Ward councillors Fiona OrsquoDonnell, Lachlan Bruce and Neil Gilbert did not support the application.Ms OrsquoDonnell said that the impact on local amenity would be unacceptable and spoke of the ldquohigh level of public concern from constituents about the proximity of the test site to housing ndash the nearest of which was estimated at  metres away.Councillors rejected the planning application by six votes to two.The decision was welcomed by Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council chairman Mr Hickman, who said: ldquoThe community is very pleased about the decision as expressed on social media and meeting residents as I go about.ldquoI felt that we presented a strong case against the application.ldquoThe councillors present gave a fair and balanced summary before coming to their decision. The community thanks the ward councillors who called in the application.ldquoIf this did not go before the committee, it would have been approved by East Lothian Council planning department.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said that he hoped the council would now turn attention to calls for a cruise port at the former power station site, which has been supported by his members. He said: ldquoI am disappointed that local ward councillors went against the advice of their council officers on this planning application.ldquoHopefully this will focus East Lothian Council councillors and officials on pushing forward the cruise port initiative to secure much-needed jobs in East Lothian.And his community council colleague Mr Miller criticised councillors for failing to listen to their officials.He said: ldquoIt was patently obvious that councillors on the planning committee couldnrsquot get their heads around the nuances of decibels and emissions.ldquoThey should have fallen back on advice from their own experienced officials. Instead, they repeated the junk science coming from cranks in Cockenzie.ldquoEach test would have generated the same emissions as a family car running for a year. The councillors who referenced a climate emergency in defence of their decision were only too happy to drive home from Haddington.ldquoAn ecosystem of space technology companies could have emerged in East Lothian based around the testbed.ldquoThe wilful ignorance of a few has pulled opportunity for the hands of young people in East Lothian.Derek Harris, from Skyrora, said he was disappointed by the decision of the planning committee.It is understood the company will take time to consider whether to appeal the decision.Mr Harris said: ldquoI would like to thank all the staff at East Lothian Council who helped with our application.

My we and kids were with me carrying the crisps and goodies when the absence of sound coming from my friendrsquos flat made me suddenly realise Irsquod mucked up.Turning up on a doorstep with drinks and snacks for a party that had already taken place was a potentially awkward moment.ldquoI wondered where you were yesterday, my friend said, ldquoas you were so sure you were all coming.Kate, my we, who normally keeps me organised, looked at me in a way that expressed horried disbelief and lack of surprise at the same time. But what could have been an embarrassing and disappointing evening became a wonderful and quite moving experience.My friend is Jewish. She is not religious but she observes Jewish festivals and traditions as part of her inheritance and identity. And the day we arrived was December , which in  was the first day of Hanukkah, also called the lsquofestival of lightsrsquo. There is not a fixed date for this celebration as the time is based on the cycle of the moon, as many celebrations from other religious traditions are.We were askedwe would like to take part and we were honoured to do so. By tradition, the youngest in the room lights the candle, so my four-year-old son, with help, did so.The evening was full of meaning and unexpected closeness with an old friend. There was a feeling of shared sacredness in the antiquity of the ceremony, and the meaning of the story behind Hanukkah, like many religious stories, can be interpreted in dferent ways by the people who hold that faith.But at its core is the story of the miracle of the lamp that, despite only having oil enough for one night, burned for eight days and eight nights. The lamp was lit as a dedication to a desecrated temple, thereby signalling the restoration of religious freedom, and hence the name festival of lights.As we left our friendrsquos house into a cold and calm night, Kate told me she had forgiven me, as otherwise we would not have had such a meaningful and memorable evening.It happened to be also the Winter Solstice and this is a turning point in the year. Hanukkah isnrsquot specically about seasonal change but the idea of sharing the light in this dark time is a common theme.I imagined our ancestors huddling together in their ancient dwellings during the shortest day, knowing the dark was now at its worst, and soon the light would begin to . Le would come back to the land and the days become longer. But in the meantime, ways were needed to keep the dark at bay.Today we challenge the darkness with decorative seasonal lights. But we also have super-lit shopping centres, bright street lights and, hopefully, warm and lit homes.But in celebrating this time, it seems the seasonal bling of the corporate money-makers is becoming the new ritual. They promote the idea that celebrating together should be bigger and better every year that those who want to feel included need to buy the ticket for the big event.And indeed, much fun can be had at such events. But have we reached a point where traditions have become marketing labels rather than authentic shared experiences  Some people now have to acquire tickets from a company to celebrate in their own street, although thankfully not yet in East Lothian.The idea of being bigger and better means bigger crowds, which means more profit but not necessarily a better experience. Big crowds need to be restricted and controlled, meaning others are excluded. Have we reached the point whereyou donrsquot have a ticket then you canrsquot be part of the tradition We can enjoy big events while still having our own traditions, of course, but my feeling is that the idea of tradition is being hijacked by a commercial juggernaut with little authenticity or meaning other than making money.And so I think the unexpected evening with my friend taught me a lesson I hope I already knew: that the traditions we really value, and the memories we truly treasure, are the simple ones of shared meaningful connection. And perhaps the biggest treasure is sharing with those who would otherwise be excluded.And so wherever you are, whatever you do, I hope you find time to share these moments at this time of seasonal celebration. Whatever your faith or spirituality, whatever your family or cultural traditions, I wish you a Happy New Year and I look forward to theof the sun, and sharing with you new adventures of discovery in our beautul county."},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-youngsters-thank-lifeboat-crew-saving-lives","story":"Rachel Pirie and Luke Foster, both , were exploring the townrsquos clfs with Chloe McCaw, , at about noon on November  last year when the incident happened.The rising water levels left the youngsters, who all live in Dunbar and attend Dunbar Grammar School, cut off with no food, no water and one working mobile phone that did not have any credit.Police and Coastguard crews struggled to locate them.Talking about their ordeal, Rachel said: ldquoWe know the area well and the tide was well out so we thought we were safe.

The Kidney Flowers - Small FingersThis is a stomping, trashy, punky, rfing cracker that has been rehashed from an old self-released EP and sounds like a mighty collision of the Pixies, The Fall, The Walkmen and the Wedding Present in one blistering cut from the stunning debut album from the three-piece Glasgow musically primitive fast food enthusiasts who just might be my new favourite garage combo. Watch out Idles. Lewis Capaldi - Someone You LovedWhoever broke the Bathgate crooners Heart has made him millions. A number one single across the world from that the guy next door whose music has no bearing on his crazy social media appearances. Blanck Mass - House vs HouseA scream and a percussive rapid-fire vocal sample ushers in this eight-minute house-tinged synth epic and first single from the cracking fourth album of Benjamin John Power, who is also half of electro noise duo F*ck Buttons. The Edinburgh-based electro fiend topped this list last year with Odd Scene.TNGHT - SerpentHot Glasgow producer Hudson Mohawkes and Canadian producer Lunice make a welcome comeback after helping to usher in trap seven years ago, to produce this bone-shudderingly spiralling pulp of warped bass and percussion topped off with what sounds like an native American war cry.

The newcomer managed to sell out the legendary King Tuts Wah Wah Hut without having released any music at all online, a feat previously accomplished by Lewis Capaldi. Steve Mason - RocketThe best compliment you could pay this soaring standout about love, depression, disappointment and ultimately hope from the fourth solo album by the former front man of The Beta Band is it is the kind of dramatic epic that would not sound out of place on his previous bands acclaimed Three EPs.

Hideo Kojima, the game creator, said: \"You can cry just by listening to this song.\" Its not just hype. Anna Meredith - Inhale ExhaleLondon-born and Edinburgh-bred composer, performer and producer gave her twist on Vivaldis Four Seasons last year, only to show this year she can create a wonderfully hypnotic synth-pop song and sing on what is an instant highlight from her mercurial FIBS album.The song is underpinned with lyrics exploring a more sinister and pessimistic take on what lsquolivingrsquo or having a lsquowild timersquo might be like for \"a cautious person like myself\".She sings:\"You say yoursquore dancing in the deep end, but to me it looks like drowning\". C Duncan - Talk Talk TalkThe sublime opening track from the third album from the Glasgow musician and the first away from his bedroom studio, also moved him away from his introspective art pop on this, into synth pop gem territory. But typical of the Scot who received a Mercury Prize nomination for his debut album Architect, it remains sounding like nothing  around, with signature layered harmonies and a gorgeous hooksome middle eight.ldquoTalk Talk Talk is about miscommunication. Itrsquos about not realising that yoursquore actually on the same page as someone and how a misperception can drive you apart. However, itrsquos also about realising this and rebuilding bridges,\" Duncan says. Wuh Oh - Pretty Boy Glasgow-producer Wuh Oh, aka Peter Ferguson teams up with Hudson Mohawke for a mindblowingly original classical meets post-electro music with cellos and xylophones thrown in for good measure.\"One day something in my brain exploded and it was asI could suddenly see what made the chord progressions and melodies work.

He died ten years after the footage was shot as the result of a tragic car accident. \"I drew a lot of inspiration from Michael to write this song, that no matter when we think weve lost someone, they still live within us, in the curve of an eye, through theof a nose, through our mannerisms, we will carry them forever,\" she says.Top  Tunes from Scotland in  Part  Top  Tunes from Scotland in  Part  Top  Tunes from Scotland in  Part  This is the Spoty playlist.This is the YouTube playlist."},{"url":null,"title":"people-decade-20-movers-shakers-history-makers","story":"In , Time Magazine named its person of the year as \"the silence breakers\". McGowan was just one of those many women who stepped forward to make accusations about Harvey Weinstein that year. She was there at the beginning of a series or revelations about the producer which would snowball into a global sharing of stories of womens experience of sexual assault and harassment that would be called #MeToo.If anyone became a figurehead, it was McGowan. She may not have come up with the term Me Too ndash that was Tarana Burke back in . Nor was she the person to put the hashtag out into the ocean of social media ndash that was Alyssa Milano, her co-star from Charmed. But she made her mark as someone who would not be silenced. She has also claimed that she was the first person to out Weinstein.#MeToo was a cultural revolution and catharsis. Back in , when it broke, it felt asHollywood and the many fields where men were protected by their power and influence would never be the same again. In this revolution around what women should tolerate, who would be listened to, and what should be shamed, McGowan stood out. She wrote a memoir, Brave. She used her anger as a weapon. In an interview with the Times, she asked, \"Who has been more effective  hellip Playing nice for women hasnt got us very far.\"Weinstein recently complained that he was \"a forgotten man\". With his trial coming up next month ndash five charges, including two counts of rape ndash he might wish he were more forgotten than he is. #MeToo might have experienced backlash and criticism. But out of it did come much that was positive and inspirational, particularly the courage of the women who came forward. McGowan embodies that. Her voice carried the message that the time when abusers could expect silence was over.VICKY ALLANPHOEBE WALLER-BRIDGE, ACTOR, WRITER AND PRODUCERSpeaking to The Herald recently, Scottish actress Ellie Haddington recalled her time working on The Cafe, a Sky One sitcom which aired in . It starred The Royle Familys Ralf Little alongside Haddington and Littles co-writer Michelle Terry. But it was another cast member, then an unknown -year-old actress, who particularly caught Haddingtons eye. \"I can remember looking at her,\" she said, \"and thinking: My God, what an extraordinary inidual.\" The inidual in question was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, in her first major role.Fast forward eight years and the London-born polymath has the world at her feet, particularly the part that houses the gilded constituencies that hand out Emmys and Golden Globes. The  Golden Globe ceremony is on January  in Beverly Hills and Waller-Bridge is up for two awards. Ten days later shell be honoured at the Screen Actors Guild Awards where shes nominated in two categories. Andshe flies home laden with mantelpiece accessories it wont be the first time ndash she scooped three Golden Globes at last years award as well as three Primetime Emmys.If not, well theres the not insignicant matter of the th James Bond film, No Time to Die, to be released in April. Waller-Bridge co-wrote the script and great things are expected. Of coursetheres one production on which Waller-Bridges name is indelibly stamped its Fleabag, written by and starring her as a young Londoner navigating family, work, sex and relationships with brutal honesty and unsettling humour.Starting out as a one-woman show at the Edinburgh Fringe, it was turned into a TV series in  but was dropped quietly onto BBC Three, then only available online. But word-of-mouth is still a powerful tool even in our digital age and by the summer it had been relaunched on BBC Four. The rest is television history: when we look back at this decades television, well be splitting it into pre and post-Fleabag.Even more interestingly, Waller-Bridge followed that triumph with one of the career curve-balls weve now come to expect: an adaptation of Luke Jenningss Villanelle spy novel series. Retitled Killing Eve it was fresh, funny, thrillingly violent and gratuitously fashion-forward, and made a star of lead actress Jodie Comer, whose pink Molly Godard tulle dress became the go-to Halloween costume for hipsters everywhere. And, of course, it hauled in yet more gongs for its writer.:Books of the decade: From Harper Lee and Hilary Mantel to EL JamesWill it be third time lucky with No Time to Die  Dont ever bet against Phoebe Waller-Bridge.BARRY DIDCOCKANDY MURRAY, TENNIS PLAYERSmall, wet, overweight countries should not ndash and usually do not ndash produce tennis superstars. As only those from other small countries can appreciate ndash the Jamaicans and Swiss, perhaps ndash possessing a global sports hero somehow makes your whole nation stand a little taller.Thats exactly what Andy Murray has done for Scotland . Is there any feeling comparable to the buzz of watching Murray play a big match, willing him to win with every demented fibre of your mind and body  I think not.And yet the Dunblane-born champion is not only from Scotland, but very much of his homeland. During the late Noughties, the young, gangly, wild-haired Murray thrilled us with his impressive Wimbledon runs. But as the years went on and he just missed out on a slew of grand slam trophies, many English media outlets and tennis fans took against him, decrying the sweary intensity and dry Scottish banter. This only made Scots love him more, of course.Eventually, with patience, maturity, courage and sheer hard graft came the top honours in tennis ndash the US Open, two Wimbledon singles titles, two Olympic gold medals, the Davis Cup, the coveted world number one spot ndash and global adulation.But as much as he grew as a sportsman, whats equally remarkable about Murray is how he grew as person. Indeed, it is his openness, humanity and humility, the way he speaks out against sexism in tennis, that make him a true hero, loved by his peers and the public, rather than simply respected.A devastating hip injury ndash and subsequent resurfacing operation ndash nearly ended Murrays career, and his recent comeback has been both painful and inspiring to watch.Murray taught Scots to dream big. But the father of three also taught Scots men, in particular, showing your feelings, being true to yourself, makes you a bigger man in every way.MARIANNE TAYLORJEFF BEZOS, AMAZON CEOThe worlds richest man is fond of reminding people that he started Amazon in his garage. A company that is now worth more than pound trillion and employs in the region of , people began with Bezos packing books and taking them to the post office himself.Like Facebooks Mark Zuckerberg and Twitters Jack Dorsey, Bezos grasped early on the potential of the internet. That realisation has had huge consequences. Amazon has transformed shopping, helped hollow out the high street, and led to a fortune for its creator estimated at poundbn.That has allowed him to set up his own space exploration company and buy the Washington Post .Bezoss success cant be gainsayed, but at what cost  Employees have bitterly complained about working conditions, the EU is investigating the company for anti-trust violations and earlier this year it had to scrap plans to build a second headquarters in New York when local politicians questioned why a company making bna month should receive taxpayers cash to move to the city.Oh yes, and it was also revealed that the company had not paid any income tax in the US the previous year. Or the year before that. You dont get to be the richest man in the world by giving anything away, obviously.TEDDY JAMIESONDAVID BOWIE, MUSICIANIn the months after his death at the start of , as Britain voted for Brexit and America voted for Donald Trump, there was a spate of tweets wonderingBowies absence was now one of the reasons why everything was going to hell in a handcart.\"Im not saying that David Bowie was holding the fabric of the universe together, but *gestures broadly at everything*\" tweeted blogger Katie Liewy with tongue firmly in cheek in June that year.Whether his influence actually stretched that far, theres no doubt that culturally this decade was Bowies, in the same way as the s belonged to the Beatles. As Oasis looked to Lennon and McCartney in the mid-s, Bowie became the touchstone for any musician ndash from FKA Twigs to St Vincent ndash in the s who wanted to push the odd boundary.But none of them did it as well as the original, who ed at the start of , after almost a decade in which he had withdrawn from public view. He released a new single, Where Are We Now , on his birthday without any warning. It presaged a new album, The Next Day, and a VA retrospective, David Bowie Is. Three years later he released an album, Blackstar, on his th birthday. Two days later his death was announced. It was ashe was curating his own end.:From the death of Bowie to the rise of grime: The decade in pop musicFor anyone who knew him in the middle of the s the fact that Bowie avoided being a rock n roll casualty must have seemed a miracle given his copious drug intake back then.Instead, he weaned himself off them, created some of the most memorable and potent music of the late th century, reinvented himself as a mainstream pop star in the s, then became an elder statesman who embraced everything from drum n bass to the internet before his final st-century flourish.His is one of the great stories in pop and in  it came to a tragic yet magnicent conclusion.TEDDY JAMIESONELON MUSK, TECHNOLOGY ENTREPRENEURThe chronicles of self-styled maverick billionaire Elon Musk never fail to fascinate. Among his outlandish adventures and madcap musings, we have Elon and the space car Elon and the Thai cave rescue Elon and the dead gorilla novelty rap Elon and his plan to nuke Mars.South African-born Musk first pricked the public consciousness as a technology entrepreneur, investor and engineer in  when, aged , he sold his web software company, Zip, to Compaq for  million .He continued to ascend his field throughout the Noughties, but it is in the last decade that Musk has become a household name for his roles as founder chief engineer designer of SpaceX and the CEO product architect at Tesla.Granted, this is often more down to calamity than plaudits for his innovative work. Such as the cringe-inducing moment during a recent unveiling for the new Tesla Cybertruck when, demonstrating how tough the \"armour glass\" of the windows was to break, they were duly smashed.Or when he referred to British er Vernon Unsworth ndash who helped rescue  Thai boys trapped in a flooded underwater cave in  ndash as \"pedo guy\" on Twitter .Then theres Musks lofty plans to \"nuke Mars\" ndash which he describes as \"a fixer upper of a planet\" ndash suggesting that nuclear bombs should be detonated at its poles to melt the ice caps and allow it to sufficiently heat up for humans to dwell there.And the head-scratching moment when he dropped a track on SoundCloud called RIP Harambe, a heavily auto-tuned song about the Cincinnati Zoo gorilla whose death in  sparked a global outpouring of grief and anger.Sure, Musk sometimes loses credibility due to his more leftfield thinking ndash such as a belief that were all probably living in a giant computer simulation like The Matrix or a Sims-style game controlled by superior beings ndash but there is no denying that hes a clever guy who shouldnt be underestimated.If this is a simulation, we cant wait to see what our overlords get him to do next.SUSAN SWARBRICKMEGHAN MARKLE, DUCHESS OF SUSSEXSurely it wasnt meant to be like this. If you become a fairy tale princess can you not then expect to live happily ever after That hasnt been the case for Meghan Markle. Yes, she had the royal wedding last year attended by the great and the good and the merely famous. Yes, she got a title, a handsome prince and a royal baby . Not what she must have expected growing up a mixed-race kid in Los Angeles.And yet since the wedding there has found herself a constant target of the tabloid press. She recently filed a lawsuit against the Mail on Sunday for publishing a private letter to her estranged father. It also prompted her husband Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, to condemn the medias \"relentless propaganda\" which was, he said, often \"knowingly  and malicious\" in a public statement announcing the legal action.His anger is perhaps understandable given the paparazzis involvement in the death of his mother. \"Every single time I see a camera, every single time I hear a click, every single time I see a flash, it takes me straight back,\" he admitted this year.The Duchess of Sussexs major crime would appear to be that she has \"opinions\". There is a class of media commentator ndash mouthy, reactionary and perhaps most importantly white ndash who is offended by her feminism and likes to moan about the couples \"wokeness\". It has prompted \"the Queen\", or, rather, the TV version of the monarch, Olivia Colman, star of The Crown, to speak out against the critics.:From Leonard Bernsteinrsquos MASS to the GRIT Orchestra, Keith Bruces musical picks of the decade\"I dont know why theyre so mean to a fellow human being,\" Coleman said of the press coverage.Or maybe we simply have to accept there is no such thing as happy ever after.TEDDY JAMIESONGRETA THUNBERG, ENVIRONMENTAL CAMPAIGNER\"My name is Greta,\" a Swedish schoolgirl wrote on her flyers in . \"I am in ninth grade, and I am school-striking for the climate. Since you adults dont give a damn about my future, I wont either.\"Its hard to believe that it has only been just over a year since Thunberg ndash recognised now simply as \"Greta\" to millions ndash made her viral UN speech in Poland, saying, \"You say you love your children above all . And yet you are stealing their future in front of their very eyes.\"Thunberg may only have made her stamp in the final year of the decade, but at just  years old she has done more to provoke an attitude sht on environment than anyone, and she began it by skipping school.Her words and actions have woken millions of schoolchildren, four million of whom went on strike from school on September , as well as adults, to the science-backed threat of the climate emergency. On what is arguably the biggest issue of our time, hers is the voice that has led, upbraiding those in leadership. Margaret Atwood called her the Joan of Arc of environmentalism. Donald Trump told her to \"chill\". Collins Dictionary made \"climate strike\" its word of the year.Why did people listen to her, when others saying the same were ignored  Perhaps because of who she was ndash not an adult, scientist, politician or expert ndash and how she, a teenager with Aspergers Syndrome, delivered her message, politely, yet angrily and without softenings.To the UN General Assembly, in September, she said: \"We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you.\" She has started a powerful movement. The question is whether necessary change will follow. Can we alter the ending of this terrying nightmare  Thunberg dares us to.VICKY ALLANNICOLA STURGEON, FIRST MINISTER OF SCOTLANDBy the time Nicola Sturgeon became Scotlands first female First Minister in , at the age of , she had already been involved in politics for more than a quarter of a century.She joined the SNP in her native Ayrshire ndash then a Labour bastion ndash aged  at the height of the Thatcher years. It was the decisive first step on a journey that would transform not only the young Sturgeon but the fortunes of her party, and, ultimately, the political landscape in Scotland.After becoming an MSP in , Sturgeon, a solicitor by trade, impressed from the outset, serving in two shadow cabinets. In , she was elected deputy party leader to Alex Salmond during his second stint as party leader. The partnership was successful and in  the SNP won a majority at Holyrood, paving the way for s independence referendum.When Salmond resigned as SNP leader and First Minister in the aftermath of the Yes campaigns loss, Sturgeon was the obvious choice to replace him.:From Frozen to  Years a Slave, the best films of the last  yearsThe five years since have seen tumultuous change in UK politics, with Sturgeon growing in stature as politician and stateswoman, both in UK and European terms, even in the eyes of many who do not share her stance on independence. She regularly appears in glossy magazine lists of the worlds most influential women.During the recent General Election campaign her clear opposition to Brexit and impressive performances in TV debates ndash not to mention her lively Twitter feed ndash won her a whole new legion of fans in England, particularly among women. Will Sturgeon lead Scotland to independence in the s  That remains to be seen. Regardless, her place in Scottish history, as politician and role model, is guaranteed.MARIANNE TAYLORBARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATESThings might look dferent now. In , at the end of Barack Obamas second term in office, when commentators looked back at his legacy as president, there was a sense that his achievements were, at best, mixed.True, he had withdrawn US soldiers from Iraq, improved relations with Cuba, reached a nuclear deal with Iran and introduced Obamacare.Set against that, though, he escalated American military involvement in Afghanistan, increased drone strikes in Pakistan, saw wealth and income inequality rocket under his watch. Guantanamo Bay was still in operation when he left office and though he spoke out in favour of gun control he didnt manage to introduce it.Obama could point to Republican obstruction in the House of Congress. Even so there was a whf of missed opportunities about his presidency. Perhaps that was inevitable. In the end a centrist president was never going to live up to the utopian notions so many Americans projected on to him during the  election campaign.And yet, in retrospect, perhaps his achievements are growing. What has been missed over the last four years is his articulacy, eloquence, wit and normality.In part its because he represents the antithesis of what came after. An inarticulate, narcissistic, racist, corrupt old man whose first term has been a skip fire of the vanities ending in a vote for impeachment. Obama for all his failings always felt like he was an adult in the room. Can you say the same of Donald Trump TEDDY JAMIESONKIM KARDASHIAN WEST, REALITY TV STAR AND ENTREPRENEURLove her or loathe her, there is no denying that Kim Kardashian West ripped up the rule book in her rise to becoming a world-famous reality star with a multi-million-dollar business empire and a global fanbase.Having first found peripheral fame as a friend and stylist to heiress Paris Hilton in the early s, Kardashian West gained notoriety after the release of her sex tape with then-boyfriend Ray J in . That same year, the familys reality TV series, Keeping Up with the Kardashians, began airing.While the naysayers reckoned it would be a fleeting  minutes of fame, Kardashian West pulled off a shrewd and unparalleled move: she utilised social media to make herself into a brand. Today, her Midas touch extends across fashion, fragrances and cosmetics to television, books, gaming, and even law and politics. Oh, and she is queen of the selfie.An exaggerated hourglass figure and cartoonishly large backside have become a trademark for Kardashian West, garnering as many ndash and often more ndash column inches as her entrepreneurial ventures.: The best visual arts of the last  years, by Jan Patience and Sarah Urwin JonesIndeed, when Kardashian West posed for a  cover of Paper magazine with her rear bared and oiled up like a Greek wrestler, it saw a new phrase \"break the internet\" coined, referring to the frenzy that the images sparked.That same year, she joined her husband, the rapper Kanye West, for a landmark cover on Vogue magazine. \"There are a lot of firsts,\" Kardashian West said at the time. \"Kanyes the first rapper to be on, Im the first reality person to be on, were the first interracial couple.\"She continues to surprise people. Earlier this year, Kardashian West announced she was following in her late fathers footsteps by studying to become a lawyer .Kardashian West ndash who boasts  million social media followers on Instagram alone ndash seems determined to use her  and stratospheric public profilefor good, visiting US president Donald Trump at the Oval Office last year to discuss justice reform.She successfully lobbied Trump to grant clemency to Alice Johnson, a -year-old woman who spent  years in an Alabama prison, without parole, for a non-violent, first-time drug offence. Johnson was released in  and Kardashian West has vowed to tackle other miscarriage of justices.Her work to date makes for impressive reading. But in the scheme of things, one could argue that Kardashian West is only just getting started. With her husband having announced he intends to run for US president in , a decade from now this might all seem like small fry.SUSAN SWARBRICKSTORMZY, RAPPERWhy is Stormzy one of the most influential public figures of the last decade  There are  people you could ask ndash  black students who were admitted to Cambridge University in . Thats up about  per cent more than the  who started courses in .Not all of it is down to Stormzy, but a lot of it may be. In , the grime artist announced he would be paying the tuition fees and maintenance grants of two black Cambridge students, and this year he said hed be paying for two more. Its called the Stormzy Scholarship and now theyre calling the rise in the number of black students at Cambridge the Stormzy Effect.The question is: can the effect spread  Theres still a huge gap between the chances of going to university in the UKyoure white and well-off and the chances of goingyoure black or youre poor or youre both and some argue universities will have to offer places to poorer students with lower grades to start making a dference. But the good news, thanks to Stormzy, is that black students now make up more than three per cent of new undergrads at Cambridge for the first time.Stormzy has had another effect too, and perhaps its one that will be even more profound. Rappers have traditionally had a bit of an image problem: theyve usually promoted out-of-school activities rather than in-school ones. But Stormzys dferent. \"It sounds corny coming from a rapper,\" he says, \"but I did love learning and I loved studying.\" The Stormzy Effect could inspire many others to feel the same.MARK SMITHSIMONE BILES, GYMNASTOnce in a letime ndashyoure very lucky ndash theres a sporting star who shines so brightly that they eclipse everything that has come before.Step forward Simone Biles. The US gymnasts talent and achievements are such that we humble observers have long since exhausted the superlatives.While the gymternet ndash as the online community of gymnastics fans are known ndash has been abuzz about Biles for years, it was at the Rio  Olympic Games that the rest of the world sat up and took notice.: From Our Ladies of Perpetual Succour to What Girls Are Made of, five standout theatre shows of the decadeBiles, who won four golds and a bronze, found herself repeatedly compared to a raft of male sporting greats asthat is the only way we could comprehend her colossal achievements. \"Im not the next Usain Bolt or Michael Phelps,\" she responded. \"Im the first Simone Biles.\"The -year-old from Texas burst onto the global gymnastics scene in , winning her debut world all-around gold in Antwerp. It is a title that Biles has claimed on four further occasions , alongside a raft of inidual apparatus medals.In October, Biles took her th medal, making her the most decorated gymnast ndash male or female ndash in world championship history .But it is not only in a competition arena that Biles proved herself a gargantuan presence. In January , she released a statement on Twitter confirming that former USA Gymnastics physician Larry Nassar had sexually assaulted her under the guise of medical treatment.Nassar was later sentenced to up to  years in prison after more than  women stood up in court and laid bare their own experiences of sexual abuse in a scandal spanning three decades.Biles and her fellow survivors were awarded the Arthur Ashe Courage Award. At the  US National Championships, she designed and wore a teal leotard ndash a colour used to raise awareness about sexual abuse.A vocal critic of the US Olympic Committee and USA Gymnastics for their response to the allegations against Nassar, Biles continues to lobby for better accountability from both governing bodies.She refuses to be defined by what happened. Biless willingness to push the boundaries of her sport remains unabated. At the  US Gymnastics Championships, she stepped out in a crystal-studded leotard bearing her surname above an embroidered image of a goats head.It was a nod to the acronym GOAT, which is shorthand for the Greatest of All Time. Far from being boastful, however, this was Biless tongue-in-cheek \"jab back\" at the \"haters\" .She has the goods to back it up. This year Biles had two gymnastics skills ndash a hugely dficult triple twisting-double somersault in her floor routine and double-double dismount from beam ndash named in her honour after she became the first woman to perform them. Both appear to defy gravity.The Tokyo  Olympic Games loom on the horizon. Simone Biles is far from done yet.SUSAN SWARBRICKABU BAKR AL-BAGHDADIHe was the most wanted terrorist in the world. For more than half of the last decade, no single figure caused more chaos in the Middle East than Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim al-Badri. For that was his real name, even though the world came to know him by his nom de guerre, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.As the decade began al-Baghdadi had already served four years in the sprawling US military detention centre called Camp Bucca, which had detained some of the Iraq Wars most radical jihadists. In political and religious terms he was already a long way from his days as a PhD student of Islamic Studies at university in Baghdad.By , clad in black robes and standing in the pulpit of a mosque in Iraqs second city of Mosul, he was already claiming the title caliph of the Muslim world and leadership of the infamous Islamic Stategroup.Few even then could have imagined the chaos, carnage and suffering that al -Baghdadi, born one of six children in , would wreak on the world.:Books of the decade: From Harper Lee and Hilary Mantel to EL JamesIt would not be until October , , in a raid carried out by US Special Forces, when al-Baghdadi detonated a suicide vest in the Syrian province of Idlib, that the world was rid of his malign presence.\"We killed the last murderous bastard who ran IS, lets go get the next one,\" proclaimed one tough-talking US Republican Senator in the wake of al- Baghdadis death.But in the tunnels and booby traps left behind in cities like Mosul and Raqqa to the mass graves and thousands of faceless, black-clad female followers haunting refugee camps, ISs presence remains palpable along with its new new leader, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi.Many IS fighters now languish in prisons, but thousands more remain at large re-grouping and organising while their franchises likewise operate across the globe. This is Abu Bakr al-Baghdadis lingering and still menacing legacy.DAVID PRATT, CONTRIBUTING FOREIGN EDITORBOB SERVANT, BURGER TYCOONAh, Bob Servant. How do we love thee  Let us count the ways.

Public opinion has become ever more supportive. LGBT people have become ever more visible. And in , gay marriage was made legal in most of the UK.Then theres the T in LGBT. A few days ago, the Scottish Government published a draft bill which will simply the process of trans men and women having their gender legally recognised, but its not been an easy path. Some feminists say the legislation will undermine the rights of women. Trans activists say a change in the law is the only way to end the demeaning legal and medical process trans people currently have to endure. The two sides have not always been nice to each other.What the debate, and the bitterness, may prove is there is still some distance to go to LGBT equality, but the fact we got closer in the last decade is in large part due to its trans pioneers and one pioneer in particular. You know what Im talking about andnot, you should: the cover of Vanity Fair in June . Caitlyn Jenner. Former Olympic athlete. Openly transgender woman.For Jenner, the photograph was an act of happiness. \"Im so happy after such a long struggle to be living my true self,\" she said when the magazine was published. \"Welcome to the world Caitlyn.\" And for those who saw the picture, it was an act of courage and activism. When is equality  When trans people are in parliaments, and in churches, and in governments, and on the cover of fashion magazines.MARK SMITHDONALD TRUMP, BORIS JOHNSON, NIGEL FARAGE AND VLADIMIR PUTIN, POPULIST POLITICIANSVladimir Putin is about to mark  years in power ndash he first became Russian president on December ,  ndash and for much of that time the West has looked at his style ndash authoritarian, bombastic and a little bit silly ndash and thought: thank God were not like that.But that was then. First, a man with a fag in his mouth ndash call me Nigel ndash became leader of Ukip and the Brexit Party. Then a man with a phone in his hand ndash call me Donald ndash became president of the United States. And then a man with an inappropriate phrase on the tip of his tongue ndash call me Boris ndash became Prime Minister of the UK.Its not a coincidence they are known by their Christian names. Nigel, Donald and Boris represent a new, first-names-only style of politics that has dominated America and the UK in the last  years: populist, chummy, big on rhetoric, light on detail, and ndash much to the frustration of liberals ndash effective at attracting votes. Those three men have attracted support from working class voters who have traditionally looked to the left for answers. In the last  years, though, theyve looked right, and the result is Nigel, Donald and Boris.The next decade will decide their fate. Arguably, Farage has already been neutered after the Brexit Partys dismal election campaign. But the fates of Trump and Johnson are less certain. Trump has been impeached and will face a trial in the Senate, but its controlled by the Republicans, who arent going to vote their man out. As for Johnson, hes just won a big, blue majority and, failing a cock-uphes going to be here for the next five years.Beware:  years of populism may become .MARK SMITHPROFESSOR PETER HIGGS, SCIENTISTScience always plays the long game. It took almost a century for scientists in  to prove Einsteins  predictions of gravitational waves in space, which formed part of his theory of general relativity. Professor Peter Higgs didnt have to wait quite that long.Back in , while teaching at Edinburgh University, Higgs published papers predicting the existence of a particle that gave mass to the most basic building blocks of matter. It soon became known as the Higgs Boson. Much to his dismay, it was also called the God particle.No-one could find it, however. Or not until , when the large hadron collider near Geneva finally proved its existence.A year later Higgs, then , won the Nobel Prize in Physics, sharing the prize with fellow scientist Francois Englert.Higgs decided to go on holiday when the prize was announced, neglecting to take his mobile phone with him in a bid to avoid being pestered by journalists. They could wait. He had, after all.TEDDY JAMIESONEL JAMES, AUTHORThere was a moment, in the summer of , where everywhere you looked someone had their nose in a copy Fty Shades of Grey.

Edinburghrsquos Hogmanayrsquos city-wide series of site-specic installations combines newly commissioned texts by five writers with new visual projections and sound scores. The event is run in partnership by Edinburghrsquos Hogmanay producers, Underbelly in association with Edinburgh UNESCO City of Literature Trust, with City of Edinburgh Council and Edinburgh International Book Festival.It follows on from last yearrsquos Love Letters to Europe-themed compendium of works, and opened yesterday to usher in Scotlandrsquos Year of Coasts and Waters under the banner of Shorelines, with work that focuses on Edinburghrsquos maritime history in radically dferent ways.Sugar for Your Tea, takes place at the City Chambers on High Street, and sees its author reflect on the darker side of Scotlandrsquos sea-faring past. Using video and projections, Bankole focuses on the seemingly respectable Scottish merchants and businessmen whose names remain familiar from streets and statues across the country, but who made their fortunes on the back of the slave trade.Filmed by Rianne White, who has previously made videos for Young Fathers, The Proclaimers and Kate Tempest, Sugar for Your Tea also sees Bankole perform his text onscreen through a backdrop of light and water to reflect on his own identity as a Scot, as well as honouring his Nigerian ancestors. With the words themselves projected onto the City Chambers by high-tech projection mapping company, Double Take Projections, Bankole has also provided a new soundscape for the event.ldquoI didnrsquot know about Scotlandrsquos role in the slave trade, says Bankole. ldquoThings like that are always buried under the crypt, so this piece actually came from being a human making new discoveries.

These map the city from the Union Canal in Fountainbridge to the Malmaison hotel on the Shore in Leith, taking in the Northern Lighthouse Board on George Street and the Nelson Monument on Calton Hill en route.Jamiersquos piece, Seascape with WEC, is a poem that captures her experience of witnessing new wave energy converters being tested on the Orkney islands. Graphic designer and animator Thomas Moulson brings the poem to le using vibrant colours inspired by ideas of symmetry and kinetic energy. These are subsequently animated by Susanna Murphy and Cristina Spiteri, the duo behind Bright Side Studios, who worked on last yearrsquos Message from the Skies alongside composer Pippa Murphy on Kapka Kassabovarsquos love letter to Europe projected onto the National Monument of Scotland on Calton Hill. This time out, Bright Side create a playful reflection of Moulsonrsquos visual interpretation of Jamiersquos words on the water above the Union Canal in Fountainbridge.Bright Side also take part in Ten Thousand Miles of Edge, Robin Robertsonrsquos personal reflection of the signicance of Scotlandrsquos seaside landscape in Scotlandrsquos identity as a seafaring nation, and takes the audience on a vast nationwide journey across the countryrsquos coastal geography. With Robertson narrating, Ten Thousand Miles of Edge is augmented by a new musical score by neo-trad troubadour Alasdair Roberts, who looks to Hebridean psalmody and piobiareachd to create something both sacred and elegiac. This is illuminated by Bright Side to create an immersive fusion of elements beamed onto the Nelson Monument on Calton Hill.As another Message from the Skies veteran, Pippa Murphy, provides a new score to accompany Lightkeepers, Charlotte Runciersquos meditation on lighthouses real and fictional, including those built by pioneering engineer Robert Stevenson, grand-father of fiction author extraordinaire, Robert Louise Stevenson. Utilising the Northern Lighthouse Board on George Street as a backdrop, the piece features animations by Kate Charter to shine fresh light on such iconic myth-making structures. There is input here too from singer Karine Polwart, who narrates and sings as part of the piece.Finally, down by The Shore in Leith, local hero Irvine Welsh presents The Sea, which promises a mash-up of Welshrsquos words, film cut-ups by Norman Harman and industrial beats by DJ Steve Mac to illustrate Welshrsquos memoir of the influence of a sailor he met while growing up in Leith.

The ceremonies had been very professional and emotional.ldquoThe contribution and sacrice which Scots, and forces from all over the world, had made to the liberation of Europe through their involvement in the Normandy landings had ensured the preservation of democracy.ldquoHe paid tribute to those who had given their lives in the landings.An analysis of news and current events presented to the cabinet described Mr McConnell enduring ldquofierce criticism for turning down an invitation to attend the D-Day commemorations.After he reversed his position, there were then ldquonumerous articles and editorial in the weekend newspapers, ldquomainly focused on the First Ministerrsquos lsquoU-turnrsquo and the role played by his advisers.Bizarrely, the then Labour First Minister of Wales was caught up in a similar row, agreeing to attend a golf event at the Celtic Manor resort near Newport to discuss Wales hosting the  Ryder Cup, instead of going to Normandy.Other cabinet minutes also show Mr McConnell trying to fix another of his mistakes.After publicly supporting Glasgow singer Michelle McManus through her successful bid to win TVrsquos Pop Idol in , he conspicuously failed to congratulate Ayrshire violinist Nicola Benedetti when she won the less-watched BBC Young Musician of the Year in .He called three days later - after growing public criticism - and suddenly announced he was holding a reception for successful young Scots.The cabinet minute of  May  records: ldquoThe First Minister said that he had congratulated Nicola Benedetti on being the first Scot to win the BBC Young Musician of the Year competition.ldquoShe was one of many Scottish young people who had awards and recognition in ious fields, including sport and culture. He planned to hold a reception in the summer celebrating the success or young Scots over the past  months in all fields, and asked Cabinet members to nominate young people who might be involved to attend the event.Coming shortly after his infamous kilt and blouse outfit in New York, the Normandy and Benedetti gaffes made  a turning point for Mr McConnellrsquos credibility."},{"url":null,"title":"hogmanay-2019-excuse-selling-scotland-seans-scottish-hogmanay-reviews","story":"Scotland**Hogmanay **Only an Excuse ***Seanrsquos Very Scottish Hogmanay **Selling Scotland **HOGMANAY without Jackie Bird. We knew it was looming, like the iceberg that did for RMS Titanic, or a new season of River City. But nothing could have prepared us for the sheer, buttock-aching blandness of it all.Perhaps we should not judge too harshly. Ms Bird had herself warned of the intense scrutiny that comes with presenting one of the biggest shows of the year. ldquoThe word Hogmanay, she told a newspaper last week, ldquocomes from the Norse Hog-maan-aye, which roughly translated means: to give anything on the telly on December  a kicking.Jackie was so good at the job it took three people to replace her this year: Susan Calman, who is on Radio  more often than the pips comedian Des Clarke and entertainment reporter Amy Irons. Even then, the programme relied onlots ofpre-recorded material, something total pro Jackie never did. In a further sign of the scorched earth policy pursued by BBC Scotland chiefs, musicians Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain had been given their jotters.The evening began with a half hour show on BBC Scotland, just to make sure the new channel on the block felt included and useful. No point spending pound million on a dog and doing all the barking yourself. Susan Calmanrsquos Not Quite the End of the Year Show was a chat session so cosy and congratulatory it made Wogan look like Stalinrsquos show trials. The tone for the evening was set: safety first, mind how you go, have any flavour you like as long as it is vanilla.The main event kicked off at . on BBC Scotland and was simulcast on BBC Scotland. We were back in what looked like the prerecorded chat show with Calman. Her guests earlier in the evening, James Cosmoand Mark Bonnar , had been joined by Line of Dutyrsquos Martin Compston and Jane McCarry of Still Game. Tame banter followed.The hard work was being done by Clarke in Edinburgh and Irons in Stonehaven. Irons was shouty and hoarse, but at least she was animated. Clarke was confident and competent, though he was rather ahead of the crowd on the big countdown.Back indoors, Travis continued to play the studio gig like it was a corporate event, with the audience standing around like some middle aged Top of the Pops crowd who were missing their beds.As for the rest of it, particularly the Calman end of things, where was the jeopardy, the excitement, the raw buzz of a truly live gig  The only part that offered genuine bangs for the viewerrsquos buck were the fireworks after the bells. Otherwise, this was a Hogmanay show that felt like it had been cooked earlier and was being reheated on the night.Oh Jackie, you were missed.Stand by for an important announcement. Clear small children and pets from the area, secure breakable objects and make grannyrsquos a double. Ready  Good people of Scotland, Only an Excuse is funny again.Now, let us not get carried away here. Post-appendectomy patients watching were in no danger of bursting their stitches. But my God, the relief. How many years have we sat through half an hour of excruciating humourlessness with a rictus grin on our collective coupon, only to come away disappointed Changes had been made, notably drafting in extra bodies so that Jonathan Watson did not have to carry the show alone. Smart move. Even Eric had his Ernie. Watson was joined by Mark Cox, Joy McAvoy, Louise McCarthy and Alex Norton. Yes, wummin were there, and not just to be the object of lame Frank McAvennie gags. There was even a wummin in the ten-strong writing team. Just one, but it is a start. Theyrsquoll be letting one run the country next.A couple of sketches aside , the strongest material had nothing to do with football. Someone commission Cruachan Hydro Electric Power Station, Scotlandrsquos answer to Chernobyl, now.Sure, there were still some mirth-free stretches and misfires, but this was Scots comedy tailored for a Scots audience more importantly it was funny.Jack Docherty is a cheeky article. Researchers on Selling Scotland, a look at how the country has been depicted in ads down the years, had unearthed one of the first recorded Scottish commercials. Dated  and shown in American cinemas, it featured a gang of kilt-wearing teuchters selling whisky.ldquoThis strange, grainy clip, said the Scot Squad star, ldquois last yearrsquos STV Hogmanay special. Cheeky, but on the money. When it comes to Hogmanay, STVrsquos offerings in recent years have been televisual mince. Last year Lulu was wheeled out for a ldquoHogmanay Hooley that had all the atmosphere of a flu jab session in your local GPsrsquo surgery, and who can forget the year Elaine C Smith welcomed in the New Year with Nicola Sturgeon in a recreated s living room  Oh, the banter.In Seanrsquos Very Scottish Hogmanay the Sean in question was Batty, not Connery. Weatherman of the STV parish, Sean is licensed to tell you when it is going to bucket down.The location for the party, Craufurdland Castle in Ayrshire, was a cut above. Gold star for the production team on that one, eventhe rather snug surroundings made it look as though we were dropping in on the smallest ceilidh in the world.Dressed in full kilt with accessorising earpiece, Sean took to the part of host with his trademark big daft laddie gusto. Besides interviewing the laird and his we, he had been out and about filming segments on Hogmanay traditions. In the Borders he made black bun, and in Dundee he watched two women put a dress on a herring. Something to do with ensuring the family fish barrel would always be full, or so they told him.Meanwhile, back in the castle, Seanrsquos presenting partner, Jenner Reoch, was learning what the Craufurd family ate in olden days . ldquoItrsquos basically Instagram, said a thrilled Reoch as the laird read from old kitchen diaries.True, Sean and Jen gave Emily Maitlis and Andrew Neil nothing to worry about on the interviewing front, and the production flowed as naturally as treacle uphill, but at least an effort had been made to offer something fresh.Selling Scotlandhad the slickness, but it was  minutes of telly trying to pass as an hourrsquos worth. Much of the territory, including the Tennentrsquos ldquolager lovelies, had been covered before, though it was nice to see the likes of Molly Weir popping into neighboursrsquo houses uninvited to show them how to clean a floor with Flash, and pea and ham from a chicken will always raise a smile.As was pointed out several times, the ads were very much of their time, which apparently made it fine to show sexism and racism that would not have made it through the door any other night.ldquoI canrsquot believe we got away with showing all those ads on the BBC, said Docherty as the show closed. Neither can I, but thatrsquos Hogmanay telly for you a lot of cheek, a bit of charm, and thank Rabbie Burns it is over again for another year."},{"url":null,"title":"rosemary-goring-100-ways-survive-2020","story":"Count butterflies.Give a pint of blood.Visit a gallery at least once a month.

As we approach the end of this decade , a great deal seems to have changed in political terms, and yet not at all in the way that most of us might have anticipated ten years ago.We were sure that we were in for a tough time of it, economically. The optimistic view was then that the discipline involved in austerity would lead to root and branch reform of the structures of capitalism, tackling monopolistic firms and overhauling the banking system. There was also the expectation that it would offer the opportunity for a rolling back of the state, welfare and pensions reform and a radical reconstruction of the tax system.But almost none of that happened. The banks and the corporatist rent-seekers continue much as before. The reduction in public spending has not been strictly speaking, a reduction in spending, but merely a reduction in the rate of its increase. The tax burden is at a high as is the national debt. The new government ndash a Conservative government, allegedly ndash is aiming to spend even more.The changes, which never transpired, were to be ushered in by a new sort of consensual, centrist politics in the form of the ldquoheir to Blair, David Cameron, and his Liberal Democrat partners. His jibe to Mr Blair, that he ldquowas the future once, looks more pointed now that Mr Cameron himself is history, while his programme of reforms, promises of stability, ldquoa new kind of politics and a ldquoBig Society, are as dead as the Charleston.What was going to be the decade of consensus turned out to be contention and ision on an almost unprecedented scaleyou were looking for historical comparisons you would probably have to pick something like Irish Home Rule or the Corn Laws. What was going to be a transformative politics turned out to be a period of paralysis ndash the apparent paradox is that one reason the political landscape now looks so dferent is that almost nothing could be done while Brexit and independence swept aside the day-to-day issues.The other thing wildly dferent from what might have been assumed ten years ago is where the centre ground in politics actually is. When Mr Cameron and ldquoI agree with Nick Clegg appeared in the garden of Number , we expected government that would be, for the foreseeable future, fiscally conservative and socially liberal.But now that it appears that nobody agrees with Nick, or with his successors in the leadership of the Liberal Democrats, it looks asthe UKrsquos political centre is voters who are fiscally slightly to the centre-left, and socially rather more conservative than metropolitan liberals would like.Contrary to the claims of their opponents, the Conservatives under Boris Johnson have not moved sharply to the right ndash with the exception of their rhetoric on immigration, which, awkwardly for liberals, seems to chime with the general opinion of the voters. In most other regards, the Tories have become steadily more centrist, especially on public spending, while remaining socially liberal on most issues.If it doesnrsquot look like that to some people, itrsquos because the Labour Party has been even more radically transformed into what, to all intents and purposes, seems to be the Bennite wing of the Labour Party in the s. Amazingly, after their catastrophic results in the election, the membership seems inclined to double down on this position, despite the evidence that the only people inclined to vote Labour are their own activists. A membership of around , may be the biggest of any European political party, but itrsquos not an awfully big percentage of the UK electorate.The SNP, unsurprisingly, continues to bang on about independence, which is fair enough, since it is its raison drsquoecirctre. The partyrsquos persistent strength is obviously in part due to their success in converting so many Scots to the cause, but it presents them with problems, too.One is the dficulty of uniting the country on anything  when the subject dominates all discourse another is the practical matter of being the government, and being expected to deliver on domestic policy issues. Long-term electoral success, as Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair discovered, always leads to public disenchantment eventually.We start the new decade with a UK government once more promising real change and improvement. The Whig theory of historymade the assumption that you could explain the present in terms of the past, with the implication that the present was better. Irsquom not sure anyone believes that anymore. On the evidence of the past decade, we should probably just expect the unexpected."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  Labour has to learn the language of progressive nationalism if it is to survive","story":"But people rarely vote on their own narrow material interest, rather on what they think is best for the country as a whole.

The EUrsquos smaller states adapt to its terrain in dferent ways, with ying political outlooks, and dfering degrees of success.So how does the current world of smaller EU states look as we enter a new decade  The EU is primarily made up of smaller states, a fact that often gets overlooked as the shting political dynamics of the Franco-German couple sit centre stage. And certainly, the larger member states have always had more power. But the EU has always run too on a mixture of one-off and longer term coalitions between dferent countries. Even at the start, in , the smaller threesome of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg cooperated as the Benelux group to hold their own in the face of the larger trio of France, Germany and Italy.Today, one of the newest groupings of smaller states is the so-called new Hanseatic League covering the Netherlands, Ireland and the Nordic and Baltic states. The League was set up in , driven partly by the looming impact of Brexit: to many the UK was an important EU partner who needed replacing with new networks. But the Hanseatic League also aims to oppose Francersquos efforts to loosen orthodox economic and monetary policies around the euro.So while an independent Scotland might indeed be well advised to look first to its geographical neighbours for alliances, a neoliberal Hanseatic grouping would not be the most obvious place to start. But within that group there are countries Scotland could learn from. Ireland has worked hard at putting itself in the core of the EU ndash joining the euro, even while staying out of Schengen to protect the Ireland-UK common travel area. Finland too similarly made sure it is not on the sidelines.But an independent Scotland in the EU is not expected to join the euro in a hurry so it would be less of a core player. And the motley group of eight member states not in the euro including, apart from Denmark and Sweden, six central and eastern European member states, is not strong. The UK, with its euro opt-out, gave a certain clout to this group, disappearing now given Brexit.Perhaps an independent Scotland could be like Sweden ndash putting off indefinitely joining the euro, progressive on human rights, gender, climate change and migration  Or it could look further afield for role models ndash Portugal is currently showing how anti-austerity policies can work, just about, while being within the eurozone.Whatever the strategy and policy stance, being a well-regarded EU member state depends on playing a constructive, cooperative game, with excellent diplomatic and networking skills, building bilateral and multilateral alliances, showing commitment to the EU as a whole not just to onersquos own narrow interests. Certainly, an independent Scotland in the EU ndash and in accession negotiations ndash would have, not least, to show it was not going to be a mini-UK, being one of the awkward squad and demandingmultiple opt-outs.All this is some way off, should Scotland eventually choose independence. But her international and European relationships need more not less work now to limit the damage that Brexit will do.The Scottish Government has already taken ious initiatives in its European work. It has a Nordic-Baltic strategy. And it has established government offices and ldquoinnovation and investment hubsin Brussels, Dublin, London, Paris and Berlin. A new review into strengthening Ireland-Scotland relationships should report this March.But there is much more that could be done. The European Union is at the start of a new five-year term ndash with new Commission and Council presidents and big challenges ahead in a turbulent world. Scotland should have a clear European strategy setting out its interests and goals for the EU, and how it would hope to contribute and participate even from the outside, ranging from the environment and climate change to human rights, education, research, culture, competitiveness and the much-discussed green new deal. Ireland, Sweden, the Netherlands ndash even big regions like Baia ndash have clearly set out European strategies.True, foreign policy is not a devolved power but around the world cities, regions and sub-states are increasingly cooperating internationally on many key issues. Yet the Scottish Government seems a little nervous of being seen to have too clear or deliberate a para-diplomacy strategy. Such nerves should be set aside.A Scottish European strategy could be the centre of a wider international strategy and would strengthen Scotlandrsquos bilateral relationships across the EU. That would be helpful to Scotland today and, potentially, to the Scottish Governmentrsquos EU accession aspirations.Paradiplomacy on climate change is one example. There will quite likely be a row in  over the next big climate summit, COP, taking place in Glasgow in the autumn ndash the UK Government will aim to be centre stage and side-line the Scottish Government. But a Scottish Government that is working strategically with other EU member states, showing adept paradiplomacy, in the run up to COP may hold its own perfectly well.Amidst the Brexit furore, Scotland has established a quite distinct, pro-European image across the EU. The challenge now is to build on that to promote Scotlandrsquos wide, dense range of Scottish-EU networks and interests. Andthat is done well, Scotland will already be showing ndash to itself and to the EU ndash the sort of member state an independent Scotland might one day be.Kirsty Hughes is Director of the Scottish Centre on European RelationsRead more: Sturgeon reassures EU citizens in New Year message"},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-tv-tantrums","story":"GARY: Tank Commander star Greg McHugh has received plaudits for his comedy turn in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs at the SSE Hydro.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”The government’s failure to fund the ageing inter-island ferry fleet has left Orkney’s most remote and vulnerable communities with an inferior service compared to other areas in Scotland claimed Councillor Stockan.Following a y battle, the council secured £. million in additional government funding for internal ferry services for   — described by Councillor Stockan at the time as the “most signicant financial breakthrough” made by the council in years.The air of positivity failed to last however.OIC say they need £. million to run services in the current financial year — £. million more than the Scottish Government allocation.“This is a burden that most other Scottish councils do not have to bear,” Councillor Stockan continued. “The greater the burden placed on the council to keep the ferries running, the greater the risk of severe cuts to other vital services our community depends upon.“We need a long-term commitment from the government to fully fund the cost of running the service and replacing vessels with modern, cheaper-to-run ferries of a standard you would expect on routes as important as these.”RET was also in Councillor Stockan’s sights.The tarf, which would see cheaper fares for all when travelling across the Pentland Firth, has been mired in legal proceedings with Pentland Ferries making a complaint to the European Commission.From the outset, those at Holyrood said they were committed to see the scheme introduced within the first six months of . However, there appears to be no resolution in sight as we now head into .“It is outrageous that we in Orkney are still waiting for RET and that there appears to be no urgency or political will from the Government to resolve this.“Again, this is a clear case of discrimination against Orkney and our community will find it abominable that the money the government has saved by failing to introduce RET on our routes has been spent where — when it could have been committed to supporting our internal ferry service.“This is why I have written to the First Minister and appealed for her to intervene and ensure that Orkney is treated as fairly as other coastal communities with leline ferry services.”In response, a Scottish Government spokesperson indicated that the government was committed to finding a resolution to the issues raised.The spokesperson said: “At present, Orkney Islands Council are wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.#However, the Scottish Government understands the signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities and we have made clear our commitment to Orkney internal ferry services with the provision of additional revenue funding support totalling £. million in the last two years.“We continue to discuss long term solutions with both Orkney Islands Council and Shetland Islands Council. We established a working group to examine these issues and we are now in receipt of the final report which we are currently considering.”The spokesperson continued: “It is the responsibility of inidual local authorities to manage their own budgets and to allocate the total financial resources available to them, including on ferry services, on the basis of local needs and priorities, having first fulfilled their statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities.“Ultimately, it is for locally elected representatives to make local decisions on how best to deliver services to their local communities.“Ministers remain committed to pursuing all avenues to deliver RET for Orkney and Shetland, however, the first step is to resolve the complaint that Pentland Ferries have made to the European Commission.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The time for acrimony and ision is over. The time for slogans and soundbites is over. The test now for every party that has talked up getting back to work is to go back to the Executive table and deliver.Stormont imploded three years ago this month when the late Sinn Fein deputy first minister Martin McGuinness resigned in protest at the DUPrsquos handling of a botched green energy scheme.That dispute soon widened to encompass traditional rts over issues such the Irish language and the toxic legacy of the Troubles.A logjam over proposals to reform the petition of concern voting mechanism was one of the main reasons a deal failed to materialise before Christmas.It was designed to protect minority rights but politicians have accused each other of misusing it for their own ends.Discussions around change are focused on making it more dficult for one party to use the petition to block controversial legislation.The parties are also considering amending Assembly rules to make it harder to collapse the institutions.copy -.

Mr Ghosn had been out on bail while awaiting trial on ious financial misconduct allegations. The trial was expected to start in April, though no date had been set.How the Japanese authorities might investigate Mr Ghosnrsquos escape and what action they might take on the apparent security lapses also remains unclear.Japan does not have an extradition treaty with Lebanon.Mr Ghosn, who is of Lebanese origin and holds French, Lebanese and Brazilian passports, disclosed his location in a statement through his representatives but did not say how he managed to flee Japan. He promised to talk to reporters next week.He said he wanted to avoid ldquoinjustice and political persecution.ldquoI am now in Lebanon and will no longer be held hostage by a rigged Japanese justice system where guilt is presumed, discrimination is rampant, and basic human rights are denied, in flagrant disregard of Japanrsquos legal obligations under international law and treaties it is bound to uphold, the statement said. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Carlos Ghosn: Details of his daring escape from Japan may be confirmed in a promised talk with reporters next week--His lawyer Junichiro Hironaka denied all knowledge of the escape, saying he was stunned.

One report said he sneaked out from his Tokyo home hiding in a case for a musical instrument.Lebanonrsquos minister for presidential affairs, Selim Jreissati, told the An-Nahar newspaper that Mr Ghosn entered legally at the airport with a French passport and Lebanese ID.France has reacted with surprise and confusion, denying any knowledge.Speculation is re that a foreign or Japanese government, or both, might have been involved, or maybe simply turned a blind eye to allow the escape and spare the public from a potentially embarrassing trial.With him missing, Mr Ghosnrsquos trial is suspended.But a trial is still pending against Nissan as a company and Greg Kelly, another Nissan executive. Mr Kelly, an American, has said he is innocent.Mr Kellyrsquos allegations overlap with those charges against Mr Ghosn related to the under-reporting of Mr Ghosnrsquos future compensation. Those charges are less serious than the additional breach of trust accusations against Mr Ghosn.Mr Ghosn has been charged with breach of trust in having Nissan shoulder his personal investment losses, and erting payments in Saudi Arabia and Oman for personal gain.He has repeatedly asserted his innocence, saying authorities trumped up the charges to prevent a fuller merger between Nissan and alliance partner Renault SA.copy -.

Directed by Jezza Neumann, it allowed a handful of children to give first-hand accounts of le on the financial margins.The fact those featured were so young stripped their commentary of artice. They talked in matter-of-fact tones of hardships that would have broken many adults. Courtney, eight, who lives in Cambridge – “the most unequal city in the UK” – counted out coppers in the hope there would be enough for heating, before resigning herself to another night spent sleeping in her coat. Cameron, a pale and undernourished boy, described eking out diminishing food supplies. “We try not to eat a lot in one day, even though most of us are really hungry,” he said.Growing Up Poor painted a picture of the UK that made A Christmas Carol, with all its paternalism, feel entirely contemporary a world where the working poor are forced to survive on charity hand-outs.It was jam-packed with heroes. There was Danielle, who tried to carve out a bit of space in temporary accommodation to study for her GCSEs, and Courtney’s mother, who drew a chart to try to explain her depression to her daughter. Then there were those who donated to and ran the food banks, and Neumann himself, who avoided all the pitfalls of poverty porn to bring us this thoughtful piece of film-making. The villains – the architects of the Westminster government’s austerity programme – were less visible, but ever-present, behind the scenes, undermining the foundations that used to keep the lives of the underprivileged stable. Iain Duncan Smith’s welfare reforms were the dark heart of Growing Up Poor. Whatever his original intention, those reforms and the striver skiver rhetoric they produced were responsible for pushing just-coping families into destitution .And yet Duncan Smith is among those being rewarded in the New Year’s Honours list. Much to the horror of anti-poverty campaigners, the man behind Universal Credit, the bedroom tax and the two-child cap – three of the most odious policies of the decade – is being knighted because ofthe havoc he wreaked. That’s the way it goes nowadays. Those who sow chaos and confusion are gloried, while those left to pick up the pieces of their own and other people’s lives remain in the shadows. The likes of Duncan Smith lack the insight to be embarrassed by such unseemly boys’ club back-slapping. He will doubtless regard himself as a fitting recipient of the title Sir – asUniversal Credit had fulfilled its mission of helping millions back into work rather than entrenching misery and social exclusion.It was, famously, in Easterhouse, that Duncan Smith experienced an epiphany. Back in , he wept in the face of condemned tenements and boarded up lives. This moment of empathy inspired him to evangelise about “compassionate Conservatism”. Under his leadership, he pledged, the Tories would become “the natural party of those who want to make a better le for themselves and their children”.How hollow that sounds now. Yet, with hindsight, that phrase foreshadowed everything that would go wrong with his welfare reforms. It hinted at that most Dickensian of binaries: the deserving and the undeserving poor. It made a spurious distinction between “those who want to make a better le for themselves” and those considered too feckless to care.There are groups, including the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, who believe Universal Credit was a good idea in principle. It was aimed at simplying an over-complicated system by rolling six benefits into one, and – more importantly – at incentivising people to work.The logic was, on the face of it, unimpeachable. The way the benefits system was structured meant those who moved from claiming, say, Jobs Seekers Allowance, to low-paid employment would often find themselves losing out financially, which cannot be right.But with this logic came other shakier assumptions: that everyone ought to be entering the labour market that no-one would ever be too ill to work or have other competing pressures on their time, such as caring for children, the elderly or the disabled.And so a new era was indeed ushered in: an era of sanctions and Atos fitness-for-work tests, which saw benefit claimants penalised for attending funerals and the chronically ill forced to prove they had not staged some miraculous recovery. It was the era of being punished for having an extra bedroom – evenyour own child slept in it every other weekend. It was the era of growing mental health dficulties and soaring suicides. The era of I, Daniel Blake.Universal Credit caused more problems than it solved,it solved any. It was supposed to help people into work. But in , the Institute for Fiscal Studies claimed some groups, such as single parents, had less of an incentive to work under Universal Credit than the old system and that . million working families faced an average loss of £, a year.The five-week hiatus before Universal Credit was received meant claimants like Courtney’s mother had no money to feed their children. They were forced to go to food banks or to take out loans they had no hope of repaying.By the time the National Audit Office issued its scathing report in , Duncan Smith was gone. He resigned over cuts to disability benefits in , and four more work and pensions secretaries followed in quick succession. But the conceptual and logistical flaws the NAO report identied were ones that originated under his watch. Head of the organisation, Amyas Morse, said the case for Universal Credit was based on unproven assumptions. “We think the larger claims for universal credit, such as boosted employment, are unlikely to be demonstrable at any point in future,” he said.Nor has the situation improved over the last  months. Last month, the UN rapporteur for extreme poverty, Philip Alston, said the UK government’s austerity policies were driven by “a political desire for social engineering” and that key elements of the post war social contract devised by William Beveridge had been swept away.Alston also insisted the UK government was in a state of denial about reports suggesting  million people, a fth of the population, now live in poverty, with . million destitute.It is in the same spirit of denial, no doubt, that Duncan Smith was offered and accepted his knighthood. His elevation further undermines an already discredited honours system. \u2028But it is entirely in tune with today’s politics: cruelty and incompetence rewarded by a self-promoting clique, while those working long hours to improve people’s lives might as well be invisible.As the MP for Chingford and Woodford Green kneels on the red carpet at Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle, what will Courtney be doing  Or Cameron  Or Danielle  They will be struggling on, supporting their parents through the worst of their misery. Unfortunately, there are no knighthoods for stoicism. Or resilience. Or making the best of things.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

That shouldn’t mean a negative focus on EU citizens living here, but as British and European leaders arm-wrestle their way through the year ahead, producing us versus them narratives and “Hop off you frogs” headlines aplenty, it probably will. In  a new Labour leader will probably officially embrace Brexit and leave millions of Remain voters south of the Border without any means of democratic expression, thanks also to the collapse of the bickering People’s Vote campaign and the leaderless Lib Dems. Anyone hoping the main Westminster opposition parties will swtly recover from the failed Brexit battles of yesteryear to refocus on the human rights battles of tomorrow is likely to be disappointed.The enlarged cohort of SNP MPs has the energy, mandate and moral authority to champion the views of the “losing” side, raise important questions about the way Brexit is managed and persuade gung-ho Leave voters that giving Boris carte blanche over every aspect of British le is not a good idea. But the third largest party at Westminster is customarily ignored by politicians and the mainstream media. There’s no reason to think  will be any dferent.South of the Border at least, Europeanism has suddenly become as unfashionable and last season as glittery cards, wrapping paper, carols and Brussels sprouts – a Christmas tradition which could, incidentally, disappearrivals follow the example set this Christmas by Morrisons and Asda and rebadge their sprouts with local origins. Soon, Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and Scottish sprouts will be all we’ve ever known.A small thing perhaps and both supermarkets insist that pleasing Brexiters played no part in their re-labelling decisions. But maybe a sign of things to come. A sign that anything or anyone from a European country will soon smack of an alien culture. Is this overstating things  The statistics suggest not.The number of hate crimes recorded by police in England and Wales has more than doubled from , in - to a new record of , in  while the number of cases passed to prosecutors has dropped from  to just  per cent. Admittedly, referral rates have dropped across all types of offence, hate crimes sometimes don’t have named suspects, and out-of-court disposals don’t result in criminal charges. Suspects are also harder to identy when anonymous accounts are used to send abuse and threats online. But still, as weekend stabbings in a rabbi’s home north of New York City amply testy, attacks on minorities can happen in apparently tolerant environments. And Britain is not likely to be all that tolerant a place in . If EU leaders take a tough stance during forthcoming trade talks – as they surely must – the hostile and triumphalist Europhobic British press will have a field day, demonising EU institutions and painting European leaders as robbers and thugs determined to cheat the noble, freedom-seeking Brits. In this unpleasant and toxic political environment, unsuspecting, ordinary EU citizens will be on the receiving end of anti-Brussels sentiment. Indeed, that nasty process has already started, in some very surprising locations.A few customers at the Ceilidh Place Hotel and restaurant in Ullapool objected to a tiny EU flag mounted over the cash-desk. Days later, a French waiter was effectively told to get back home by a guest. Now all waiting staff wear T-shirts sporting the -stars of the EU flag on their backs, in solidarity with their French colleague and anyone  picked on for their ethnicity. Thanks to the hotel owners’ strong public stance, there’s been open discussion about changing public behaviour and some visitors have revealed bruising encounters they’ve experienced where. One Portuguese man living here for almost a decade, said customers now regularly demand to be served by “someone who speaks English properly,” at his workplace – a large High Street department store in Scotland. His English is almost perfect. A workmate also told him to stop using his native tongue while chatting with two other Portuguese speakers in the staff canteen. Are these incidents unusual one-offs or the tip of an iceberg set to grow larger as Britain’s acrimonious withdrawal from the EU dominates front pages and political discourse in   How will employers and managers respond Scotland prides itself on welcoming New Scots and Nicola Sturgeon was widely praised for reaching out to EU citizens straight after the  referendum, reassuring all who’d chosen to live and work here that Scotland was their home. This message of international solidarity gets loud cheers at independence rallies – partly because it neatly distinguishes Scots from very dferent English attitudes towards immigration, Europe and international cooperation. But are we just virtue-signalling and kidding ourselves  Are EU citizens getting almost as many pointed and unpleasant jibes in Remain-voting Scotland as Brexit-voting England  It’s impossible to know for sure. But these and other incidents should prompt the SNP to try and reconfigure the Westminster debate before Britain withdraws on  January. Otherwise, a very nasty scenario could develop – one in which EU nationals are singled out, pilloried and turned into scapegoats for the political and economic uncertainty that will inevitably arise as a wildly over-promising Conservative leader hits the brick wall of an unyielding and united bloc of EU trade negotiators. Agreed – the notion that Britain might somehow remain in the EU or single market, through the mechanism of a second vote, or a Remain alliance at Westminster is now officially dead, but the idea of a part-European identity and the internationalising impact of freedom of movement has always meant more to Scots Remain voters than the arcane details of tarf-free trade, and harmonised regulations. It still does. Protecting the rights of EU citizens living amongst us is an expression of enlightened self-interest, curiosity about other cultures, gratitude for the energy and enthusiasm of incomers and recognition of the enduring importance of respecting cultural and ethnic dference. Boris Johnson’s self-imposed December trade negotiations deadline is bound to ramp up anti-European, anti-foreigner rhetoric.If Scotland wants to remain a proud “mongrel nation”, we must hold the line against any descent into foreigner-blaming.

Most,not all, of these will be gone over the coming nights to those sleeping rough in the city centre. Offering tea and coffee on tap from am until pm at their Townsend Street HQ, Sandra told the Andersonstown News that the need for their service is very much “ days a year”. “We have service users coming to us with ious needs, whether it’s clothes, a cup of tea or somewhere to have a bit of refuge. We do make targeted appeals throughout the year via our Facebook page and we do have people ringing to ask is there anything in particular we need. We always need decent trainers, sturdy, durable. We can’t hold out to jeans, in smaller sizes of waist, new underwear on which there is a massive demand all year round, socks and toiletries. “We can’t hold out to coffee, tea, sugar, washing powder, toilet roll, those things make a big dference to us,” she said.“We would ask for those who are donating that there is a reasonable le left in the items they want to give. We always have a need for sleeping bags and we don’t distribute tents on the streets as they would pose a danger.”Established  years ago, the Welcome Organisation has provided a vital shelter for those sleeping rough and who are experiencing homelessness. Sandra spoke of how the need for the service has “changed dramatically” in that time.“We are dealing with a greater number of people, people with more signicant issues, drug, alcohol, mental health, not all the people we work with do, its some, not all. What we are finding is that the age profile of those seeking the service is much younger, and there are more women coming to the Organisation. When I came  years ago we had six women in service. Now a third of our service users are female.”She continued: “We are working with homelessness in its most chronic form. We can’t forget that there is hidden homelessness. By that I mean people sleeping on sofas, moving from pillar to post. Nobody has a handle on that. One in  people within their le in Northern Ireland will experience homelessness. Le expectancy of someone who has had periods of continuous homelessness is  for a woman and  for a man.”Sandra said that currently those service users at the centre are predominantly young males from North and West Belfast.As  comes to a close, Sandra said that the issue of homelessness is facing a constant struggle in the New Year.“All services are facing pressure, lack of mental health services, lack of drug and alcohol support service and not just in Belfast, right across the North. We do not have detox or rehab facilities here, what services are there, due to severe pressures, aren’t responsive enough. We are trying to bridge that gap. It’s quite evident right across the city that there is a growing drug problem, there is a real need for education in communities. “People have to bear in mind that there is a back story to each and every person who is homeless. This is someone’s son, somebody’s daughter. Nobody has ever set out on that path. What child do you ask and they say ‘I want to be ill’, ‘I want to be struggling with addiction’, ‘I want to be homeless’. It’s not an aspiration but unfortunately it’s were we are. In Belfast I think we have a chance to not end up like Dublin, like London, the big cities. We still have a chance of doing something to contain it, but the agencies need to work together.”“No-one knows what the budget is for Ireland next year. How can you possibly plan while we have no minister for finance or minster for health  We, along with others, are highly dependent on the good will of the public, we couldn’t survive without the public,” she said. “I’ve been here  years and every year I am still overwhelmed by the generosity of people, people are very kind, however homelessness is an issue  days of the year.”Sandra said the levels of increased poverty within households job losses and the impact of Universal Credit are contributing factors to homelessness. “Regardless of whatever way Brexit goes, the economy is shrinking again, there is higher unemployment. “As my grandmother always said ‘when poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window’. We see so many times relationships breaking down because of the stresses of poverty linked to job losses. Statistics show that children growing up in poverty that their le chances are much worse. Someone who experiences homelessness as a child is much more likely to experience it as an adult – we need more preventive services going forward.”With the Organisation’s core team of staff, Sandra said that they couldn’t provide their service without their “ volunteers”. “We had  for Christmas dinner last year and so far we have wrapped over  Christmas presents,  of those bespoke for our regular users. We are inundated with people wanting to volunteer with us on Christmas Day – it’s a lovely day but it’s a hard day for a lot of people as you can imagine. We try to keep familiar faces around for the people that are coming in.“We just want to thank everyone for their continued support, we couldn’t do our work without it. We have a fantastic team of staff, of volunteers and the support of the public and the community. All I would ask is that people continue to be kind. That’s all I ask, is for people to be kind to those on the street. We don’t always know the story of how or why it has come to that.”For more information on the Welcome Organisation or to donate visit www.homelessbelfast.org"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"young people saying yes to yeha project","story":"ESTABLISHED over ten years ago, the YEHA Project has gone from strength to strength in helping young people in North Belfast.Based in the Flax Centre and the Houben Centre in Ardoyne, YEHA stands for Youth, Education, Health and Advice.The YEHA Project is made up of a small dedicated team of five full-time staff, sessional workers and a team of volunteers.

Sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone but the benefits are massive.The YEHA Project is also involved with cross-community work, alongside an organisation based on the Woodvale called Streetbeat Youth Project.Another successful project is the Carezone in Schools project, a pilot programme which is currently into its second year, based at Mercy College.Cara explained: “It is a model where we run one-to-one support within the school and have someone from YEHA project in the school daily to work with students in school.“After running a research programme, we found that over  per cent of young people would be more likely to speak to another young person about their problems rather than an adult.“We run the one-to-one mentoring service alongside a Peer Mentor programme where young people are trained up in Peer Mentoring to help support other young people on issues affecting their mental health and enables them to signpost to relevant support agencies.“It was a successful first year and last year we delivered  sessions to  pupils covering a range of issues including building coping skills and resilience, relationships, communication and social skills, health and well-being and anxiety.“We have a nice room in Mercy College where young people can come and relax and they are more likely to open up in such an environment.“It is all voluntary too, of course.”One young person, who took part in the programme, Jodie Shevlin, praised the benefits of it during the pressures of school exams.“The Carezone in Schools project is a way for pupils to distress and escape from the pressure of school work and exam,” she said.“The one-to-one work the project does is a chance for us to get worries or problems off our chest and be able to just have a more relaxed chat where we are really listened to.“It has really helped me get through my last few years of school.”YEHA ProjectFlax CentreArdoyne AvenueBelfast BT DATel:    "},{"url":null,"title":"dup mp opposes call to ban hunting with dogs","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Theyre a tradition which need to be maintained.\"On a wider point, I have never seen anything wrong with hunting for control, but people who complain about these hunts are missing the point.\"Its not about killing foxes, its about people with a love of horses and tradition coming together in a colourful occasion, occasions that have been held for years.\"The League Against Cruel Sports, though, maintains more than halfof respondents to polling carried out believe hunting with dogs is already banned in Northern Ireland as it is in England, Wales and Scotland.Janice Watt, senior public affairs officer for the campaign group in Northern Ireland, said hunting and killing animals for sport might satisfy a small minority, but most people find it repulsive.She added: \"With polling showing widespread opposition to this so-called sport, its clear that hunting should be made illegal in Northern Ireland, and the league is working hard to ensure that as soon as Stormont sits again we get a ban to bring our nation into line with the rest of the UK.\"In a poll of , people living here released by the group, % of respondents believe it should be made illegal to hunt deer with live dogs, compared to % who believe it should remain legal.When it comes to fox hunting, % of respondents believe that it should be made illegal to hunt the animals, compared to % who think it should remain legal.The polling, commissioned by the group, asked people aged  and over living in Northern Ireland their views on a iety of animal welfare topics, including hunting.Of those polled, % believe it is illegal to use dogs to hunt live animals in Northern Ireland, compared with % who think it is legal and % who did not know."},{"url":null,"title":"focus on border poll would lead to wasted decade says arlene foster in new year message","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

intelligence-gathering role is to spot iniduals who act suspiciously when they see police nearby, perhaps by attempting to hide or make off at pace in the other direction.Servator, Latin for

and dealt with more than  other iniduals by other means, such as by issuing advice or engaging in conversation.Several drugs seizures were made as a result of the deployments and the arrests included

to avoid police,” she said.“So it’s about providing that police presence but with the plain-clothed officers working alongside and what that would look like on the ground is that the plain-clothed officers would see these tell-tale signs, inform their unormed colleagues, and then we would exercise our stop and search powers and conduct a stop and search.”Ms Foy said the feedback from the public and business community had been “very positive”.“Over the course of the six weeks the team visited the Christmas markets, shops, cafes and licensed premises to offer reassurance and advice on keeping staff and customers safe,” she said.“Officers engaged with council workers, post workers, security staff, street performers and members of the public who all played an important role in helping us keep people safe by being our eyes and ears and reporting suspicious activity and we’re grateful for their support.”It is anticipated that the dedicated Servator team will conduct patrols in towns and

Business leaders said no-deal would have proved disastrous. The farming community was facing devastation with the loss of EU subsidies coupled with new trade tarfs between north and south. Experts warned that farmers would be left facing bankruptcy.A real issue for all was the lack of clarity about what any potential Brexit would mean for Northern Ireland. Everyone had an opinion on what Brexit would mean. When Mr Johnson ed with his new deal from the EU, it became known as the Betrayal Act by loyalists who saw it as a threat to the Union. They claimed it put an economic border in the Irish Sea and meant Northern Ireland would be treated dferently to the rest of the UK.Disagreements about what it all means for Northern Ireland will continue in the next  months.July: Lowry wins at PortrushJuly saw the worlds best golfers and thousands of golf fans flock to the north coast as Royal Portrush hosted The Open for the first time in almost  years.The championship generated more than £ million of economic benefit for Northern Ireland, according to a study commissioned by organisers and proved a real boost to the tourist industry with hotels sold out and fans flocking to the scenic location from across the world - , fans arrived on the north coast with more than half coming from outside Northern Ireland.Shane LowryThe figures helped boost predictions that  will be a record breaking year for tourism in Northern Ireland with .m people expecting to have visited in the year.Irish winner Shane Lowry lted the coveted Claret Jug at the end of the event, six shots clear of nearest challenger, Englands Tommy Fleetwood.

The biggest loser was the DUP, with Nigel Dodds ousted by Sinn Feins John Finucane after serving as North Belfast MP for  years. The DUP also lost South Belfast where the SDLPs Claire Hanna unseated Emma Little-Pengelly by over , votes. The DUP suffered a third blow in North Down where the Alliance Partys Stephen Farry claimed the seat vacated by independent unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon.Nigel DoddsWhile the DUP finished the election down from  seats to eight, Sinn Fein saw their majorities slashed across Northern Ireland - Mr Finucanes win tempered by a crushing defeat for Elisha McCallion in Foyle. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood now sits as MP there with a majority of over , in what had been predicted to be a close contest.Gains for Alliance followed success in the European Elections at the end of May with leader Naomi Long elected alongside Diane Doddsand Martina Anderson .

Why \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  DUP leader Arlene Foster Few could ever have predicted that the issue to pull down Stormont’s peace process structures would be a row about a botched green energy scheme. But so it came to pass in January  when Sinn Fein withdrew from the mandatory coalition administration it jointly led with the DUP. The republican party had demanded that DUP leader and then first minister Arlene Foster step down temporarily to facilitate an investigation into her handling of the ill-fated Renewable Heat Incentivescheme. When she refused, the late Sinn Fein deputy first minister Martin McGuinness resigned – a move that pulled down the executive. The row over the RHI scheme destroyed relations between the parties, sparking a range of further disputes over traditional issues that had previously not posed an existential threat to the institutions. A wrangle over proposed legislation for Irish language speakers and the region’s ban on same-sex marriage soon emerged as key roadblocks. Ironically, the bust-up over RHI soon faded into the background and, even though a public inquiry report on the scheme is due, it is no longer one of the issues considered pivotal to restoration.– Has the general election changed things \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  SDLP leader Colum Eastwood is elected MP for Foyle The DUP and Sinn Fein both had very disappointing elections. The DUP lost two of its  Westminster seats and saw its vote drop signicantly. Sinn Fein still has seven parliamentary seats, but its vote fell by a quarter on the last election and the party suffered an extremely embarrassing defeat in Foyle, where the SDLP trounced its incumbent MP with a , majority. For many, the outcome was the public passing judgment on the two largest parties’ failure to restore powersharing. The election also provided further evidence of a sht towards more centre-ground politics in Northern Ireland – a trend borne out by another positive showing for the cross-community Alliance Party. The results undoubtedly created a fresh impetus for the big two to get Stormont back up and running.-What about the DUP and the Tories \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith The sight of Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith blaming the DUP for the failure to secure a pre-Christmas deal served as a powerful reminder that confidence and supply is a thing of the past. That Westminster arrangement had been the elephant in the room during previous talks initiatives, with the other Stormont parties accusing the Government of dancing to the DUP tune and undermining its stated independence in the region. The general election appears to have changed this dynamic. The other parties seem content with Mr Smith’s handling of the process, thus far, and the DUP knows it can no longer rely on the Government for political cover.– Are there other factors at play that make this process dferent \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The picket line outside the Royal Hospital in Belfast The powersharing impasse created a slow-burning crisis in Northern Ireland’s public services. With no elected ministers, and the Government reluctant to reintroduce direct rule, civil servants have been left to run departments in a strange governance limbo-land. The situation has been getting gradually worse over three years, as more and more decisions have been left untaken. But things arguably reached tipping point in the weeks before Christmas when workers in the region’s struggling health service embarked on industrial action to highlight low pay, spiralling waiting lists and staffing shortages. There was an unprecedented strike by nurses – the first ever in the UK – amid mounting public fury that patients are suffering while politicians continue to argue. With more strike action planned, there is little doubt the health service crisis has lit a major fire under politicians’ feet, providing further impetus to get back round the negotiation table.– So what are the remaining disputes \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill and Mary Lou McDonald Same-sex marriage has effectively been taken off the table as a consequence of legislation passed by MPs at Westminster last year that ended the prohibition. The first marriages are expected in February.The Irish language remains a key logjam. Sinn Fein has consistently made a standalone Irish Language Act a prerequisite of any deal to restore devolution. The DUP has expressed a willingness to legislate to protect the language, but only as part of broader culture laws that also include the Ulster Scots tradition. There is a sense that the shape of a deal on language is there it just requires sufficient political will from the two parties to make the required compromises to get it over the line.Away from the language issue, all the parties accept that Stormont’s structures and practices require an overhaul. However, they remain at odds on the shape of those reforms. One of the key disputes centres on the controversial petition of concern voting mechanism. It was this issue, rather than the language row, that is understood to have prevented a pre-Christmas breakthrough. The mechanism, which enables large parties to effectively block change evena majority of other MLAs agree to it, was a peace process construct designed to offer protections for minorities. But there is a widespread sense that it has been abused, with parties using it for issues unrelated to the traditional community ide, such as on same-sex marriage and to prevent the censure of party ministers. Talks faltered on plans to limit the use of the petition and make it more dficult to trigger. Proposals drawn up with the UUP, SDLP and Alliance secured the backing of Sinn Fein but failed to convince the DUP.– And there’s yet another deadline Yes, January . The three-year crisis has been marked by a series of missed deadlines, with the parties busting through successive cut-off points that were either imposed by the UK Government or set by legislation. There is another one approaching fast. On January , legislation that has given civil servants extra powers to operate in the governance vacuum expires. Mr Smith will then be under a legal duty to call another snap Assembly election. Whether this deadline will prove any more meaningful than the others is yet to be seen."},{"url":null,"title":"dups emma little pengelly unsure over her future in politics","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The case we have prepared sets out how the belief in principle, and how Jordi’s particular interpretations of it, meet the required legal test,” Mr Daly said in a statement.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A  will decideveganism is a “philosophical or religious belief” and thus protected in law When he initially brought the case, Mr Casamitjana said the hearing was not primarily about his dismissal, but about establishing ethical veganism as a philosophical belief.“Although the manner in which I was dismissed was intensely distressing for me, some good may come of itI am able to establish this valuable protection for all ethical vegans.“If we are successful in that hearing, we will then proceed to a hearing on the specics of my dismissal.”But the League Against Cruel Sports said it sacked Mr Casamitjana for “gross misconduct”.In a statement to the BBC, it said: “The League Against Cruel Sports is an inclusive employer, and as this is a hearing to decide whether veganism should be a protected status, something which the league does not contest, it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.”"},{"url":null,"title":"what the papers say january","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It’s either too dry, there’s no taste from it at all, and to avoid both those complaints requests are made for the ‘dark’ meat to be served to you. But still the vast majority of us will sit down to eat turkey on Christmas Day – but how did the big bird from America find its way onto our plates and manage to remain a permanent Yuletide fixture for centuries  googletag.cmd.push Turkeys were first brought into these islands in  by explorer William Strickland and before that those who had the money to buy them ate geese, boars heads, pheasant and even peacocks. Yorkshire man Strickland acquired six of the birds from native American traders on his travels around the New World and duly shipped them back to England. With the arrival of the turkey, a th century poem described Christmas dinner as: “Beefe, mutton and porke, shred pies of the best, pig, veal goose and capon and turkey well drest.” This was accompanied by cheese, apples, nuts and “good drink.” The turkey was also devoured because of purely pratical reasons by farmers because they needed to keep their cows to produce milk and their chickens for eggs. In the sixteenth century eggs were almost a luxury item and were accordingly expensive. googletag.cmd.push It is a matter of historical record that King Henry VIII began the tradition of eating turkey on Christmas Day, but it wasnt really until after WWII that the bird became more popular than goose on the big day. An English farmer, Thomas Tusser noted that by  turkeys had started to adorn Christmas tables, but that as well as geese another bird – the capon – a castrated rooster – remained the fowl of choice. And, that remained the case for another few centuries. By  turkey appears as a meat used in households as noted in a book called The English Housewe written by Gervase Markham. In the s the London Poulters Guild recorded that they had begun to give the company clerk a turkey as a Christmas gt. In the Victorian era, turkey was still too expensive to buy in comparison to its alternatives. There was a ision in tastes between northern and southern England. In the north, roast beef was favoured while in the south, goose remained the traditional choice. Poor families mostly made do with rabbit whether they were from the north or south. Recent research shows that today the average worker will need to toil for around . hours to afford a turkey, but as late as the s it would have cost the average weeks wages to buy one. Eating turkey at Christmas was popularised further by its most recogniseable literary reference. That of course came in  when Charles Dickens, A Christmas Carol was published. The character of Scrooge famously sends his put upon clerk Bob Cratchit a huge turkey to replace his goose on Christmas morning. Post  food austerity changed any doubts about the correct choice for Christmas dinner. The sheer size of the turkey could more than adequately feed a sizeable family and the St Stephens Day leftovers could be turned into sandwiches, soup and stew. According to the British Poultry Council more than  million turkeys are killed every year –  million of those for the Christmas season alone. However that figure pales by comparison to the fact that in the U.S.A three hundred million turkeys meet their fate each year – mainly for Christmas and Thanksgiving. But outside of Ireland, Britain and America, turkey is not the favoured roast for Christmas Day. In Norway for example, the festive feast actually takes place on Christmas Eve and most around the costal regions of the country eat fish – mainly cod and haddock and a iety called lutefisk. Inland in Norway they opt for pork chops, specially prepared sausages and sometimes lamb. In neighbouring Sweden the Yuletide consists of a smorgasboard of caviar, shellfish, cooked and raw fish and cheeses. Further east in Ukraine people prepare huge broths crammed with meat while in the Czech Republic tradition decrees that the tree is not lit before Christmas Eve and is then followed by a dinner of fish soup, salads, eggs and carp. A macarbre tradition upheld by the Czechs is that the number of people at the table must be even, otherwise the person without a partner will die the following year. In Germany the traditions are much more straightforward with the Christmas Day feast consisting largely of wild boar or venison. Meanwhile in Jamaica, Christmas dinner usually consists of rice, gungo peas, chicken, ox tail and curried goat. Back in Western Europe, the Christmas dinner in Italy can last four over four hours. Most families will have seven or more courses including antipasti, a small portion of pasta, a roast meal followed by two salads and two puddings – then, cheese, fruit, brandy and chocolates. The Austrians take a more austere approach and on Christmas Day traditionally sit down to braised carp served with gingerbread and beer sauce. Poland pays no heed to the turkey at all. In fact they pay no mind to meat at all and knuckle down to  meat free dishes that represent the months of the year and which includes fish such as pike, herring and carp. Other typical Polish Christmas dishes are fish soup, sauerkraut with wild mushrooms or peas and traditional dumplings with ious fillings.

Ebenezer Scrooge wasnt the first fictional character to see ghosts at this time of year. In fact the tradition probably goes back further than Christmas itself. As the nights grow long and the year creeps towards its close its a natural instinct that people gather together. Its also natural that this time makes us think of people and places that are no longer here. These thoughts have often morphed into tales based on what we encounter at this time of year - winter, death and the eventual rebirth experienced in spring. googletag.cmd.push In Europe this was usually connected to the pagan rituals surrounding the winter solstice known as Yule. The shortest and darkest day of the year was viewed as a time when the dead would have access to the living. The telling of tales at Yuletide began to decline as TV took over as the main form of household entertainment, but it must also be remembered that when Dickens published A Christmas Carol in  the tradition of Christmas itself was also in decline. In fact, for most people in that era Christmas was a working day because the Industrial Revolution meant fewer days off for everyone. As a result, Christmas was considered relatively unimportant and no one really complained. googletag.cmd.push The beginning of disregarding Christmas had come courtesy of Oliver Cromwell around  years earlier. The puritanical Lord Protector of England who in the th Century was “on a mission to cleanse the nation of its most decadent excesses.” These excesses unfortunately included banning Christmas celebrations, its ghostly tales and traditions with even carols making his draconian hit list. Oliver Cromwell is of course remembered in Ireland for his other exploits including the deaths of thousands of people as the result of his orders. But despite his best efforts he failed to quell the traditions of folklore carried over from pre-Christian Ireland. In the Irish tradition, ghosts are called taidhbhse or tais and live in a place halfway between this le and the next. The spirits are held here by some earthly affection or unfulfilled duty or anger against the living. Those who die suddenly, more commonly than others, are believed to become haunting Ghosts. They go about moving the furniture, and in every way trying to attract attention. It was also believed that when the soul has left the body, it is drawn away, sometimes, by the fairies. Such souls are considered lost. If a soul eludes the fairies, it may be snapped up by the evil spirits. The weak souls of young children were especially in danger. In western Ireland for example, people sprinkled the threshold with the blood of a chicken when a very young child died so that the spirits may be drawn away to the blood. A ghost was also compelled to obey the commands of the living. One old tale said, the stable-boy up met the master going round the yards after he had been two days dead, and told him to be away with him to the lighthouse, and haunt that and there he is far out to sea still. Oscar Wildes mother who studied and wrote about the supernatural thought it was only spirits who were too bad for heaven, and too good for hell, who were caught halfway between paradise and damnation. It was also thought that the souls of the dead sometimes took the shapes of animals. They will sometimes take the forms of insects, especially butterflies. If you see one fluttering near a corpse, that is the soul, and is a sign of its having entered upon immortal happiness. The author of the Parochial Survey of Ireland, , heard a woman say to a child who was chasing a butterfly, How do you know it is not the soul of your grandfather. Spirits who remain inside houses can also take on many shapes, including that of the elf and sometimes also of a rat, cat, or black dog. In their natural state they are invisible to people, but they can become visible in these forms. They make a lot of noise in the house at night and live between the walls, in the attic or in the cellar, in the stable, in the shed, sometimes even in a large tree beside the house. These ghosts are not considered particularly intelligent, and remain friendly as long as they are treated well. They like to tease lazy people by pulling the blankets off their beds and sending icy drafts through the room. They also delight in knocking over milk pails and keeping people awake by constantly tapping on the walls. When made very angry, they become malevolent. Their noise making becomes unbearable they throw stones, the cattle become sick, drought or cold weather or continuous storms occur. They leave the house or farm only when it has been totally overwhelmed by disaster and is lost. And, there is a well-known local wintry ghostly tale which refers to The Lady in the Snow which is said to have happened on the outskirts of Derry. The story is of two children, a brother and sister who were playing in the snow near a small stream near Enagh Lough. They were making a snowman and gradually they moved closer and closer to the water until they were standing on the ice. A woman dressed in a grey coat and a fur muff approached them, warning them of the danger. She coaxed them back to the bank just as the ice began to crack. She asked where they lived and she advised them to go home. The little girl askedshe could walk home with them andshe could put her hands in the muff to make them warm. The woman put the muff on the little girl and they chatted as they walked. She told them that she had a little girl who went into the water through the ice and warned them to be careful. At the gate she took her muff back and watched them being greeted at the door by their mother. They were both pointing at the lady and gesticulating but the mother saw no one. However she went to the gate because the children were so convinced that a lady had walked home with them. On the snow there were only the footprints of her children. When the snow melted a muff was found near the lake. The little girl knew it was the one that the lady wore.

For decade upon decade, especially in rural Ireland, New Years Eve was about exactly that - staying in. New Year was never truly a big thing in Ireland - especially for farming communities for who the fortunes of the crops were all important. Irish New Year traditions in agricultural areas, such as they are, are all about the coming twelve months. One belief was that no water could be drawn from the well after the sun went down on New Years Eve. All the water required needed to be inside the house before that and none of it could leave the house until the next day. Defying this belief meant that the family would be faced with a drought in the new year. googletag.cmd.push There was also a tradition that no money could be spent on New Years Day. Nothing could be brought out of a home and anyone visiting should make sure they came bearing a gt. Giving something away meant giving your money away and surely no sensible person would do that. The stroke of midnight on December  carried traditions of its own. Being the first visitor to a house on New Years Day was a popular custom but the warmth of your welcome was largely dependent on the colour of your hair. Unless he arrived empty handed, a dark haired man would be greeted gladly because it was believed that he would bring plenty of good luck. However, a red headed womans arrival meant ill fortune evenher arms were weighed down with all the tokens of what was known as first footing - bread and coal. Red haired females apparently tended to stay at home on New Years Eve. googletag.cmd.push In fact to prevent bad luck, families sometimes sent out a dark haired member of the family immediately after midnight and had them walk back in though the door. All dark haired boys in the area would visit the houses and be welcomed with gts of sweets or money. Anything bad that happened on New Years Eve was considered more signicant the closer it was to midnight. It was believed that there was only a certain amount of luck in the world and everything that could be done to claim a share of it had to be done. It was also important to begin the New Year with a spotlessly clean house signying a fresh start to the New Year. New Years Eve was also known as “Oiacuteche na Coda Moacuteire,”- ‘the night of the big portion’ since people would eat a larger than normal meal to ensure food in plenty for the coming year. Another way of ensuring plenty was to make a cake which was then pounded against the door of the house three times while a prayer was said by the housewe. This would chase the bad luck out of the house and invite the good spirits in. In other areas the man of the house would take three bites out of the cake and then throw it against the front door, in the name of the Trinity and banish hunger from the house. After this the family would then gather up the fragments of the cake and eat it. Many farmers repeated this ceremony at the door of the byre to ensure plentul fodder for the cows. People tried to ensure that no food was taken away from the house on New Years Eve and beggars knew better than to approach a house looking for food. Another New Years Eve Irish tradition was that young girls put mistletoe under their pillows on New Year’s Eve, in hopes of dreaming about their future husband. On New Year’s Eve night, families would remember those who has passed away that year before by setting a place for them at the dinner table and leaving the door unlatched. Anyone entering the house after midnight by the front door would leave by the back door for good luck. Well into the evening on New Years Eve in Ireland there would always be a small group gathered around the fireplace, laughing and joking. Sooner or later, the conversation would turn to reminiscing about Ireland. The old ones, well on their way with a few glasses of the hard stuff, would get all misty-eyed as they remembered times past and the stories would begin in the light of just the fire and candles burning in the windowsill. There was also an Irish tradition of predicting the political future of the country by checking which way the wind blows at midnight on New Year’s Eve. If the wind is from the west, there is a chance that good fortune will reign that year. If the wind is from the east, however, the British will prevail. And,after the stroke of midnight the man of the house would recite the following verse: “May your nets always be full, Your pockets never empty, Your horse not cast a shoe, Nor the devil look at you In the coming year.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

They haven’t released their first album yet but I’m assured it’s on its way.We proved ourselves more than capable of putting ourselves on the map via the Celtronic, Feile, Together, Stendhal, Oscillations and Modulations festivals, not to mention the fundraiser gigs for NICU and the Tuned In Project, great times and great music were had by all. googletag.cmd.push Damien Dempsey came back to Derry for the anniversary of the Civil Rights movement’s most important work.The music and performing arts course in the tech headed up by Rory Donaghy and Grainne McNamaragave itself the credit it deserves and is now living under the new identity MAPA and being rightfully celebrated for training up the musicians and tech-heads that keep our funny wee engine running. Marty Coyle went to Bulgaria as a musician in residence and came back with whole new bag of ingredients for future Balkan Derry work. You were probably in Tinney’s watching them last night and no doubt agree wholeheartedly.Janet Hoy and a group of other artists created “The Stone Tapes” which were sonic representations of the Walls of Derry, the memories trapped in stone can be heard at www.stonetapes. The Clameens played their first live show since disbanding without Doyle at Lisahally in August and promised us nothing really. They came, they saw, they conquered and they’ll let us know the craic sure.The Clameens have sadly aged and now the young punks have taken over. No Collusion are leading the way for independent, frenetic noise and keeping the spirit of Bam Bam  The Calling well and truly alive. Between them, Fast Thursday and Happy Out the punk scene is well and truly flourishing. Rebecca Harkin released “Things Man Be Someway” and Great White Lies released “Chrysalis” and both proved that jazz isn’t as terrible as I thought and, more importantly, the young musicians of Doire and Donegal know a million times more about music than the frequenters of the start of may party.  The late Micky Grfiths who is sadly missed.Keith Harkin continued to soar around America but landed back in Ireland to build and promote his Barn Studios and work with White Denim and The Eagles collaborators. Contact the Barn Studios on Facebook, it’s an absolute treat and the rates are magic.The year belonged to Quiet Arch and the work of Eoin O’Callaghan and Ryan Vail on their “Borders” album. Everything about it came from here, from writing and making, to promoting and videoing. A true triumph of independence that will live forever. It won the album of the year at the NI Music prize and their stablemates Cherym picked up the Oh Yeah Contender award. Sadly this year we lost Eamon Friel in June and his loss is reverberates still, a truly loved, inspiring and cherished foundation of everything musical in Derry left the kind of memories that will outlast us all. Then, in December, Micky Grfiths passed away. Joe Brown said he stopped him from going sane. I can’t think of a more beautul tribute.

The scheme, which will extend for a distance of approximately . kilometres from its junction with the A Tobermore Road to Nutgrove Road, will greatly improve the strength and surface quality of this section of the road network. The carriageway works on the Draperstown Road, Desertmartin will commence on Monday, January  .Given the nature of the scheme and to help ensure the safety of road users and workers, it will be necessary to implement a full road closure for the duration of the works. googletag.cmd.push During the road closure a two-way traffic ersion will be in operation along the A Tobermore Road from Desertmartin to Tobermore and the B Draperstown Road from Tobermore to Draperstown. The Nutgrove Road Tobermore Road junction will also be closed to all traffic. Residents and landowners living along Nutgrove Road should use the Iniscarn Road to access the A Tobermore Road and B Draperstown Road during the duration of this closure. Advanced warning signage for the closure will be provided and ersion routes will be signed as necessary. Local access will be facilitated.Completion of the scheme by Sunday, January  is subject to favourable weather conditions and the Department will keep the public informed of any change. googletag.cmd.push The Department has carefully programmed the works operations and traffic management arrangements in order to minimise any inconvenience to the public, however road users should expect some delays and should allow additional time when planning any journeys. The work was welcomed last week by Sinn Fein councillor Catherine Elattar who has campaigned for the much needed work. She said: At this stage, the work being done will only go as far as the Nutgrove Road, but I am hopeful that as soon as funds become available that the work will be continued along the road to Draperstown. This whole stretch of road needs to be done and we will continue to lobby for this to happen as soon as possible.For traffic information about this and other improvement schemes visit: www.trafficwatchni  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Commenting on the ongoing action, Pat Cullen, Director of the RCN in Northern Ireland said: “Nurses in Northern Ireland are angry that no-one appears to be taking seriously the crisis in our health service. By now, no-one in Northern Ireland, or indeed the rest of the UK, can be in any doubt about the inequalities in health care that people in Northern Ireland are facing. Yet, here we are, a day before Christmas, with the prospect of nursing staff taking strike action again in early January. googletag.cmd.push “We have written to the Secretary of State to say that we are extremely disappointed to learn of the failure of the health summit last week to produce any resolution to the safe staffing and pay parity issues that form the basis of our action. We are also disappointed to hear that attempts to negotiate an agreement leading to the restoration of the devolved institutions has failed. “Although we wish to see political leadership and accountability in Northern Ireland restored, nurses deeply resent the link that is being made between this and resolving the crisis in health care. Sorting out this crisis is a priority regardless of our political situation, which has been in disarray for the past three years. We do not have another three years to wait. googletag.cmd.push “We wonder how much longer this inaction can continue before somebody, somewhere, can take a decision to recty the problems we are facing ”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The principal cast performed like seasoned professionals, bringing the iconic characters to le with flair and panache.Eoin McGuinness and Ellen McGurnaghan were outstanding in their comic portrayals of Gomez and Morticia Addams, while Annie Haughey and Eoin Moore were superb as the sinister siblings, Wednesday and Pugsley.The hilariously embarrassing grandmother was played by Aisha Oladipupo, and Year  student Conaire Laverty brought endless laughs as the grunting Lurch. Conn Murnin, as Uncle Fester, was a particular audience favourite and his departure on a rocket to seek the love of his le mdash the Moon mdash was a highlight of the show.The ever present long dead Addams ancestors were a tight and focused chorus including a stunning range of costumes from cavemen to flappers. All-American family, the Beinekes, played by Malachy McGrady, Elisha Tumelty and Tomaacutes Harkinleft the audience in stitches as they struggled to deal with ways of the weird and wonderful Addams family. All ended happily ever after, however, as both families moved towards the darkness and embraced who they really were.Featuring an exceptional live orchestra led by Head of Music Celeste McEvoy and music teacher Ciara Coleman, and with magnicent set, costume, lighting and sound complementing the breathtaking musical and dramatic talent of these students, it really was a show not to be missed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Ballynahinch.jpg","title":"Ballynahich Post Office remains  ","story":"RESIDENTS in Ballynahinch will continue to have access to a first class Post Office service in the New Year after all.Days after it was suggested that the current office in Lisburn Street would close temporarily on January , it was confirmed this week that there will be no break in service.The current postmistress will vacate her position on January  with M Retail Ltd taking over the service the following day.Mrs Donna Carlisle mdash who is the current postmistress mdash said everything will continue as normal in the New Year and that there will be no interruption to services.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who said last week that it was his understanding that the Ballynahinch Post Office was to close temporarily, is delighted that normal service is to continue.He said post offices are at the heart of communities and are used by a wide range of people, in particular the elderly, who enjoy the face-to-face contact with staff.ldquoBallynahinch is the districtrsquos third largest town and I am pleased that there will be no interruption to postal services, he continued.ldquoMany elderly people prefer to conduct their business at post offices rather than banks.

The boys are all training hard and we are working on a few dferent permutations for the decider, but it will definitely be horses for courses.ldquoTony McIlhone, Jack McLaughlin and Adam and Gareth George will be key for us in the final. Their experience should stand us in good stead, but I have absolutely no doubt that our young players will rise to the occasion, he added.Fitzsimmons paid tribute to Gerard Kelly, who led the team, to Harry Clarke Cup success last season with Kieran Sharvin and who is still in the management team.ldquoIt is a pleasure and honour to work alongside Gerard, who puts so much effort into keeping the club going. We have been friends for many years and work so well together, he said.ldquoWe have come up with a few ideas on how to get at Ballynahinch Olympic, but we will leave that information to the changing rooms in Meadowvale.Barry McGoran and Marty Sloan have moulded Ballynahinch Olympic Town into a force to be reckoned with, despite the fact that they rarely field with the same  every week due to first team call-ups.As a reserve team, people tend to write them off in the big games, but theyrsquove consistently proved that theyrsquore good enough to compete with anyone.The squad has done exceptionally well to get to another final, but they wont be happy until they get our hands on the cup.McGoran and Sloan like to play the same way as Killough and use the tactic of attack being the best means of defence and Barry feels that Olympic arenrsquot far away from lting the trophy.ldquoWersquore only half way there and need to stay focused. We got a bit carried away last year, but wersquove learnt from that. We need calm heads now, hesaid.ldquoKillough will go into the final as favourites.

In addition, roads officials only have eight electricians to repair faulty street lights across the Province, with just five of these working full-time.The crisis facing street lighting repairs has been highlighted this week by South Down MLA Colin McGrath who has been contacted by many concerned residents across the constituency.He said that the government departmentrsquos failure to sanction work to repair street lights mdash which includes replacing faulty wiring and defective bulbs mdash is a major concern for many, in particular, the vulnerable and elderly.Mr McGrath said that while the issue may appear trivial and mundane to some, to a signicant number of others, itrsquos literally is a matter of personal safety.He said many are fearful of injuring themselves due to faulty street lights which plunge areas around their home into darkness.The MLA declared: ldquoThere is barely a street or road in South Down that does not have street lights which are not working. When there are several defective lights in a row, this creates problems.Mr McGrath said that he and his colleagues have been ldquoinundated with repair requests which are passed on to the departmentrsquos street lighting team.He said that while he is full of admiration for the local team who work tirelessly to resolve faulty streetlights in a professional and courteous way, they can only work with the budget they have been given, one which he said falls well short of what is required.ldquoI have written to the Department for Infrastructure and have found out that the budget for street lighting should be poundm a year. It is currently a mere poundm which is totally inadequate and falls well short of what the public expect, declared Mr McGrath.ldquoApparently, there are only eight full time staff managing the work of replacing and fixing street lights across the whole of North and this is wholly unacceptable. Eight staff from Derry toNewry, and Enniskillen to Ballycastle is not enough and represents a situation that demands action.The MLA confirmed that he has also raised his concerns with the permanent secretary at the helm of the government department asking that in the depths of winter and reduced daylight hours, additional funding will be made to address the issue.Mr McGrath added: ldquoWe are literally in the dark over what will happen next and need to see some solution to this problem.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure has confirmed that officials have discussed the street lighting situation with Mr McGrath.ldquoWhilst we appreciate his concerns, we have explained that in common with many other parts of the public service, the Department continues to face budget challenges and resources are not available to provide for a full street lighting repair service, she continued.ldquoThe Departmentrsquos current budget for street lighting repairs is approximately poundm, which is much lower than the pound.m that would be required to provide a full street lighting repair service.The spokeswoman explained that repairs are now generally limited to those that can be carried out by the departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce, which consists of five full time and three part time electricians.She added: ldquoDue to the restricted service, outages may take much longer than usual to be repaired, with priority being given to hazardous electrical defects and group outages..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Devaney.jpg","title":"Devaney elected as new chairman of Down GAA  ","story":"DOWN GAA elected a new chairman at the annual convention in Newry last Wednesday evening.

But it is only the only project.ldquoThere is quite a lot we can achieve in other areas, on and off the fields of play. Coaching, refereeing, administration, club development and fundraising will also require our attention, he added.ldquoAnd we also want to have the ambition for our teams to reach their potential and challenge for honours. So, the future has real potential for us, but it will require a lot of support, goodwill and a unity of purpose across the county.

Muriel worked in the office of the now defunct Ulster Transport company.They met on a bus from Belfast to Portaferry and the rest, as they say, is history.ldquoI think we were both on the bus from Belfast and my mother, who knew Muriel, sat beside her and they began to talk and then we were introduced, said Alan. ldquoI was sitting behind and my mother then invited her down for supper the next night.Muriel interjected jokingly: ldquoI was supposed to be going to a shorthand class, which would have made my dear father much happier, but I mitched off and went to the Ritz pictures instead.ldquoHis mother had already spotted me and approved me as a likely candidate for her son as she believed that I knew how to keep house since I was doing it at home as my mother died when I was very young.Alan said that his motherrsquos approval of Muriel very much matched his own.ldquoI had clapped eyes on her before and I thought she will do very nicely for me. It was a private thought, but my mother must have picked up on it and had some insight, he added.Muriel did come for supper the next night and an invitation to a dance was given by Alan. They courted for over a year and more whenever he was home on leave.Alanrsquos parents, Rachel and Ian, were in the next room when Alan later asked Muriel to marry him and they celebrated with tea and supper again.ldquoI was completely flabbergasted but I would say that it was a romantic proposal, recalled Muriel. ldquoAlanrsquos father was great at tending to an open fire in the sitting room and his mother was a great hostess in making scones and cake for supper, so I think just after his father tended the fire, Alan turned tome and asked me to marry me. I think I said yes with a laugh as it was so unexpected.The couple spent the early years of their marriage in Malta where Alan was stationed and where the eldest two sons where born.While the family spent a short time living in Bangor, they have spent the last  years living Downpatrick where Alan went on to work for Radio Rentals in the town, and later in the British Red Cross Society in Belfast, while Muriel worked for the Saul playgroup and later in Downpatrick Library.The couplersquos love of music and going to the theatre, both in Belfast, and at the former Theatre Upstairs, in Irish Street, Downpatrick, was a shared passion over the years.Even today, they both love to watch or listen to concerts on the radio or TV, with performances perking up them up from a trying day or calling on their Alexa to play some Glen Miller music.Muriel said: ldquoWe both love the theatre and we both absolutely love music of all sorts. If therersquos anything that doesnrsquot suit us, we have a wee word with Alexa and say itrsquos your turn to chose.Alan added: ldquoIrsquove often said isnrsquot it wonderful that we have the same tastes in common and thatrsquos a great start to a marriage as well as a good sense of humour and a short memory.Muriel said: ldquoI think it did help that we did like the same things but I would say donrsquot leave it too long before you say sorry for whatever may have happened or been said between you.

Cllr Enrightrsquos assertion has been rejected by council officials.ldquoThe long-standing plans to publicly finance the redevelopment of public lands in Downpatrick town centre have been abandoned, he claimed.Cllr Enright said business representatives who attended the meeting in Downpatrick were not informed that a proposed road linking Irish Street with St Patrickrsquos Avenue as part of a new one-way system was not proceeding.He said such a scheme mdash which roads officials have said is not viable given the cost and the small impact that it would have on congestion mdash would have eliminated the need for traffic lights on all the main junctions and ldquomassively reduced congestion around the centre of town.Cllr Enright claimed that when he queried the decision, he was informed that the councilrsquos priorities are the Ballynahinch bypass and Newryrsquos southern relief road.He added: ldquoAll this comes hot on the heels of the scandalous proposed closure of Downpatrickrsquos visitor information centre in favour of Newry, progressing greenways around Newry but not Downpatrick and the abandonment of the promised Edward Street one-way system, which was supposed to have been delivered on a short-term basis in  until the new council revisited the roads priority list.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman said the local authority has allocated poundm to the Newry City Centre regenerationproject, with poundm secured from the Belfast Regional City Deal, not the poundm quoted by Cllr Enright.She continued: ldquoIt has been proposed that the development of Downpatrick town centre and the old PSNI station should be done collaboratively between local and central government with intervention from other public sector bodies.ldquoThis remains the case. However, the one-way system for Downpatrick town centre was considered by Transport NI who have advised that this is not viable.The spokeswoman also confirmed that a report was tabled to the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourismlast month which considered the future opportunities for visitor information centres within the district.She added: ldquo This report was held lsquoin committeersquo and no decisions have been made by Newry, Mourne and Down Council with regards to the closures of existing visitor information centres.

He has said before that he doesnrsquot have the authority, yet he made the last offer.She stressed that none of the union members wanted to take strike action but felt compelled to do so as a last resort.Speaking as her union entered the fourth week of industrial action, she said: ldquoThe fact that Unison, RCN, Unite and NIPSA are all taking strike action today reinforces the fact that health care staff feel passionately about the preservation of the NHS and want to restore it to a service that they can be proud of again and will last for generations to come.ldquoAgain we ask the public to support us as they have previously and join us in the fight to restore our health service to a high standard.She called on recently elected MPs to fulfil their promises of support at last weekrsquos strike and added: ldquoWe look to our local MLAs, Department of Health officials and the Secretary of State to address these issues now.She said that Unison would like to thank local businesses which provided the striking staff with food and refreshments during this time, in particular Molloyrsquos in Downpatrick  A in Crossgar, and Down Community Health Committee members for their support..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Sinn.jpg","title":"Sinn Fein\u0027s candidate sails home on night of drama at Titanic Centre  ","story":"THE re-election of Chris Hazzard largely went under the radar at last weekrsquos election count in Belfast.Originally due to take place in Magherafelt, the South Down count was switched to the Titanic Exhibition Centre in Belfast in the shadow of the iconic Harland and Wolff shipyard and its imposing Sampson and Goliath cranes which dominate the city skyline.The mainstream media effectively ignored the South Down contest in the run-up to last weekrsquos election and, during the counting of votes across six constituencies in the huge Titanic centre, it was more of the same.Predictably, the media focus was on the North and South Belfast seats where DUP heavyweights Nigel Dodds and Emma Little-Pengelly lost out to Sinn Feinrsquos John Finucane and the SDLPrsquos Claire Hanna respectively.Television cameras were focused on the reaction of the winners and losers in the Belfast constituencies and the arrival of DUP leader Arlene Foster mdash on what was a particularly dficult night for her party mdash and Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald and the republican partyrsquos northern leader Michelle OrsquoNeill.Mr Hazzard, who made history two years ago when he broke the SDLPrsquos -year stranglehold on the South Down seat, was officially declared the winner shortly before .am, but his acceptance speech was brief. As was that of SDLP runner-up Michael Savage.They were the only two South Down candidates who made their way to the podium to thank those who voted for them on a night when Northern Irelandrsquos political environment changed signicantly.With voters across the province electing a majority of nationalist MPs for the first time, it truly was a night of edge-of-the-seat political drama. Itrsquos often said that first itrsquos news then its history, but at the Belfast county centre news and history were inextricably intertwined.Minutes after the South Down result had been declared, the glare of the media spotlight was on official confirmation that the DUP had lost South Belfast.As SDLP supporters and the party faithful cheered loudly for Claire Hanna, the Sinn Fein contingent took a moment out of celebrating Mr Hazzardrsquos victory to watch proceedings.Hazzard was always the favourite for the South Down seat and used a sporting analogy to explain how he felt about the contest. He said favourites donrsquot always win, pointing out how hard he worked on the ground, emphasising that the was never complacent about the challenge he faced from the SDLP.From early in the count, SDLP members said that it looked as though their man was in with a real fighting chance and from the boxes which had been opened, the duo were neck and neck.While some of the Sinn Fein contingent appeared to be sporting furrowed brows early into the counting process, they were always confident that their man would emerge victorious and that he did, albeit with a reduced majority.There were suggestions that unionist voters in the Crossgar area had backed Mr Savage, who was clear throughout his campaign that he would not only be an MP for all, but one who would take his seat in the House of Commons.And while it was reported close between him and Mr Hazzard at one stage, the Sinn Fein man eased ahead in the race to cross the winning line, with the SDLP man left wondering what might have been.He had been given a relatively short lead-in time to last weekrsquos parliamentary pole and while pleased with his performance, he clearly felt he could have done even better and pushed the Sinn Fein man all the way to the line.Elsewhere, Alliancersquos Patrick Brown was one of a number of his partyrsquos candidates who built on their recent success at the EU and local council elections.The Westminster poll was viewed as a key litmus test that would rigorously challenge Alliancersquos recent election surge in a first past the post electoral system which did not rely on the votes of other parties.Mr Brown, who in May trebled his Newry, Mourne and Down Council vote in Rowallane, was at it again. His election agent and fellow councillor, Andrew McMurray, stood for Alliance in  and polled , votes, but Brown more than trebled the Alliance vote, a performance which helped his party leapfrog the Ulster Unionists to become the third largest in the province. Overall, Alliancersquos vote in South Down increased by an impressive . per cent, marking a remarkable performance by Brown.Most signicantly, Alliance now has its eyes focused firmly on securing an Assembly seat and while Mr Brown refused to be drawn on whether he would like his name to go forward should such a contest arise, there is no doubt that he will be the partyrsquos preferred candidate. He left the count centre a happy man his stock within his party continues to rise.Elsewhere, the DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna was pleased with his performance, despite his vote decreasing, and he didnrsquot rule out being the partyrsquos flag bearer in a future Assembly electionthis weekrsquos talks at Stormont fail to restore the power-sharing executive.Ulster Unionist, Jill Macauley, defied pundits suggestions that her party would not do well in South Down, by increasing the UUP vote by almost three per cent.Province-wide, the UUP polled , votes but with a new leader in charge the party did not produce the performance it had been hoping for. However, Mrs Macauley provided it with a glimmer of hope with her performanceAontuacute mdash which was contesting its first election mdash polled , votes but party candidate, Paul Brady, wasnrsquot at the count centre in Belfast where party leader Peader Tobin did call late on Thursday evening.As the last of the media interviews were conducted, television and radio sound engineers were doing their best to drown out the clatter of chairs being piled on top of one another and folding tables used by counting staff collapsed to be packed away.The last of the candidates, party supporters, election staff and the media started to drt away from the Titanic Exhibition Centre around .am, following another night of high drama which signicantly reshaped the provincersquos political landscape..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Special.jpg","title":"Special gift for Lorcán  ","story":"CHRISTMAS came early for Downpatrick toddler Lorcaacuten Maguire who received his first dose of le-extending medication yesterday.His parents have been campaigning to get the expensive drug Orkambi free on the NHS since Lorcaacuten, who has Cystic Fibrosis , was just a few months old.Brave Lorcaacuten, who turns three next month, took his drug at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with the help of some strawberry-flavoured milk.However, it was a bittersweet moment for his mother, Jen Banks, as she knows that other parents of children are still patiently waiting for the drug to became available.She said: ldquoLast Christmas I was dreaming about getting Orkambi but it was a dream that would have meant leaving my home, family, and our amazing NHS to move to the south.ldquoThis year on Christmas morning Lorcaacuten will open his stocking and before he opens the rest of his presents, he will have his morning dose of Orkambi with a few segments of chocolate orange. I am so joyful and thankful as is my husband Dermot and our families.Orkambi was made available freely available following a surprise move by Department of Health Permanent Secretary Richard Pengelly at the end of October.Scotland and the Republic of Ireland made the drug free available to CF sufferers earlier but NHS England wrangled with the drug company over price.Once a deal was agreed in England, it paved the pay for Northern Ireland to introduce Orkambi for patients as young as Lorcaacuten, along with Symkevi, which can be given to children aged  and over.Jen was only informed on Monday that the drug was available for Lorcaacuten following a phone call from his treatment nurse.She said: ldquoI was absolutely shaking holding the phone when they told me that Lorcaacuten could get his medication as he has been fighting off the pseudomonas infection since last November.ldquoOrkambi was being given to those children with the higher clinical need and Lorcaacuten got it because of his infection, but I know of so many other families who have campaigned long and hard as we have.ldquoItrsquos just a matter of sufficient quantities of the drug becoming available as I know that the medical teams are working around the clock to distribute to as many patients as they can.Lorcaacuten was observed for five hours in hospital before he was allowed to go home with what his mother calls his ldquomagic medicine. He will need to take it twice daily from now as well as taking his antibiotics and being nebulised several times a day.However, Jen says that studies have shown that children with CF who take Orkambi from the age of six can live with the condition for an extra  years.ldquoThis is not just a Christmas present for this year, but for all the extra years we hope to have with Lorcaacuten, said Jen.ldquoWhilst I love Lorcaacuten to the bottom of my heart, these past three years have been very dficult.

If and when an Assembly election happens, we will certainly be putting a lot of effort into securing a seat in South Down.Mr Brown said he went into the election with the intention of building on the partyrsquos best ever performance in a Westminster poll two years ago when it secured , votes.ldquoWe wanted this election to be our best ever result and we have done that, he declared.ldquoI would say that we knocked more doors in  than in this election as I was responsible for the partyrsquos social media and digital marketing campaign.

NEW YEAR, NEW BEGINNING!”The leaders of the DUP and Sinn Fein used their respective New Year messages to restate a desire toto government.DUP leader Arlene Foster said it must be a decade of “decision rather than dithering”.“The talks will recommence on Thursday,” she said.“We will be there and stand ready to restore devolution through a fair and balanced deal. A Northern Ireland that is going to keeping moving forward must be one where everyone feels at home but must also be one where no-one feels their culture is being marginalised.”While Ms Foster warned that a focus on a potential border poll would lead to a “wasted decade”, Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald insisted a united Ireland was within reach.Someone will get killed - enough is enough say

He said: “The Prime Minister’s speech was heard in respectful silence but the Taoiseach’s speech was marred by some ill-mannered sighs, groans and chattering from unionist delegrations which degenerated at the end into actual interruptions.”Unionists objected to the proceedings being jointly chaired by the British and Irish governments, with an eventual acceptance by Dublin that the secretary of state would act as interim chairman until a decision on a permanent chair.“The SDLP were in grim mood and determined to press for George Mitchell for chairman on the basis of an unchanged agenda and procedural guidelines.”The DUP and UKUP were strongly opposed to Mitchell on two grounds. First, they did not agree with the role he would enjoy and the powers that went with it.“Second, and more crucial in their view, was the fact that he was fatally compromised in unionist eyes because of his background and the way that his appointment had been acclaimed by the Irish government and Sinn Fein.“At this stage the mood of McCartney and Paisley was friendly, jolly and courteous, a condition which did not last.“The UUP had objections to Mitchell which were similar, but in their case the powers and procedures that he would operate under were much more prevalent than their reservations about his backgrounds, which had, to a large extent, been assuaged by personal contact between Mitchell and Trimble.“Their attitude and position was also complicated by all too obvious concerns about being outflanked by Paisley and stirrings within their own party.“Pulling in another direction, however, was Trimble’s evident huge enjoyment about being involved in negotiations which, I believe, contributed to a strong personal reluctance to walk away.Declassied Files: Labour planned to put NI on an involuntary path to Irish unity Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“The Alliance were in deepest gloom. They had been very depressed, though perhaps not surprised, by the procedural wrangling which had, so far, totally dominated events.”Mr Howard said that the Irish government “acquiesced in the subordinate role they played” in the meetings, “though they evidently did not like it”.He said that towards the end of the day “it became clear thatwe were to keep the UUP in the process it would be necessary to address their concern about the procedural rules.” It was accepted that a deal which brought in the UUP would probably not be enough to retain the DUP and UKUP but the judgment of both governments and the independent chairmen was that in such circumstances the talks would remain viable.”The following day the governments tabled proposals for amended procedures and the parties then entered bilateral negotiations with each other, the governments and the chairmen.“After a huge row with the Irish government, the SDLP very reluctantly accepted that this was the best on offer. The DUP and the UKUP effectively rejected it ... in the end and as expected, it came down to trying to do a deal with the UUP.“Their initial reaction to the paper was that it had some good elements in it but the order needed to be changed [appointing a committee first to finalise the rules before appointing a plenary chairman].“However, the Secretary of State said he intended to press ahead with the proposal as it had been tabled.“Trimble at that stage said that this was unacceptable. The Secretary of State said that ... in those circumstances [he] would have little option but to conclude that the talks were not viable [and] suspend them.“A consequence of that, of course, would be that there would be no Forum. This evinced some horried looks, particularly from Geoffrey [sic] Donaldson and a physical mental gulp from Trimble who, nevertheless, said ‘So be it’.“By pm, he said that the Secretary of State had concluded that it was ‘the end of the process’ and “we reported to the Prime Minister suggesting that the only card remaining was a direct call from him to Trimble.“Events then took an extraordinary turn. Very shortly after his meeting with the Secretary of State, Trimble asked to see Senator Mitchell and at . presented a compromise proposal to the Secretary of State, saying that he would be prepared to accept Mitchell as chairman, provided that the interim rules under which he operated were not those of  June, but those which applied during the   talks.“The Secretary of State believed that this was a major concession and the next few hours were spent trying desperately to sell it to the Irish Government and the SDLP.“For a while this showed signs of being fruitless with Hume effectively saying that he and his party had already moved enough in the direction of unionist concerns and would move no further and the Irish showing an overwhelming and inexplicable solitude for the dignity of the three independent chairman [sic], effectively suggesting that it would be best for everyonewe were to cut our losses and move out of the process.” However, he said that “then news filtered up about another almost unprecedented event in the shape of direct negotiations between Irish ministersand David Trimble. .”He said that for several hours that left the British side “in the unaccustomed position of having to twiddle its thumbs while the Irish and the UUP tried to come to terms”.That ended when the tanaiste appeared “clutching a piece of paper... representing an agreement between the Irish, the UUP and the SDLP”.By now it was almost midnight and “Dr Paisley and his colleagues became increasingly loud and belligerent, at one time threatening to burst into the Secretary of State’s office”.When informed that a deal had been done, there were “loud shouts of protests and Paisley, McCartney and their teams stormed out”.Eventually, after midnight, Senator Mitchell took over as chairman and faced a barrage from Dr Paisley who then led the DUP out.Martin Howard said: “In  months as a private secretary I have been privileged to be part of, or witness to, a number of extraordinary events, but I think the last two days has topped them all.“More than once, the whole enterprise was on the point of failure and, in accordance with normal practice in Northern Irish political affairs, was only saved in the small hours of the morning ... most extraordinary of all was the fact that the final deal was done between the Irish government and David Trimble.”He added: “Finally, the other great success has been leaving Sinn Fein literally, and metaphorically, out in the cold. Their attempt to gain entry into the talks on Monday failed to gain them the public confrontation which they had sought and their demonstrations on Tuesday and Wednesday attracted minimal media coverage.”try catch  TrendingGame of Thrones NI actor Andrew Dunbar dies suddenlyThe full list of the  Northern Ireland New Yearrsquos Honours recipientsPSNI issue  warning after receiving highly

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The time for acrimony and ision is over. The time for slogans and soundbites is over. The test now for every party that has talked up getting back to work is to go back to the Executive table and deliver.Stormont imploded three years ago this month when the late Sinn Fein deputy first minister Martin McGuinness resigned in protest at the DUPrsquos handling of a botched green energy scheme.That dispute soon widened to encompass traditional rts over issues such the Irish language and the toxic legacy of the Troubles.A logjam over proposals to reform the petition of concern voting mechanism was one of the main reasons a deal failed to materialise before Christmas.It was designed to protect minority rights but politicians have accused each other of misusing it for their own ends.Discussions around change are focused on making it more dficult for one party to use the petition to block controversial legislation.The parties are also considering amending Assembly rules to make it harder to collapse the institutions..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Talks resume to restore NI powersharing article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Mr Ghosn had been out on bail while awaiting trial on ious financial misconduct allegations. The trial was expected to start in April, though no date had been set.How the Japanese authorities might investigate Mr Ghosnrsquos escape and what action they might take on the apparent security lapses also remains unclear.Japan does not have an extradition treaty with Lebanon.Mr Ghosn, who is of Lebanese origin and holds French, Lebanese and Brazilian passports, disclosed his location in a statement through his representatives but did not say how he managed to flee Japan. He promised to talk to reporters next week.He said he wanted to avoid ldquoinjustice and political persecution.ldquoI am now in Lebanon and will no longer be held hostage by a rigged Japanese justice system where guilt is presumed, discrimination is rampant, and basic human rights are denied, in flagrant disregard of Japanrsquos legal obligations under international law and treaties it is bound to uphold, the statement said. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Carlos Ghosn: Details of his daring escape from Japan may be confirmed in a promised talk with reporters next week  --His lawyer Junichiro Hironaka denied all knowledge of the escape, saying he was stunned. He said he did not expect Mr Ghosn toto Japan.When askedMr Ghosn had taken any of the documents being prepared for the trial, Mr Hironaka said he had not checked but said he doubted Mr Ghosn would care about a trial he had taken such pains to avoid.Japanese media reports said on Wednesday there were no official records of Mr Ghosnrsquos departure from the country, but a private jet had left from a regional airport to Turkey. One report said he sneaked out from his Tokyo home hiding in a case for a musical instrument.Lebanonrsquos minister for presidential affairs, Selim Jreissati, told the An-Nahar newspaper that Mr Ghosn entered legally at the airport with a French passport and Lebanese ID.France has reacted with surprise and confusion, denying any knowledge.Speculation is re that a foreign or Japanese government, or both, might have been involved, or maybe simply turned a blind eye to allow the escape and spare the public from a potentially embarrassing trial.With him missing, Mr Ghosnrsquos trial is suspended.But a trial is still pending against Nissan as a company and Greg Kelly, another Nissan executive. Mr Kelly, an American, has said he is innocent.Mr Kellyrsquos allegations overlap with those charges against Mr Ghosn related to the under-reporting of Mr Ghosnrsquos future compensation. Those charges are less serious than the additional breach of trust accusations against Mr Ghosn.Mr Ghosn has been charged with breach of trust in having Nissan shoulder his personal investment losses, and erting payments in Saudi Arabia and Oman for personal gain.He has repeatedly asserted his innocence, saying authorities trumped up the charges to prevent a fuller merger between Nissan and alliance partner Renault SA..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Carlos Ghosn to  uspend rest of his le in Lebanon u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
