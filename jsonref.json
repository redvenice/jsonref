The actress is set to play Eva Harrington in All About Eve Lily James will play devious a-in-the -making Eve Harrington, who executes a series of Machiavellian moves to usurp a larger-than-life Broadway actress played by Gillian Anderson in a stage adaptation of the Bette Davis classic All About Eve. I can reveal that Lily — who starred in Kenneth Branagh\u0027s screen extravaganza Cinderella, appeared opposite Gary Oldman in Darkest Hour and has the central part in Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again — won the part of Eve (Anne Bax - ter in the 1950 film) after meeting with the director, Belgian theatre artist Ivo van Hove, earlier this month. The show, based on Joseph L. Mankiewicz\u0027s scorching satire of Broadway, will go into rehearsal in early January and begin performances at the Noel Coward Theatre in February. Gillian Anderson, who won the London Evening Standard\u0027s best actress trophy for her turn as Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire, will get to utter one of the most quoted lines of movie dialogue: \u0027Fasten your seatbelts. It\u0027s going to be a bumpy night.\u0027 Initially, Margo Channing, a stage goddess, is unaware of Eve\u0027s cunning. After meeting her young admirer, Margo tells Birdie, her bluntspoken dresser, that Eve is \u0027a lamb loose in our big stone jungle\u0027. But, Birdie is wise to her ways. \u0027What a story!\u0027 she says, scornfully, after hearing Eve\u0027s tragic history. \u0027           Blonde beauty Lily James is set to play the devious Eve Harrington, who executes a series of Machiavellian moves to usurp a larger-than-life Broadway actress played by Gillian Anderson in All About EveEverything but the bloodhounds snappin\u0027 at her rear end.\u0027 And as much as the story appears to be about Eve, it\u0027s really all about Margo.

This was a private visit, and did not count as an official engagement.After a day to catch her breath, the hard-working Queen met a host of guests at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday, including David Beckham and Sir Lenny Henry, for the Young Leaders Awards Ceremony.Looking suitably floral in a green dress, she appeared alongside Prince Harry and Meghan.On Wednesday, she hosted the High Commissioner for Tonga, the ambassador from Zimbabwe and other foreign dignitaries.

The best way to stop the leak would be to shut both main steam stops, which would halt the leak almost instantly.But that would come at a cost – a very big cost. If he did that, the nuclear reactor would be disabled and Revenge would be crippled, dead in the water.‘We would have to surface and signal for a tug,’ Thompson recalls in a book he has just published about his service in this most secretive branch of the Royal Navy.‘Unthinkable. Revenge was a Polaris missile submarine on Strategic Nuclear Deterrent patrol. She was the country’s duty guardian. Surfacing and calling for a tug would mean breaching one of the country’s most highly guarded secrets – where we were.’          NUCLEAR CRISIS: Senior engineer Eric Thompson aboard HMS RevengeHad that happened, the political ramifications would have been huge. With the then Labour Government facing noisy and insistent calls for unilateral disarmament, the image of a crippled nuclear-armed submarine being towed back from waters somewhere near the Soviet Union would have been humiliating and would have increased calls for an abandonment of Britain’s nuclear deterrent.The stakes for Thompson could not have been higher. He was damned one way and possibly killed the other. But then he had an idea, a way that could perhaps save both lives and national prestige. It would be a gamble, but he had nothing to lose.LAST month marked the 50th anniversary of the Royal Navy’s Submarine Service taking on the enormous burden of carrying Britain’s nuclear deterrent.On June 15, 1968, HMS Resolution slipped out of her dock at Faslane on the Clyde to start her first patrol. Resolution would be the first of four submarines in her class, and between them, from 1968 to 1996, they carried out an unbroken series of 229 Strategic Nuclear Deterrent patrols.For the entire duration, they were ready to fire their Polaris nuclear missiles at any target in the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc at just 15 minutes’ notice. It was an extraordinary achievement, and it required extraordinary men and machines.Today, that duty is being carried out by the Navy’s four ageing Vanguard class submarines equipped with the Trident nuclear ballistic missile system, the fate of which is, of course, a political hot potato.Iain Ballantyne, author of The Deadly Trade: The Complete History Of Submarine Warfare From Archimedes To The Present, explains: ‘Paradoxically, the only way for Britain to have a voice in multilateral nuclear disarmament may be for it to build the new Dreadnought class submarines to give it the weight to demand an end to the nuclear balance of terror.‘What is deeply worrying is the current situation where Theresa May’s Government – and preceding Labour, Tory and Coalition administrations – have so weakened the nation’s conventional deterrent forces that nuclear weapons become the first resort – rather than the last resort – if the nation is faced with an existential threat from a nuclear-armed foe, such as Russia.’          Some crew members dressed in drag for the ship’s revues. Such theatrics provided an excuse for transvestism, and one snatched Polaroid shot shows a burly crew member in grotesque make-up, wearing lilac tights and a lurid green mesh top struggling to contain a false embonpoint the size of a couple of torpedoesIf there was some seriously bad news, it was withheld by the captain until the end of the patrol. Eric Thompson once had to inform a chief petty officer his wife had left him, and to another, he had to break the news that his father had died. But there was once worse. On the night before Repulse finished one of its patrols, Commander Bob Seaward had to summon one of his crew to inform him his wife and child had been killed in a car crash seven weeks before.‘After more than ten weeks on patrol, that poor man would have been overjoyed at the prospect of a reunion with his wife and child the following day,’ Thompson observes, ‘only to be told they had been killed.’Deal of the century: UK defence firm BAE wins contract worth...Ex-head of the Armed Forces lashes Theresa May for...Surveillance splurge: Government spends $7 BILLION on six...Bomb squad is called to BAE Systems after suspicious item is...Share this articleIn order to break the monotony of life on board, various entertainments were laid on. Of course, the Polaris subs operated well before Kindles and tablets, and today the entertainments seems almost quaint.Men played games such as Ludo and cribbage, or watched one of the 56 films brought on board. Quizzes were a staple activity and some aspiring disc jockeys even used the sub’s sound system to inflict their favourite music on crewmates. Fitness fanatics could use rowing and cycling machines, lift weights and even play table tennis. More cerebral types studied for public exams.Even plays and revues were staged. The exhibition in Gosport shows that on one patrol, a group called the Polaris Players staged a show called A Deep Distraction, featuring morris dancing, a barber shop quartet, and even a group describing themselves as ‘Scottish opera’.Such theatrics provided an excuse for transvestism, and one snatched Polaroid shot shows a burly crew member in grotesque make-up, wearing lilac tights and a lurid green mesh top struggling to contain a false embonpoint the size of a couple of torpedoes.Eric Thompson recalls one such ‘lady’ being so attractive that pin-ups of him appeared all over the submarine. ‘It’s frightening what eight weeks without female company can do to a man’s judgment,’ Thompson reflects.Such antics were not the only eccentricities that crew members displayed. One commanding officer was known to take a sports jacket and flannel trousers on every patrol and after the Sunday morning service, he would put them on and have a picnic in a private corner of the submarine.Banter and high jinks were also staple fare. Men could find themselves unable to get out of their bunks because they had been trapped inside by a wall of parcel tape. Cigars – yes, smoking was allowed – were sometimes fitted with exploding tips. Sleeping bags were placed into the rubbish compactor and returned to their owners as tight cubes.Naturally, with so many confined in such a small space for weeks, personalities could clash and tempers could flare, but with training and officers keeping discipline, there is no account of things getting out of control. In the main, it appears the men looked out for each other, with many performing selfless tasks.One of the most remarkable in the eyes of Eric Thompson was the supreme act of valour carried out by a crewmate called Tom Chittenden, who went scuba ing in the sewage tank to unlock the valve that released its contents overboard. With all the toilets blocked, had he not succeeded, the results would have been unthinkable. ‘He should have received an honour for that,’ Thompson writes.Had Chittenden become ill as a result of his e, he would have been treated by the submarine’s doctor, qualified to carry out many life-saving operations, as well as keeping his eye on the mental health of the crew.However, if a crewman was critically ill, he would have to survive until the end of the patrol. If he did not, his body would be stored in the food freezers. Nothing, not even life, was more important than maintaining the country’s nuclear deterrent.Of course, it was that which united these men – their exceptional role as the Prime Minister’s trigger if he or she wanted to launch a nuclear strike against, in all likelihood, the Soviet Union. The submarine had to be ready at all times to fire its missiles and to keep the crew sharp, weapons systems readiness tests were carried out at random.When the orders for such tests came in, the crew had no way of knowing whether the test was the real thing, and it was not until the senior officers had decoded the full order that the crew would become aware they were not in fact consigning millions of people to their deaths.It is chilling to reflect that each submarine had more firepower than all the ammunition expended in the Second World War. Of course, no such order has ever been issued for real. However, what was frighteningly real was the situation faced by Eric Thompson back in June 1978, with the critical leak of high-pressure steam.With just seconds to spare, Thompson decided to take a gamble on what he later called an ‘obscure dockyard procedure never used at sea’. Too complex to explain here, Thompson’s gamble involved the equivalent of ‘emptying the domestic hot water tank straight into the toilet’.‘For what seemed like an eternity, nothing happened,’ he recalled.‘The roaring of the steam continued. The humidity was unbearable. Then there was a mighty whoosh down the starboard steam range behind my back. \u0027It was like letting go the neck of an inflated balloon. The boiler had been deflated. The roar of steam had stopped.’Although crisis had been averted, for the next eight weeks, the maximum speed was severely reduced and there would be no extra power to deal with any emergencies. Thankfully, none came.What Thompson soon discovered was that one of the crew had tried to squeeze through the jungle of pipework through the scalding steam to shut down the critical valve, but had been unable to make it.In doing so, he ripped his back open. Thompson recommended him for a medal and the crewman, James ‘Bungy’ McWilliams, was awarded the Queen’s Gallantry Medal.Although there was no chance of a nuclear meltdown or the Polaris missiles detonating, it had been a close-run thing. It was the nearest – as far as we know – that our nuclear ballistic submarines have come to a major disaster.Meanwhile, the four Resolution class submarines are lying in a dock at Rosyth on the Firth of Forth, waiting to be decommissioned in a process costing many millions that will last until 2040.Once the secret killers of the deep, they can now be easily seen with Google Earth. It seems an ignominious ending for these awesome instruments of Armageddon.On Her Majesty’s Nuclear Service, by Eric Thompson, is published by Casemate Publishers, priced £19.99.

Pictured: Former home secretary Amber Rudd I was Home Secretary last year when the UK fell victim to a spate of terrorist attacks after similar incidents in Belgium, France, and Germany.It felt relentless.It was a dangerous period, not only because of the attacks that got through but also because of the ones that were stopped – 16 since March last year alone.The trial against Khalid Ali – arrested in April last year for carrying knives in Whitehall – has recently concluded. I was in the Commons when that arrest happened. Parliament was briefly on lockdown that afternoon. It is now well known that Ali was a trained maker of IEDs.Each time an incident took place, other home secretaries from European countries offered condolences. I would do the same when an incident took place in their country. It mattered because we were all targets for the radical Islamist propaganda that was leading to this violence. We all are still. With European counterparts, I would share experiences about deradicalisation and how to limit access to weapons and stop convicted terrorists radicalising others in prison.But the most important part of protecting our citizens was about sharing data. The UK played a leading role in originating data programmes that allow countries to know more about who is coming into and moving within the EU. We should have no borders in data and intelligence sharing in protecting citizens.It would be madness if intransigence in Brussels led to this shared law enforcement being diluted as the UK leaves the EU, leading potentially to fatal events. Other EU home secretaries agree. I know a little about resignations – that would be the least of their problems.The UK is not threatening the EU Commission. Our offer to them on security co-operation is unconditional. Strong security is not a competition, it is a partnership.The Prime Minister is right. We must have a security treaty that builds on the UK\u0027s role in keeping all European citizens safe. We were ready and patient to make progress last year. Let\u0027s get on with it.

A lovely man, it shocked me to see him tense himself as he began to walk through the crowd.I was looking forward to an interesting game. He was anticipating abuse just for the colour of his skin.In more recent times, leaden-footed performances on the field have been accompanied by bouts of drunken ill-discipline off the pitch, and a surly lack of focus and, in some cases, commitment.Mercifully, things are very different now. Crowds are becoming as multiracial as the teams and all-seat stadiums have allowed football to become a family experience, not just a beer-sodden afternoon out for men.Women and children have had a civilising influence on football, which is why I welcome the number of women now engaged in the media for this World Cup.And so to Tuesday, when England will go into the last-16 match against Colombia as the holders, for the first time, of the under-17 and the under-20 World Cups. Dare we dream that we might lift the greatest football trophy of all?Come what may, I will be cheering them on as a symbol of just how much they have done already to transform the image of the sport I love. And it’s all the more astonishing for their youth. It testifies to the strength and numbers of the real talents coming through, which belatedly the FA and the top clubs have now chosen to support with real resources.Today’s players possess a set of skills that puts them on a far higher pinnacle than any other England team of recent years.The influx of foreigners into the Premiership has not ruined the career prospects of young English players as some have claimed, including many distinguished ex-professionals.Try telling that to the likes of Dele Alli, Jesse Lingard, Harry Kane and the rest.These young stars have learnt a lot from competing with the best from abroad.Meanwhile, the manager has combined the disciplined positioning that is essential to a successful team with encouragement for the flair players to express themselves.Well done Gareth Southgate for binding them together so well. And for standing up for decency and respect, and for leading his squad with such calmness and authority. He has been an absolute revelation to me at this tournament.In Harry Kane, too, we have a captain worthy of the title.No, this young side probably won’t win the tournament, although I hope for even more success over the next fortnight. But whatever the final result, they have already won our hearts and minds.After so many England embarrassments down the years, at long last we have a bunch of lads who look like the best of England, rather than the worst.Let the chants ring loud and proud: Cry ‘God for Harry, England and St George!’  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/30/19/4DC9E0B400000578-0-image-a-2_1530381753884.jpg","title":"Emergency services hunt man 30s vanished swimming lake","story":"    All emergency services including search and rescue at the scene on a missing man at Crown Lakes, Peterborough          A number of police and fire units were seen in the area including the force helicopter which was hovering above the water          Police have cordoned off an area at a lake as they continue their search for a missing man in his 30s          A number of young people took their floats and inflatables to cool off in the heat at the water where the man has gone missingA number of police and fire units were seen in the area including the force helicopter.It was spotted hovering above the scene between Yaxley and Farcet. Three babies drown and more than 100 migrants are feared...\u0027Our hearts are shattered into more than a million pieces\u0027:...Share this articleThe air ambulance is also at the scene and a search is being carried out around the lake at the Yaxley end.Police are concerned for the welfare of a man in his 30s who entered the water this afternoon.           Emergency services are continuing to search for a man in his 30s who vanished while swimming in a lake during Britain\u0027s 88F heatwave          An air ambulance is at the scene and a search is being carried out around the lake at the Yaxley end of the water          The area near the water at Crown Lakes in Farcet, Peterborough has been blocked off as police continue their search for the missing manA Cambridgeshire police spokesman said: \u0027We are currently searching for a male in his 30s who became distressed while in the water at Crown Lakes in Farcet, near Peterborough.\u0027This has involved police, fire and ambulance services.\u0027We received the call just before 3.30pm and the area is still sealed off.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/30/20/4DCA3F0300000578-5904627-image-a-39_1530386489913.jpg","title":"Cristiano Ronaldo girlfriend Georgina Rodriguez watches Portugal Uruguay World Cup clash","story":"    Spanish model Georgina Rodriguez, 22 (pictured) was pictured in a red corset top and silver hoop earrings as she looked onto the pitch to watch her beau, 32, take on Portugal           Ronaldo\u0027s signature pre-free kick stance got the crowd going in Sochi as he pulled his shorts up to prepare for the shot - but it ended up off-target          With her long hair swept back she was later spotted in an elegant white coat as she chatted to a friend at Sochi\u0027s Fisht Stadium          Ronaldo\u0027s girlfriend Georgina is pictured with his son Cristiano Jr at Sochi\u0027s Fisht StadiumThe Portuguese side fell behind in the first half after Edinson Cavani scored for Uruguay, but Pepe managed to equalise in the 54th minute.They went 2-1 down when Cavani netted another sensational goal for Uruguay, as they sailed through to the next round.  Ronaldo\u0027s signature pre-free kick stance got the crowd going in Sochi as he pulled his shorts up to prepare for the shot - but it ended up off-target.  Portuguese fans wept as their World Cup dreams fell to pieces on Saturday evening.Are Three Lions DOOMED by the curse of ITV?

Now, the East Sussex house where Anthony Burgess wrote the novel – and set the scene of a violent break-in and assault – is for sale.Burgess lived in the Victorian semi-detached house on the High Street in Etchingham between 1960 and 1968, when he sold it to his neighbour and former cleaner. It was in the study – now a bedroom – that he wrote his seminal 1962 novel, a nightmarish vision of youth in revolt for which he invented a futuristic slang called Nadsat, in which house was domy and to buy kupet. Kubrick’s 1971 screen adaptation sparked controversy with its violent and sexually explicit scenes.Burgess, a former literary critic of the Observer, wrote the first two Enderby books in the house, as well as Nothing Like the Sun, a novel about Shakespeare’s love-life narrated in Elizabethan English.Professor Andrew Biswell, Burgess’s biographer and director of the International Anthony Burgess Foundation in Manchester, told the Observer: “It’s fascinating to be able to see the interior of Burgess’s former residence, where he wrote so many of his important books.”He added: “This could be an opportunity for a Clockwork Orange super-fan to own the house where the novel was written. Burgess’s novel features a middle-aged author much like himself, who is writing a book entitled A Clockwork Orange. The author and his wife are beaten up by a gang of teenage droogs who invade their home.” The typescript of his novel ends with the words “Etchingham, Sussex. August 1961”.Biswell acknowledged that “prospective buyers of Burgess’s house may be rather put off by this fictional episode of violence in the home”.But, like Burgess, buyers may well fall for a four-bedroom, three-storey house with views over large gardens and open countryside. It is on the market for £510,000.Burgess lived in the house, called Applegarth, with his first wife, Lynne. She died in 1968 and he then left England to settle in Malta.Biswell said: “Writing about Sussex in the 1960s, Burgess remembered the village of Etchingham as a sleepy place where only half the houses had good drains. He said that his neighbours across the road had to make do with outside toilets and a trench.”A selection of his essays, including many pieces written in Etchingham, appears in The Ink Trade, published by Carcanet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/454fd648524d97a12aa73d302cd96d410cf437bc/1_0_5200_3121/master/5200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=503ac523343049412712cbedcf6736be","title":"quiz how well do you know business jargon","story":"Want to get soaked in a thought shower?

Even so, we generally prefer not to be at the centre of the news we are reporting. Yet as George Orwell knew, there are times when the journalist cannot avoid being part of the story. Carole Cadwalladr, winner of this year’s Orwell prize for journalism, has made a virtue of this necessity. Not only has she broken some of the most important stories of the last two years, she has also involved her readers in her own voyage of discovery, taking us with her as she navigates the murky waters of the Brexit and Trump phenomena. There is a large personal cost to this: Cadwalladr has been exposed to the wrath of the forces she has been exposing. But it has been a vital demonstration of the power of real journalism. She has not just demanded transparency – she has shown in her own brilliant reporting what transparency looks like.As the appalling massacre of journalists in Maryland has reminded us, the free press is fighting for its life. One of the preludes to authoritarianism is the undermining of the legitimacy of independent media. The purpose is obvious: to clear the field for far-right propaganda machines. Donald Trump’s systematic targeting of reporters as “enemies of the American people”, the dismissal of all inconvenient reporting as “fake news” and the organised online contempt for the “mainstream media” (which of course does not include approved media giants such as Fox News and the Daily Mail) all serve this same grim purpose. Orwell, of course, would have recognised all of this from the 1930s, and one suspects therefore that he would also have recognised that the bile that has been directed towards Cadwalladr is the ultimate tribute to her effectiveness.She has had to withstand the full range of attacks, from openly sexist sneering to accusations of professional incompetence, from legal menaces to “jokey” incitements to violence. When Leave.EU posted a video of a sequence from Airplane! in which Cadwalladr’s face was substituted for that of a “hysterical” woman who is repeatedly smacked about the head, the message was as clear as it was crude.Cadwalladr’s response has been not to hide behind the relative anonymity of print, but to use the word “I” with seriousness and deliberation. She has, as it were, reported on her own reporting, telling us not just what she has found out about the manipulation and subversion of the democratic process in the US and the UK, but how she has found it. The results of her work have been momentous – the exposure of the role of Cambridge Analytica and its satellite AggregateIQ, aided by the culpable negligence of Facebook, in the Trump and Brexit campaigns. But almost as important has been the process – the week-by-week demonstration of what investigative journalism in the public interest really looks like in this radically altered media environment.For what Cadwalladr has shown is not just what journalism can do but what it must not do. In the face of the onslaught, it is tempting for newspapers to take refuge in an Olympian tone – trust us, we’re professionals. That, of course, suits the far-right narrative of “old media” as detached, elitist, smug. Cadwalladr’s reporting has done the opposite. She has never pretended to know the whole story. On the contrary, she has always made it clear that what she has been trying to do is to identify a few stars in a very dark sky and to map the connections between them so that the constellation of forces shaping contemporary politics gradually emerges. It is a long and radically incomplete task.This effort is innately and intimately personal. It is, of course, impossible without the long-term support of a media institution, of editors and colleagues. But while that support is a necessary condition, it is not a sufficient one. There is still that unblinking “I”, that personal commitment to discovering and telling the truth about what is being done to our democracies.Carole Cadwalladr has placed herself on the frontline in the fight to preserve open societies against rich, powerful and ruthless enemies. She has done so with the courage, skill, resilience and undaunted optimism of one who believes that fight can and must be won.Fintan O’Toole is a columnist with the .

The removal men fashioned waterproof capes from bubble wrap, squeezed the last bit of decades of accumulated crap on board, and then set off damply to catch the ferry. They didn’t, of course “conditions” on the M4 saw to that. So we arrived in Co Kilkenny 12 hours ahead of them, and sat on some borrowed plastic garden chairs, waiting.“Stop telling people we’ve bought a farm,” my bloke keeps saying. “It’s a farmhouse. We haven’t got a tractor or any livestock and you don’t even know what arable means.” Pfff. Whatever. I haven’t moved from a main road in central London to a lane in the back of beyond not to indulge my fantasy of\u0026nbspplaying Marie Antoinette at the Petit Trianon (Kirsten Dunst version). There’s hay. I can hear cows. It’s a\u0026nbspfarm.Not only have I never lived in the countryside, I’ve barely been there if you grow up in home counties suburbia with an internal drumbeat thudding “get-to-London”, you try not to go via the Lake District. Everything that has been good about my life – my friends, libraries, newspapers, bars, restaurants, train stations, shoe shops – has been urban. I am a person who once had Amazon Prime Now deliver extra provisions in the middle of a dinner party – so sue me.But then we got older, and so did our loved ones, and many of them are in the Republic of Ireland. And then, the killer blow: the Republic of Ireland is in the European Union, and our country, through a combination of hilarious mishaps and outright swindles, is about not to be. In the words of the old commercial for the Irish lager Harp, time for a sharp exit.Actually, it was anything but sharp: several years of waiting for circumstances to align perfectly, then the realisation that they never would and that we just had to make the leap. Thus, we find ourselves engaged in a little light commuting, which itself tees up an interesting process of compare-and-contrast. In Ireland, things that I had no reason to notice throughout years of visiting suddenly present themselves as unromantic daily facts: privatised rubbish collection, more limited booze-buying hours in supermarkets, a marked absence of public transport.But they are as nothing to the delights of small-town and rural life. The shebeen – put simply, a pub in someone’s house – at the end of the road, the only place of entertainment within walking distance, is open four nights a week. And when I say “nights”: it starts up around 10pm and serves until 3am. If the owners aren’t about, they leave an outside light on to let you know it’s fine to go in and help yourself. In the proper pubs in town (use of the word “village” is a very specific business here, and quite unlike the Cotswolds definition), you can buy shotgun cartridges and rat poison along with your pint.At Christmas a few years ago, my roiling Irish adopted family persuaded me and my English father that a complicated-looking tool on the wall of the pub was what farmers used for trepanning sheep suffering from the gid, a brain disease. It turned out to be a standard gouge. Now, I am making arrangements to have my own hay\u0026nbspbaled.I fear terribly that I will become the ex-city dweller of Stewart Lee’s comedy sketch, begging friends to come to visit, promising horses at the end of the garden and finally plaintively requesting they bring cocaine. I am already cross that I can’t access the BBC iPlayer, and that my favourite online makeup company doesn’t deliver to the ROI.But what’s more likely is that I try to out-Irish the Irish. I am already in love with the language, especially as it pours from the mouth of the bloke’s mum. She threatens to give you a fellandibang (“wallop”), or hop your head off the wall anything in her way, particularly a cow, is a Protestant you might want half a cup of tea out of your hand, if you’re in a rush and anybody displaying airs and graces might be displaying gorster, and definitely notions.Already, I am starting sentences with “Sure, lookit” and “Howya”, a sure sign that I must guard against becoming what Danny Dyer would quite rightly call “a twat”. And I must let Dyer also remind me that the British, too, have a brilliant way with the language it’s just that the gift seems to be more widely distributed this side of the Irish Sea.As does the gift of optimism. Another favourite Irish phrase, in response to a piece of gloom and doom, asks: “Could you not have the good word?” In fairness, Ireland has more to have the good word about following a series of dramatic referendums, it is throwing off its constitution to become a progressive and liberal version of its\u0026nbspalready beautiful self.Am I now a citizen of nowhere? It doesn’t feel like it. Through the sheer good fortune of wandering into an Irish family, I feel like I have allowed a billowing gust of air to blow through my life. I feel like I have granted myself the permission not to be chained to a bickering, ided, petty, cruel country, its plight not the fault of its predominantly decent populace but of a bewildered governing elite and a cabal of vicious chancers.

Some schools were found to be engaged in “aggressive marketing campaigns and ‘cream skimming’ aimed at recruiting particular types of students”.The findings form part of a state-of-the-nation study of England’s education system, drawn up by academics at the UCL Institute of Education over four years, which will be published on Tuesday. It includes the examination of Ofsted data over a decade, a statistical analysis of the impact of multi-academy trusts (MATs), 47 detailed school case studies and a survey of almost 700 school leaders.The reforms were largely implemented under the coalition government and championed by Michael Gove as education secretary. A plan to force all English schools to become academies was abandoned in 2016 after a backlash among Tory MPs.The study concludes that any new autonomy handed to schools had been “more than balanced” by testing and inspections that had ensured the state remains in control from a distance. The drive to turn schools into academies, the key part of reforms since 2010, is described as “uneven and often fraught”.There is also worrying evidence of schools improving or keeping their high status by shunning children who qualify for free school meals, whose parents receive state help. “Our analysis of national Ofsted data for the periods 2005-10 and 2010-15 showed a relationship between inspection grades and the changing socioeconomic composition of a school’s student body,” say the authors, Toby Greany and Rob Higham.“Schools that sustained or improved their judgment to ‘outstanding’ in the 2010-15 period saw, on average, a reduction in the percentage of students eligible for free school meals (FSM), while schools retaining or being downgraded to a ‘requires improvement’ and ‘inadequate’ judgment saw, on average, an increase in FSM eligibility.”The study admits it cannot say conclusively why better-performing and improving schools have admitted fewer poorer students.The study amounts to a stark assessment of sweeping education reforms introduced in the past eight years, as part of an attempt to build a “self-improving school-led system (SISS)”. Key measures include forcing schools to become academies, the promotion of multi-academy trusts (MATs) and the rolling back of local authorities from education.Ministers said the reforms would “dismantle the apparatus of central control and bureaucratic compliance” by handing power to schools. However, analysis by the academics shows there is no positive impact from MAT status for pupils in either primary or secondary academies when compared to pupils in similar standalone academies. For secondary schools, there was no statistically significant benefit for students when compared to all other schools.It looked at data from 2009 to 2015, examining average performance and progress of children at primary school, including in reading, writing and maths. For secondary school pupils, it examined the proportion of students achieving at least 5 GCSEs or equivalent qualifications at A*-C including English and maths, as well as their progress in English and maths.School leaders deemed to be leading the way in the new system are being handed new opportunities and power, it finds. However, it adds that they are faced with “conflicting and unreasonable demands” from government, while being treated with suspicion by less favoured schools. The study warns of the power that the new system can hand to “charismatic, authoritarian leaders”.It warns that the system in which the involvement of councils has been stripped back, with fellow schools encouraged to help their struggling counterparts, is actually seeing the creation of a market for advice – with schools charging for their expertise on how to improve.“And thanks to our reforms schools that aren’t delivering for young people are being turned around, with 65 per cent of schools made into a sponsored academy seeing improvement from inadequate to good or outstanding. But there is always more to do, which is why we are investing £23bn by 2020 to create more good school places and we are targeting £72m at the areas that need it most to help improve prospects and opportunities for some of the most disadvantaged young people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dd148c1bd79a02d1214d590b8da871cfc6c1227/0_11_2559_1535/master/2559.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02887be44dbb733d834aecdca63c9b5b","title":"harry kane world cup chingford england football","story":"Idols, as England fans have learned from years of bitter experience, invariably have feet of clay, not golden boots. Harry Kane is different.Despite every effort by fans to keep World Cup expectations on a simmer, Kane provokes eruptions of optimism: on the one hand, England haven’t won a tournament knock-out game since 2006 and face Colombia, a top-rated team, in their next one on Tuesday evening. On the other hand is Harry Kane: five goals so far, more than any other player including megastars such as Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.Nowhere epitomises this tension as well as Chingford, the north-east London suburb where the England captain and Tottenham Hotspur striker grew up. Fewer people have hung out England flags than in previous years. The streets are not filled with people wearing England shirts. The town of Norman Tebbit, who as its MP invented the “cricket test” as a way of questioning immigrants’ loyalties, seems at first glance to be ambivalent about the national team.Scratch the surface and you find hope – chiefly because of Kane.“There’s more hope now. There’s more optimism, although it’s probably a false hope,” says Ian McGill, whose home has flags outside. “But Germany have been knocked out, so they can’t knock us out again. We went to the pub for the Belgium game and people didn’t seem too disappointed that we’d lost.“We’re going into the second half of the draw with teams we can beat. Maybe we can do it.”As an Arsenal fan, McGill is not naturally well-disposed towards Kane, whose Premier League goals over the last three seasons have led Spurs to become the current kings of north London.“Even though I’m not a Tottenham supporter, it was nice to see him doing well, a boy from Chingford,” he says.His wife Karen, from a family of Spurs fans, is more effusive: “It’s inspirational really. I first heard about him 10 years ago because he went to the same school as my brothers. He stuck in my mind because of the local connections.”Those connections are still strong. Kane was born in Walthamstow in 1993 and his parents, Kim and Patrick, who is originally from Galway in Ireland, have lived in the area for more than 30 years.“He was a lovely boy,” says Verna Denny, the welfare assistant at his primary school, Larkswood. “I remember I lost a ring on my little finger. I was looking everywhere for it and couldn’t find it. Harry found it in the playground and brought it to me. I’ve still got it.“When I think now what he’s achieved, it’s absolutely wonderful. When I think I used to see him kicking a ball around in the playground and he’s now playing for England, it’s just magical.”People in Chingford have seen superstardom before in one of their own. David Beckham went to the same secondary school, Chingford Foundation School, and played for the same youth team, Ridgeway Rovers.Nick Zenonos, who grew up near Parmiters sports ground and played for Ridgeway rivals, Brimsdown, believes that Kane and Beckham are opposites.“He doesn’t have the David Beckham glamour look about him and that’s given kids, especially in this area, a lot of hope. They know that if they work hard then they could be like Harry Kane – he’s done it, so maybe they can too.”Coming from a family of diehard Spurs fans, and living within sight of Tottenham’s White Hart Lane stadium, Kane was scouted and briefly signed by Arsenal, whose training ground is next door to Ridgeway Rovers. They failed to spot Kane’s potential and he joined the Spurs academy.“It’s a little bit surreal,” Zenonos says. “As a Spurs fan, he’s one of my absolute heroes. When I first saw him though, I didn’t really see any stand-out abilities. I never thought he’d even be a Premier League player. I almost don’t expect him to keep going because he’s such a normal bloke.”Kane seems to thrive on those low expectations. A video on his social media account shows him practising, overlaid with quotes from his detractors: “He won’t make it”, “Struggled on-loan”, “One-season wonder”, “Not world class”. Determination to prove the doubters wrong is essential to his success.John Viggers was one of the first to see Kane up close, when he was sent on loan from Spurs to Leyton Orient, the other local club, to play League One football.“A lot of Spurs players came on loan to Leyton Orient: Andros Townsend, Tom Carroll, Harry Kane,” he says. “Kane was probably the least spectacular, but I remember saying to my mate, ‘He’s the best one of this bunch – he’s going to shine in the future’.”Viggers says Chingford has changed since the Beckham era. “It’s true there are fewer flags than there used to be. I think interest in football is waning. I know there’s lots of hype about the Premier League but there’s too much money in football – it’s a business. That’s why Kane stands out. He appears to be bothered about the fans.”The fact that Kane seems different to the stereotype of previous generations of footballers, with their ostentations and bling-seeking, attention-hungry behaviour, is what makes him inspiring, Zenonos says. “He comes across as such a normal, humble guy. His family have always got time for people. He seems like one of us that made it. It’s what makes the ‘one of our own’ chant so powerful. I think that definitely plays a part in making people feel proud.”At the Dovecote pub in north Chingford, where the Kane family has been seen from time to time, signs of enthusiasm have been stronger. Some 1,100 people turned up to watch England play Belgium on the big screen in the beer garden.“It’s just been crazy – they were parking on the grass verges outside, trying to get in,” Alex Agbloe says. He and his partner, Leslie Nkansah, run Blackstar Kitchen at the pub, feeding fans with their enormous barbecue and smoker.“There’s been a lot of cheering and singing ‘It’s coming home’. I’m not a massive football fan but I’m really getting caught up in it. People are talking about the quarters and semis. It gets people buzzing and it gives us hope for the next four years.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc27d2aa51512499151f81e49f535dbe49cfe1a7/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=633886551f86c1a8dc001926389f038a","title":"world cup players premier league colombia","story":"David Moss, former head of scouting at Celtic and head of football operations at Huddersfield, selects two Colombians among those who have made an impressionSome wingers have a reputation for laziness but Rebic bucks that trend. He is over 6ft, very fast and powerful, a fine dribbler and so direct in his play, forever seeking the byline rather than tracking back inside and slowing the buildup play. But, while he is offensively aggressive, he is just as proactive defensively. His work-rate is phenomenal. The 24-year-old is ever eager to close down defenders and regain the ball, averaging around 30 challenges per game. He presses and works feverishly, making him a huge asset on the flank or through the middle.He needs to improve his finishing given he works himself into fine positions, while his decision-making on the ball, perhaps because he runs so fast, is also a work in progress and he is prone to over-elaborate. That comes down to football intelligence but it may be something he learns with time. But most sides want to press from the front these days, so would be attracted to Rebic for that work-rate, pace and physical presence.Would he suit the Premier League? At the start of last season, one top-flight club agreed a fee of around £4m with Fiorentina, but Croatia were not fully formed members of the European Union and Rebic was not a regular in the national side so he did not automatically qualify for a work permit. His case went to a tribunal and the move was turned down. He ended up going on loan to Eintracht Frankfurt and now, on the back of a fine World Cup, he would most likely cost in excess of £30m.South America was not an area I had scouted particularly heavily so, when I saw Quintero play against Japan, I thought: ‘Wow, who is this?’ The playmaker’s exquisite technique is of the top level. His first touch, passing, dribbling and shooting are all up there. He has that ability to sense teammates’ runs and supply key passes, and his delivery from open play against Poland took the breath away, as did the way he carried possession forward.Yet Quintero, owned by Porto but on loan at River Plate, does not offer as much defensively. Colombia play a 4-3-3, so he needs a strong defensive midfielder behind him to provide cover. That makes you wonder if there is a laziness to his character, or does he simply not have the tactical understanding of the defensive game? That said, so many teams sit deep against elite clubs these days, and the 25-year-old can unlock opposing defences in tight areas. That is a rare gift.Would he suit the Premier League? Maybe not. Quintero has had two brushes with European football, with Porto – who still own him – and on loan at Rennes, where he hardly played. His best form has come in South America. Maybe there have been adaptation issues because he is not young. In that context, he might actually be better suited for Spain or Italy. Premier League clubs could be taking a risk.Milinkovic-Savic arrived at the World Cup with a burgeoning reputation, and his performances for Serbia merely enhanced it. The Lazio midfielder, at 6ft 3in, is an imposing presence, strong in the air both offensively and defensively, and puts his foot in when required. But his major asset is his eye for goal. To have scored 12 from 35 games in Serie A last season was outstanding, and the Driblab stats upon which I lean show he fires off shots from all angles. Everything about him is attack-minded: he is confident dribbling, has excellent technique and close control for such a tall man, and good vision to make those cute passes for runners.Like Rebic, he closes opponents down. The only drawback is a lack of explosive pace. He has a languid, one-paced running style and that gives the impression he is ambling through contests. The reality is very different – he makes challenges and has a spikiness to his game – but the absence of a burst of speed holds him back.Would he suit the Premier League? Instinctively, he looks a perfect fit for Manchester United. The 23-year-old boasts the stature to play in a José Mourinho side, has worked with Nemanja Matic and would be an upgrade on Ander Herrera or Marouane Fellaini. Yet the price may be prohibitive. I first scouted him in Serbia back in 2014, playing for Vojvodina, when he was available for £600,000. Genk snapped him up quickest and then sold him a year on for £9m. Now Lazio will be seeking nearer £80m for his signature.Akanji has everything you’d look for in a top-level central defender. He is over 6ft and powerfully built, has excellent technique and is quick, sharp on the turn and able to match forwards for pace in one-on-one situations. A player who stepped up to the national team only a year ago can pass accurately short or long. For someone who turns 23 in July, those attributes mark him out, and he has impressed in a Switzerland team who have taken plenty by surprise.Other aspects require work. For a centre-half, he is not yet as dominant in the air as he might be, though that may come with age given he clearly has a power game. The Driblab stats suggest he does not intercept the ball as much as you’d like, which suggests his positioning can be marginally out. But that, too, may merely be down to a lack of experience. The potential for future growth is frightening.Would he suit the Premier League? A player who spent two and a half-years at Basel feels as if he has sprung to prominence from nowhere. He’d played barely 40 league games for the Swiss club before Borussia Dortmund forked out £20m on potential in January. Already, you can see Akanji developing into a player who would settle in seamlessly at an elite Premier League club – a Manchester City, Tottenham Hotspur or Arsenal – but he would cost at least £50m.Everything about Mina’s game smacks of elite level. At 6ft 5in he is bigger than Akanji, and a real threat from attacking set plays as Poland and Senegal will testify, while his passing statistics are everything you would expect of a player recruited by and schooled over the last six months at Barcelona. His comfort in possession makes the 23-year-old perfect for a team who play it short from the back. He tackles, is athletic and quick, making it is easy to see why Barça set his release fee at an eye-watering €100m after signing him to 2023.His defensive heading stats are not quite so impressive, but that may be the sign of a player developed in South America at Palmeiras and now in Spain. His longer passing, in truth, is quite average, but Barça do not demand that of their defenders. Indeed, Mina has everything to succeed at the highest level: size, speed, technique, game intelligence.Would he suit the Premier League? He would fit at any of the top six clubs, who will surely monitor his progress in Spain given he finds himself behind Gerard Piqué and Samuel Umtiti at the Camp Nou. He has made only five La Liga appearances. Does he remain at Barça as third-choice behind established names or does he seek an opportunity elsewhere?The Russia playmaker looks destined to move to England sooner rather than later. Golovin has energy and mobility, playing either as an attack-minded No 8 or all-out No 10. He carries possession impressively and creates chances at will for teammates. Even defensively, he puts in a shift: not necessarily by flying into tackles but certainly winning duels by closing down space. That work-rate is an asset for a player who, at 5ft 10in, is relatively slight.There needs to be a better goal return. He scored that fine free-kick against Saudi Arabia but he managed only five goals at CSKA last season and three the season before, a disappointing tally. The stats suggest he scuttles into good areas but is not firing away enough shots. But there is plenty to work with. He is mobile, energetic and a creator: a player of huge potential.Would he suit the Premier League? Undoubtedly. If you’re Arsenal, he’d be an excellent replacement for Aaron Ramsey if contract negotiations do not go well. At Manchester United he would add more creativity than Herrera. At Chelsea, he would give more offensive energy with Cesc Fàbregas now 31. A fee of £25m would be a very good price in today’s market."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55eb9039aa868a0fcb7c867e77a2ce41449a2261/0_277_4904_2942/master/4904.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=838beaadeaf4c5d91df19460f50781a7","title":"uruguay portugal world cup last 16 match report","story":"Cristiano Ronaldo walked Edinson Cavani out of this game, helping the Uruguayan to the touchline, but not before Cavani scored the goals that put Portugal out of the World Cup.Cavani departed with 20 minutes remaining, slowly making his way around the edge of the pitch, limping slightly, a lost look on his face after he felt a pain in his calf that prevented him from continuing. Two superb strikes took Uruguay through to the quarter-finals but, while the striker said he hoped that it was nothing, he departed the stadium hobbling and there are doubts now that he will be with them when they face France in Nizhny Novgorod on Friday.Twenty minutes after Cavani departed it was Ronaldo who looked lost: his World Cup is over and he would not be drawn after the match on whether he will continue with Portugal, though the manager Fernando Santos expressed the hope that he will. “There is a tournament in September, the Uefa League of Nations, and we hope that he is with us so that he can help the young players who will need their captain’s example,” Santos said.As the final seconds ticked away Portugal threw everything they could at this, the goalkeeper Rui Patrício sent forward and almost heading goalwards, the Portuguese bench leaping with every tackle and tumble, calling for the VAR to rescue them. But in the end it could not. Cavani had gone but he brought delight to a resilient and often impressive Uruguay, built on solidarity and skill, whose manager Óscar Tabárez talked afterwards about their “absolute commitment”. France will not welcome playing them even if Cavani is absent – without him Luis Suárez occupied an entire defence alone.It was that kind of night and it ended with supporters in blue and white singing. It had begun with a goal that was genuinely breathtaking: brutal in its beauty, beautiful in its brutality – a 100‑yard one-two taking them from halfway line to byline, the ball twice smashed high, hard and with incredible precision diagonally from one side of the pitch to the other and back before it flew into the net.Rodrigo Betancur turned neatly, setting the ball rolling, the play spread to the right for Cavani. His strike partner Suárez was almost the entire width of the pitch away, but while they were distanced they came together once again – the story of their footballing lives. Born a month apart in Salto, population 104,000, Suárez left for Montevideo at seven and they did not know each other until they met at 19 but they have played together almost ever since, 207 Uruguay caps between them. Here they did so to devastating and dramatic effect.Cavani drove a long diagonal across towards the left for Suárez that could be heard from the stands. Suárez controlled, ran at Ricardo, cut inside and sent it back again. From beyond the top corner of the box he bent a vicious, superb ball in a fast, long arc to the far post where Cavani was running in. It might have hit Cavani on the shoulder or the face but the result was perfect, the ball rocketing in.It was a superb start, despite the fact that the first two attempts on goal had been Portugal’s, Bernardo Silva heading over and Ronaldo shooting sharply in a game that had begun as might have been predicted, Cavani unlucky to be penalised as he turned Pepe and then Diego Godín pushing over the Portugal defender while they waited for a corner, though with the ball not in play that one was free. Others would be too, the referee seemingly reluctant to pull out cards.Next, José Fonte headed over and Ronaldo had a shot blocked, but Uruguay appeared reasonably comfortable. There were crosses in, but mostly they were just headed out again. And if Godín and Giménez did not get to them, Fernando Muslera did, advancing from his line. There was sharpness when they sprung too, Betancur offering clarity, Martín Cáceres overlapping, Suárez looking sharp. And just before half-time, Cavani brought down Godín’s wild hoof inside the area, but scuffed his shot past the near post.The game soon reopened. Bernardo Silva’s ball in was flicked back to Adrien Silva. His shot was blocked but from the corner, taken short and eventually delivered by Raphaël Guerreiro, Pepe leapt behind Ronaldo and Godín to head the equaliser.Having conceded their first goal in 2018, Uruguay were under pressure now, unable to get out until a long ball released them and put them ahead once more. Thumped forward by Muslera, it dropped near the Portugal area and Betancur rolled it to Cavani who curled a wonderful shot first time into the corner. He departed not long after, leaving Uruguay with a lead and 20 minutes to protect it.It was not going to be easy. Bernardo Silva offered a little more subtlety to what had previously been a more frontal attack, although he did hit the best opportunity over when the ball escaped the scrambling Muslera. His run on one side drew a corner and then, on the other side, Matías Vecino stood firm as Ronaldo dribbled into the area. There was tiredness and nerves. When Carlos Sánchez gave up possession, Ricardo Quaresma’s curling cross with the outside of his foot just evaded Ronaldo’s leap.As the momentum built, Suárez became an island battling with Pepe but often beating him. And Portuguese chances were few: two long and inoffensive Manuel Fernandes shots and a sliced effort from Ronaldo way wide before Diego Laxalt ed to clear. Then, a long ball found Suárez again, alone against the world, who got away from three defenders and crossed to Cristian Rodríguez. His control escaped him, leaving more minutes of nerves, but Cavani’s two glorious goals would prove to be enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac8b8f668829577cb7f4f3110990a17b992fe0ad/0_0_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c72ebfbefdda0ae30afef6bb6b02e30","title":"joe cole actor interview i was ready to deliver a kicking","story":"From Skins to Peaky Blinders, actor Joe Cole has made his name playing rogues. But nothing prepared him for the full-on physicality of his latest filmYou might know Joe Cole as a Brummie, from Peaky Blinders, where he played John Shelby, the much-loved gangster kid brother to Cillian Murphy’s Tommy. Or maybe as a Manc, from the Hang the DJ episode of Black Mirror, in which true love was shown to triumph in an age of algorithm-sanctioned pairings. Or, if you catch him in his latest film, A Prayer Before Dawn, where he’s a Liverpudlian boxer turned Thai prisoner turned Muay Thai fighter, using mostly non- verbal gestures to ask to fight or to plead for drugs.“I’ve not done my own accent in years,” says Cole, 29, his own voice deep, slightly gruff, with a south London twang. Last night, he was watching the World Cup with mates in a bar near where he lives now, in Brixton, but today we’re in a Hitchcock-themed hotel on the outskirts of the capital, drinking in the bucolic surroundings of Epping Forest. He’s on a rare break from filming, having been working almost solidly since he chucked in his old job of selling carpets. Apart from the football, he’s been going to auditions, but there can’t be many accents left for him to tick off. Scottish? “I just went in for Scottish the other day,” he smiles.Cole has become one of those actors whose presence is usually an indication of quality, particularly on TV, though A Prayer Before Dawn, which called for a complete transformation and total immersion in a tough, violent world, could do for his big screen career what Bronson did for Tom Hardy. He was raised in Kingston-upon-Thames, the oldest brother of five (three of the five are now actors).“I was a bit of a wind-up, a joker,” he remembers, but puts it down to growing up in a busy house. “And my mum used to look after kids after school, so there were always at least 10 people in the house. Always.” Recently, he moved into a one-bedroom flat on his own, for the first time in his life, but the isolation didn’t stick. “I quickly realised it wasn’t for me. I love my own company, but not permanently. I’m used to a house of people coming and going. I don’t think I ever remember being on my own in the house.” Now, he lives in a houseshare with friends, and one of his brothers.He started acting at school, where one particular teacher – “an inspiring, amazing teacher, Miss O’Shea” – made drama seem like fun. “Our school didn’t have as much money as the surrounding schools, but her and the music teacher would go out of their way to make these productions better than they should have been,” he recalls. Up until his GCSEs, he was a high achiever, top set, and found it all easy, but when A-levels came around, he started to falter. “When I actually had to put in some work, I realised I was middle of the pack, and for me that wasn’t enough, so I didn’t do any work, messed about, went out, and it wasn’t going to plan.” He calls his later teenage years “tricky”. “I had a bit of a bad break-up, I didn’t get into university, I felt very sorry for myself,” he laughs. “Perhaps I shouldn’t have, but I did. I got arrested. I was just getting up to nonsense, really.”He went back to school, in his brother’s year, and retook his exams, after realising that his current life as a carpet salesman wasn’t quite right. “I mean this with no disrespect at all, but it wasn’t for me.” Then he applied to the National Youth Theatre – and got in. Cole puts a lot of his success down to self-belief and optimism, to a certainty that, once he’d decided he was going to be an actor, he was passionate enough to do the work he needed to do to make it happen.“I remember watching Skins when I was at college, when I was fucking around and fucking my life up, and I was watching Skins, like, I could be there. I’ve got more fire in my belly, I’ve got more to say, and I reckon I could go and do that. And that was my mindset.” It didn’t take long for it to come to fruition. One of his first breakout roles was as Luke, a drug-dealing bad boy, in series six of Skins. “To see me come out of the other side of that and flourish was just a relief for my mum,” he explains.Given that he’s got an angelic sort of face, with long eyelashes and plump lips, it’s perhaps surprising he’s cast as a rogue as often as he is. But Cole has a long line in bad boys and hard men, from an early role in Offender, set against the backdrop of the 2011 London riots, to the short film Slap, in which he played a cross-dressing boxer.Then, of course, there was John Shelby, the baby Peaky Blinder, who met a gangster’s fate at the beginning of series five. The show has been a bona fide hit and, as well as winning awards all over the place, it’s set a fashion precedent, unlocking many men’s desire to look like a 1920s criminal. “The haircuts?” he smiles. “People absolutely love it, it’s amazing. With television, people respond in a different way, it’s crazy. I have some friends who’ve done big films and stuff, but the love for Peaky Blinders just completely takes over from that.”It was Cole who decided to step away from the show, despite its huge success. “We started shooting in 2012, so it’s five series, but it’s gone on for six years. I’ve had a great run and loved every minute, but I’m trying to push on, to do new things and challenge myself. For me it was definitely the right time.” He says that people were so gutted by John’s exit, they still come up to him in the street, “crying and stuff, which is mad. What more can you ask for as an actor, if people respond to your work like that?”He was pleased to get the part of Frank in Black Mirror almost as soon as he’d decided to leave Peaky (as he calls it) because it showed what he already knew – that he had the range to play a romantic lead as well as a tough guy. But he’s returning to the hard stuff for A Prayer Before Dawn. It’s an adaptation of a memoir by Billy Moore. He was locked up in a brutal Thai prison for three years and found a kind of salvation in prison-sanctioned Muay Thai fighting.Shot over three months, somewhere north of Bangkok, it’s distressing, clammy and harrowing, and almost entirely mute many scenes were improvised, and the language barrier, deliberately maintained between Cole and the Thai cast, prevented a lot of talking. Instead, much of the communication is done through fists and feet.“I was ready to put myself on the line, and spar for real and fight, and get the shit kicked out of me, and deliver a few kickings as well,” Cole says. “I was ready to go there, and I’m not sure everybody would go there, even if they say they would. I’d like a few of the lads to prove me wrong, but we’ll see.” He’s sporty anyway, so enjoyed the Muay Thai training and getting ripped for the part. “It was simple, but regimented. Train every day, eat the same food, a couple of press-ups.” Just two? “I did two press-ups. Amazing, right? One at the beginning of the shoot and one right at the end,” he says. “I should get in touch with Men’s Health.”Cole says he’s not one for “method” acting – he does disdainful inverted commas with his fingers when he says the word – but admits he found it difficult to shake this one.“It was long, heavy hard days with a lot of fighting every single day. I remember getting on the plane and feeling very emotional. Sounds a bit naff, but I did. It’s the first job I did where I’ve felt emotional afterwards. I thought, even if this turns out to be a pile of shite, it’s been one hell of a ride. We all felt we were making something special.”He applies the same kind of logic to his career so far. “Listen, the rug could be pulled out at any time,” he says, an apt metaphor for a former carpet salesman, “so let’s not get ahead of ourselves. But even if I had to quit tomorrow, I’m pretty happy. I am content. And I think mainly I’m content because of this film.” Still, that’s not to say he’s ready to coast. He’s been working on his own scripts, and has a couple of writing projects on the go that he’s quietly confident about. And he’s about to star in Channel 4’s new drama Pure, in which he’ll play a recovering porn addict – and he’s doing close to his own accent in this one…On Twitter, Cole’s handle is “theotherjoecole”, but you get the sense any mix-ups between him and his footballing namesake will be happening less and less. Though he says the postman still seems disappointed. “‘Oh my God, I thought you were gonna be famous. I thought you were gonna be the footballer,’” he mimics, grinning. “Nah, not me mate. Just a regular Joe.”A Prayer Before Dawn is in cinemas from 20 July"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0a35ecbeeab278907501ad02ff92a61aa5f8410/712_1278_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=100937e75bb2a4cb7c1424414bf7623f","title":"beauty tips the new glittery eyes","story":"Models at Anna Sui had an ulpifting twist on the festival lookGlitter is usually sidelined as a festival look, or an accessory you dab on to make an office Christmas party more jazzy.

That’s why I turn to life in the community: the only way you can change anything is in small increments around you where you shop, what you buy and how much you’re willing to bring positivity into difficult situations.Cerys Matthews’s The Good Life Experience is on 14-16 September at Hawarden Estate, Flintshire (thegoodlifeexperience)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fde6452f7751e49e68c2630c7847219b7d6c9f3d/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14f66a3385e3a13bcd6eddeeed4aee3f","title":"for the love of playmobil our home toy stories","story":"Colour and kitsch collide in this Brazilian couple’s flat, transforming it into a corner of Rio in LondonAsk graphic designer Eduardo Lima and costume designer Mauricio Carneiro to tell you why they moved to their two-bedroomed 1970s flat in north London and they’ll probably tell you about Eduardo’s goddaughter who lives nearby. Or how much they liked the green spaces of the communal gardens and nearby Parkland Walk. But that’s only half the story. Press a little harder and you’ll find out that the truth has more to do with a small plastic toy created by Hans Beck in 1974. “We have a collection of over 2,000 Playmobil figures, kept from our childhoods and added to ever since,” confesses Eduardo. “One of the best things about moving into this apartment was unpacking them all. We’ve never had the space to display them before – and they make me smile every time I walk past them. I sometimes imagine them having little parties while we’re out.”The pair met at a fashion show in Brazil 18 years ago and bumped into each other again at a bar a week later. When Eduardo told Mauricio that he was returning to London, Mauricio’s reply was simple, but momentous: “May I come with you?” They’ve been together ever since and a civil partnership in 2007 (later converted into a marriage) made it official. “He is my soulmate – my everything,” says Eduardo, who co-runs MinaLima, the graphic design agency behind all the props for the Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts films as well as the wider Wizarding World franchise. Luckily, a 20-minute conversation about colour – orange and green in particular – on that fateful first date and a shared love of Playmobil meant that they were on the same page when it came to decorating the flat they bought in 2004.They started by creating a white backdrop for their colourful collections. “The previous owner had painted everything mustard yellow – even the ceilings,” says Eduardo. “We almost wrote it off as too small and too yellow, so I’m glad we saw its potential – even if it did take three coats of paint.” Once they’d finished decorating, they set about unpacking the Playmobil figures, displaying them by type in a vintage, glass-fronted cabinet. “They are arranged in groups – policemen with policemen, pirates with pirates – to stop it from feeling too cluttered,” explains Eduardo. “There is an element of curation, but not too much.”As well as Playmobil, the pair also collects the letters E and M in vintage 3D characters – an assemblage which started with the light-up green E perched on the arm of the sofa that Mauricio bought for Eduardo. “Now he gets really upset that there just seem to be more Es in the world than Ms,” laughs Eduardo.Other collections include the religious iconography typical of Brazil displayed against a bright green (Eduardo’s favourite colour) wall in the hall, the Disney merchandise in the master bedroom, the tin toys that line the dining room mirror, and books – lots of books. “There’s an amazing Oxfam bookshop local to us,” says Eduardo, “and we seem to come home with another five or 10 every weekend.” The couple invested in the 606 Universal Shelving System by Vitsoe for their library when they moved into this flat. “Vitsoe is life-changing. It hasn’t moved a millimetre since we had it installed.”Collections taken care of, they turned to furniture, settling on the Bo Concept sofa that fits so perfectly into their lounge area, alongside a collection of house plants. “Brazilians do love their plants,” explains Eduardo. The flat is arranged around an open living-dining area, with a small kitchen, two bedrooms and a bathroom off the L-shaped corridor that connects it to the front door. The 1960s teak dining table and Formica chairs are exact replicas of the ones both Eduardo and Mauricio grew up with.“My mum hated them so much, she eventually threw hers away,’ laughs Eduardo. “They’re really expensive now. We managed to find ours about six years ago.” The wallpaper behind the table is Orla Kiely for Habitat and the Eames RAR rocking chair was a wedding gift. The mid-century aesthetic, the Brazilian-inspired cacophony of colour and pattern, and the nostalgic collections are all part of creating a home from home.“I’ve been in London for over 20 years, so I feel very comfortable here,” says Eduardo. “I miss the people and the food more than the country itself, but I think that’s because we’ve created a little corner of Brazil in our apartment. It’s the same if you visit any of our Brazilian friends. It’s like walking into an apartment in Rio.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1719d8f4f95b9cb9395a0f299cbd9e802998974f/0_2062_4927_2955/master/4927.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8e6bdac955c6f9d528deb7b0c0e773e","title":"nigel slater summer fruit drinks and salty nibbles recipes","story":"From gooseberry and elderflower to watermelon fizz, anchovy rolls to olives with chilli, we’ve got summer coveredWe need a drink. Not a glass of wine or a cold beer, but something long, sweet-sour and fizzing with the flavours of the season. So we make one or, more accurately, a jug full. A drink that is truly seasonal, of gooseberries and elderflower, and then another of watermelon and the sort of sparkling wines that seem made for when the sun is shining. And then we take them outdoors.Every drink, be it a small, cold golden beer or an espresso, needs something to go with it. A bite or two. That something could be a tiny, too-hot-to-hold pastry filled with a paste of anchovies and pine kernels or it could be an olive or two that you have marinated with roast peppers, rust-red chillies and coriander. A spicy morsel to alternate with a swig of icy watermelon fizz.The one truly essential rule for making summer drinks is that they be iced. Hand me a lukewarm cocktail on a summer’s day and I’ll probably throw it at you. Ice cubes, yes, but you could swap them for frozen berries or chunks of fruit. I made a gooseberry drink this week and cooled it with frozen berries. Rather than dissolving into your drink like ice cubes, they partially thaw as they do their work and leave you with diminutive, sozzled nuggets to scoop up at the end.A bright red drink to cool a blazing hot summer’s day. It also makes a splendid water ice. Just pop it in the freezer.Cut the watermelon into 3cm thick slices, remove the skin and seeds, then place in a freezer bag, seal and freeze for 2 hours.Put the frozen watermelon into a blender, add the elderflower cordial and process to a bright pink slush.Tip into 12 small glasses, then top up with prosecco, and if you wish, some edible flower petals.There are few drinks that don’t appreciate an olive or two. Enough for 12roasted peppers 150g, bottled or cannedred chilli 1, largesmoked paprika 1 tspcoriander leaves a small handfulgreen olives, pitted 160g (drained weight)cipollini onions 100gPurée the peppers and chilli in a blender or processor, add the smoked paprika and coriander leaves and process to a soft red and green paste. Scrape it into a bowl, add the olives and onions and fold gently together. Serve with the watermelon fizz.We made a paste of anchovies, olives, thyme and pine kernels, the scent of which reminded me of a Provençal farm I visited years ago. A farm where the owners made not only their own olive oil but also deep vats of tapenade from the crushed olives. They threw in dried thyme and ground bay. The fragrant paste below is also worth making to spread on thin, curling sheets of crispbread or to wedge into the furrows of a rib of celery.Pat the anchovies with kitchen paper to remove the excess oil. If you are using salted anchovies, rinse them briefly then dry them with paper. Put the anchovies in the bowl of a food processor together with the pitted olives, pine kernels, dried thyme, peeled garlic and parsley. Grate the zest from the lemon and add, then process to a thick paste.Roll the puff pastry out on a lightly floured board to a rectangle measuring roughly 30x40cm. Have the long side facing you, then cut the pastry into three 40cm-long strips. Break the egg into a small bowl and beat with a fork until thoroughly mixed. Brush the pastry strips with beaten egg.Place 12 tsp of the filling along one side of each of the pastry strips then lightly smooth into a long thin sausage shape. Fold the pastry over the filling then press the pastry edges firmly together to seal. Cut the sausage into 10 small pieces, place them on the baking sheet, a centimetre or two apart, then brush with more of the beaten egg and sprinkle lightly with nigella seeds. Repeat with the remaining two strips of pastry and the reserved filling. Set the pastries in the fridge for a good half hour.Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6 and bake them for 12-15 minutes until golden.There are drinks I want to sip in the sunshine, and others such as this that are made for enjoying in the shade of a large tree. There is no alcohol here, but gin would put a spring in its step. We used frozen gooseberries in lieu of ice cubes.Put the 18 reserved berries in the freezer. Remove the stalks and dried flowers from the gooseberries. Put the berries in a stainless-steel saucepan, add the sugar, elderflower cordial and water and bring to the boil. As soon as the berries start to burst and the sugar has dissolved remove the pan from the heat and leave to cool.Ladle the berries and their liquid into the jug of a blender, add the mint leaves and process to a pale green, sweet-tart syrup. Chill thoroughly.To serve, ide the gooseberry and elderflower syrup between 6 tall glasses, top up with sparkling water, the frozen gooseberries and a few mint leaves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/882eb99522fa975bf040a01aacff7cb9179d639a/0_509_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f6bc684e8baeca9f0e87a02ab5571f4","title":"jane horrocks am i happy i dont think so no sorry","story":"The actor, 54, on youthful pratfalls, Lancashire people and the power of musicI’m a happier person when I’m making people laugh.

Last February, Drake, already a superstar, became ubiquitous when he released God’s Plan, the opening shot of this sprawling album. The audio broke Spotify and Apple Music records its oft-played video witnessed the Torontonian giving away its $996,631.90 budget. A few songs into the first half of this double album, the emotive Sandra’s Rose, sums up the entertainer’s status succinctly: “Every title doing numbers like I’m Miss Adele.”More pertinent, though, is the question of paternity. The Canadian rhymer has recently been embroiled in a war of words with veteran rapper Pusha T. His diss track, The Story of Adidon, made hay of the persistent gossip that Drake had fathered a secret child with a porn actress, and that there was a plan to reveal Drake’s son as part of a future Adidas branding exercise.When it comes, Drake’s big reveal is almost conversational, a genuine shock. On Emotionless, a track which wrings maximum weepiness from a sample of Mariah Carey’s Emotions, Drake paints a bleak picture of a superficial Instagrammed world. “Look at the way we liveI wasn’t hiding my kid from the world,” he states, “I was hiding the world from my kid.”The rest of this 25-track album is dusted with references to Drake’s less-than-ideal situation, child support (I’m Upset), and single fatherhood. On 8 Out Of 10, Drake huffs: “I’ve settled into my role as the good guy.” The angry flow is at odds with a beat full of vintage sparkly sentiment on this album stand-out.On the very final track, March 14, Drake elaborates. “She’s not my lover like Billie Jean, but the kid is mine.” Drake’s main lament is far more touching, however. The rapper, who as a child ided his time between his mother in Toronto and his father in Tennessee, reflects on how he always dreamed of not repeating history, of starting a family in a loving relationship.Is There More? asks the last song on the A-side of this double album – long, even given the sheer volume of stuff the 31-year-old clearly needs to get off his chest. The track itself finds Drake pondering whether there is anything for a superstar like him beyond money and status. It ends on an affecting interpolation of Aaliyah’s More Than A Woman, sung by guest Nai Palm of the Australian band Hiatus Kaiyote, one of the obscure international artists Drake showcased on his much-admired mixtape, More Life (2016). Lasting love is always the elusive endgame for this rapper, who made his name singing in granular detail about relationships, not guns or drugs.The rest of Scorpion doesn’t lack for talking points. The menacing sub-bass on Nonstop deserves an Instagram account. Much of the aggression feels as if its directed towards Pusha T and Drake’s arch-nemesis, Kanye West the opening track, synth-strafed Survival, hints that Drake is holding back damaging information for the good of all.It is, perhaps, a marker of Drake’s newsworthiness that the existence of an unreleased Michael Jackson vocal collaboration is not the biggest draw here. Don’t Matter To Me (feat. Michael Jackson) finds Drake trading croons about an unresolved relationship with Jackson’s treated-sounding vocal.Another significant guest is Jay-Z, who crops up on the dramatic Talk Up. Like a number of Scorpion tracks, which react to very recent events, it must have been recorded days ago. “Y’all kill X and let Zimmerman liveStreets is done,” spits Jay-Z disgustedly, highlighting the recent killing of Florida rapper XXXTentacion, then boggling at the fact that Trayvon Martin’s killer, George Zimmerman, is still free.Drake has hinted that he might release an all-R\u0026ampB album. Also relegated to the small print here is that the second half of Scorpion is mostly sung, not rapped: a first.It remains a tantalising mystery to whom these more introspective, smouldering tracks are addressed. In My Feelings names “Kiki” and “KB” other candidates include past flame Rihanna and Nicki Minaj.The song ends with a skit from an episode of Atlanta, the Donald Glover TV show, which referenced Drake. Although this album lacks a world-conquering pop hit like One Dance or Hotline Bling, and your interest wanes on side two, Scorpion is the album of the summer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a4a1107cb7709401b2351849e27feda551b4124/0_111_3678_2207/master/3678.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e818a593fe66121ab9fed77723f077b1","title":"morrissey critic hails postponed uk gigs","story":"Dave Haslam, the veteran DJ and author who has led criticism of the singer Morrissey for his support of the jailed founder of a British far-right group, said on Saturday that he believed the former frontman of The Smiths had “just crossed the line”.Speaking after the last-minute decision to postpone a string of Morrissey’s British and European concerts due to begin this week, Haslam rejected fans’ accusations that his public campaigning against the singer’s views was unfair.“I’ve become more and more concerned about his defending Tommy Robinson and his support for far-right organisations,” Haslam told BBC radio, referring to the founder of the English Defence League, who is serving a 10-month prison sentence for contempt of court. He added that he found it impossible to ignore recent derogatory comments made by Morrissey about the diction of Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, and other “comments that he has made about black and white people, that they will never get on”.Disappointed fans with tickets to see the 59-year-old perform have been told by promoters that the process of refunding their money will begin on Monday. One concert, originally scheduled to take place at the Castlefield Bowl in Morrissey’s home town of Manchester a week on Sunday, was to have run alongside a protest event set up by Haslam at the city’s Deansgate Locks. “It might not be coincidence that the venue is just a few hundred yards from where Morrissey is playing,” Haslam had admitted. Titled One Nation Under a Groove, Haslam’s free event will go ahead, with donations, collected at the gate, going to the charity Love Music Hate Racism. On hearing news of the postponed Morrissey gigs, Haslam has offered his fans half-price cocktails.Ticketing website Gigs and Tours blamed the postponement on “logistical circumstances beyond our control”, while on Twitter Haslam, who was born in Birmingham but made his name DJ-ing at Manchester’s fabled Hacienda nightclub during its 1980s heyday, was clearly delighted, describing the decision as “the best turn of events ever”.Morrissey’s latest album Low In High School was released in November and he completed a British tour in February and March, but his controversial public comments in favour of Brexit and admiring of both Nigel Farage and George Galloway have met with growing condemnation among even his devoted fans.The singer’s world tour will continue in Mexico City in November."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55b8177bcdef13f69ee19b23a1380884d463f01a/0_255_4134_2481/master/4134.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ca4ee7d33eb24e3696a0915044e7e20","title":"amy winehouse photographer friend blake wood intimate photos taschen interview","story":"For Amy Winehouse, 2008 was a year of extreme highs and confounding lows – business as usual, in other words, but even more so. The zenith came in February, when the 24-year-old singer dominated the Grammys with five wins, a record for a British woman. She couldn’t be in the US, because of visa complications, but when Tony Bennett, one of her heroes, announced Rehab as record of the year – beating Beyoncé, the Foo Fighters, Rihanna and Jay-Z, and Justin Timberlake – she was shown, by satellite linkup to London, staring straight ahead, mouth agape, briefly speechless.But there were many profoundly distressing episodes, too. Throughout the year, Winehouse battled her addictions to alcohol, crack and heroin, while a gleeful tabloid press documented every tumble from the wagon. Her live shows could descend into chaos and she was roundly booed at both V Festival and Bestival that summer.Blake Wood, then a 22-year-old proto-photographer from Vermont newly arrived in London, met Winehouse in early January 2008. They were introduced by their mutual friend Kelly Osbourne and quickly became inseparable – in red-top parlance, he was “Good Blake”, in contrast to Winehouse’s husband, Blake Fielder-Civil, who had not long been jailed for attempting to pervert the course of justice, though her relationship with Wood was always platonic (he eventually took legal steps to correct false reporting).Their friendship deepened and, on Winehouse’s invitation, Wood began taking informal photographs. After her death in 2011, he could scarcely bring himself to look at them, but now he feels the time is right for a different, more nuanced narrative of that surreal period. “A big reason I wanted to put this out there was to change the conversation about her,” Wood says of his new book, Amy Winehouse, a collection of 150 mostly unseen images, taken in locations from Camden to Paris to St Lucia, in 2008-09. “There’s a false idea that it was all bad during those years and it really wasn’t – I was there.”Wood, on the phone from New York, where he now lives, goes on: “This book, really it’s a love letter to a friend. And it’s a visual diary of us at the time when she was most celebrated by the world, but she was also really misunderstood. She was very much loved by the people around her, and I hope this comes through the work.”Certainly the photographs present a contrasting image of Winehouse from the one that filled the newspapers at the time, or from that of the doomed, self-destructive naïve from Asif Kapadia’s Oscar-winning documentary Amy. Wood says that he wanted to capture “the person, not the persona”. In many of the images she has her natural curly hair rather than the extreme beehive we are used to. The book is dominated by an extended holiday that Winehouse took to St Lucia at the end of 2008, which Wood joined her on for almost four months. Winehouse looks natural and healthy as she rides horses on the beach or exercises on a trapeze, and she appears totally at ease with Wood snapping away on Polaroid and old point-and-shoot cameras that he’d brought on the trip.By the time of the St Lucia holiday, Wood insists, Winehouse was done with hard drugs, but she was still drinking. Either way, Wood – who grew up around addiction but has always been straight-edge himself – didn’t want to document that aspect of her life. “It was this unwelcome friend she’d go deal with and then come back and we’d hang out,” he says. “I just had no interest in taking bad photos of her. Why take a photo of someone who’s struggling? As a society we’ve captured that, we’ve seen that, at least from my perspective. But maybe not. Maybe other people need to connect to that visually and they need to see it more. But for me, I’m good.”Before St Lucia, much of the time that Winehouse and Wood spent together was housebound, hiding from the paparazzi. They would watch TV, talk about their lives, sketch out their creative dreams once they made pillowcases from vintage T-shirts. “We were both outsiders and we connected on that,” says Wood. “When you grow up feeling like that, you don’t feel like you belong, that definitely brought us close.” Winehouse pushed Wood to do photography and it was her encouragement that led him to leave St Lucia and return to the States to pursue it professionally. “She really believed in my work,” he says. “She saw my abilities before I saw any of it. I didn’t really know if I was shit or not. But she pushed me to make work and it was really nice to have a friend like that.”When asked to pick a special memory from their time together, Wood selects the night of the Grammys, and the gathering of friends and family at the Riverside Studios, west London. There’s even been a suggestion that when Winehouse finally found her voice and made a speech – “To my mum and dad. To my Blake, my Blake incarcerated” – she was talking about Wood first and Fielder-Civil second.“I didn’t talk to her about it after, but you can jump to that conclusion if you like,” he says. “But when she won, it was the first time in my life I really cried from joy. Seeing somebody being able to experience recognition sober, they really deserve it, and to be able to really feel it. Just to see her whole family and how proud of her they were, to bear witness to that moment was really big. As much as it was televised and public, it was very intimate that night. It was almost like her own private ceremony.”Amy Winehouse by Blake Wood is published by Taschen on 27 July (£30). To order it for £25 go to  bookshop or call 0330 333 6846.

Everyone thinks they can say just what they want. It is not good for anyone or good for the country.” Crucial decisions on Brexit had to be made within days, and time was running out, he said. But within the cabinet, disagreements were widening as the moment of truth approached. Ministers were briefing against one another in public, giving an impression that the ship of state was heading for the rocks just when the national interest required those steering it to pull together.“She has to lead,” the minister added. “The can has been kicked into the corner on Brexit. It can’t be kicked any farther.” He then headed off, turning back for a second, to sum it all up as “midsummer madness”.Normally ministers and senior MPs will show some caution when having private conversations with journalists at Westminster. They will at least make efforts not to be overheard. But these days they brief without fear on every corner, in every cloister. Soon after the minister departed, a former cabinet minister who has worked for the Conservative party for several decades strolled by and was happy to talk. The atmosphere was dreadful, he said, and Theresa May’s position was becoming more perilous by the day.Westminster is always a hothouse in high summer, in which disagreements and splits within parties seem more important to those inside the bubble than they do for the world outside. Now, arguably, the reverse is the case. Last week’s burst of Tory bloodletting came less than a week after the EU withdrawal bill had passed the last of its big parliamentary hurdles en route to the statute book. But rather than bank that success and move on, as one, to the next, even bigger challenge – agreeing a united negotiating position on what Brexit will actually mean, at an awayday at Chequers this Friday – the cabinet did the reverse. It went into meltdown.It began last weekend with some of the most senior ministers in May’s team falling out over whether the UK’s biggest businesses had the right to speak up about the risk to jobs from a hard Brexit. What Brexiters fear most is that employment and contracts will go abroad and that this will turn public opinion against a clean break with the EU. The cabinet infighting was triggered by a chilling warning from Airbus that it could leave the UK in the event of a hard Brexit, putting around 14,000 jobs at risk. BMW then gave similar gloomy assessments. The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, is supposed to have reacted at a private reception by saying, “Fuck business.”Deep isions in the cabinet over Brexit have been exposed in a secret recording of a speech Boris Johnson gave to the Conservative Way Forward group. Here are his most contentious comments on ...“Imagine Trump doing Brexit. He’d go in bloody hard … There’d be all sorts of breakdowns, all sorts of chaos. Everyone would think he’d gone mad. But actually you might get somewhere. It’s a very, very good thought.”“You’ve got to face the fact there may now be a meltdown. OK? I don’t want anybody to panic during the meltdown. No panic. Pro bono publico, no bloody panic. It’s going to be all right in the end.”“The inner struggle is very, very difficult. The Treasury, which is basically the heart of remain, has seized the risk — what they don’t want is friction at the borders. They don’t want any disruption. So they’re sacrificing all the medium and long-term gains amid fear of short-term disruption. Do you see what I’m saying?“And that fear of short-term disruption has become so huge in people’s minds that they’re turning them all wet. Project Fear is really working on them. They’re terrified of this nonsense. It’s all mumbo jumbo.”“What they are trying to do is do a Brexit that does as little change as possible and that keeps us basically in the same orbital pull … and that would be the worst of both worlds.”So great is his, and the Brexiters’, desire to leave everything to do with the EU that he even seemed prepared to put at risk the Tory party’s close relationship with their friends and donors in business in the name of Brexit purity. It all went downhill from there.Cabinet unity and collective responsibility crumbled. The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, went on television to say that it was “entirely inappropriate” for big businesses like Airbus to say such things, only to be contradicted by the business secretary, Greg Clark, who slapped his colleague down, saying “any company and any industry that supports the livelihood of so many working people in this country is entitled to be listened to with respect”. Tory donors in business despaired. Alexander Temerko, who has given hundreds of thousands of pounds to the party, said that May was not suited to be leader. “There is no economic and business agenda,” he argued. “Business will support clarity. All of us, with small exceptions, say we need to be in the customs union and be part of EU regulation. Theresa is a good lady with strong morality, but she doesn’t have political intuition.”Throughout last week the arguments spiralled like a playground brawl, with everyone piling in, working off their own frustrations, showing they could throw good punches too. Perhaps fearing their time in high office might be limited, ministers appeared to be deliberately raising their profiles while they had the chance. The defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, was seemingly sore that the NHS had received promises of an extra £20bn a year while his department had got nothing. If it did not get the same, some of his people briefed, he could bring May down.Asked why cabinet anarchy had descended when unity was demanded more than at any time in recent history, a former minister said she could only think it was fear of failure and the human instinct to blame others for impending catastrophe. “A sense of doom seems to have stirred selfish instincts of self-preservation. They all fear we are heading for no deal and disaster. Now it’s every man, every woman for himself and herself. It is about salvaging reputations.”Levels of farce were reached on Tuesday night when Liz Truss, chief secretary to the Treasury, targeted Michael Gove and other ministers for meddling too much in people’s lives. “Too often we’re hearing about not drinking too much, eating too many doughnuts, drinking from disposable cups through plastic straws, or enjoying the warm glow of our wood-burning Goves … I mean stoves,” she said in a speech at the London School of Economics. “I can see their point: there’s enough hot air and smoke at the environment department already.”Was she joking? Perhaps, but cabinet ministers would not risk such attempts at humour in normal times. Her comments about doughnuts came just three days after Hunt had announced a long-awaited anti-obesity strategy. Brexit disunity was spreading like a virus across the government’s entire domestic agenda. “Brexit is destroying the party,” said another former minister. “What are we now? Are we pro-business? Are we internationalist? Are we pro- or anti-regulation?”This Friday the disunited cabinet heads for Chequers, charged with agreeing the content of a white paper that is supposed to contain the vital elements of UK policy on Brexit that can then be negotiated on with Brussels over the next few months. The prime minister is said to want an agreement that would involve staying closely linked to the customs union and single market in goods, though Downing Street insists, to placate Brexiters, that will definitely not mean accepting free movement of workers.A customs union is an agreement by a group of countries, such as the EU, to all apply the same tariffs on imported goods from the rest of the world and, typically, eliminate them entirely for trade within the group. By doing this, they can help avoid the need for costly and time-consuming customs checks during trade between members of the union. Asian shipping containers arriving at Felixstowe or Rotterdam, for example, need only pass through customs once before their contents head to markets all over\u0026nbspEurope. Lorries passing between Dover and Calais avoid delay entirely.Customs are not the only checks that count – imports are also scrutinised for conformity with trading standards regulations and security and immigration purposes – but they do play an important role in determining how much friction there is at the border. A strict customs regime at Dover or between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would lead to delays that will be costly for business and disruptive for travellers. Just-in-time supply chains in industries such as car making could suffer. An Irish peace process built around the principle of entirely unfettered travel between north and south could be jeopardised.It looks like another unrealistic attempt to square the circle. EU leaders have already made clear they will never accept what they regard as more demands to pick their cherries on departure. And another problem for May is that Johnson and Davis say a customs deal that in any way keeps the UK linked to EU customs rules and institutions will be unacceptable to them. It would be Brexit in Name Only (Bino). The likes of Clark and Hammond, on the other hand, want maximum closeness to the customs union and single market. Cabinet ministers are split many ways. One arch-Eurosceptic in the cabinet told the Observer that in the end they may have to accept temporary membership of the customs union beyond Brexit and the two-year transition, and decouple later. This, the cabinet minister argued, was because Tory Remainers might well win the next round of parliamentary battles over the trade and customs bills and insert pro-customs union amendments into them. The prime minister has decided the meeting will not end until ministers have reached a deal. But no one is betting much on a puff of white smoke rising from the Chequers chimney on Friday night, signalling a truly meaningful deal. Too many “crunch meetings” have been and gone over recent months to allow that kind of optimism to take hold.There are now only about six weeks of negotiating time left on Brexit, when parliamentary and Brussels holidays and the party conference season are taken into account, before a deal has to be done in October. Any agreement then has to be voted on by the European parliament and by MPs at Westminster before Brexit day on 29 March next year. Without a deal, there will be no two-year transition period, no soft landing, and instead a hard descent into chaos of the kind that businesses say will drive them abroad. Brussels looks on in despair.After May attended a summit there on Thursday, the prime minister of Belgium, Charles Michel, said: “The feeling that dominates is the impression that the Brits continue to negotiate with the Brits and not with the EU. The red lines set by the UK are globally incompatible with the fundamental principles of the EU.”More than two years on from the referendum, with time fast running out, and the cabinet unable to agree a negotiating position on issues as fundamental as customs and trade, there seems to be only one thing that everyone in the UK and EU agrees on: the prospects for a good deal for all on Brexit look bleaker than ever."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/137643c7a2b6792b555cb17ff88e48d06ecdd2a2/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81e4821d18a5fa6bc3cb8faf93710cb9","title":"unite union brexit poll corbyn labour","story":"Ahead of super-union’s conference, majority of members oppose leaving single market and back a people’s voteJeremy Corbyn is today coming under fresh pressure to back a softer Brexit as a new poll shows an overwhelming majority of members of the Unite super-union – Labour’s biggest financial backer – believe the current Labour position in favour of leaving the single market will be bad for jobs.The survey by YouGov, released before Unite’s annual conference this week, also shows that most of the union’s members back giving the people a vote on any deal Theresa May brings back from Brussels – something Labour also opposes.The survey is released as sources within grassroots movement Momentum say senior figures at the top of the organisation are now keen to ensure a full debate on Brexit at the Labour conference in September, opening a possible way for anti- and soft-Brexit members and delegates to force a change to official policy.Corbyn maintains that he is determined to pursue a “jobs-first Brexit”. But the polling suggests many in the union movement now think his policy will have the opposite effect. Labour is proposing a new relationship with the single market that it says would give the UK access but fall short of full membership. The model has been dismissed by Brussels as unrealistic as it tries to keep all the advantages without having to comply with the EU’s four freedoms, including free movement of workers.Many of the motions submitted to the Unite conference depart from Labour’s policy and express support for the single market, and some for a people’s vote. One motion, submitted by West Midlands car workers to the conference, states: “Only now have voters started to see through the initial referendum campaigns and truly understand the implications and costs of leaving the EU. The final negotiations of UK Brexit terms cannot be left for parliament alone to agree upon because the facts presented to the voting public have changed so much since the referendum vote. The British electorate must ultimately have the final say.”Last week, another group, Labour for a People’s Vote, which is led by several former Momentum figures as well as trade union leaders and has the backing of more than 60 constituency Labour parties, announced that it would try to force a vote at this year’s party conference to change Corbyn’s Brexit policy.The group will call for Labour to oppose the government’s final Brexit deal. The party has said it would do this if the deal with the EU did not meet six tests set by shadow Brexit secretary Starmer. The group will then campaign for the party to go further and campaign for a public vote on the deal with an option to stay in the EU should voters reject the deal.Baroness Margaret Prosser, a former deputy general secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union, which merged into Unite in 2007, said: “It’s becoming increasingly clear that the Tory government is hell-bent on a bad Brexit deal for British workers that will damage jobs, public services and the future of young people. We are already seeing worrying signs about the impact on Airbus, carmakers and other key sectors of the economy. In these circumstances, workers look to our union to stand up for their interests.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91abbafa734ddfc272526f73e87f00a85b4f2be5/0_255_2427_1456/master/2427.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7a0c52f61d1bb02d69d7573552f9fb8","title":"home dna test kits race ethnicity dna ancestry","story":"Researchers raise concern over white people misunderstanding their minority roots: ‘It has no consequences for them’People who use home genetic testing kits to unlock the mysteries of their ancestry tend to “cherry pick” the results, relying on preconceived biases to embrace some of the findings while disregarding others, new research suggests. Home genetic testing has become a multibillion-dollar industry that has seen millions of people around the world sign up for swab kits in hopes of uncovering the secrets hidden in their genomes. Researchers at Vancouver’s University of British Columbia focused on how the results shape perceptions of race and ethnicity. They interviewed 100 Americans from various ethnic and racial backgrounds who had taken the tests, returning to them 18 months later to examine whether the tests had gradually shifted how they saw their identity.“I was surprised to find that, for most people, they didn’t adopt the ancestries suggested by the test,” said Wendy Roth, a sociologist and lead author of the study Those who did heed the results did so on a selective basis, she added. “They didn’t embrace them full-scale – they cherry picked.” Participants tended to embrace identities that they saw positively or that they thought others would accept. Test results that were disliked were simply rejected or ignored in some cases. “So it’s not like people were seeing this genetic information as being definitive. They were really allowing their social desires and influences to change how they reacted to it,” she said.One of the participants who identified as a white Mexican American before the test was found to have Native American, Celtic and Jewish ancestry. Researchers found he embraced his Jewish roots over the other ancestries highlighted in the test. Another participant was adopted and had always believed herself to be Native American. After the test suggested she had no Native American ancestry, she dismissed it as inaccurate and continued to identify as Native American anyway. A notable exception was among some of the white respondents, who were more likely to embrace new racial identities as long as they felt others would still accept them. “They were really excited to try on this identity that made them anything other than just white,” said Roth. Some of this might be explained by the type of person who takes this test, said Roth. “Many of these people were looking for a sense of belonging. They didn’t know where their family came from, many of them were adopted and they were just looking for a place to belong.” The findings suggest that genetic testing could end up reinforcing race privilege, said Roth, citing the example of someone who has always identified as white but now, based on the test results, takes on a new identity as white and black, or white and Native American.“It doesn’t have any consequences for them. They can try it on, mention it when it’s to their advantage and ignore it otherwise. So it doesn’t have the same consequences as race does for non-white people,” she said. “That can really lead whites in particular to think that race is like that for everyone.”Roth is now carrying out similar research on randomly selected samples to see if the findings – which hint at the myriad of social factors that plays into our concept of race – carries over. “It really emphasises to me that race is much more complex than just information that’s encoded within your genes,” she said. “Even if they are getting this information, they still interpret this information in terms of who they want to be, how they want to present themselves and what they think society will accept. And then they chose to either embrace it or ignore it based on that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5865253bcc3486eeb55a723f2d5848b8acdf352f/0_378_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b451d025fdbd3c7cd5b909f003d68fd","title":"tinnitus mindfulness new treatment study","story":"Cognitive therapy more effective in reducing stress, insomnia and hearing issues than traditional techniquesA mindfulness-based approach can dramatically reduce the impact of tinnitus, according to a groundbreaking study that will offer hope to the one in 10 people who are affected by the condition at some time in their lives.Defined as the sensation of hearing sounds in the absence of any external sound, tinnitus can lead to emotional stress, insomnia, concentration problems and hearing issues.While its cause is unknown, specialists insist it is not a disease or an illness. Rather, according to the British Tinnitus Association (BTA), it results from some type of change that can be either mental or physical and may be unrelated to hearing. There is no known cure but the study, published in the journals Ear and Hearing and Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, suggests the effects can be mitigated using psychological techniques.The research, led by Dr Laurence McKenna from University College London Hospitals NHS foundation trust and Dr Liz Marks from the department of psychology at the University of Bath, found that mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) can help sufferers far more effectively than the relaxation-based treatments currently recommended by many tinnitus clinics. This is welcome news for the one in 100 people who say they are left “very distressed” or “disabled” by tinnitus and the one in 20 people who report that they are moderately distressed by it.“We compared MBCT to relaxation therapy, a traditional treatment for people with chronic tinnitus, to determine if MBCT was a better option,” Marks said. “In total, 75 patients took part in the trial at UCLH’s Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear hospital receiving either MBCT or relaxation therapy. The study found that both treatments led to a reduction in tinnitus severity, psychological distress, anxiety and depression for patients.”But Marks said the study also highlighted a clear difference between the two treatments. “The MBCT treatment led to significantly greater reductions in tinnitus severity, and this improvement lasted for longer. In addition, 182 patients who completed MBCT routinely in our clinic showed a similar level of improvement.”Relaxation therapy provides patients with specific skills to reduce stress levels. In contrast, MBCT, taught by clinical psychologists, teaches patients to pay purposeful, present-moment attention to experiences, rather than trying to suppress them. According to its proponents, this is a more helpful way of responding to tinnitus. People learn how to “accept” tinnitus, rather than having to “fight it” or “push it away”. Mindfulness does not aim to change the tinnitus’s nature or sound, but the therapy can lead to it becoming less intrusive, to a point where it is no longer a problem for people.“MBCT turns traditional tinnitus treatment on its head,” Marks said. “So rather than trying to avoid or mask the noise, it teaches people to stop the battle with tinnitus.”David Stockdale, chief executive of the BTA, said: “The results of this research are extremely encouraging, particularly for people with chronic tinnitus who find that current treatments are not working for them. We really hope that more people will be able to benefit from this approach moving forward.”The researchers are now developing their work to see whether MBCT can be used to treat tinnitus-related insomnia.“The mindfulness approach is radically different from what most tinnitus sufferers have tried before, and it may not be right for everyone,” Marks said. “We are confident, however, that the growing research base has demonstrated how it can offer an exciting new treatment to people who may have found that traditional treatment has not been able to help them yet. We hope the results of our research will be one of the first steps to MBCT becoming more widely adopted.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dbc95248e223adace0c904f2c680a1ad8fa84f8/22_42_5447_3268/master/5447.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d300b5d1f87c22bde17714f7b888665","title":"chris froome alberto contador tour de france buildup similarities","story":"As Karl Marx said, history repeats itself, first as tragedy, second as farce. Which one the 2018 Tour de France turns out to be remains to be seen. Chris Froome, the defending champion, travels to the Vendée this week aiming for a place in the record books: a record-equalling fifth Tour win, a straight run of four Grand Tour victories out of four, and the first Giro d’Italia-Tour double in 20 years. It should be a statistician’s delight but it is also a legal bunfight, with Froome’s adverse analytical finding (AAF) for salbutamol still in abeyance.Unless the verdict falls this coming week, cycling has been here before. It was in the Vendée in 2011 where a beleaguered Alberto Contador started the Tour de France as defending champion, on the back of a Giro d’Italia win, with a possible anti-doping ban hanging over him. He met a hostile reception, with a chorus of booing when he was presented to the crowds at the pre-Tour presentation. It is to be hoped that Froome is more gracefully received.There are differences between the two cases. The Froome case is not a straightforward positive for a banned substance as Contador’s clenbuterol saga was the asthma drug salbutamol is in a different category as a restricted substance, subject to certain limits. Contrary to the recently expressed views of the five-times winner Bernard Hinault, Froome is not “positive”, unless his explanation for being over the limit were to be rejected.But the other similarities with 2011 are too obvious and uncomfortable to ignore. In 2011 the Observer’s Tour de France preview included these words: “As the massive favourite, Contador would be the man on whom the success of the Tour hinges even under normal circumstances. July should be spent applauding his dominance or thrilling as he falters. As it is, July will be spent wondering what will happen in August … he could lose a Tour and a Giro and his reputation.” Substitute “Vuelta” – the race in which Froome’s AAF occurred – for the second mention of Tour, and Froome for Contador, and there is no further need to rewrite those sentences.Contador was able to race only because the court of arbitration for sport put his appeal hearing back two months similarly resolution of the Froome case has become increasingly drawn out. At first it was expected before the Tour and there is still time for it to be settled at least initially, to the extent the organiser of the Vuelta has begun making worried noises.Since the AAF was leaked in November Froome has been adamant he will clear his name, and that the world will see him in a fresh light when his full explanation for the high test reading is made public. Thus far, Sky have said they have “utmost confidence” he stayed within the permissible limits while Froome has said he was following doctor’s advice after his asthma worsened – and the chances are his final defence will be more comprehensive than Contador’s claim that the tiny amount of clenbuterol found in his urine was due to a contaminated steak brought to him on the rest day of the 2010 Tour.One difference is in the way the cycling milieu has viewed the two cases. In 2011 the UCI was slack in getting the Contador case under way and called for him to be received with tolerance in contrast the current UCI head, David Lappartient, has said that in his view Froome should have ruled himself out of racing until the case is settled. Froome’s view has been consistent: the rules permit him to race and he has done nothing wrong, so he should race.Not all his fellow cyclists see it that way, though. In 2011 there were few prepared to put their heads over the parapet about the Contador case – Bradley Wiggins being an exception – but there has been heavyweight opposition to the way Froome and Team Sky have chosen to plough on. While Hinault has preferred to ignore the subtleties of the case – and Sky’s response has been the diplomatic equivalent of lead piping – the sprinter Marcel Kittel and the 2017 Giro d’Italia winner, Tom Dumoulin, have been more measured.“People are annoyed and I do not like it either,” said Kittel. “I find it difficult to say whether or not Froome should start. The possibility is there, and his team uses that. But Sky has wanted to be transparent since its existence and want to practise a pure sport. They had the opportunity, in this case, to underline those words and keep Froome aside. They have not, however.”Put aside the wondering about what will happen in August – or September or whenever a resolution comes – and the Tour is potentially more enthralling than usual, with perhaps the strongest set of challengers Froome has faced to date: perennials such as Nairo Quintana, Vincenzo Nibali and Romain Bardet, relative newcomers such as Adam Yates and Dumoulin, wildcards such as Rigoberto Urán and Richie Porte.There are grounds for wondering how Froome’s form might be affected by racing the Giro but they are slender, as usually he and Sky manage their buildup to perfection.The Tour organisers have weaponised the elements that have worked well in recent years: short mountain stages, a more than symbolic run across the pavé of northern France, new climbs and a hilltop finish in the first week. There are more cobbles than usual packed into a smaller distance, briefer and tougher mountain days in both the Alps and Pyrenees, a potential pitfall in the Pic de Nore in southern France on the penultimate Sunday, and two ascents of the Mûr de Bretagne on day six.The upshot is a route and a field that offers Froome a serious test. However, as it was for Contador in 2011, the greater challenge is off the bike and it is not to be found anywhere on the roads of France."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/485ea822b6412b1429a383e09e123cb32c02ff13/0_18_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af7b4622d7d965b4dbb276d63923a4cb","title":"nba free agency tracker","story":"LeBron James, Paul George and Kawhi Leonard could all play for new teams next season.

Next year I want to have this convention in Tehran!”The former New York mayor, who became a cyber security adviser in the White House before being named as Trump’s personal lawyer in April, is one of a long line of American conservative hawks to attend the NCRI annual conference. Another prominent guest on Saturday was Newt Gingrich, a former House speaker and a close Trump ally. In his speech, Giuliani said the fall of the government in Tehran would be brought about by economic isolation. “When the greatest economic power stops doing business with you, then you collapse ... and the sanctions will become greater, greater and greater,” he said.  In May, Trump abrogated the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran and ordered a campaign of intense economic pressure, threatening sanctions against any foreign company doing business with Iran and calling for an end to trade in Iranian oil by November. Giuliani suggested that the current wave of protests in Iran was being orchestrated from outside.It was unclear whether “our people” was intended to mean the US or the MeK.The guest of honour at last year’s NCRI conference was John Bolton, who has since become Trump’s third national security adviser. Bolton told the 2017 rally US policy should be to make sure the Islamic Republic “will not last until its 40th birthday” –1 April 2019.The policy of the Trump administration is not officially to call for regime change, though top officials have often hinted at it. Outlining his approach in May, the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said it was up to the Iranian people to relieve the pressure on the country by changing their government.  Giuliani was one of 33 senior US officials and military brass at the year’s conference on Saturday. Bill Richardson, former US ambassador to the United Nations, US energy secretary and Democratic governor of New Mexico, was also in attendance. Stephen Harper, former prime minister of Canada, also delivered a speech advocating regime change in Iran.It was unclear if the speakers at the Saturday conference were paid. The NCRI and MeK have been known for paying very high fees.Most observers of Iranian politics say the MeK has minimal support in Iran and is widely hated for its use of violence and close links to Israeli intelligence.  In sweltering temperatures on Saturday, around 4,000 people arrived by bus at the Parc des expositions centre. Many were draped in the MeK flag, which replaces the sign for “Allah” on the Iranian flag with a yellow lion. Others wore yellow sun hats displaying the hashtag “#Maryam Rajavi”.Around half of the attendees were Iranian. The other half consisted of an assortment of bored-looking Poles, Czechs, Slovakians, Germans and Syrians who responded to a Facebook campaign promising travel, food and accommodation to Paris for a mere €25. Hundreds of Syrian refugees settled in Germany also attended. Many snoozed under trees during speeches.“We saw the deal on Facebook and we agreed to come on a holiday,” said a young Syrian mother as she sat on the conference floor, fanning her two young children. “I have never seen Paris. I don’t know anything about the MeK.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f015b4b0001e850693e618011fcd98446bd2c76/0_59_4794_2876/master/4794.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2dd1374208ec6edd45f48ea6025048fc","title":"divers reach further into thai cave where boys are trapped","story":"US navy Seals part of international rescue effort that has been hampered by heavy rainRescue ers reached several kilometres inside a flooded cave in northern Thailand as the search for 12 trapped boys and their football coach entered its seventh day.There was still no contact with the boys, aged 11 to 16, and their coach who went into the 10-kilometre Tham Luang cave on the border with Laos and Myanmar last weekend.The desperate round-the-clock search for the group has been beset by torrential downpours, blocking ers from going in.But on Saturday US navy Seals reached a T-junction in the depths of the cave just two or three kilometres (one to two miles) from where the boys are believed to be, said the Chiang Rai governor, Narongsak Osottanakorn. Divers reached the same spot earlier in the week but were forced back by rushing floodwaters. This time ers left bottles of oxygen along the tunnel walls so swimmers navigating the muddy pools with almost no visibility could stay under for longer.The group has little or no food and light, though they likely have access to fresh water – either dripping in through rocks or rushing in through the entrance – but experts warned that runoff water from nearby farms could carry dangerous chemicals or bacteria.“If they drink the water in the caves and it makes them sick it could hasten the problem that they are in, but if they don’t drink it then they are also in trouble,” said Anmar Mirza, the US National Cave Rescue Commission coordinator.Even without food, he said, young, athletic boys could “easily live for a month or a month and a half”. “The biggest issue that they are facing right now if they are alive is psychological, because they don’t know at what point they might get rescued,” Mirza said.The dramatic week-long rescue has galvanised the nation and prompted emotional outpourings online from well-wishers praying for their safe return. Cartoon images of the smiling boys being found by ers circulated, along with messages for the team: “Stay Strong”, “We are Coming” and “Don’t Give Up”. Teams of foreign experts from the US, Australia, China and Japan have descended on the remote mountainous site to join some 1,000 Thai rescuers.Several teams trekked into the thick jungle above the cave desperately looking for new openings that might lead to the trapped boys. One team was drilling into a 40-metre chimney that led to a muddy chamber. Another chimney was discovered nearby and helicopters carrying food, water and medical supplies were dispatched to the area. But the main priority is trying to reach the boys through the main entrance.Officials said the boys know the site well and have visited it many times before, buoying hopes that they might have trekked to a large airy chamber in the centre.Rescuers found footprints and handprints in a chamber near that spot earlier in the week, further in from where they found the kids’ football boots, backpacks and bicycles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6521af4b2a582ad741b23ceb0d1c968f80e866d/0_409_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc378fe0111850c3e08c777a90048c80","title":"mexico election vote andres manuel lopez obrador","story":"Election comes against a backdrop of widespread exasperation with political sleaze and soaring violenceMillions of Mexicans will head to the polls on Sunday in a watershed election that is almost certain to see a silver-haired leftist who has vowed to take on the country’s corrupt ruling elite elected president of Latin America’s second largest economy. Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the 64-year-old former mayor of Mexico City and a friend of the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has put promises to eradicate corruption and fight poverty at the heart of his campaign and is expected to cruise to victory.The election comes against a backdrop of widespread exasperation with political sleaze and soaring violence, with Mexico on track to register its most violent year in recent history in 2018 with more than 13,000 murders already committed.For months, polls have given López Obrador, or Amlo as most call him, a 20-point lead over his closest rival, a 39-year-old lawyer and yoga aficionado called Ricardo Anaya.“We can already affirm that Andrés Manuel López Obrador is the next president of the Republic,” Claudia Sheinbaum, a close Amlo ally tipped to become Mexico City’s next mayor, told jubilant fans at his final pre-election rally on Wednesday night. “I am convinced we are standing at the gates of a new era.”About 100,000 lopezobradoristas had reportedly packed Mexico City’s Azteca Stadium for the rock concert-style jamboree – the final act in a punishing six-month campaign that has seen Amlo repeatedly crisscross Mexico with his promises to wipe out corruption and pump the recovered funds into social projects.Outside, street hawkers peddled T-shirts and trinkets emblazoned with the image and the gospel of a man who followers describe in quasi-religious terms and detractors dismiss as Mexico’s populist “tropical messiah”. “Peace and tranquility are the fruits of justice,” said an Amlo quotation stamped on to one mug. Another carried more words of wisdom from Mexico’s likely next president: “Outside the law, nothing above the law, nobody.”“It’s so exciting to know that someone is going to change our Mexico,” enthused Esmeralda de Jesús, a 21-year-old campaign volunteer who was among the crowds. “I believe in his project. I believe he can change the country. That’s why I’m with Amlo.”Martí Batres, the president of Amlo’s party, Morena, in Mexico City, compared the coming sea change to the dawn of the welfare state in 1940s Britain. “It is a historic moment. This is the culmination of so many years of history.” Once sworn in as president, in December, Batres said Amlo would immediately act to pacify the country and help the poor by starting to build Mexico’s very own welfare state.Amlo’s rise has appalled Mexico’s political establishment which – contrary to the views of most analysts – paints him as a Hugo Chávez-style autocrat-in-waiting set to cripple the country’s economy. At his last campaign assembly, Anaya told supporters: “This Sunday the future of our country is quite literally at stake – the future of a whole generation.” As well as the presidency, more than 3,000 elected offices are up for grabs on Sunday when more than 156,000 polling stations open at 8am on Sunday. Voters will also pick 128 new senators, 500 members of the lower house, nine governors and nearly a thousand local representatives. “When you think what people have been through in Mexico, the notion of some saviour coming along is rather appealing,” Riding added. “If you don’t think too much about it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dafcdf3cc086f806ea0e94cf99982d7a7b7031f8/0_102_3765_2259/master/3765.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a56812c3a22fe13aa7062d218be41c4","title":"captain imran khan starts run elections pakistan army","story":"In run-up to elections, the former cricketer has drawn wide support as well as claims he is complicit with the militaryOutside a samosa stall in Lahore, the home town of Imran Khan, a group of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) supporters put down their forks to recall the glories of the 1992 Cricket World Cup, when the final wicket fell like a matchstick before the fast bowling of the team captain. “He was like a tiger,” says Imran Raja, who remembers the final. “I watch it all the time on YouTube,” chips in 21-year-old Hassan, mourning that he was not alive to see Khan lift the trophy.On 25 July, Pakistan holds a general election in which Khan, who founded the PTI in 1996 and goes by the nickname Captain, stands a good chance of a still more significant victory. Posters bearing the party logo, a bat and ball, deck the streets of Lahore. In language typical of a 65-year-old who has transferred boundless energy to the electoral field, Khan warned party workers “not to stop until the final ball” at a gathering in the city on Thursday.Although polls show the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) retaining a lead, most analysts predict that a combination of a spate of defections, court cases and pressure from the military establishment will deny the party a second consecutive term.Families are split. Parked in their car on a side-street in the Lahore constituency Khan is contesting, Mehreen leans over her husband, Yasser, a PML-N supporter, to shout through the window: “Imran Khan is the only hope for Pakistan.”Regardless of who wins, difficulties loom. Pakistan’s economy is teetering and is likely to require a bailout from the International Monetary Fund, after the current account deficit doubled this year. An international money-laundering watchdog put Pakistan back on its “grey list”, indicating insufficient efforts to combat financing of terrorism. And a financial slowdown could reduce the leeway to protect the country from a water crisis, or bolster decrepit hospitals and schools.Since returning from England in 2006, Khan has worked hard to shed the playboy reputation of his cricket career. Then, he was married to heiress Jemima Goldsmith and posed in his briefs for the Daily Mirror. Today he wears the shalwar kameez (trousers and tunic), flicks prayer beadsthrough his fingers, and in January wed his spiritual adviser, Burshra Maneka. In the eyes of his supporters, however, his credibility lies in his clean fingers. Khan is a philanthropist who has set up three cutting-edge cancer hospitals his financial probity stands in contrast to the PML-N founder, Nawaz Sharif, and his family, who currently face trial for money laundering. They have pleaded not guilty and deny any wrongdoing.It was Khan’s dogged campaigning that forced the supreme court to take up the Panama Papers last year, a move which led to Sharif’s ousting as prime minister. “Khan is an honest man,” says Raheel Malik, a 40-year-old IT worker. “He should get a chance to put into practice what he is saying.”Yet the PTI chairman appears less confident than he did in the run-up to the last election. “If you look at the campaign, the PTI hasn’t resonated as it did in 2013”, when it grabbed the votes of the young and middle-class to become the country’s second-largest party by votes, says TV host Fasi Zaka. That partly that comes down to the compromises Khan has made on the way.For the past two weeks long-standing party members have protested outside Khan’s lavish homes in Islamabad and Lahore, furious at being denied tickets to run for election in favour of “electables”, politicians who switch parties with the wind and bring their own vote-banks – and often corruption scandals – with them. The more wizened observers of Pakistani politics argue that picking up “electables” is the only route to power in the crucial province of Punjab, dominated by the PML-N for the past 30 years. “You need the right horses,” says 23-year-old Saeed Zaman, a volunteer in the constituency Khan is contesting. Others feel that by bringing in a third of its candidates from other parties, the PTI has lost its appeal as a purgatory force.“How can Imran Khan’s laundry wash their sins clean?” laments Muhammad Asghar, 60, who says he will no longer cast a vote for the party.Hopes that Khan could deliver the promised “new Pakistan” have also suffered somewhat from the record of his five-year government in the northern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The delivery of health insurance to a million poor families, improvement in public hospitals and removal of political interference in the police draw some recognition from voters, but expectations – whipped into the stratosphere during the campaign – have not been met.Khan has also lost former allies in the elite. “Feminists and liberals are quite shocked that he is still treated by some as a progressive leader,” says Ashaar Rehman, the Lahore editor of Dawn newspaper. He calls liberals “blood-suckers” for supporting the war against the Pakistani Taliban, which he opposes in favour of negotiation. His provincial government granted $30,000 to the madrasa of Sami-ul Haq, a notorious front for Taliban fighters (in return Haq has formed an alliance with the PTI).And similarly damaging is the impression of complicity with military-backed efforts to interfere in the election. Khan has not spoken out as journalists have been abducted, TV stations taken off air, and Dawn’s distribution blocked in some areas.“He enjoys the rumours of establishment support,” says Umair Javed, a consultant. “His understanding of Punjab politics is that he is much more likely to do well if people believe the army is behind him.”Still, Khan has a hot-headed, independent streak that unnerves the military leadership.

Both countries say they will not allow any Syrians to cross.Rebel fighters are trying to negotiate with Assad’s backer, Russia, as the opposition-held enclave in southern Daraa province rapidly shrinks under airstrikes and ground attacks, but say conditions offered are “hard to accept”.Daraa is seen as the cradle of the Syrian uprising against Assad, which led to the seven-year civil war, so recapturing it would be both a strategic and propaganda victory for the government.Fighting, which began on 19 June, continued into Saturday, a second week of conflict that the UN’s Syria envoy has said could match the siege of Aleppo and last year’s assault on eastern Ghouta combined.The fighting in effect rips up a ceasefire agreed last year between Russia, the US and Jordan. It designated the area around Daraa as a “de-escalation zone” and Washington promised a strong response to any campaign that violated the agreement.However, US forces have not taken action to stop attacks, and opposition spokesman Ibrahim Jabawi accused them of having struck a “malicious deal” to stay silent.Jabawi said rebel civilian and military officials held meetings with Russia to discuss surrender, but were offered terms they could not accept. Russia demanded the handover of weapons and said anyone who had borne arms would face trial.Since Russia joined the civil war in 2015, it has helped turn the tide of the conflict with decisive but often brutal interventions, condemned by international agencies, aid groups and human rights monitors.Government forces and their allies have repeatedly hit civilian targets including hospitals and schools, used chemical weapons and starvation sieges, in their battles to take over opposition-held areas around the country.Rebel-held areas have been slowly recaptured, and the south-west is one of just three remaining strongholds still outside government control, along with Idlib in the north-west, alongside territory held by Kurdish forces in the north-east.Even as the rebels negotiated with Russia for some limited protection from Syrian government troops, those forces were taking other towns in the area. Large parts of the rebel enclave has already fallen, and army advances near Daraa city could cut the opposition-held territory in two.State television said at least five towns had agreed to surrender and accept government rule, and one had already raised the national flag, news agencies reported.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says more than 100 civilians have been killed in airstrikes and shelling since the campaign around Daraa started. Tens of thousands of other civilians forced from their homes are gathered in extremely harsh conditions along the Jordanian and Israeli borders, some with tents but many sleeping in the open air. The fighting has been so intense that aid convoys across the border have been halted, Jan Egeland, a humanitarian adviser to the UN said this week, begging Jordan to reopen its border to those fleeing conflict. “I hesitate, in a way, to ask a small and poor county, who has more than a million Syrians on their soil, to take more,” he said. “But I have to do it, because these are women, children, civilians, who have no other place to flee if they are to escape the war zone.” Israel should also be asked to offer refuge, he said."},{"url":null,"title":"dublin s pride parade wows the city as thousands take to the streets","story":"  June 30, 2018This year\u0026rsquos event marks 25 years since the decriminalisation of homosexuality "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3543076.1529934908!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"michael viney the beauty of weeping beeches","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWeeping beech: We found a drift of self-sown beech seedlings, a few inches high, and pocketed one for the garden. Illustration: Michael Viney The summer storm swept past in a hectic swirl of branches and I looked out at dawn to a polytunnel plastered with torn, wet leaves. But even on this bare hillside, so open to sea winds, our motley spinney stood firm. I am awed again by its billowing growth, nourished on extra breaths of CO2.The deeper greening of the planet, confirmed by scientific satellite, has encouraged much online enthusiasm. Even one large tree, I read, “strategically placed in a yard, can replace 10 room-size air conditioners operating 20 hours per day”.That would fit the beech beyond our window, now with an extra metre to its arching twigs and dwarfing everything around it in a great, green crinoline of leaves. But as a specimen of Fagus sylvatica, it may have a problem of identity.A tree can take a few years to show you the shape it means to be. Almost 30 years ago, wandering through the old demesne forest at Cong, we found a drift of self-sown beech seedlings, a few inches high, and pocketed one for the garden. A slow ascension in a sheltered corner brought its head up into the wind, green as a lettuce in May, fiery in the winter sun.Ten years later, at about 2.5m tall, its new growth surprised me. Instead of reaching for the sky, its slender twigs arched gracefully earthwards, a first hint that, rather than the common European beech, we might have adopted Fagus sylvatica pendula. Or are the branches just waiting to be hoisted aloft as the trunk piles on height and muscle?The weeping beech is the largest growing of all hardy weeping trees, reaching 25m or so (not on this hillside, it won’t). That’s long after a weeping willow has grown up and decayed.At Florencecourt, Co Fermanagh, there are “immense, round-topped specimens” of the weeping beech, along with the original wild yew, fastigiate freak from the nearby Cuilcagh mountainside and cloned for the sombre, columnar yews of churchyards.Half a dozen other Irish demesnes in the midlands count weeping beeches among their prized trees, and the named cultivars of beeches on old Irish estates run into some 25 variations of form, purple-leaved, columnar or absolutely twisted (“Tortuosa”).Moreover, England’s Kew Gardens have a remarkable walking beech, which is advancing outwards because its branches have rooted down and become a ring of young trees where they struck the ground.Our tree lacks the authentic, perpendicular droop and seems unlikely to start walking anywhere. It may be just feeling down at its singularity and windy exposure than actually wanting to weep (“even to a casual observer,” writes botanist Charles Nelson, “several different habits are obvious”). The arch of its branches does, at least, still admit me to its shade to offer the trunk a hug.Beech was typically a “big house” tree, but happily accepted by the surrounding populace as occasional “pin trees”, studded with pins and nails (later with hammered coins) in pagan, tree-worshipping rituals. But it never became a native.“Some modern ecologists,” Thomas Pakenham has noted, “advocate a kind of ethnic cleansing in which naturalised species, such as beech, are systematically hunted down and destroyed.”He might have been referring to some of those devoted to restoring and extending Ireland’s native woodlands, many in the remnants of ascendancy estates.In Management Guidelines for Ireland’s Native Woodlands, published last year by the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service, the beech is joining sycamore, lodgepole pine and rhododendron as an “invasive alien”.Authors John Cross and Kevin Collins point to its dense, dark shade and prolific seedling-scatter as a threat to the ground layer of woodland plants and the regeneration of native trees. Their advice is to “pluck out” beech seedlings in winter months, their identity marked by the obstinate, golden curl of their leaves.A national survey of native woodlands found beech in 69 per cent of them. But the guidelines are far from absolute in wanting them gone, if “mother trees” among them are doing no great harm. Indeed, their shade can help foster the growth of yews. And mature, even venerable, beeches have a value to the natural world quite independent of their beauty.At Clonbur Woods, for example, on the limestone shore of Lough Mask on the MayoGalway border, a restoration by Coillte has left some stands of beeches intact. Planted originally as part of the Guinness estate, part of their role in bioersity is to offer a home for the birds-nest orchid, Neotinia nidus-avis.It is a somewhat charmless waif among orchids, and its flowers are a pallid, yellowish-brown, and nectarless. Its leafless and parasitic growth depends on digesting a fungus that is part of the network of underground mycorrhizae that helps to feed the beech’s roots. The plant is also rare, protected and declining, with no duty to be beautiful."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"P\u0026aacutel\u0026aacutes cinema is selected in two categories for World Architecture Festival AwardsLGBTI+ activists express concerns that the event is now more of a festival than a protestpolitan Police issues appeal over the whereabouts of Quinn siblingsThis year\u0026rsquos event marks 25 years since the decriminalisation of homosexualityMet \u0026Eacuteireann has forecast \u0026lsquodrought conditions\u0026rsquo and 25-28 degree heat this weekendDUP leader says she may be unable to block gay marriage law if powersharing resumesIrish envoy says UK\u0026rsquos EU exit will strengthen Washington\u0026rsquos bond with the RepublicGAA club also welcomes visitors from the Orange Order in cross-community initiativeBody had State funding withdrawn amid controversy over handling of rape allegationOwner of popular gay bar calls on public to enjoy Dublin LGBTQ Pride Festival on SaturdayDeceased, who is in his 50s, was part of group making silage at Clogher near ClaremorrisRepealing Fempi all at once would increase national debt and violate EU pact, says MinisterSecurity worker threatened with hammer in Clonee, Co Meath at lunchtime on FridayFocus Ireland opens Dublin service for those unsure where they will sleep until late at nightStudents encouraged to use genuine preference over peers\u0026rsquo plans ahead of Sunday deadlineCassie Fitzgerald sued through her father as a result of circumstances of her birth in 2008What was he convicted of this week?

Photograph: David CheskinPA Wire.Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster has called on Scots to back proposals to build a bridge to Northern Ireland. Ms Foster said there was “growing support” for the idea as she addressed an Orange parade in Fife.She was the main speaker at the Cowdenbeath event, organised by the Grand Orange Lodge of Scotland. The DUP proposed a feasibility study into building a bridge to Scotland in 2015.“The connection between our two countries has always been special,” she said. “What better way to cement that relationship than through a bridge?“Amongst all the nasty and abusive comments made about the Orange wouldn’t it be great to become an actual bridge builder between Northern Ireland and Scotland?“Whilst some foolishly attempt to use Brexit to build a border between Scotland and Northern Ireland, we are more progressive, we want to build a bridge.”Speaking before the event, Ms Foster made a plea for certainty on Brexit.“I think most people want to see that now. We’re two years after the referendum,” she said.“It’s important that we get that certainty soon.“It takes two to tango and we need the European Union to step up to the plate and to recognise that Brexit is happening, so let’s make it a good Brexit for us, and a good Brexit for the European Union as well.”Earlier this month, Labour and the Liberal Democrats in Scotland criticised Ms Foster’s decision to attend the parade, stating her time would be better spent in Northern Ireland, where there is no devolved government in place following its collapse more than a year ago.The DUP leader — who addressed the parade but did not participate in the march through Cowdenbeath — said: “I am the last in a long line of unionist leaders coming along here.“I am not really sure why people would object to me coming here today. This is my culture actually, this is who I am.” - Ms Foster also indicated that her party may be unable to block a gay marriage bill in Northern Ireland. She was previously criticised by gay rights activists and Scottish National party politicians after it emerged she had written to ministers in Edinburgh in 2015 asking them to bar gay Northern Irish residents from converting civil partnerships to marriages in Scotland.After the Irish vote to back gay marriage and Westminster politicians demanded the UK government impose reform on Northern Ireland, Ms Foster shifted ground and became the first DUP leader to attend an LGBTQ event, doing so in Belfast last week. She suggested on Saturday the DUP’s objections to gay marriage would be dealt with by negotiation in Stormont when powersharing resumes. “We don’t have a majority so even if we did apply that petition of concern there’s no guarantee that would actually go through,” Ms Foster said. “So these are all issues we need to discuss in the talks and indeed in the devolved administration.” - PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3548628.1530299553!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"long hot summer ahead as brexit negotiations drag on","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFrench president Emmanuel Macron greets Taoiseach Leo Varadkar during a breakfast meeting at an EU summit in Brussels, on Friday. Photograph: Virginia MayoPAFor months it was billed as the “Brexit showdown”.The June summit of EU leaders in Brussels was the point at which the UK would have to demonstrate movement on a series of Brexit issues, chief among them the Irish Border.Otherwise, Irish and EU leaders warned, the negotiations would be in trouble. A withdrawal agreement, due to be completed by the autumn, would be in doubt. That meant the transition period sought by the UK – allowing it to ease itself out of the EU after next March, rather than leaving all of a sudden – would become uncertain.Were such a thing to happen it would cause consternation in London, as the UK was brought face-to-face with tumbling out of the EU next March.And yet, the British declined to co-operate. There would be no British proposals on the Border or the future relationship, London made clear, until it was in a position to make them. The UK would not dance to the EU’s tune. It would make its proposals when it was ready to do so. Brexit business continued, but at a snail’s pace.As a group of Irish officials waited for their bags at Brussels airport early on Thursday morning, one senior mandarin who works on Brexit was asked if he was busy these days. “Not really,” was the reply. “I wish I was.”Ireland had wanted to avoid a situation where the Border ended up as one of several issues to be thrashed out at five-to-midnight as deadlines loomed in the autumn. But that’s exactly what Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney now face. There’s just no getting away from that.So in recent weeks, the focus of the summit moved to migration into the EU, as a new anti-immigration Italian government found its feet and German chancellor Angela Merkel, still Europe’s most important political leader, came under unprecedented domestic political pressure on the same issue.The switch in focus was evident as the EU leaders arrived for the summit on Thursday, traversing the long red carpet in the Europa building to make their way for a few words with their national media. Few spoke about Brexit. The Irish understand this it’s not clear the British do. Europe is getting over Brexit. They have other things to be getting on with.Going into the summit, one reporter asked the Hungarian prime minister, the authoritarian anti-immigrant Victor Orban, why he persisted in speaking about an “invasion” when there were hardly any migrants coming into Hungary.“Come to the border,” Orban told him.“I went to the border, there is no one there,” the reporter replied.“Because there is a border,” responded Orban.The truth is that Europe’s leaders are having to accommodate themselves to the fact that in many of their countries, there is no support for admitting large numbers of migrants from Africa. They know that if they don’t address the issue, politicians who will address it – one way or another – will be elected. That, more than Brexit, or Trump, or trade, or budgets, is what this summit was about.Meanwhile, the adjacent Justus Lipsius building, where press and officials were gathering, went into temporary lockdown. Access to the building was shut down – nobody in, nobody out. Police clambered down manholes but emerged a few minutes later shrugging and shaking heads.The security alert didn’t keep out the former Ukip leader – and the man who more than anyone else made Brexit a reality – Nigel Farage, who buzzed about from interview to interview in the vast atrium that housed the hundreds of journalists accredited for the summit.For someone who wants to destroy the EU, he seems remarkably addicted to EU summits. The European Parliament, of course, pays his salary.The Irish Border? “It’s the biggest nonsense of all,” he said. “There’s a lot of Euroscepticism in Ireland,” he told Irish reporters. “Always has been, always has been.”And Farage was withering about Varadkar. “The ultimate Yes man in Brussels,” he said. But Farage is a marginal figure these days, even in the UK. His work is done. It’s left to others to pick up the pieces.Two events dominated Thursday night – the EU leaders’ dinner, and the England-Belgium World Cup match. Journalists tried to make the game a metaphor for the summit, or even for the Brexit process, with limited success.More telling perhaps were the photos released from inside the summit room, which showed Belgian prime minister Charles Michel present British prime minister Theresa May with a Belgium jersey.Varadkar donned a Belgium scarf. Everyone was on Belgium’s side. Nobody was cheering for England. British officials later claimed they had a jersey for Michel too, but were ambushed by the Belgians. Nothing seems to be working out as they hoped.When the match starts, the leaders’ dinner is ongoing they won’t be out for many hours yet. The bars around the EU quarter are packed Farage and the Ukip MEPs bray their way to the Place du Luxembourg, but quieten over the evening as England go down to a 1-0 defeat. In the press bar at the summit venue, there is a quiet smattering of applause when the final whistle goes. Perhaps it is because the Belgians are not a passionate nation perhaps everyone realises it will be duller when the English are not around.Before the dinner, there was a brief bilateral meeting involving Varadkar and May. Their personal relations are said to be not good, but officials insist cordiality and business was the order of the day. Varadkar restated his requirements on Brexit May told him proposals are forthcoming. They agreed to resuscitate the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference on the North, which the Irish have been seeking for months. Some progress, perhaps, but not on Brexit.At the dinner, meanwhile, things were not going well. The new Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conti, attending his first summit after taking power on a pledge to stop the boats packed with African migrants arriving in Italy, blocks agreement on anything until the leaders agree a package of measures to address the migration crisis.This is not how the summits work, council president Donald Tusk explains to him. This is not the procedure. Conti doesn’t care. He is, after all, in government with the Five Star movement, whose slogan is “Vaffanculo!” (“F**k off”).As the session dragged on into the early hours, exasperation with the Italians grew. Conte told the group he was unimpressed at the way it managed its business. He was speaking, he said, as a former lawyer.The Swede Stefan Lofven piped up. He was speaking as a former welder. The Bulgarian Boyko Borissov said he was a former fireman. He is also a former bodyguard, karate coach and footballer. Though he didn’t mention that.At 4.35am, having hammered out a compromise that was half resolution and half aspiration, bleary-eyed EU leaders shuffled out into the Brussels dawn. Borissov said they should establish a trade union to defend their rights not to work extra-long hours.The leaders were whizzed back to their hotels for a few hours’ sleep before Friday’s session started, albeit a few hours late. The young guns – Varadkar, Sebastian Kurz of Austria, Emmanuel Macron, Xavier Bettel of Luxembourg – bounded in the old guard looked less lively. After the tortuous Thursday eveningFriday morning session, nobody was in any mood for hanging around. They rattled through the agenda, including matters related to Brexit. Chief negotiator Michel Barnier briefed the leaders on “some progress on some areas” – but none on others, including the Irish Border.After 2pm, Tusk and commission president Jean-Claude Juncker hosted the end-of-summit press conference with Borissov, marking the end of the six-month Bulgarian presidency.He milked the moment, droning on and on in Bulgarian about the achievements of the presidency. Tusk looked on impassively Juncker looked like a man who needed a gin and tonic. Finally, it was time for questions. The first questioner took the microphone. “What was the biggest achievement of the Bulgarian presidency?”Varadkar held his own press conference. He tried to sound optimistic about Brexit, but failed. The EU seems set to reject the forthcoming British white paper. He told Mrs May, he said, that there was “no point” in putting forward something that was incompatible with single market rules.“While we really regret the fact that the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union,” he said, “we’re not going to let them destroy the European Union.” A long hot summer is in store.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

hosepipe ban heatwave continues","story":"digitalservices@telegraphFarm workers picking lettuce in Lincolnshiredigitalservices@telegraphFarmers have warned of a shortage of lettuce while gardeners in England have been told not to use hosepipes as waters shortages deepen as a result of the heatwave.Lettuce and other vegetables such as broccoli and cauliflower could be in short supply as high temperatures put the produce “under stress” and stop them growing.Growers say that with traditionally high summer demand for lettuce they may have to import salad leaves from the US to make up the shortfall, at a time when more than 90 per cent usually originates here.Farmers have also said there could be problems with the wheat and barley harvest if there is no rain in the next few weeks, as these crops depend on rainfall rather than irrigation.At the same time water companies have asked customers to conserve supplies by not using hosepipes or water sprinklers, with the heatwave continuing into the weekend.The first hosepipe ban began in Northern Ireland at 6pm on Friday, and on Saturday Severn Trent Water in the Midlands and United Utilities in the north west began to urge people not to use hosepipes and sprinklers.The recent hot spell has put a strain on water firms, which have been pumping millions of litres into their systems.Severn Trent said: We\u0027re set for another hot weekend, and, with demand for water really high, we\u0027re producing millions of extra litres.We\u0027re asking customers to be careful with their water and for now avoid using the garden sprinkler or hosepipe.Trent Water’s reservoirs were at 88 percent of capacity on June 18, down from 97 percent in April.The British Leafy Salad Growers Association (BLSGA) said the soaring temperatures were causing havoc for growers.In good weather the crop normally grows rapidly, but at current high temperatures it effectively stops growing because it is under stress.Dieter Lloyd, spokesman for the BLSGA, said it looks entirely likely that there will be shortages from the middle to end of next week.One East anglian grower added: I think that if the weather keeps going the way that it\u0027s going absolutely we wouldn\u0027t be in a position to fulfil the demand that we\u0027re seeing with UK-grown produce.”The Met Office said the highest temperature on Friday was 32.5C (90.5F) in Porthmadog, in north-west Wales, and highs of 30C-31C (86F-87.8F) are expected on Saturday.This compares with average temperatures for the time of year of 17C (62.6F) in the north and 21C (69.8F) in the south.Senior forecaster Marco Petagna said: There\u0027s a lot of fine weather still to come.Before tennis ruled Wimbledon, croquet was king in SW19British tennis hopeful slams lack of

federation turns two female candidates role promoting","story":"digitalservices@telegraphdigitalservices@telegraphThe English Chess Federation has been accused of sexism after rejecting two female candidates for a top role promoting the game to women - and instead handing it to a man.One applicant, a senior HR executive aged in her 40s, wasn\u0027t even interviewed for the ECF\u0027s director of women\u0027s chess post, it is claimed.She is an expert player who specialises in recruiting women to male-dominated fields.The other, a chess-playing lawyer in her 30s, said she was offered the opportunity to shadow the male candidate who was eventually successful.The directorship, which carries a meagre £5,000pa budget to promote chess to women and girls nationally, was previously held by former England international Sarah Longson.However it was abolished in February after laying vacant for several months, and then only reinstated following a series of complaints.Only 4 per cent of active chess players registered with the English Chess Federation are womenFollowing this week\u0027s announcement that a man had been appointed, campaigners accused the organisation that runs England\u0027s national team and the British Championship of being spectacularly out of touch with wider efforts in society to get more women in leadership roles.Amanda Ross, who founded London\u0027s Casual Chess Cafe group to encourage more women to play, said: This is a lost opportunity to put a highly qualified leadership role.When I heard the news, lasers came out of my eyes! We refuse to be squeezed out of the game.Time and again, in all areas of life, we are told the best \u0027man\u0027 for this job \u0027just happens to be a man, better luck next time girls\u0027. It\u0027s not that women are mysteriously worse at everything in the world than men: it\u0027s that systemic unconscious bias leads recruiters to falsely believe men make better leaders.In the case of this particular role, a first hand understanding of the barriers to women\u0027s participation is key, and previous post holders have also cited their importance as a role model for young girls starting out in the game. The straightforward administrative aspects of this job have been given preference over the higher level strategic ones.England\u0027s number one female player, International Master Jovanka Houska, also expressed surprise, saying: That is very strange because it is very important to have female presence on the board.Profile | Hou Yifan, ‘queen of chess’The ECF leadership consists of 11 directors, only two of whom are women. One is a non-executive director and the other the director of junior chess.The decision comes just a week after the ECF appointed a male player, IM Lorin D’Costa, as the non-playing captain of the England women\u0027s team for September\u0027s Chess Olympiad - the game\u0027s premier team competition - in Georgia.In April the ECF also turned down an application from the Casual Chess Cafe for £6,000 in funding to support women\u0027s chess.The group offers free lessons has taught more than 500 women to play in the last year but runs entirely on donations.Ms Ross, who has previously called out British Grandmaster Nigel Short for saying women are not \u0027hard-wired\u0027 to perform at the highest level, is now working with other players to form an independent body to represent women in the game.We tried to work with the ECF – now we have to go around them. The new Women\u0027s Chess Network will be a registered charity supporting existing female chess players, and bringing more women into the game.Chess has long been seen as having a problem attracting women. Outspoken comments from several notable male players have not helped.Short, who is running for the presidency of the world governing body, is not the only top player who has suggested that men are naturally better at the game.Garry Kasparov, perhaps the game\u0027s greatest star, also once said that women, by their nature, are not exceptional chess players: they are not great fighters.Although there are very few female chess players at all levels from primary school age upwards, especially in the top echelons, Grandmaster Judit Polgar regularly beat both Kasparov and Short.GM Polgar has now been succeeded as the world\u0027s top woman by Chinese star Grandmaster Hou Yifan, who is considered a prodigious talent but due to take a break from the game when she attends Oxford University this year.In England, out of a total 16,000 active players registered with the English Chess Federation last year, only 4 per cent were women.The ECF\u0027s successful candidate for the role of director of women\u0027s chess was 59-year-old Chris Fegan, a highly-experienced tutor for the Chess in Schools and Communities charity who has taught the game to thousands of adults youngsters of both sexes.Speaking after his appointment, Mr Fegan said: “With the imbalance between the numbers of men and women playing chess, it is obvious that a key focus across the chess world is boosting the participation of women in chess at all levels.I am looking forward to the challenge of working with men and women across English chess to change the culture of the game in this country to make it more welcoming and inclusive for the many women who want to participate.ECF CEO Mike Truran said that he was “delighted to secure a person of Chris’s experience and calibre to take responsibility for one of the major areas of priority for the ECF”.The new Women\u0027s Chess Network has launched a fundraising page to help increase the numbers of women playing chess, and support existing female players.ECF CEO Mike Truran: In the considered opinion of the ECF directors, who carefully reviewed the three applications and interviewed two of the applicants, Chris’s chess-related experience and background were ahead of the other two applicants.One of Chris’ objectives in the role is to identify and develop a suitable female candidate who will hopefully take over from him in due course.Please

fund","story":"Created with Sketch.The message of the Brexit vote - and of similar protest votes in other western democracies since - was that if citizens do not feel economically secure at home, they will reject international commitmentsClick to followThe Independent OnlineBrexit is a done deal - but the social and economic wounds that led to it have not been healedAt the two-year anniversary of the Brexit vote, officials are engaged in fractious debate on the terms of Britain’s exit from the European Union.They are wrestling with several thorny problems, including the fate of the customs border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.But the political and media focus on the deal to be struck has obscured the real message of British voters. The vote for Brexit was a cry for greater opportunity from those who feel that they and their children are mired in lives that offer little hope. \u0026nbspBrexit is a done deal, and the exact parameters of exit from the European Union will have limited and short-term bearing on the UK’s economic performance.The basic facts are uncontroversial. Britain will trade somewhat less than before, at least until British businesses redirect some of their trade away from the EU to more dynamic Asian and US economies.The expected decline in the extent of international trade will, for a while, reduce Britain’s overall economic welfare. But, as the Harvard economist Dani Rodrik has repeatedly emphasized, citizens’ economic welfare changes only modestly when countries with extensive trade relationships increase or decrease the extent of their international trade.Estimates of large (sometimes very large) costs of Brexit rely on the wildly unreasonable assumption that British productivity will decline precipitously and permanently.True, the UK\u0026nbsphas been growing slower than other advanced economies since the Brexit vote but that slower growth is almost entirely explained by senseless fiscal austerity being pursued by Prime Minister Theresa May’s government while other countries have neutral or even expansionary fiscal policy.There has been much handwringing about the depreciation of the pound triggered by the Brexit vote. Currency depreciation normally makes citizens poorer: they pay more for foreign products and receive reduced prices for their exports. But the UK was running a large (and growing) current account deficit.Put simply, the UK was not richer it was living beyond its means. Prolonged current account deficits would eventually have caused a sharper and, therefore, potentially more disruptive exchange rate depreciation. For now, the depreciation has helped narrow the deficit (precisely by making British exports less expensive for trading partners – stimulating demand for British goods – and making imports dearer for British consumers). Britain is on a more sustainable growth path.Moreover, as I noted at the time, the pound’s depreciation reflected an abrupt decline in “hot money flows” into the UK\u0026nbspThese foreign funds were being used by Russian oligarchs and Indian billionaires to bid up prices of property in London. After the Brexit decision, the rate of rise in London property price increases slowed markedly recently prices have actually dropped.Since the modest trade costs of Brexit are at least partially offset by favourable developments, it is crucial to recognise what is really at stake. The Brexit vote expressed the anxiety of those who felt that their prospects of rising up the income ladder were vanishing. In her October 2016 address to the Tory party conference in Birmingham, Theresa May seemed to understand that the vote was a plea for greater opportunity and fairness. But she seems to have lost track of that insight.As my student Rachel Lurie and I find in ongoing research, those who voted against Brexit were predominantly low-skilled workers stuck in dead-end jobs or unemployed in Britain’s rust-belt areas. As former Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote in the days after the Brexit referendum, unable to face Asian competition, British manufacturing “collapsed,” and industrial towns “hollowed out,” leaving semi-skilled workers “on the wrong side of globalisation.”But rust-belt parents had a deeper reason to worry. They were bequeathing poor education and work opportunities to their children. Thus, not only were they themselves stuck, they also felt powerless to create more opportunities for their children and grandchildren.The children, for their part, are as dispirited as their parents. Commentators commonly point out that young British citizens voted more so than their elders to remain in the EU. This ignores the large numbers who did not vote: these were young citizens typically unemployed in socially dysfunctional urban communities.For example, in Greater London, the voter turnout was 79 percent in affluent Kingston upon Thames borough but only 65 percent in Hackney, where large pockets of deep poverty and alienation persist. The non-vote of the young living in bleak urban areas was as much a sign of hopelessness as the exit vote of older rust-belt citizens.Theresa May’s early reading was right: UK\u0026nbspcitizens were indeed pleading through their vote (and non-vote) for a fair shot at the future. They were urgently calling on British leaders to revitalize decaying industrial areas and bring hope to failing urban communities in which they were trapped.The message of the Brexit vote – and of similar protest votes in other western democracies since – was that if citizens do not feel economically secure at home, they will reject international commitments.That crucial message has been lost amid the frenzied Brexit negotiations. Until it is heard, it will continue to haunt, and be repeated again and again.Ashoka Mody\u0026nbspis Visiting Professor of International Economic Policy at Princeton University and former deputy director of the International Monetary Fund’s European and Research Departments.

The setting is spectacular, at the eastern end of Lake Geneva, on the edge of the Swiss Alps. Palm trees line the promenade, there are snowcapped peaks above. You can sit and look at it all day, but when the sun goes down the town shuts down. The vistas here are heavenly, but there’s not a lot to do.Yet for a fortnight each summer, this torpid paradise is transformed. Lighting rigs and big amp stacks spring up along the lakeside. Grizzled musos replace prosperous OAPs. A tax haven for wealthy pensioners becomes the centre of the world music scene, as the Montreux Jazz Festival comes to town.The Montreux Jazz Festival has always been a bit of a misnomer. It started as a jazz festival in 1967, the brainchild of Swiss impresario Claude Nobs. Keith Jarrett played the first festival, Nina Simone played the second, but it’s always doubled as a rock fest, ever since Ten Years After played here in 1969.Since then, Montreux Jazz Festival has become increasingly eclectic. During the 1970s, there were shows by Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Carlos Santana, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Ella Fitzgerald, Aretha Franklin and Roberta Flack. James Brown came here in the 1980s. Miles Davis played here 11 times between 1973 and 1991. In the Noughties, Montreux hosted Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Leonard Cohen, Run-DMC and Radiohead.This year’s line-up is similarly erse: Rag ‘n’ Bone Man, Nine Inch Nails, Jamiroquai, Massive Attack, Jamie Cullum, John Cale, Iggy Pop, Nick Cave, Steve Winwood, Van Morrison… and the band that put Montreux on the hard-rock roadmap, heavy metal veterans Deep Purple.Even at their headbanging peak, Deep Purple were never really fashionable. They lacked the mystique of other hard rock bands like Led Zeppelin or The Doors. However, in Ritchie Blackmore they had a lead guitarist to rival Led Zep’s Jimmy Page, and in Jon Lord they boasted a keyboard virtuoso the equal of The Doors’ Ray Manzarek.Montreux started as a jazz festival in 1967, but has doubled as a rock event since 1969 (Claude Nobs Archives)Blackmore left the band long ago, and Lord died in 2012, but the three other core members are still going strong: vocalist Ian Gillan, bassist Roger Glover and drummer Ian Paice (the only ever-present since the band started out, 50 years ago). Along with Lord and Blackmore, this trio recorded Deep Purple’s most famous track, in Montreux in 1971, with one of the most familiar riffs in rock history – “Smoke on the Water”.Blackmore’s immortal riff would have been enough to ensure the song’s longevity, but like all the best rock songs it also tells a story. Thankfully, unlike a lot of heavy metal anthems, there’s nothing mystical about it. Instead, it’s a straightforward account, almost journalistic in its brevity, of how Deep Purple recorded their finest album, Machine Head, in Montreux.Formed in 1968 in Hertford, Deep Purple enjoyed some success with their first two albums, but it was when founder members Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord and Ian Paice brought in Ian Gillan and Roger Glover that the band took off. Their Concerto for Group and Orchestra (recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall) attracted heaps of publicity, and their fourth LP, Deep Purple in Rock (with its iconic Mount Rushmore cover, featuring the anthemic “Child in Time”) made their name.Cale and Nick Cave (Emilien Itim)Yet for Deep Purple, like so many bands before and since, this breakthrough album brought a different set of problems. Recording sessions for their fifth album, Fireball, had to be fitted in around a busy schedule of live dates, from the autumn of 1970 until the summer of 1971. The album wasn’t as successful as its predecessor, and was widely regarded as a sideways step.Consequently, the band resolved to record their sixth album without any interruptions or distractions. Montreux Casino would be empty for three weeks that winter, and Nobs had offered them the use of it. All the recording equipment they needed they could take with them, in a mobile recording studio (borrowed from The Rolling Stones).With Swiss punctuality, Deep Purple arrived in Montreux, ready to start recording. Frank Zappa and his band, The Mothers of Invention, were playing the Casino that afternoon, and then the venue would be theirs. It couldn’t have been any simpler. What could possibly go wrong?Great music documentaries to watch nowGlastonbury is taking a fallow year but if you’re still craving your Pilton fix, look no further.

Part two takes a closer look at the Seventies - from Zandra Rhodes’ Queen costumes to the DIY punk explosion.Ian Gillan went to see the show with his girlfriend. He saw a man in the crowd behind him wielding a couple of roman candles. Gillan wasn’t too perturbed – compared to most fireworks, roman candles are usually fairly harmless – but then the bloke chucked them into the air, and they lodged in the rafters. In no time at all, the building was ablaze. “There’s a fire, please stay calm and make your way out,”\u0026nbspannounced Zappa from the stage.The band retreated to their hotel, and watched the fire from the bar. At first, it looked like the blaze might spread to the surrounding buildings, and set the entire town alight, but thankfully the wind blew the flames towards the lake, sending smoke billowing out across the water. It was like a special effects scene from a movie. They sat up late, watching the Casino burn to the ground.The title came to Glover the next morning, as he woke up in his hotel bedroom, but the other band members laughed it down – they said it sounded too druggy. But then Blackmore came up with a riff, that riff, on the spur of the moment, and they had the beginnings of a song.However, right now, their most pressing problem was finding somewhere – anywhere – to record. Mercifully, no one had been hurt, but the Casino was a smoking ruin. Nobs found a vacant theatre called The Pavillon, which seemed fine, but the sound-proofing was useless. They’d just started playing “Smoke on the Water” when the police arrived to shut them down. Luckily, the roadies kept them out, as the policemen hammered on the doors.There was only one thing wrong. There wasn’t quite enough material. They’d recorded six classic tracks, including “Lazy”, “Highway Star”, “Pictures of Home” and “Space Truckin’”, but it still came up a bit short for a full LP. Then they remembered the demo they’d recorded at The Pavillon, just before the Swiss police threw them out. And so belatedly, “Smoke on the Water” ended up on the LP, almost by accident. Today, it’s not only the most celebrated song on the album, but the most celebrated song they’ve ever played.Léon Francioli played Montreux in 1971 (Claude Nobs Archives)Yet even after it scraped onto the LP, “Smoke on the Water” still took a while to become a classic. The main single from the album was “Never Before”, which only reached number 35 in the UK singles chart and never became a live staple. Only in 1973, when “Smoke on the Water” was released as a single in the US and started getting airplay on American radio stations, did it finally begin to break through.But although “Smoke on the Water” has now acquired legendary stand-alone status, it still sits best amid the album for which it was intended, as track five (if you’re listening to it on a CD or some other rubbish modern format) or – far better – as the first track on side two, if you’re listening to the proper vinyl LP. It tells the story of the album, and that’s where it ought to stay.Deep purple: There are hellebores- and then there are Rodney Davey’sDeep Purple looks ready to rock old star DenmanDeep Purple made some fine LPs before and some fine LPs thereafter, but they never made anything quite as good as Machine Head. So what made it click? The tight timeframe was one factor – adversity was another. Far from home in the dead of winter, in a quiet resort in low season, there was an element of “all hands to the pump”\u0026nbspas everyone mucked in together.This no-nonsense attitude was reflected in the production. Sound engineer Martin Birch did a brilliant job. The sound he created was clean and sparse, never overly ornate or fussy. He gave each instrument room to breathe. There was very little overdubbing. It was such a palaver getting out of the hotel and into the mobile studio that they often didn’t bother listening to the playback. By modern standards, this was virtually a live album.Nobs died in 2013, after a skiing accident, aged 76. The Jazz Festival is his enduring testament (he also gets a shout-out as “Funky Claude”\u0026nbspin “Smoke on the Water”). The Casino was rebuilt on the same spot, but sadly they didn’t recreate the Belle Époque splendour of the original structure. The modern replacement is a Seventies eyesore. Just think: if it hadn’t been for that idiot with the roman candles, that beautiful building would still be there. But, then again, we’d have never heard “Smoke on the Water”.Montreux Jazz Festival runs\u0026nbspuntil 14 July and Deep Purple play on 4 July (mjf.ch)Smoke on the waterEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Immediately after his birth, doctors whisked him away to another hospital in another state – the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. His mother didn’t see him again until he was eight days old.The doctor told Kevin’s parents that the chance of him surviving was slim.\u0026nbspBut survive he did. However, the large tumour and the damage from its treatment prevented him from being able to do one of the most fundamental things humans do.\u0026nbspSmile.Most babies are born immediately able to communicate with the world around them in one way: by crying.The second signal babies send out is a smile. Newborns can smile spontaneously, as a reflex. This is sometimes misinterpreted by new parents as a reaction to their presence, a reward for their intense concern and sleepless efforts. However, it’s not until six to eight weeks of age that babies smile in a social way. Blind babies do this at the same time.That new parents sometimes optimistically interpret the first reflex smiles as meaning something more underscores the duality of smiling: there is the physical act, and then the interpretation society gives to it.\u0026nbspThe smile, and what the smile means.On a physical level, a smile is clear enough. There are 17 pairs of muscles controlling expression in the human face, plus a singular muscle, the orbicularis oris, a ring that goes entirely around the mouth.When the brain either reacts to a stimulus spontaneously or decides to form an expression intentionally, a message is sent out over the sixth and seventh cranial nerves. These branch across each side of the face from the eyebrows to the chin, connecting to a combination of muscles controlling the lips, nose, eyes and forehead.The basic upward curving smile is achieved primarily by two pairs of zygomaticus muscles, major and minor. These connect the corners of the mouth to the temples, tugging lips upward – often accompanied, depending on the underlying emotions and thoughts, by the levator labii superioris, raising the upper lip, and other muscles of the face.And as for the oft-cited folk wisdom about how it takes more muscles to frown than smile – the jury’s still out, especially as different smiles require different numbers of muscles. However, one source suggests that a genuine smile takes about as many muscles as a frown (and that a particularly insincere kind of smile might take not much more than the pair of risorius muscles).It is when we leave the realm of physiognomy, however, that the smile becomes enigmatic. This contraction of various facial muscles resonates across the entire arc of human history, from the grinning Greek kouros sculptures of 2,500 years ago right up to emoji, those little images that pepper our online communications.One study of smartphone users from 60 countries showed that emoji with smiling faces are by far the most prevalent in messages. The most popular overall – the face with tears of joy – was picked as the 2015 Word of the Year by Oxford Dictionaries. \u0026nbspJust as this emoji expresses more than mere happiness – tears adding the ironic twist so popular online – smiles themselves can convey so much more than happiness. Interpreting their nuances is a challenge whether dealing with art history or interpersonal encounters or the cutting edge of artificial intelligence.A 2016 study, published in the Journal of Nonverbal Behaviour, questioned thousands of people in 44 cultures about sets of photographs of eight faces – four smiling, four not.In most of these cultures, people deemed the smiling faces to be more honest than the non-smiling ones. This difference was huge in some countries, such as Switzerland, Australia and the Philippines, but small in others, such as Pakistan, Russia and France. And in a few countries, such as Iran, India and Zimbabwe, there was no trustworthiness benefit to smiling at all.Why? That question is also complicated, but in essence, the researchers concluded it has to do with whether a society is set up so that its members assume that other people are dealing with them honestly. “Greater corruption levels decreased trust granted towards smiling iniduals,” the authors concluded.That attitude harks back to a very old view of smiling as being opposed to pious solemnity. There is exactly one smile in the Old Testament – Job, ironically – though in many passages faces are said to “shine”, which could mean smiling or could mean heavenly radiance.Eastern religions often use the smile to denote enlightenment. The literal name of the 1000-year-old Flower Sermon, which describes the origin of Zen Buddhism, is: “Pick up flower, subtle smile.”\u0026nbspThe Buddha and various religious figures were depicted with serene smiles, though the original Buddhist texts are as devoid of smiling as Western scripture. Jesus weeps but never smiles.Nor did Kevin Portillo, not fully. He did not smile on schedule. At five weeks old, he was already a week into chemotherapy with vincristine, an anticancer drug so powerful it can cause bone pain and skin rashes. Doctors warned his mother that the treatment might leave him blind, or deaf, or unable to walk.“If he survived,” says his mother, Silvia Portillo, in Spanish, speaking through a translator. “The doctor always said he could not give us hope that he would survive.”Whether stunted due to the tumour or killed by the chemo, Kevin’s seventh cranial nerve withered. That nerve originates at the brainstem then branches out across the face. It is susceptible not only to tumours, as in Kevin’s case, but also to rare conditions such as Moebius syndrome, a congenital facial paralysis caused by missing or stunted cranial nerves. You can’t smile, frown, or move your eyes from side to side.“You essentially have a mask on your face,” says Roland Bienvenu, 67, a Texan with Moebius syndrome.Without being able to smile, others “can get the incorrect impression of you,” says Bienvenu. “You can almost read their thoughts. They wonder, ‘Is something wrong with him? Has he had an accident?’ They question your intellectual ability, think maybe he’s got some intellectual disability since he’s got this blank look on his face.”A lopsided smile can be as problematic as no smile at all.“I have half a smile, so even with that I am able to successfully convey emotion,” writes Dawn Shawn, born with a teratoma – a fast-growing tumour that was interfering with her windpipe.“The hardest part for me was seeing photos of myself smiling, because smiling exaggerates the fact that half my face doesn’t move very much. But eventually I learned to own it. That is me. That is how I look.”The challenges stemming from lack of a smile are frequently compounded. When people have a medical condition severe enough to keep them from smiling, other difficulties tend to be involved.“He was different than the other kids,” says Silvia of her son. “He was fed for four years through the G-tube in his stomach. He wasn’t able to have a normal life, because every few hours he had to be connected to the machine to be fed.” Little kids, being curious, would look and ask what happened to him, she says.While those who cannot smile can blame the state of their facial nerves and muscles, those who can smile are often concerned with a different aspect of physiognomy: their teeth. More than $3bn is spent worldwide on teeth-whitening products, with billions more spent on braces and on purely cosmetic dentistry: straightening crooked teeth, for instance, or reducing the amount of gum that shows when a person smiles.Caring for the state of your teeth is not a modern concern. The Romans had dentists and used chewing sticks and toothpaste. They preferred dazzling white smiles, sometimes rinsing their teeth in urine to enhance the effect.Contrary to common modern perceptions, the ancients had surprisingly good teeth, for reasons that have nothing to do with dentistry. A CAT scan of 30 adult bodies recovered at Pompeii found they had “perfect teeth”.Health news in pictures150 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugarNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active350 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.450 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.550 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms.

The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed2950 Measles outbreak spreads across Europe as parents shun vaccinations, WHO warnsMajor measles outbreaks are spreading across Europe despite the availability of a safe, effective vaccine, the World Health Organisation has warned.3050 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.3150 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.3250 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.3350 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.3450 Breakfast cereals targeted at children contain \u0027steadily high\u0027 sugar levels since 1992 despite producer claimsA major pressure group has issued a fresh warning about perilously high amounts of sugar in breakfast cereals, specifically those designed for children, and has said that levels have barely been cut at all in the last two and a half decadesScientists have made a “monumental leap forward” in the treatment of pancreatic cancer after discovering using two drugs together dramatically improved patients’ chances of living more than five years after diagnosis.3650 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.3750 Over-cooked potatoes and burnt toast ‘could cause cancer’The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued a public warning over the risks of acrylamide - a chemical compound that forms in some foods when they are cooked at high temperatures (above 120C).3850 Cervical cancer screening attendance hits 19 year lowCervical screening tests are a vital method of preventing cancer through the detection and treatment of abnormalities in the cervix, but new research shows that the number of women using this service has dropped to a 19 year low.3950 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaThe ConversationIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4050 Most child antidepressants are ineffective and can lead to suicidal thoughtsThe majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide4150 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4250 Green tea could be used to treat brain issues caused by Down’s SyndromeA compound found in green tea could improve the cognitive abilities of those with Down’s syndrome, a team of scientists has discovered. Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”4350 Taking antidepressants in pregnancy ‘could double the risk of autism in toddlers’Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightened4550 Connections between brain cells destroyed in early stages of Alzheimer’s diseaseScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memories4650 A prosthetic hand that lets people actually feel throughThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers. The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade. While prosthetics have previously been able to be controlled directly from the brain, it is the first time that signals have been successfully sent the other way4750 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4850 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 4950 NHS agree, after loosing legal battle, to fund HIV prevention drugHaving lost the legal battle over who was to pay for the drug the NHS have finally agreed to fund the HIV prevention treatment. National Aids Trust, whom Princess Diana supported, said that it was a ‘pivotal moment’.Scientists have discovered that the switch is controlled in the hypothalamus area of the brain. The switch acts on insulin receptors and involves the protein TCPTP. Scientists have discovered the switch in mice and are hopeful but yet to find out if the switch would be the same in humans.150 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugarNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active350 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.450 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.550 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms. Melissa Whiteley, an 18-year-old engineering student from Hanford in Stoke-on-Trent, fell ill at Christmas and died in hospital a month later.650 Government to review thousands of harmful vaginal mesh implantsThe Government has pledged to review tens of thousands of cases where women have been given harmful vaginal mesh implants.750 Jeremy Hunt announces \u0027zero suicides ambition\u0027 for the NHSThe NHS will be asked to go further to prevent the deaths of patients in its care as part of a “zero suicide ambition” being launched today.850 Human trials start with cancer treatment that primes immune system to kill off tumoursHuman trials have begun with a new cancer therapy that can prime the immune system to eradicate tumours. The treatment, that works similarly to a vaccine, is a combination of two existing drugs, of which tiny amounts are injected into the solid bulk of a tumour. 950 NHS reviewing thousands of cervical cancer smear tests after women wrongly given all-clearThousands of cervical cancer screening results are under review after failings at a laboratory meant some women were incorrectly given the all-clear. A number of women have already been told to contact their doctors following the identification of “procedural issues” in the service provided by Pathology First Laboratory.1050 Potential key to halting breast cancer\u0027s spread discovered by scientistsMost breast cancer patients do not die from their initial tumour, but from secondary malignant growths (metastases), where cancer cells are able to enter the blood and survive to invade new sites. Asparagine, a molecule named after asparagus where it was first identified in high quantities, has now been shown to be an essential ingredient for tumour cells to gain these migratory properties.1150 NHS nursing vacancies at record high with more than 34,000 roles advertisedA record number of nursing and midwifery positions are currently being advertised by the NHS, with more than 34,000 positions currently vacant, according to the latest data. Demand for nurses was 19 per cent higher between July and September 2017 than the same period two years ago.1250 Malnutrition deaths in hospitals in England and Wales at highest level for a decadeThe number of people dying in hospital as a result of malnutrition has hit its highest level for a decade, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show. Death certificates from England and Wales show that malnutrition was listed as the primary cause in a total of 66 deaths in 2016.1350 Fertility \u0027breakthrough\u0027 as human eggs grown in lab for first timeHuman eggs with the potential to become fertilised embryos have been grown in a laboratory for the first time in a breakthrough that could unlock future fertility treatments. 1450 Cannabis extract could provide ‘new class of treatment’ for psychosisCBD has a broadly opposite effect to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main active component  in cannabis and the substance that causes paranoia and anxiety.1550 Babies\u0027 health suffers from being born near fracking sites, finds major studyMothers living within a kilometre of a fracking site were 25 per cent more likely to have a child born at low birth weight, which increase their chances of asthma, ADHD and other issues1650 Over 75,000 sign petition calling for Richard Branson\u0027s Virgin Care to hand settlement money back to NHSMr Branson’s company sued the NHS last year after it lost out on an £82m contract to provide children’s health services across Surrey, citing concerns over “serious flaws” in the way the contract was awarded1750 More than 700 fewer nurses training in England in first year after NHS bursary scrappedThe numbers of people accepted to study nursing in England fell 3 per cent in 2017, while the numbers accepted in Wales and Scotland, where the bursaries were kept, increased 8.4 per cent and 8 per cent respectively1850 Landmark study links Tory austerity to 120,000 deathsThe paper found that there were 45,000 more deaths in the first four years of Tory-led efficiencies than would have been expected if funding had stayed at pre-election levels.Hours of commuting may be mind-numbingly dull, but new research shows that it might also be having an adverse effect on both your health and performance at work.  Longer commutes also appear to have a significant impact on mental wellbeing, with those commuting longer 33 per cent more likely to suffer from depression2050 You cannot be fit and fatIt is not possible to be overweight and healthy, a major new study has concluded. The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part2350 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.2450 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves2550 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.2650 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.2750 Ketamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors sayKetamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors say2850 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department.

Prior to the French Revolution, broad smiles in art were overwhelmingly the realm of the lewd, the drunk and the boisterous lower classes.“The whole face ought to reflect an air of seriousness and wisdom,” John Baptist de La Salle wrote in his 1703 The Rules of Christian Decorum and Civility, allowing that people might, under certain circumstances, convey the impression that they are happy, provided it is done within limits.“There are some people who raise their upper lip so high or let the lower lip sag so much that their teeth are almost entirely visible. This is entirely contrary to decorum, which forbids you to allow your teeth to be uncovered, for nature gave us lips to conceal them…”In The Smile Revolution in Eighteenth Century Paris, Colin Jones argues that smiling reflected the gathering sense of inidual worth that went along with the beheading of kings:This shift in social practices and in sensibilities involved the emergence of the perception, common in our own day, that the smile offered a key to inidual identity. In late eighteenth-century Paris, the smile came to be viewed as symbol of an inidual’s innermost and most authentic self. In a way that was perceived as both novel and modern, it was held to reveal the character of the person within.Photography, by capturing smiles, eventually helped popularise them. But the sitters in 19th-century photographs still rarely smiled, a neutral continence being both easier to hold over the long exposure necessary at the time and less likely to detract from the gravity of the occasion.“A photograph is a most important document, and there is nothing more damning to go down to posterity than a silly, foolish smile caught and fixed forever,” humorist Mark Twain was quoted as remarking in the 1913 memoir of an acquaintance.Around the same time, however, Kodak in the US launched extensive advertising campaigns to help consumers see photography as a means of recording joyous events and celebrations.Over the century, smiles showed a confidence in keeping with the rise of modern capitalism. “An insincere grin? That doesn’t fool anybody,” Dale Carnegie wrote in his 1936 bestseller, How to Win Friends and Influence People, embraced as a life guide by millions.“We know it is mechanical and we resent it. I am talking about a real smile, a heartwarming smile, a smile that comes from within, the kind of smile that will bring a good price in the marketplace.”Part of the attractiveness of smiles is they are so easily extended. Part of their menace is that they can also be just as easily withheld.“For a salesman, there’s no rock bottom to the life,” Charlie says at the end of Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman. “He don’t put a bolt to a nut, he don’t tell you the law or give you medicine. He’s a man way out there in the blue, riding on a smile and a shoeshine. And when they start not smiling back – that’s an earthquake.”Once Kevin was able to eat food, go to school and enjoy usual childhood pastimes – he became passionate about soccer and playing the drums – he still felt the tremors of having a half-smile in a world solidly established upon “a cultural expectation of pearly perfection”, as Richard Barnett writes in his book The Smile Stealers.“I couldn’t smile on my left, I only smiled on my right,” says Kevin. “My smile was weird … people kept asking what happened to me, why I\u0027m like this. I keep telling them I was like this when I was born.”If you see someone in a wheelchair, you anticipate that the person might have trouble walking and assume a physical condition is involved. But facial paralysis carries no telltale equipment, and is rare enough that the unaffected population is not generally familiar with the conditions that cause it, whether congenital or appearing later in life.One of the latter is Bell’s palsy, an inflammation of the sheathing around the facial nerves on one side that paralyses half the face, causing the eye and corner of the mouth to droop. It usually strikes men and women between the ages of 15 and 60.In most cases temporary, Bell’s palsy generally slowly goes away as mysteriously as it arrives. Doctors suspect it is caused by a viral infection. There are also traumatic events – car wrecks, sporting accidents – that damage nerves and muscles in the face, plus congenital irregularities such as cleft palate.A common condition that can also affect the smile is stroke. A sagging smile or face drooped on one side is one of three signs that a person has had a stroke and needs immediate emergency care (the other two are weakness or numbness in one arm, and slurred or garbled speech).While losing a smile is a serious blow at any age, it can have a particular impact on younger people, who are starting out, forming the bonds that will carry them through the rest of their lives.\u0026nbspOr trying to.“It’s a huge problem,” says Tami Konieczny, supervisor of occupational therapy at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHoP). “When you look at somebody, the first thing you see is their face, their ability to smile or not smile, or an asymmetrical smile. It’s your social world.“If someone can’t read your facial expressions, then it’s difficult to be socially accepted. It’s hugely devastating for kids. I had kids photoshopping their pictures. They are taking mirror images of their good side and copying it, photoshopping their own pictures before posting them to social media.”Photoshopping might work on Facebook. But fixing a smile bisected by nerve damage and subsequent muscle loss – Kevin couldn’t move the muscles on the left side of his face, so they atrophied – is far more complicated. Sometimes, it requires multi-stage plastic surgery spread out over a year or more.There are two major procedures available for facial reanimation, according to Phuong Nguyen, a plastic surgeon and reconstructive surgeon at CHoP.The newest, which has its roots in older techniques, is called a lengthening temporalis myoplasty – taking part of the broad band of muscle that powers the jaws and repurposing it to draw up the lips.That wasn’t ideal for Kevin because he had one side of his face working. The older, more complicated surgery was better suited to him.“Kevin had the most commonly done one, a classic two-stage cross-face nerve graft followed by a free gracilis muscle transfer,” says Nguyen. “To be perfectly honest, when Kevin had his stage, we weren’t familiar with the lengthening temporalis myoplasty procedure yet.”Nguyen later learned the new procedure from facial reanimation pioneer Ronald Zuker, a Canadian plastic and reconstructive surgeon, and from its originator, French surgeon Daniel Labbé.“My preference is to do it when kids are five years of age,” says Zuker. “At the time, if I can restore a smile for them, they can go to primary school, meet kids on the playground, meet kids in class. They have their smiles and are well-equipped to handle that situation.”Why put children through what is still elective surgery?“It’s incredibly important to be able to interact with humans on a face-to-face basis,” says Zuker. “If you don’t have the ability to smile, you are at a disadvantage. People cannot understand your inner emotions. They mistake your appearance for being disinterested, or not too bright, or not very involved in the conversation.”Still, some parents prefer to wait until their children are older and can participate in the decision.“If families want to wait, that’s perfectly fine,” says Zuker. “Sometimes when a kid is nine or 10 they look in the mirror and say, ‘You know, I really want this surgery.’ That’s the time to do it.”Which is what happened with Kevin. He was doing well, “even with that scar on his face, has always been popular at school,” says his mother. “He’s always been a happy kid.”But there were kids that made fun of him, she says. One day when he was about nine, he was sad. “I said, ‘What happened to you?’ He said, ‘Some kids, they’re not my friends. They laugh at me because I look funny.’ It was really hard for us as parents.”“We always wanted the surgery,” she says. “But we were told it was impossible. We had to wait to see how everything was changing.”At age 10, Kevin told his parents that he wanted to do what most people do without giving it a second thought. He knew it would be a long, painful, difficult procedure, but it was one he wanted to undergo.“He’s very engaging, very motivated,” says Anne-Ashley Field, his occupational therapist at CHoP. “His goal, I wrote in my notes, was to have a symmetrical smile.”As with smiles themselves, so the scientific study of smiles reflects the cleavage between the physical and the interpretive. The physical side is entwined with the long history of plastic surgery, which has tended to focus on survivors of diseases like syphilis and of the knives of vengeful authorities and warlords.The father of modern plastic surgery, Harold Gillies, reported in 1934 that restoring the ability to smile made patients’ faces “feel much more comfortable”. In addition, Gillies observed, “the psychological effect is also one of considerable value”.On the interpretive side, Charles Darwin discusses the meaning and value of smiles in his 1872 landmark The Expressions of the Emotions in Man and Animals. Like many, Darwin sees a smile as the first part of a continuum.“A smile, therefore, may be said to be the first stage in the development of a laugh,” \u0026nbsphe writes, then reverses course, musing that perhaps the smile is instead the remnant of laughter.He observes his own infants closely, detecting in two their first smiles at six weeks, and earlier in the third. He comments how smiles do more than merely convey happiness, mentioning the “derisive or sardonic smile” and the “unnatural or false smile”, and showing photos to see if his associates can read what they mean.The scientific study of smiles finds differences in gender (generally, women smile more) and culture. Smiles are definitely communicative – people smile more when in public than they do when alone, and more when interacting with others than when not.Scientists have shown that smiles are far easier to recognise than other expressions. What they don’t know is why.“We can do really well recognising smiles,” says Aleix Martinez, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Ohio State University and founder of its Computational Biology and Cognitive Science Lab.“Why is that true? Nobody can answer that right now. We don’t know. We really do not know. We have a classical experiment, where we showed images of facial expressions to people, but we showed them very rapidly… 10 milliseconds, 20 milliseconds.“People can detect a smile even in exposures smaller than 10 milliseconds. I can show you an image for just 10 milliseconds and you can tell me it’s a smile. It does not work with any other expression.”Fear takes an exposure time of 250 milliseconds to recognise – 25 times as long as a smile, “which makes absolutely no sense, evolutionarily speaking,” Martinez says. “Recognising fear is fundamental to survival, while a smile… But that’s how we are wired.”Studies have shown that smiling faces are judged as more familiar than neutral ones. And it’s not just us that can recognise smiles more easily. “This is true both for humans and for machines,” says Martinez. Alibaba, China’s answer to Amazon, launched its new facial recognition payment system called “Smile to Pay” in September 2017.Although scientists have been studying smiles for about 150 years, they are still at the stage of trying to count and categorise types of smile among the millions of possible facial expressions.“One of the fundamental questions in the scientific literature right now is how many facial expressions do we actually produce?” says Martinez. “Nobody knows.”Scientists such as Martinez theorise that smiles – as well as frowns and other facial expressions – are remnants of humanity’s distant pre-linguistic heritage. Human language started developing as far back as 100,000 years ago, but our expressions reach back further still, even to before our origins as human beings.“Before we could communicate verbally, we had to communicate with our faces,” Martinez says. “Which brings us to a very interesting, very fundamental question in science: where does language come from? Language is not fossilised, not found in any other living species. How could something that complex have evolved from nothingness?”One of the hypotheses is that it evolved through facial expression of emotion, he says. “First we learned to move our facial muscles – ‘I’m happy. I feel positive with you! I’m angry. I feel disgust.’ Then language came through a grammaticalisation of facial expressions, which over time evolved into what we call grammar and language.”In October 2015, Nguyen, who plays in a band, cranked up some rock music in the operating room at CHoP – he thinks it was probably something from the Smashing Pumpkins album Siamese Dream.He began work by removing a section of sural nerve from Kevin’s right ankle and attaching it to the working right side of his face, running it underneath his upper lip, to the paralysed left.“We bring it across, parking it, waiting for nerves to regrow from the right side to the left,” Nguyen says.That growth took almost a year. The nerve fibres advanced about a millimetre a day (about 24,000 times slower than a snail).In nerve grafts like this, many of the fibres don’t make it across. This means that the nerve can lose the ability to transmit information – in a few cases, completely.“The thing with nerve-based surgery, you don’t get a lot of instant gratification or feedback,” says Nguyen. “You do the procedure and don’t know if it works or not. You have to wait.”During that time, doctors would periodically tap areas of Kevin’s cheek, to see if the nerve was taking. “When it tingles, you know the nerve is growing,” says Nguyen.The body has a way of covering losses. Removing that nerve did cause a small patch of skin on Kevin’s ankle to go numb. But as he was still growing, the numb patch began to shrink as the neural network took over its function.Once Nguyen was certain the nerve was in place and functioning, it was time for the second stage of the surgery.The mystery of Mona Lisa\u0027s smile has finally been solved Mona Lisa smile \u0027based on his gay lover\u0027, art historian claimsRussian Mona Lisa could be genuineSecrets of the Mona Lisa, BBC2, TV review: the face behind the paintOne morning in August 2016, he took a purple marker and wrote a “P” on Kevin’s left temple and an “NP” on his right, for “paralysed” and “not paralysed”, a common surgical precaution against the risk of cutting into the wrong side of a patient – easier than you might imagine, considering how much of a patient’s body is draped before surgery.“It happens,” says Nguyen. “You want to make it idiot-proof.” \u0026nbspHe also drew a pair of parallel lines, marking the location of a prime artery, and an arrow: the vector Kevin’s smile would take.The surgeon made an incision from the temporal hair line, in front of Kevin’s left ear, then pivoting back under and behind it, extending into his neck – the standard location for hiding plastic surgery scars. The skin on a face peels back easily. He attached three sutures to the inside corner of Kevin’s mouth and gently pulled, to gauge exactly where the muscle should be attached.“So you know it’s in the right place,” explains Nguyen. “If you don’t get this right, they’re going to have to live with it for the rest of their life.”The moment Nguyen put strain on the triple surgical thread was the first time Kevin Portillo ever smiled on the left side of his face.That done, Nguyen removed a 12-centimetre segment of gracilis muscle, along with a section of artery and vein, from the inside of Kevin’s left thigh, as well as the obturator nerve. The muscle was secured in place by a customised splint that hooked into Kevin’s mouth and was sewn to the side of his head to keep the relocated muscle from pulling out before it healed.The section was taken from Kevin’s thigh because the powerful upper leg is rich in muscles. “There are so many muscles that do the same function… you don’t miss this,” Nguyen says.Well… most wouldn’t miss it. Kevin, a diehard young soccer fan, did. “When the surgery came I couldn’t play,” he says. “I didn’t know it would take that long. I thought it would take a couple days and I would be back.”Just how long was he sidelined?“It was more than two weeks,” he says, sorrowfully.“He wasn’t concerned with how serious the surgery was,” his mother says, laughing. “He was more concerned with not being able to play soccer.”Over the next year, Kevin began to get motion on the left side of his mouth.“It’s really kind of a magical thing,” says Nguyen. “We do this procedure, a number of hours and effort, using not a small amount of resources. We don’t know if it works or not.“I saw him post-operatively within the first couple of weeks, he looked like he had this big bulgy thing in his cheek. Nothing was moving. All of a sudden, he was smiling. It was a really incredible moment.”Well, it’s magical, but it’s also hard work. Low-tech and high-tech.\u0026nbspKevin begins his regular occupational therapy session by holding a two-cent white plastic fork in his mouth and showing that he can move it up and down.“Try to purse your lips together to make it stand up,” says Anne-Ashley Field, his therapist at CHoP. “We’ve got it pretty solid in the middle. Try to work it over to the weaker side. Nice try… and that’s harder.”Kevin puts on purple latex gloves and pulls at the inside of his cheek.“You’re going to do your stretch on the inside,” says Field. “A nice, slow hold. Good. Bring that thumb up… Do you feel like it’s getting looser than it was?”“Mmm-hmmm,” Kevin agrees, gloved fingers in mouth.She takes some photos. There is a lot of photography in facial therapy, to track progress.“Now give me the biggest open-mouthed smile you can,” says Field. “Good. Can you make the left side go up even more? Try to make your gums even.”Then, after more exercises, she asks if he is ready for the computer work.They move into the next room, to a $20,000 Lenovo biometric therapy system. Field sticks a surface EMG – an oblong black sensor that reads electrical activity in the muscle – to Kevin’s left cheek and he plays a video game, Load Ship, where he moves animated boxes from a conveyor on the screen by smiling and relaxing.“Give me a big smile,” Field says, calibrating the device. “And relax.”He plays for four minutes, the game burbling a skittery kind of jazzy electronic music.They play a few other games: one trying to get a man to a safe spot as two serrated blue spaces come together. Then a marble maze.“How are you feeling?” she asks.“Hurts,” he replies.Physical rehabilitation is the part of the surgical process that often gets overlooked, but it can make the difference between success and failure.“It’s huge, particularly with facial palsy,” says Nguyen. “You can do technically very sound surgery on two completely different patients and have two completely different outcomes based on how involved they are with their own therapy… It just doesn’t look as good.”How does Kevin feel about being able to fully smile after a lifetime of not being able to?“I’ve been getting better on how I react. I do it automatically,” says Kevin. “Sometimes when somebody says a joke. It actually feels great now. Before it felt weird to not smile. Smiling with both sides of my mouth at same time, I feel I’m one of the other people who smiles right.”His mother remembers the moment she noticed.“We were at the table, we were eating,” says Silvia. “And then we said, ‘Kevin, are you moving there?’ He started moving. Not the way he was doing today little movements.”“We were eating,” he says. “I think she said something funny, and I just smiled.”And how does smiling affect his life?“Before, I was actually shy,” he says. “Right now, I’m less shy, more active.”“I used to have trouble expressing my emotions. Now people know if I’m smiling or laughing. When I laughed, before, I laughed weird. And right now, they know, bit by bit, that I was trying to smile, I was expressing my laughter and my smile. When I play soccer, and score a goal, I’m happy. I’m smiling, to tell everybody I scored.”You’d be forgiven for thinking that classifying and counting the different types of smile would be straightforward. It’s anything but.In the mid 19th century, French neurologist Guillaume Duchenne wanted to distinguish real smiles from fake. Interested in the response of nerves and muscles to stimulation, he applied electricity to particular parts of faces to see the results.He ided smiles into two groups: those that involved the crinkling of the eyes – sincere smiles – and those that used only the muscles around the mouth – insincere smiles.Today, the full smile that uses the muscles around the mouth and eyes is known as a “Duchenne smile” – and the fake one is the “Pan Am smile”, after the kind of smile you might greet someone with if it’s part of your job to be friendly.In 1974, Leonard Rubin described three basic types of smile, based on his study of 100 people:The “Mona Lisa”, where the corners of the mouth go up and outwards and the upper teeth are exposed. The dominant muscle action is from the zygomaticus major. About two-thirds of people studied smile this wayThe “canine” smile, where the canine teeth are exposed. The dominant muscle action is from the levator labii superioris. 31 per cent of people smiled like thisThe “full dentured”, where the lips are pulled back strongly, showing both upper and lower rows of teeth. All muscles are equally dominant. Just 2 per cent of people were found to smile this wayCosmetic surgeons, who have to be meticulous in identifying the smiles that their patients are paying good money to try to achieve, call these three types commissure, cuspid and complex, respectively.Phuong Nguyen, a Philadelphia plastic and reconstructive surgeon, attempts to clarify the matter using celebrities. The Mona Lisa, he says, is the Angelina Jolie. The Tom Cruise smile is a canine smile, and a Julia Roberts is the full dentured smile. This is a subjective matter. Other doctors place Jolie in the second or third categories.Smiling is not a realm given over to easy description. Contemplate the ideal smile as recounted by one clinician in the Journal of Clinical Orthodontics:An optimal smile is characterised by an upper lip that reaches the gingival margins, with an upward or straight curvature between the philtrum and commissures an upper incisal line coincident with the border of the lower lip minimal or no lateral negative space a commissural line and occlusal frontal plane parallel to the pupillary line and harmoniously integrated dental and gingival components.The total number of different types of smile is frequently debated. A recent BBC article gave the total as 19.Arguably the most important researcher into smiles over the past 30 years has been Paul Ekman at the University of California. His 1978 Facial Action Coding System, written with Wallace V Friesen, seeks to create an atlas of nearly all possible human expressions. Ekman says, in his book Telling Lies, that their technique for measuring the face can distinguish over 50 different smiles.Confused? You’re not the only one.

But can he be converted?\u0026nbspClick to followThe Independent OnlineI’ll give her this: she is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in rapturesThree hours of Public Enemy: that’s what I got when I let my son have his choice of music in the car recently. Amid his vast collection of Pokemon trading cards is a set featuring the members of Queens of the Stone Age. And one of my favourite moments as a dad was his overjoyed reaction when I told him I’d got us tickets for Metallica. He’s a music-loving father’s dream.\u0026nbspBut what’s good for the goose has to be good for the gander. Or the other way around. So when Taylor Swift announced that her reputation stadium tour was coming to Wembley, it was a case of fair’s fair. It was my daughter’s turn, even if it meant this Metallica Dad agreeing to a descent into musical purgatory on a Friday night instead of catching up with Game of Thrones.\u0026nbsp“On no, you’ll love it, you’ll have such a good time. I’m so jealous!”That was the response of a shockingly large number of female friends and acquaintances, many of whom volunteered to accompany my seven-year-old daughter Rheya\u0026nbspwhen I expressed trepidation at the prospect of an evening in the company of 100,000 screaming Swifties.\u0026nbspThe ersity of those it came from took me aback: people I just couldn’t imagine would be fans were saying it.\u0026nbspThere were culture vultures and rock fans. Twenty-somethings, thirty-somethings, and forty-somethings. Some with no children, others with a hatful, whose daughters, like mine, they were taking. I sometimes found myself saying, “what, you too?”Taylor Swift seems to hold a good chunk of the female population in her thrall. And not a few men too. Quite an achievement for a onetime country singer.\u0026nbspIt seems to be Swift’s particular way with words that has drawn them in. Nashville is renowned for its story tellers. But Swift’s stories have resonated with a far wider constituency than is usual for singers coming from out of that milieu. \u0026nbspRheyaAt her Wembley show, she likened what she does to the opening up her diary. The chronicling of the ups and downs of her love life, her biting back at bad boyfriends, her reflection on experiences many of those who count themselves her fans will have had, speaks to them.\u0026nbspSelina Mills, a writer friend of mine, and one of those who had me saying “what you too?”, says she serves up “emotional truths” with that diary.\u0026nbspAnother friend, Karen Attwood, who runs Nine Media Training, says: “She’s as good with an acoustic guitar as she is with a big pop anthem and I just love her lyrics. She is having a conversation they’re gorgeous, often very funny and sarcastic.”\u0026nbspIt never hurts if you can make ’em smile. Swift does it for her fans in the same way that a cutting rhyme from rapper Chuck D does it for me.

Right now, it’s them against us. This shit is ugly to the core. When it comes to the poor, no lives matter!” Now that’s the sort of the conversation I want to have.\u0026nbspFeeling suitably purged and, yes, a little self-righteous, I felt able to spend an afternoon in the company of Taylor. But after the first half hour I almost felt like saying “look what you made me do”\u0026nbspto Rheya. And my editors, because I didn’t find listening to her latest missive any easier than her fans might find sampling Slayer.\u0026nbspIt’s not that I can’t recognise a good pop song. Everyone has their guilty pleasures. But reputation’s hooks seemed swamped in a sea of expensive production. Here a backing singer trills, there a rapper rhymes, as the vocals tail off into electronic distortion. Meanwhile\u0026nbspSwift reflects on the trials and tribulations not so much of being a teenager, but of being an uber-famous member of the 1 per cent, a bona fide mega star, with the requisite stable of hip hop style feuds.\u0026nbsp1989, her first “official”\u0026nbsppop record, I found more approachable, and memorable. I confess, I already had some familiarity with that album on account of indie troubadour Ryan Adams covering the whole thing. He somehow managed to put a wistful and melancholy sheen on an upbeat and feisty pop record, widely recognised as the highpoint of her career to date. Moving further back, Nashville becomes progressively more noticeable, and Swift’s stories more innocent and easier to hear.\u0026nbspBut what about the show designed to showcase it all? If not the hottest ticket in town, it was certainly the priciest, part of an effort, it has been argued, to neutralise the scalpers who would have profited handsomely through gouging fans had Swift left money on the table.\u0026nbspI have to admit: a part of me was intrigued. I’ve been going to gigs for more than 30 years now (it makes me shudder to have to say that) and I’ve seen almost everything. Metal, indie, jazz, rap, soul, punk and more besides. I’ve been to decaying fleapit clubs, massive arenas, festivals and, yes, even great big stadia.\u0026nbspBut what I’d never experienced before my evening with Swift was one those bona fide pop mega tours the sort of thing featuring a cast of thousands, that takes several planes, and a fleet of trucks to move the thing from to venue to venue, and turns over the GDP of a small country.It was a world apart from the stadium shows I’ve previously been to. The Stone Roses, for example, needed only their songs, together with the odd inflatable ball bouncing up and down in the crowd, to make for a thoroughly memorable occasion last summer, one worth the price of tickets that weren’t exactly cheap themselves.\u0026nbspA Swift show, by contrast, majors as much on spectacle as it does on music. There were, at Wembley, enough huge snakes to send an ophidiophobic fan running for a\u0026nbsptherapist. Apparently their presence stems from an insult the Kardashian married to Kanye West lobbed at her, and they’ve since become something of a trademark. One’s probably pending.\u0026nbspThere was fire, and fireworks, and films. There was the obligatory army of dancers. Everyone was given a light bracelet on their way in, which seemed to change colours at the command of someone armed with an iPad backstage. The effect was actually rather pretty, if not exactly environmentally friendly.\u0026nbspThere was even a sort of floating cage of lights to ferry Swift between the three (count ’em) stages and, at the end, a bloke whom I’m reliably informed was once in One Direction, came on to perform a duet. Neither me nor my daughter were quite sure who he was, although his presence seemed to delight the crowd. \u0026nbspAs for Swift herself? Well, I’ll give her this. She is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in raptures.\u0026nbsp“Thank you for joining us on the reputation stadium tour,” she said. It was a line she repeated several times. I could almost hear the business manager whispering in her ear: “Don’t say anything that could be considered controversial, but make sure you reference the brand at least once every 15 minutes or so. It’s good for T-shirt sales.”In the middle of this assault on the senses I was again left wondering whether Swift isn’t in danger of losing that connection she has forged. But then, about halfway through, with her occupying stage number two, she produced an acoustic guitar and just sang. She did the same with a piano later on. It worked too. Whatever Swift is, she is no manufactured talent, incapable of surviving without studio trickery, and solely reliant on others to play the instruments. It made me wonder if all the extra stuff was really necessary.\u0026nbspThe reputation\u0026nbspalbum may not have done the business 1989 did, and Swift may have strained her connection with some, but her still loyal fans lapped up everything she did.\u0026nbspCrucially, so did my daughter. All my criticisms started to pale before her sheer unabashed joy. It would have made any parent melt, and the zone of protection I thought I’d established by wearing my Metallica tour T-shirt, with a suitably gruesome design, was breached. In a world that seems to grow grimmer by the day, I couldn’t help but be uplifted at my child’s innocent delight. I even found myself enjoying myself, if vicariously.\u0026nbspAttwood says part of Swift’s appeal, as a parent, is that “among all the hyper sexualised pop stars she is a fantastic role model for my daughter”.\u0026nbspTaylor Swift brings Robbie Williams on stage to sing ‘Angels’ Taylor Swift launches UK ‘reputation’ tour in ManchesterTaylor Swift marks Pride Month with heartfelt speech in ChicagoIs Taylor Swift off-loading her Beverly Hills property portfolio?And I get that. Even though with all that branding it sometimes seems as if she’s as much CEO as she is musician, she is, to quote Janet Jackson, in control.I don’t think Taylor will be troubling my speakers in future, but this Metallica Dad was able to make an accommodation with her.There is a postscript that may amuse you. Since getting one of those Amazon Echo Dots, my chip-off-the-old-block son has been constantly playing what he tells me are Geometry Dash composers. They play electronic video game music that leaves me cold.My daughter, meanwhile, has developed an obsession with Metallica’s Master of Puppets, to the extent that sometimes she’s even had me saying “can’t we have something else on?”.\u0026nbspIt means I might have to enjoy our next live experience vicariously. Next time they tour she’s made it clear she doesn’t want to be left out.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

We don’t know exactly what she is asking for yet, so how can there be?“First the UK needs to decide what it wants, then there needs to be a discussion here and even if it is acceptable, there are processes that have to take place first before everyone agrees to move forward.”Another source close to the European Commission told The Independent: “Now we are looking at December as a more likely option, but there are questions about how much time that leaves for the deal to be ratified in time before March.”There is no hope really for October now. We don’t know exactly what she is asking for yet, so how can there be?In broadcast interviews senior figures also pressed the need for urgency, with commission president Jean-Claude Juncker calling for UK negotiators to finally “make clear their positions”, and Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte saying: “I am not losing patience, but time is getting shorter and shorter to come to an agreement.”On the record Downing Street is still clear that the UK’s intention is to secure a deal as quickly as possible, with October’s summit the goal.Varadkar criticises government for not planning for Brexit before EU referendumA No 10 spokesman said when last week’s get-together concluded: “We have always been clear the Brexit is a challenging process.“But we have made good progress so far, and are publishing a white paper next month setting out clearly what our future plans will achieve.”The food and drink staples at risk of shortages due to BrexitDanny Dyer’s rant about Brexit and David Cameron in fullWhy is Jeremy Corbyn staying quiet on Brexit?What do the ‘bad boys’ of Brexit have to do with Russia and Trump? Danny Dyer’s expletive-laden tirade on David Cameron and BrexitHowever, the view taken off the record by British ministers more closely corroborates the idea that the timetable has now slipped, with senior frontbenchers signalling that October has been becoming less plausible the longer the deadlock in London continues.December is also now being seen as the moment when a deal could most plausibly be struck, something supported by the fact that the government identified 21 January 2019 as a potential staging post on the road to Brexit.A proposed amendment to Ms May’s EU withdrawal bill, which has now received royal assent, committed a minister to making a statement to parliament if that date passes without a deal.But if December is now the new deadline, it leaves the prime minister facing a race against time in the new year\u0026nbspto win parliamentary backing for any agreement before Brexit takes place on 29 March 2019.She will need to win a one-off vote backing the deal and enshrine it in a piece of legislation, which both houses of parliament may wish to amend.People\u0027s Vote march - demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchRecent fraught debates and rebellions as Ms May tried to pass her EU withdrawal act have not gone unnoticed in Brussels, where officials are nervous that the prime minister may yet fail to have the deal they agree backed by enough MPs.But first the prime minister must secure the backing of Brexiteers in her cabinet, in a crunch meeting at her official country residence that should finish with the UK being able to publish its latest Brexit white paper, setting its goals for future relations with the EU.One potential source of friction, post-Brexit immigration rules, has been neutered for now, with government sources telling The Independent that element of Ms May’s future plans is more likely to be explored in a separate paper coming closer to September – but the vexed issue of customs arrangements still needs to be agreed by her top team.The Chequers meeting was originally set up to start the previous day, with only those who sit on the cabinet’s Brexit subcommittee attending.But with that group having already failed to agree to either of Ms May’s options for customs and leaning towards a harder Brexit since the departure of the more Remain-minded ex-home secretary Amber Rudd, the Thursday meeting was scrapped.Holding a meeting of the whole cabinet could give Ms May more cover to pursue a path which would see her keep the UK in a tighter customs deal with the EU and even the single market for good.\u0026nbspBut there has been some speculation that if she goes too far, then key Brexiteers – most notably Boris Johnson, David Davis and Liam Fox – could seize the moment and resign from her cabinet, badly destabilising her whole administration.Those close to Mr Johnson, whose name comes up more than the others, have rubbished the idea. Either way, Downing Street insiders admit that Friday’s meeting could well be one that runs into the following day.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Nine per cent said, “don’t know”.Asked whether Unite union, which represents more than 1.4 million\u0026nbspmembers, should campaign for a referendum on these terms, 49 per cent were in favour while 39 per cent were opposed.Members polled also believed that Britain would be economically worse off if it left the single market after Brexit by a margin of 58 per cent to 21 per cent. Just over a quarter (26 per cent) replied that it would have “no real difference to me and my family”.Mr McCluskey has previously refused to rule out a fresh referendum on Brexit but has echoed the views of senior shadow cabinet ministers who would rather have a general election should the prime minister’s deal be voted down in the Commons.If his union does decide to throw its support behind a fresh referendum, however, the ramifications for the Labour party would be significant – Mr Corbyn would undoubtedly face renewed pressure\u0026nbspto make a radical shift towards a public vote.The Labour leader has already faced calls\u0026nbspfrom his own supporters this week, as a new grassroots campaign, Labour for a People’s Vote, urged Mr Corbyn to support another referendum and avoid Ms May’s “kamikaze” Brexit.According to Labour for a People’s Vote, activists in 60 Constituency Labour Party (CLP) groups have pledged to put forward a motion on the issue to both their local party and to the national conference in Liverpool later this year.Pressed in the survey on whether members supported or opposed the approach by the Labour leadership towards Brexit, 52 per cent opposed and 29 per cent said they supported the party’s position.\u0026nbspPeople\u0027s Vote march - demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchBut the respondents said they held more trust in Mr Corbyn than Ms May in making the “right decisions” about Brexit.“This is not about playing games in Westminster but about real lives that are going to be affected by Brexit,” said Baroness Margaret Prosser, an ex-president of the Trade Union Congress.She said: “There are growing calls for a People’s Vote on the final Brexit deal and they go far beyond traditional party politics.Lady Prosser – also a former deputy general secretary of the old TGWU which merged into Unite, continued: “I support people being given a democratic right to have their voice heard on Brexit before a final decision is taken to leave the EU.“Unite has an opportunity to back that too this week – we should stand up for members and speak up for a People’s Vote.”\u0026nbspThe poll was conducted by YouGov between June 27 and 30 June among 913 Unite members.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He added that “time is very short” and said UK negotiators should return to Brussels on Monday to intensify talks.The EU says a deal must be struck before October to stop Britain crashing out of the bloc in March without a transition period – a scenario that would be expected to cause economic chaos.Theresa May on Thursday night addressed leaders over dinner about Brexit for 10 minutes but her speech was apparently overshadowed by hours of discussions about the EU migration crisis, the main focus of the summit.\u0026nbspdidn’t realise Theresa May had made a speech in BrusselsAsked about Ms May’s dinner speech on Friday morning, Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, looked confused, and said: “There was a speech? Haha.”The joint statement signed off by the leaders on Friday, which was leaked to The Independent in advance, said coming to a deal “requires further clarity as well as realistic and workable proposals from the UK”.“The European Council expresses its concern that no substantial progress has yet been achieved on agreeing a backstop solution for IrelandNorthern Ireland,” it read.“It recalls the commitments undertaken by the UK in this respect in December 2017 and March 2018, and insists on the need for intensified efforts so that the Withdrawal Agreement, including its provisions on transition, can be concluded as soon as possible in order to come into effect on the date of withdrawal.\u0026nbsp“It recalls that negotiations can only progress as long as all commitments undertaken so far are respected in full.”The motion says that the Council urges “member states, Union institutions and all stakeholders to step up their work on preparedness at all levels and for all outcomes” – diplomatic reference to a “no-deal”\u0026nbspscenario.\u0026nbspThe main sticking point in talks is how to avoid a hard border in Ireland. The UK has flat-out rejected EU plans to give a special status to Northern Ireland that would effectively keep it in the customs union and single market, and says any deal must apply to the whole UK and be time limited. The EU says UK plans so far are not enough to prevent a hard border from happening.The UK also wants to time-limit the policy to placate Brexiteers who fear it could be used to keep Britain in the single market indefinitely, but the EU says it would not accept this.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

And for the sake of society, it is absolutely right that this twisted soul was sentenced to life and should remain behind bars for decades.But the truth is that Kouider is not your average female inmate. In fact, she’s almost one of a kind.In the age of “equality”, it’s not fashionable to say that men and women are ­different. But when it comes to ­criminality, there can be no argument.Women make up a ­vanishingly small minority of those in the criminal justice system, representing less than five per cent — and in all but the most exceptional of ­circumstances, the crimes that get them incarcerated are, to put it plainly, petty.In 2016, more women were sent to prison to serve a sentence for theft than for violence against the person, robbery, sexual offences, fraud, drugs and ­motoring offences combined — and 80 per cent of those locked up for theft were shoplifters.In the past decade, the number of ­community sentences for women has fallen by nearly half. In 2016 alone, 8,447 women were put behind bars, depriving around 20,000 children of their mothers.These children will now be shunted around family members or placed in care, eating up even more limited resources than the £36,000 it costs to imprison someone for a year.And they will be stigmatised, probably for life, through no fault of their own. Whatever the macho “tough on crime” politicians say, it is plain that nothing is achieved by locking up women for minor offences.If we want to avoid pouring more of taxpayers’ hard-earned cash down the black hole of the broken prison ­system, we need to stop lumping ­vulnerable women in with violent men and start confronting the complex ­reasons behind their rare appearances in the ­justice system.Research shows that women in prison have often been victims of much more serious offences than the ones they are accused of committing.More than half report having experienced emotional, physical or sexual abuse as a child compared to under a third of men behind bars — and 57 per cent report having been ­victims of domestic violence.Depressingly, because many women fear disclosing abuse, both figures are likely to be an underestimate.The abusers, it would seem, are also the ones pushing their female partners into a life of crime.Nearly half of women in prison (48 per cent) questioned for the Surveying ­Prisoner Crime Reduction survey reported having ­committed offences to support someone else’s drug use, ­compared to just 22 per cent of men.Manipulated, under-educated and all but broken, these women suddenly ­surface in the criminal justice system, ­desperate for the help which would enable them to put their lives back on track.But instead of offering it, we treat them just the same as the low-lives who ground them down in the first place.And it’s creating a cycle of crime.Overall, 48 per cent of women leaving prison are reconvicted within one year.For those serving sentences of less than 12 months, the reconviction rate rises to 61 per cent.This statistic is hardly surprising when you bear in mind that many women lose everything as a result of imprisonment, and 60 per cent of them don’t have homes to go to on release.Without accommodation, it is much harder to get a job or training ­placement, or arrange benefits or care for children so, understandably, they turn back to petty crime.Women like Kouider must always be locked away and no one is suggesting for one moment that serious crimes should go unpunished. But when you have nearly half of all women in jail to support the drug use of someone else and nearly half having attempted suicide at some point in their lifetime — a figure more than seven times higher than that of the general population — it would very much suggest that ­incarceration is not the wisest response.And at last, the Government is latching on. Justice Secretary David Gauke has now abandoned plans for five community prisons for women in England and Wales. Instead, the Ministry of Justice will trial five residential centres to help offenders with issues such as finding work and drug rehabilitation.It may be a small step — vulnerable men are still at risk of falling through the net and Gauke must address that, too — but it’s in the right direction.If we are to stop our shuddering prison system from imploding entirely, we must start by separating the victims from the criminals.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Who would have thought?Did he mention that Airbus, who have been warning of plague and pestilence if we dare to leave, have just been found to have received illegal subsidies worth £17billion from . . . the EU?Did he tell his audience that even Financial Times bosses — a paper so comfortable in Brussels’ bosom it could redesign its masthead as a blue-and-yellow brassiere — think German car manufacturers need a UK trade deal, regardless of what BMW say? Did he heck.Big businesses have done very well out of the EU for years. They’ll resist every possible attempt to reform it or improve it and in Greg Clark they’ve got a man unimaginative enough to believe everything they say.There are plenty of other businesses who are looking to the future with confidence and are excited about Britain striking out on their own.And those outfits who are complaining about Brexit will adjust, just as they did when we (thankfully) didn’t join the Euro, because we’ve got the fifth largest economy in the world and they’d be mad to turn their back on us.It’s time the PM backed Brexit voters over corporate doom-mongers.LOVE Island’s Adam is a nasty piece of work.How ITV can justify him still being on the show despite being caught sending sleazy messages to a 17-year-old girl is beyond us.People have been thrown off for much less.

That was exactly what the meeting had been about, and everybody there knew it.The summit was Operation Save Mutti. Their mission: To stop Merkel’s government collapsing by thrashing out a tough stance on immigration to calm her critics. It’s quite a turnaround.Once, Merkel, with her open-door refugee policy, was queen of Europe. Now she’s a beggar. Suddenly, European politics has changed beyond recognition.The tide has turned. Those making the case for an open Europe are haunted and chastised. They are losing elections.Italy’s new coalition of left and right-wing populists is a fiesta of political contradictions, but they share one goal: To stop the migration population from growing.They want a European refugee policy that is pretty similar to what Austria is advocating.Sebastian Kurz, Austria’s young and energetic Chancellor, has begun to talk about “an axis of the willing” between his country, Italy and Germany.He has canvassed allies in Germany for his ideas on migration reform.Many in Merkel’s centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) are tired of her and her centrist style of leadership and see Kurz as their hero.Earlier this month he staged a press conference with Horst Seehofer, Merkel’s interior minister, coalition partner and chairman of the Christian Social Union (CSU) party.Seehofer now wants Germany to turn away migrants who do not have documents or who first applied for asylum in another EU country. Merkel has refused. If the decades-old CDU-CSU alliance ends over this issue, Merkel’s government would collapse.Until recently, it was assumed that Merkel would last until the next elections in three years’ time.Now many are betting she won’t even make it through the summer.There are two kinds of European solidarity now: The Merkel type and the Kurz type.To survive, Merkel must find a way to reconcile the two, but she is perhaps the only leader in Europe who thinks that is still possible.Countries to the north, south and east of Germany have already moved away from her refugee vision.Denmark and Sweden reinstated border controls in 2015.Viktor Orban, in Hungary, and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, in Poland — often dismissed as loonies and fruitcakes — feel that their views on immigration have been vindicated, not just at home but across Europe. And why shouldn’t they?Much as their migration policies are flawed, they are winning the battle of ideas over border controls and openness.They have many new allies in European capitals. Slovakia and the Czech Republic now have leaders who complain about Muslim immigration.And yes, Emmanuel Macron’s victory was astonishing — but a third of France still voted for right-winger Marine Le Pen.Merkel’s view of Europe was the consensus. When Macron took power, it was hoped Europe would be purged of grubby thoughts about migrants.Merkel’s case for a common European policy on refugees seemed likely to win.But the elections in Italy and Austria changed all that. Having populists in former Soviet bloc states is one thing. Having them running Western European states is quite another.The balance of power keeps changing, shifting ever further from Merkel.The incoming Slovenian PM, Janez Jansa, is a migration hardliner and, like others in the Balkan region, sees Europe’s political future as being represented by Budapest rather than Berlin.So what to do? Merkel now stands as the charity case, not the powerbroker.Macron offers her some respite, saying he will help her by taking back the few asylum seekers in Germany who registered first in France.But far more refugees will have registered first in Italy, and the odds on its new government taking them are slim. In Austria, Kurz is focusing on a plan to force refugees to apply for asylum before they enter the EU.When Austria assumes the EU’s rotating presidency next month, Kurz will make this a centrepiece of his agenda. Kurz’s stance is unacceptable to Merkel. Belgium and the Netherlands are also protesting because they fear that forcing migrants to apply from overseas centres will lead to inhumane migration detention camps, as seen in Australia.But can Merkel fight against it?If she wants to stay in power she will need to be wary of those in her own CDU ranks who are closer to Seehofer.If her leadership recently took them to their worst election results since 1949, what might await them after more years of Merkel in power?Whatever she now chooses to do will cause her reputation to crumble.If she fires Seehofer, it may be the end of the German centre-right as the party in charge.If she goes along with Austrian and Italian demands to turn back migrants, she will be admitting that her open-door policy on migration killed her own vision of a welcoming Europe.She has run out of good options, as well as political authority. She may limp on in Germany for a few more years, but her long reign in Europe has ended.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Since then Johnny has seen his life spiral out of control.He admits to struggling with drugs and depression and he’s lost much of his £459million fortune.He’s embroiled in court battles over money and was pictured recently looking incredibly thin and pale.When I interviewed him at the end of last year he was clearly “well refreshed” and virtually incoherent.Maybe having to face up to his child’s health problems could actually be a turning point for Johnny.His family need him right now and he will have to step up to the mark. ONE of the feel-good ­stories of the week was the kind students who raised enough money to send Bristol University cleaner Herman Gordon to visit his family in Jamaica.Herman was beside himself with happiness and cried tears of joy when he opened his gift envelope to find it stuffed with cash for the trip.He’s clearly a very ­special man and much loved by the students, who said he brightened their lives and they simply wanted to give him ­something in return.Herman was part of the Windrush generation and can’t afford to go back to Jamaica too often.But now he and his wife can have a wonderful visit.This little shaft of light gives me hope for the future and shows there is still a lot of decency in the world.Herman also now knows that he makes a real difference and is greatly valued – and you cannot put a price on that. A HUGE thank you to everyone at Edinburgh Napier University, which presented me with an honorary arts doctorate this week.It was so moving to see all the young, hard-working students come up on stage at the Usher Hall to receive their degrees in front of beaming parents, family and friends.Two years ago I saw my daughter Rosie awarded her honours degree in journalism on the very same stage.I was so proud of her I could have burst.It was lovely to be able to follow in her footsteps and it really was a day to remember.  DESPITE not having watched a frame of Love Island, I’m obviously well aware of the show that has divided the nation.But what really strikes me is how similar they all look in the promos and newspaper photos.It’s no wonder the girls bounce from one chap to another when they are merely identical hairless Ken dolls.The same goes for most of the girls. The hair colour and bikinis might be a different hue, but they have that heavily browned, slightly startled, puffy-mouthed look of a sex doll.Which I suppose is the point.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Last October, this column urged Mrs May to get the Cabinet to Chequers and not let them leave until they had agreed on the final deal with the EU they should be aiming for.This delay in setting out what the UK wants is one of the many mistakes that have handed the initiative in these negotiations to the EU.In an attempt to prevent any walkouts at Chequers, the Prime Minister will spend the next few days seeing senior ministers individually. “She’s peeling off people one by one,” I’m told.But I understand there has still not yet been a “model that has been selected to go forward for adjudication by the Cabinet”. I am told the approach at the meeting will be “to rule things out rather than rule things in”.Cabinet Brexiteers, though, are already nervous about getting bounced — of being presented with a done deal they will have to either accept or resign over.One of those co-ordinating the Brexiteer response tells me: “She’ll have to show her hand before Chequers. The idea of bouncing people with papers they haven’t seen is completely unrealistic as to where we are.It might have been possible six months ago, it is not possible now.”Brexiteers are worried about Downing Street’s direction of travel.One tells me: “They’re prepared to give away things, but they don’t understand what they are giving away.”The expectation is that the Government will essentially propose staying in the single market for goods.But what won’t be addressed is what this means for immigration.The EU will — at least initially — demand free movement in exchange for the UK staying in the single market for goods.I understand the current plan is for the white paper to say the UK acknowledges that labour mobility deals normally go alongside trade deals. But there won’t be much more detail than that.Sajid Javid, the new Home Secretary, takes the view that the Government shouldn’t put immigration on the table in these talks until it knows what it wants.He is also of the view that if the EU want a deal on immigration then they should have to ask for it.As a former banker, with experience of commercial negotiations, he — unlike too many people in the Government machine — understands the difference between bid and offer.Among Cabinet ministers there is a growing view that they will all be back at Chequers in September to discuss how much they are prepared to move on immigration.But any attempt to get the UK to allow any EU citizen with a job to come here will encounter resistance.“If you can come if you have a job, that’s basically free movement,” one ally of Brexit Secretary David Davis tells me.Getting the Cabinet to agree at Chequers, though, is only the first challenge for Mrs May.The next — and even more difficult one — is to get the EU to engage with what she is proposing. CONCERNS are mounting in Whitehall about the Nato summit, and what Donald Trump might say and do.Compounding the issue is that Trump will go straight from the summit to a dinner in Britain to mark the start of his visit here – meaning Theresa May won’t be able to avoid having to say what she thinks of his comments.One well-placed Government source insists to me that the Trump/May relationship is better than it is portrayed.But this source admits his telephone manner can be rather surprising.I am told that, in reference to Brexit, he regularly starts their conversations with: “Are you out yet?Mrs May hosts his UK visit on July 13, right after he’s laid the law down at the Nato summit and before he flies out to meet Vladimir Putin. She must stress that lives are at stake. That the West’s security has relied on Nato for 70 years.And that it would be a disaster for the President to undermine it now, with Russia an increasing global menace.THE restoration work at the House of Commons has hit a snag.Some of the oil paintings, which need to be moved, are too big to go through the doors of the rooms they are in.This means that the oil will need to be rehydrated, a complex process, before the canvases are rolled up so they can be moved.This is another reminder of how difficult it will be to do these restoration works without going way over budget. MICHAEL GOVE has ripped up Theresa May’s plan for a new customs partnership with the EU.To the surprise of officials present, Gove tore the document in two at a meeting on Wednesday.After the Brexit inner Cabinet couldn’t reach a consensus on what customs relationship to have with the EU after Brexit, it was split into working groups to look at the two options.Gove was looking at the new customs partnership, which is Theresa May’s preferred model and would see the UK collecting tariffs on the EU’s behalf.Nearly all Brexiteers, including Gove, see this model as bureaucratic, unworkable and fear it will make Britain a far less attractive country to do a trade deal with.Gove and Liam Fox, the two Brexiteers on the three-man working group, had made these points repeatedly in the six weeks of meetings they have had on the subject.But on Wednesday night, when they were presented with the civil service summary of their discussions, they found these points had been downplayed to almost nothing.Instead, the document implied the group thought the new customs partnership was workable.Gove was livid about this and physically ripped it up to show he wasn’t prepared to accept the document as a summary of their discussions.This flash of anger shows that Downing Street would be making a very big mistake if it assumed Gove will accept – and sell to fellow Brexiteers – any deal with the EU, no matter how flawed it is and how much it tied the UK’s hands for the future.Customs will be one of the biggest bones of contention at Chequers.I understand there is talk the model favoured by Brexiteers MaxFax might be altered to include tariff alignment with the EU.But if that’s the case, then Britain WON’T be able to have a proper, independent trade policy.One of the Brexiteers close to the discussions warns this is the “breaking point of what people are prepared to accept”. THERESA MAY is making it clear to everyone in government that she intends to stay on as Prime Minister after Brexit day, March 30, 2019.Yesterday afternoon, Downing Street summoned the Government’s political advisers and told them to start working on measures to be included in the next Queen’s Speech, to take place in spring and after Brexit day.A Downing Street source tells me: “As you would expect, the Government is focusing on a comprehensive programme of domestic legislation for the next session of Parliament.This will include new plans for the country’s future outside the European Union.”This Queen’s Speech will be huge for Mrs May.It will be her last best chance to show her party she has a domestic agenda that justifies her staying on as Prime Minister.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She won’t survive conceding on any of them.We weep for Downing Street’s tactics.They seem ­terrified that the PM might have to walk out of talks. Why? If the EU continues to demand everything on its terms, she must do exactly that.They’ll call back.GOBBY Irish PM Leo Varadkar has no idea how much damage he does with every Brexit utterance.His latest salvo revealed a patronising, pompous arrogance as misplaced as it was sickening.The mighty EU won’t change its rules for little Britain, Varadkar sneered.“We’re 27 member states — the UK is one country,” he said. “We’re 500million people, the UK is 60million. That basic fact has to be understood.”The Sun has some more basic facts:Ireland’s population is 4.8million. The UK’s is 66.5million.Ireland’s economy relies on us so heavily that a “no deal” is forecast to throw 2.5 per cent of its workforce on the dole. It is far more exposed than any other EU country, or the UK.Our billions bailed out broke Ireland in 2010. Has Varadkar forgotten?Is he happy to sour relations with millions of UK customers with long memories, who may take against Irish goods?A wiser man would have acted as peacemaker, constructively helping both sides forge a historic deal in all our interests, including those of his country and its wonderful people.Instead he chose another role . . . as the snivelling suck-up egging on the playground bullies.THERESA May must seize her crucial opportunity to save Nato next month.Donald Trump is rightly berating Europe’s major powers for failing, unlike Britain, to fund their defence. But Nato is not some unfavourable trade deal he can abandon at a stroke.Mrs May hosts his UK visit on July 13, right after he’s laid the law down at the Nato summit and before he flies out to meet Vladimir Putin.

repeatedly referred to childrens services but only getting help when problems reach crisis point.The government must urgently put an end to the punishing funding cuts which give councils no option but to drastically shrink childrens support services.Otherwise more and more vulnerable children will be left at potential risk and without the early help they desperately need.The young boy is now living with long-term foster carers, has lost a lot of weight and is now settled in school."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PP-111.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"640\" width=\"960","title":"theresa may cabinet can score big win for britain","story":"During Friday’s crucial discussions, they must focus on how we can deliver the vision for an outward-looking global Britain which we committed to in our manifesto.The British public have chosen a positive future — to govern ourselves rather than have an unaccountable and undemocratic elite in Europe tell us how to live our lives.This means ensuring that as we depart from the EU we take back full control over our laws, our borders and our money.Britain must leave the Customs Union and the Single Market to deliver  on the 2016 referendum result.To stay partly or wholly in the EU would betray the public.These negotiations are about much more than the UK’s future relationship with the EU. They must also achieve an outcome which allows the UK to take back full control over our laws, our borders and our money.Any wavering or compromise that keeps Britain as a cash cow for Europe, and our people and businesses subjugated to EU laws that hurt our interests, would be a spectacular own goal.Instead of pandering to those who want to keep Britain in the EU, the Single Market and Customs Union, the team at Chequers must now stand firm and not back down.Their strategy and game plan must be to stand up to the EU and stop letting their negotiating team walk all over us.So far we have been negotiating with the EU in good faith and we have conceded too much ground for little in return.We have pledged a divorce settlement totalling £40billion and while we have advanced a package to ensure that the rights of EU citizens currently in the UK are protected, the rest of the EU have made alarmingly little progress on protecting the rights of British citizens living elsewhere in the EU.Conceding further ground to the EU now will leave Britain exposed at the back and will let the greedy undemocratic EU leaders take advantage of our open goal.The country also decided to take Britain on a new path to future prosperity.Outside of the EU the world is growing at a fast pace.Expanding consumer markets present new opportunities for exciting trade and investment partnerships. Technological change and innovation happens worldwide and the EU’s place in the global economy is falling fast.Ministers must not allow Britain to slip in the world trade league by being chained in any way to Brussels as the EU sinks.Without the straitjacket of EU rules Britain will stand out as a strong place for businesses to invest.While an out-of-touch elite who want to keep Britain in the EU continue to spread fear and doom and gloom, in the real world our economy is doing well.We have some great foundations and since the referendum Britain has seen a surge in foreign direct investment to record levels which shows the high degree of confidence investors have in Britain.They see that outside of the EU Britain will be successful and everyone in the Cabinet should stop playing defensively and commit to that vision too.We are at a crucial moment in our history and Cabinet members need to understand the magnitude of the decisions   they are making.Now is not the time for grandstanding or for egos to get in the way. Ministers need to tighten ranks and play as a united team to achieve victory.The future of our country is far too important to leave to chance and if the Cabinet gets its act together this week then we will be in control of our own destiny.In years to come, people will look back at the decisions we make today and judge members of this Government on whether they have advanced the cause of freedom, prosperity and democracy with a well-executed match- winning plan . . . or left our country to the fate and uncertainty of a penalty shoot-out.Priti Patel is a Conservative MP, representing  Witham in Essex. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Girls carry flick-knives and hide razor blades under their tongues.“We have to hold our spots (drug sales points) — it feels like there is no choice.”Her chilling account comes after The Sun on Sunday launched the Beat The Blades campaign last month in a bid to combat the UK’s knife crime epidemic. Nancy claims her experiences on the street have given her insight for an unlikely future career — as a policewoman.She said: “If the police want to know how to stop young people stabbing each other, they should take the time to get to know us.“I’ve met a lot of police in my life. Some of them are really tired and fed up. But some of them get a buzz out of stopping people and being violent.“The best police of all are the ones who try to get along with us and stay nice and calm.“I was in a park recently when some trouble kicked off and a boy I was with took a swing at an officer.“He got restrained on the floor but the officer stayed calm and made me laugh.“The boy was shouting something about me, and the officer told him jokingly, ‘What’s my wife got to do with this?’“It made us all laugh and stopped more violence from happening.”She added: “We are a generation who have grown up watching aggressive things on social media and playing violent video games, but so have the police.“Some people might find it hard to believe I want to be a policewoman but I know I could make a big difference.Words such as “skengs”, meaning knife or gun, cannot be detected by their computer algorithms, according to Barnardo’s chief exec Javed Khan.He warned social media is being used to manipulate vulnerable youngsters to make them join gangs – a practice known as “baiting the skets”. Mr Khan said: “This is dangerous because social media companies or the police may not be aware of the context and may not flag up the content.“Tech companies are simply not doing enough to protect children.”Nearly 80 per cent of Barnardo’s front-line staff believe drugs gangs use social media to recruit children as young as eight for drug running, knife attacks and sex trafficking.Met Police chief Cressida Dick has said social media apps and sites can “rev people up” and make street violence “more likely”.“If they had more people like me, there would be more trust and more officers would be able to build relationships with kids in their schools and homes.“It’s a long shot, I know, but I really hope I get an interview. We’ll have to see if one of the big police bosses is willing to give me a chance.”Last month The Sun on Sunday unveiled a task force including youth workers, community leaders and MPs to try to tackle the problem.It called for a ban on online knife sales, more community sports, specially trained school bobbies, a crackdown on middle-class drug use and help for child drug-deal “slaves”.Home Secretary Sajid Javid backed the initiative, saying: “I’m really pleased you’ve done this.”Nancy, who has had to conceal her identity for her own safety, was just seven when her mum disappeared back to Africa, leaving her to fend for herself for two years.She recalled: “I used to cry every single night, wondering where my mum was and praying she’d come home. By the time she returned I was a different kid — restless and insecure.“It didn’t help that we kept getting evicted. So every time I got settled we would have to pack our bags again.”BAIT THE SKETS: Manipulate kids to make them join gangsSKENGS: GunsBORRAS: KnivesNITTYS: Drug addictsNEEKS: Drug dealersCRASH CORN: Fire your gunHOOTERS: ShootersSPINNERS: RevolversPLUGGING: Carrying drugs, sometimes in your bottomDUMPIES: ShotgunsEASTMEN: East LondonersNancy was permanently excluded from school and said: “I don’t even remember why. I just had a lot of things on my mind.” In Tottenham she witnessed the 2011 riots, which saw widespread looting and the worst civil unrest since the 1981 race riots.She said: “If I close my eyes I can still smell the burning and hear the sirens wailing.“Tottenham was falling down. People were just killing people everywhere.”Nancy soon drifted on to “the road” — street slang for gang life — and was an experienced drug dealer by the age of 13.She does not attend school and spends her illegal income from drug sales on designer clothing.She said: “Girls play a big part in this life.“If you are a drug dealer, having a girl by your side gives you more protection from the Feds (police).“They can make it look like they are hugging or kissing a girl when really they are passing her drugs to sell.“It’s the way it is — if you chill with the mandem (male gang members), they will ask you to do stuff.”For Nancy, a typical day involves going to the bando (drug den) first thing to collect drugs before taking up a designated spot to do shots (sell and deliver drugs). On other days, the olders (senior, usually male dealers) send her out to steal mobile phones, expecting her to bring back two or three in exchange for around £200 each, depending on the models.Just like their male counterparts, girl recruits are expected to be loyal, punctual and never sample the food (drugs) themselves. Punishments for breaking the rules are brutal.Nancy said: “If you don’t give them the right amount of money they will slash you. Sometimes they send girls to slap other girls.“A lot of these people have nothing to lose — they will just box you up.”Some girls are used to cover up the use of knives.She explained: “They get told to stay at home and are asked to hide weapons — knives under pillows, guns under the bed. The thinking again is that they are less likely to be searched.”Nancy says some girls are able to escape gang life by forming relationships with more superior gang members and having their children.She added: “Their lives are lavish. The kids are in designer gear, they live in nice council houses and wear nice trainers.“But us ordinary road girls don’t want to get pregnant because it’s bad for business.“I wish there was a way out for me. It’s just the money that keeps me on the road.“Money has always been tight at home, I’ve never had any and because I left school early there are no other jobs so shotting (selling drugs) is better.“But there is a price. You can get beaten up by the olders and beaten up by the people you are selling to.“Someone I know had their spine broken and people have been stabbed.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Way better, in fact, without wanting to sling mud, than many other commentators who — regardless of their gender — can barely string two words together.Because, of course, whether or not you are good at your job has got absolutely nothing to do with your gender, right?Until, that is, you are a woman in football, or some other realm that men consider belongs to them.Then, it turns out, it’s a problem. For some men at least.Just to be clear, the idea that football is a “guy thing” is totally outdated. More women watch football in the UK than watch EastEnders (and that’s when there isn’t a World Cup on).And that’s just watching it. I’ll get on to playing it in a minute.Still, Simon Kelner, the former editor of the Independent, wrote in a column this week that women talking about World Cup games “is like getting a netball player to discuss major league basketball”.Then former player Jason Cundy gave his five cents worth, saying that women are unsuited to commentate on football matches because “their voices are too high”.And — although I had to watch it from behind a cushion because I was cringing so much — former Manchester United defender Patrice Evra gave Eni Aluko an actual round of applause for her analysis of one match. . . because he was so surprised that women, you know, know stuff about football too.(Her face when he did so was priceless: Withering look personified.)In case you didn’t know, Eni Aluko has more than 100 caps for England as a player. She also has a first-class degree in law. She is super brainy, bright and articulate — and she knows an awful lot about football.I am full of admiration for her. She is such a strong woman. She is also more than qualified to comment on a football match.Sadly, “more than qualified” is often what women need to be to get ahead in a male world.Eni Aluko is a high-powered lawyer, a professional sportswoman who adds serious value to the commentary of any match.Patrice Evra must know her credentials. But some men, when they feel threatened by a woman, respond by patronising her. They try to put her down. Diminish her. Banish her back into her box.As a woman working in sport I am familiar with this.Lots of men who think women in football are encroaching on “their” territory do the same to me. The number of suggestions I’ve had to get back in the kitchen — and far worse — are too many to count.It doesn’t bother me. But it is tedious and annoying.Men who respond to women in this way can’t quite accept that a new generation of women are coming to the fore and using their voice.They really can’t get their heads around the changes that are happening so quickly — the emergence of women who are using their voice, taking “their” jobs.Luckily, they are a dying breed, these men who want to keep women in the Victorian ages.Plus, it is beginning to dawn on them that we aren’t going back into the box.And they’d better get used to it because it’s not just women commentating on football who are being taken more seriously. It’s women who are playing it too.I’m proud and excited to say that West Ham is one of 11 clubs with new Women’s Super League licences.This really is going to change the face of women’s football.Tier one, the Women’s Super League, starts next year and West Ham is part of that.And the Super League is going to mean a lot more money, professionalism and structure for women in football.So to anyone who is worried about female match commentators all I can say is: Hold on to your hats, boys.REBEKAH Vardy got slammed this week for speaking out about being in Russia.She said that she took the role of supporting her husband – and being there for him before a match – very seriously, saying: “I would be mortified if I was pictured leaving a bar absolutely p***ed, knowing that my husband was going to play one of the biggest games of his life the next day.”Of course, some wasted no time laying into Rebekah’s version of feminism since it included being present for her husband which – according to comments I read – undermines feminist values.I have to say I really disagree.Whoever said that you can’t be a feminist and also stand by your man?I LOVED reading about Christine Lampard, who is pregnant, saying she, “couldn’t care less” about putting on weight as long as everything’s OK inside.In an age when many pregnant women barely look like they are expecting, only to “snap back into shape” within days of giving birth, that’s such a refreshing attitude. I felt the same way and allowed myself to eat what I wanted.I know some women crave chalk and coal when they are pregnant but my craving was for Wagon Wheels.At one point I was on about 12 a day. Those were the days.JOOLS Oliver says that being a stay-at-home mum is ten times harder than Jamie’s job running a multi-million-pound cooking empire.She described her role as “brain numbing” and “hell on earth” and said no one respects her in the household. I’m sure lots of eyes will roll at that idea, but I have to say that I agree.The brief run-in I had with being a stay-at-home mum left me full of nothing but admiration and respect for those women who do it on a daily basis.And it made going back to work feel like a walk in the park.LET’S congratulate New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, for being only the second woman ever to give birth while in such senior office.Some people have questioned whether Jacinda can do the job as a new parent. Would that same question ever be asked of a man?WELL this is exciting. Scientists are apparently closer than ever to inventing an invisibility cloak.I’m sure it’s intended for use by top secret agents intent on saving the world.But all I can think about is what a great accessory it would be for any party at which there are people you don’t fancy talking to.Or for eavesdropping on Apprentice candidates.Or spying on the half-time huddle of any team West Ham is playing.In fact, the possibilities are endless.HONESTLY there is no pleasing some people. The number of moans I have heard this week about people who think it is too hot.Just cast your mind back to the past couple of years when it rained solidly for most of June and July – and count your lucky stars.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Making my decision to go was the easy part, apart from telling my friends and family of course which was a little more tricky.I drip-fed them the information about the race rather than telling them straight away I would be alone and out of contact for nine months.The next three years which followed have been the hard part so far with so many hurdles to overcome before you even cross the start line.But I don\u0027t think the race is going to be a breeze either!I have no idea how I will cope with the lack of human contact or what it will truly feel like when I\u0027m in a low place and want to go home.I\u0027ve been planning what to take with me - it\u0027s all about the music.I can only use cassette tapes so I will miss modern music, although I have recorded some songs onto them as well as audio books.

The huge injection of cash would top the amount pledged by Theresa May’s Tories by nearly \u0026pound2billion. And today, in a speech marking the this week’s 70th anniversary of the launch of the health service, the Labour leader will say it is “essential” to give it a bigger share of the national income. He will also call for an end to the “shocking inequality gap” across the country where life expectancy in some areas is years lower than others. Yesterday Mr Corbyn joined an estimated 50,000 people who flocked from all over Britain to central London to demand more recognition and cash for the hard-pressed NHS.   Coachloads of demonstrators had set off at dawn from Newcastle to the Isle of Wight, all heading to the capital. Buses poured in from places as varied as Birmingham and Cambridge, Nuneaton and Southampton, Kidderminster and Sheffield. Despite temperatures nudging 30C, the march made for Downing Street to give PM Theresa May a stark message. They celebrated the achievements of the NHS but demanded its staff be valued and urged an end to under-funding and privatisation. There was a party atmosphere as the march snaked around London landmarks such as Trafalgar Square and towards Whitehall as thousands of \u0026shysweltering tourists looked on.  A huge mock birthday cake was held aloft by the Save Lewisham Hospital campaign as the crowd sang “Happy Birthday” to the NHS, which began on July 5, 1948. Banners called for an end to “stealth privatisation” and demanded a living wage for Britain’s care workers. The PCS trade union’s drumming band lent a carnival air while activists chanted “NHS, not for sale”. The march ended at a stage on Whitehall where crowds heard from politicians, celebrities, campaigners and front-line staff. Jeremy Corbyn was given a rapturous reception as he said people had to “go to the ends of the earth” to defend the service, which was being undermined by PFI contacts, private firms providing care and the outsourcing of staff.  He said: “Our NHS was founded when people had vision. The creation of the NHS was a coming together and we’ve got to do it all over again. “I want the NHS to be funded and operated by the public, for the public and in public hands.” The Mirror-backed march comes after a decade-long NHS funding squeeze, the worst in history, with annual increases of around one per cent compared to the four per cent historic average. Daily Mirror Editor Alison Phillips quoted from a 1948 copy of the paper which told readers back then: “No-one in the world has such a powerful force on his side as you have now.”  She added: “Sometimes it’s difficult to imagine now what that force must have felt like to our readers who previously, if sick or elderly, had been entirely on their own. “Our letters pages in those first few months were filled with messages from readers overwhelmed almost with a sense of incredulity that this powerful force was there, on their side.” Former Corrie actress Sally Lindsay, who played Shelley Unwin, took to the stage with her two children wearing “Born in the NHS” t-shirts. She told the crowd: “This is our NHS – let’s fight to save it.” Actor Ralf Little, from the Royle Family, added: “I’m here because the NHS saved my life when I was a kid. “Time and time again we have to assemble to remind the Government there is neither the political mandate or popular appeal to underfund it, to privatise it, or to war with the people who run it.”  TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: “The only reason the NHS has kept going is because of wonderful staff. Not just doctors and nurses but porters, cleaners and caterers.” She added: “Don’t let any of those poisonous politicians who want to scapegoat migrant workers divide us. Don’t let any politicians say we can’t afford the NHS. We don’t want Theresa May’s death by a thousand cuts.” Helen Erasmus, a midwife for 30 years, told the Mirror morale among NHS workers had reached an all-time low. She said: “Everybody feels at breaking point. We aren’t able to do the best for our patients because of staff shortages and cuts. “Every day you put in extra hours. Nobody ever clocks off on time.” But the 55-year-old from Newport, South Wales, added: “I’d go to jail to save the NHS – I care about it that much.”  The march came on the day it was announced that hundreds of thousands of NHS patients will be told they cannot have routine procedures. Ops from varicose vein surgery to tonsil removal are now deemed “outdated or risky” by NHS England and will be cut to save money.  Sam Fairbairn, national secretary of march organisers the People’s Assembly, said: “We are now seeing an NHS on its knees due to this Government. It’s a shameful indictment.” Meanwhile Jeremy Corbyn will today give a landmark speech on a visit to Tredegar, south-east Wales, the birthplace of the health service’s Labour founder, the 1940s Minister for Health Aneurin Bevan. He will say: “Under Labour, the share of national income going into the NHS will rise.  “That is essential if we are going to meet the health needs of our people, from cancer care to heart disease.” “We cannot tolerate a situation where one citizen or one community is denied the chance of life and health of another. That can and must change.  “There is clear and mounting evidence that austerity and inequality are killing people.” Mr Corbyn will give the NHS an extra five per cent if he becomes PM, funding it with extra tax on business and a five per cent levy on those earning more than \u0026pound80,000 a year. Tory health spending will hit nearly \u0026pound125billion this year, rising to \u0026pound145billion by 2023.  Labour’s extra money would add another \u0026pound2.4billion. Why they came Among the multitude who turned out to show support for the NHS yesterday were many who owe it their lives or their eternal gratitude. Nine-year-old James Williams dressed as a surgeon to show support after docs in Peterborough stitched his finger back on after a bike accident. Mum Sarah Tomkins, 47, said: “We’ll always be grateful.”  Jacky Mckenna, 55, from Aylesbury, Bucks, owes her life to the NHS after she developed sepsis last year when her kidney got blocked.  She had to be resuscitated and spent three months in a coma at Wycombe Hospital.  “Without the NHS I wouldn’t be alive,” she said.  Shannon Druif, 18, and sisters Katie, 10, and Rebecca, nine, from north London, were there with dad Brindley who said the NHS has helped his colitis.  He said: “If I didn’t have the NHS I’d be screwed.” "},{"url":null,"title":"six year old boy living","story":"NewsSix-year-old boy living in squalor surviving on a diet of crisps, sausage rolls and fried chickenA report by Action for Children raises concerns that high numbers are being repeatedly referred to social services before any action is taken\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByJason BeattieHead of politics10:49, 30 JUN 2018News36,000 kids did not initially get the help they needed from cash-strapped councils in the last two years (file pic) (Image: Getty)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThousands of children are being left in neglect because of ‘severe cuts’ to social services, a charity warns today.

Despite being at risk of abuse or neglect they had to be referred back to social services because they did not get the support first time, the charity says. It says councils are being put in an “impossible position” because of falling budgets and rising demands. As a result they are missing chances to intervene early and prevent harm to children “year after year.” It says one council left an unnamed six-year-old boy living in squalor and forced to survive on crisps, sausage rolls and fried chicken because it rejected “repeated referrals” by a health visitor to take him into care. “Early opportunities were missed to help him and his family a number of times when the alarm was raised. Sadly, the system failed him,” the charity says. Imran Hussain, Action for Children’s policy and campaigns director, said: “It’s simply horrifying that thousands of children are being left to face the potential risk of abuse or neglect, not just once but again and again.

Then it’s probably time to upgrade your stereo to something with more features and better performance…\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByHolly Thatcher17:29, 28 JUN 2018Updated17:13, 29 JUN 2018Advertorial\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWhen you think back to the family car journeys from your childhood, there’s a good chance that many of them were spent listening to the crackle and whine of a sporting event played out on an old-fashioned medium wave radio. Given how much the technology in our homes has advanced, it’s surprising how many of us are still using a last generation radio– particularly as DAB upgrades and wireless connectivity for cars are so affordable. If you think it could be time for an upgrade, here\u0027s some helpful tips for choosing a stereo, and some specific recommendations. Upgrading for sound   Depending on the age of your car, even a modest update could improve the sound. Even if your car came with a digital radio, it might even be worth upgrading to one that supports DAB+ for even better digital quality and more stations. What can your car handle?   Car stereos are usually sold in two sizes: either single or double DIN. As a rule, a double DIN stereo will be able to offer you a bigger screen. It’s far easier to create a stereo that offers built-in navigation in a double DIN socket, and with many modern stereos offering video playback when you’re stationary, it’s useful to have the extra screen size. What to look for in an upgrade   If your car stereo doesn’t have Bluetooth built in, then upgrading will give you access to the music on a Bluetooth-equipped phone. That means you\u0027ll be able to listen to music streamed from Spotify or Apple Music while you drive. Many car stereos have a 3.5mm line-in (headphone jack style), while some now offer USB ports. So even if your phone isn\u0027t Bluetooth enabled, connecting an iPhone, iPod or Android phone will allow you to play music over the USB connection and keep your phone charged at the same time. The Sony MEX-N4200BT offers all of the above and costs just \u0026pound99. There’s even a CD player here for your retro music (so the kids can say, what’s that funny silver circle?). Apple CarPlay and Android Auto   One of the greatest upgrades you can get for your car is to add support for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Stereos that use these are designed to make your phone an important part of your entertainment system - they allow you to navigate, communicate and play music, with intelligent voice control via Bluetooth (Siri with Apple CarPlay or voice control with Android Auto). You’ll need a recent phone to use either system. CarPlay works on the iPhone 5 and newer, while you need Android Lollipop (version 5) on your phone to use Android Auto. But not all Android phones support Auto, so be sure to check before buying anything. Some stereos support both CarPlay and Android Auto while some only offer one or the other. Again, it’s wise to check before you buy - Halfords experts can help you choose the right stereo for both your car and phone. Once connected to either system, you’ll be presented with a selection of apps: Google Maps for navigation on Android or Apple Maps on an iPhone. You can also access your music and podcasts through the clear and intuitive interface. Many systems will also give you hands-free calling and voice-activated features like Siri. Touching your phone while driving is now illegal, but upgrading allows you to still use your phone while staying within the law. Being able to change songs using Siri or say “OK, Google, send a message to Mum,” is really great if you’re running late and don’t want to stop to safely use your phone.

August came second in the study, with one in five voting it their steamiest month, and June was third with 16 per cent saying their sex drive was highest at the start of the summer.  The poll also found that two third of couples felt more passionate on holiday because they had the luxury of more time and felt more relaxed than they did at home.  While on vacation, lovers like to spice things up outside the bedroom with 57 per cent admitting to some alfresco romance on the beach. The least sexy month was November with just one per cent saying they got the most action then.  The findings are supported by science. In winter we have more melatonin, a hormone regulating sleep and wakefulness, leading to lower a sex drive and lethargy.  Tests also show men have a third more testosterone flowing through their bodies in June than in January, so for gentlemen more sun spells better sex.

Former nurse Nicola, 46, said: “It can be an utterly heartbreaking job. “But I just can’t bear the thought of them spending their final moments without the love they deserve.”  Nicola takes in dogs with around six months to live.

And their policy flouted EU regulations banning mobile networks from charging more abroad for data allowance use. But EE skirted around regulations by making a small change to its contracts before the EU laws came into force. The change meant only customers on 4G EE max plans would get the fastest EU data speeds.  Everyone else would get “standard speeds” which can be slower than in the UK.

Detectives cordoned off an area of Crown Lakes near Peterborough as search and rescue teams were seen searching the water. The man went missing just before 3.30pm today after a number of people took their floats and inflatables into the lake to cool off in the heat. A number of police and fire units were seen in the area including a police helicopter and air ambulance which were hovering above the water.

This has involved police, fire and ambulance services.  We received the call just before 3.30pm and the area is still sealed off. The man was still believed to be missing as night fell and it is expected the search will continue tomorrow morning. Four people have died in swimming-related incidents in less than a week as the heatwave takes hold.  On Monday a woman drowned while swimming in the sea off Eastbourne on the south coast .   The same day 13-year-old Ryan Evans went missing while swimming with two friends at Westport Lake in Stoke-on-Trent.   The alarm was raised at about 5pm, after a witness spotted three boys in distress. The other two boys, aged 12 and 13, managed to get to safety, but Ryan was declared missing.  Following a painstaking joint emergency services effort involving police divers, sonar and sniffer dogs , the operation concluded on Wednesday evening when the boy\u0027s body was recovered from the water.   On Tuesday the body of a 17-year-old boy was pulled from the river after he got into difficulty in the River Aire in Leeds.

They say it wasn’t until the \u0026pound6,500 Peugeot 3008 turned up 35 days later, on a Wythenshawe estate, that Manchester Airport Parking Services Ltd accepted it had been in their possession. But when owner Arthur Morris went to pick up his car from Hilary Road on Thursday, he says it had been trashed and vandalised. Photographs show dents in the roof, a broken wing mirror, a key scratch down the driver’s door, two flat tyres and damage to the bumper.  The 43-year-old paramedic said the ordeal has been a nightmare. He said: To see our car like this is so sad. But for them to tell me for a month they didn’t have my car and that they’d never had it and then to find it in this condition is outrageous. “The meet and greet worker who met me there said they would have left it there in a rush intending to move it to their compound but then it got lost.” Rebecca and Arthur Morris say they left their car with the firm - which is not affiliated with Manchester Airports Group - on May 24, before they flew to Turkey with their three children for a two-week holiday.  When they returned to Manchester Airport to pick up their vehicle on June 8 at 5am, the couple say the firm told them they couldn’t find it, or their car key. A staff member then drove the family home to Horwich in Bolton in a clapped out Mazda. Arthur called the police and says he also repeatedly contacted the firm in the days that followed.

The Duchess of Sussex, who married Prince Harry in Windsor last May, has stopped short of communicating with her 73-year-old father since the interview with hosts Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid, according to sources cited by the Mail Online. Thomas Sr has been the subject of several high profile controversies ever since the royal wedding between his now royal daughter and the newly proclaimed Duke of Sussex was announced. He made headlines shortly before the wedding when footage emerged of him staging paparazzi shots which were then reportedly sold for \u0026pound100,000.  The US former TV lighting director then shockingly announced he would not be walking his 36-year-old daughter down the aisle because of his precarious heart conditions. And just over a month later, he revealed in the ITV interview details of his conversations with Prince Harry about politics and blabbed about how his daughter told him she wished to have kids.

If the Queen is willing to meet our arrogant and insensitive president she has no excuse not to meet me, I\u0027m nowhere near as bad, he told TMZ on Tuesday.

He told the American site that he still has every intention to jet over to England to be formally introduced to Harry - despite having to be hospitalised with a suspected heart attack just days before the wedding. Thomas said neither the royals or their staff have contacted him since the interview, for which he racked in an appearance fee of \u0026pound7,500. In the interview he revealed how Prince Harry - who is supposed to remain neutral on political issues - was open to Brexit and wants people to give Trump a chance”, risking the rage of Buckingham Palace.

British micro sculptor Willard Wigan’s \u0026shyminuscule masterpieces, such as a Picasso on a pinhead, have been \u0026shydescribed as the eighth wonder of the world. Although their details are invisible to the naked eye the works are highly prized and sell for more than \u0026pound30,000. Wilard’s remarkable creations are owned by the Queen, ex US President Barack Obama , boxing legend Mike Tyson and X Factor’s Simon Cowell. And next Sunday Willard, 61, will be featured in a Channel 4 programme. He has made the Guinness World Records with the smallest handmade sculpture in human history – a baby inside a hair from his chin stubble measuring just 15-20 microns. That is one \u0026shyfifteenth the size of a newspaper full stop.  Willard’s feats have staggered leading nano technology scientists because even the most modern equipment, such as 3D printers, cannot replicate them. And to say Willard’s work in \u0026shypainstaking is an understatement. The slightest breath or reverberation from passing traffic outside can blow away his artistic creations. He once inhaled Alice in Wonderland when working on a minuscule Mad Hatter’s tea party scene. His works are so delicate he has to perfect them between his heartbeats as even his pulse is strong enough to destroy his microscopic world.  But although his works are tiny, Birmingham-based Willard insisted there is nothing small about their messages. He said: “My work is my voice. I wanted to make something small but say \u0026shysomething big. “You can see something very tiny but it means so much, just like you can say something in only a few words and have a wider meaning. When people see my work it puts a different perspective on the way they see things. “I’ve thrown a grain of sand into the sea and created a tidal wave.” Willard works 18 hours a day, often on three or four pieces at a time. His fianc\u0026eacutee Janice Blanchette, 51, has to remind him to eat. He works himself into a meditative state, slowing his heart beat so he can make his fabulous creations using his own handmade tools. These include a tiny pearl drill sharpened into a point, or shards of diamond inserted into the end of a syringe. He then paints them using molecules of pigmentation applied using a human eyelash glued into the end of an acupuncture needle. The process is so laborious that Willard admits his \u0026shydaily tasks are far from pleasurable. He said: “It’s impossible to enjoy \u0026shybecause it drives you mad doing it. I only do it because I like the end of it and \u0026shyseeing the pleasure people take in it.  “Although it is stressful, it disciplines me at the same time, training my nervous system, attention span and dexterity.” His incredible discipline has produced some staggering work. Look through a microscope and you can see a violinist playing a miniature instrument strung with fibres from a tiny money spider’s web, a vista of the Hollywood hills in the eye of a needle and a painting the world’s tiniest 1mm square Mona Lisa using a fly hair as a brush. Beloved characters from Beatrix Potter, the Princess in Disney’s Frozen, a gold galleon on a pin and Alice in Wonderland have also been \u0026shyimmortalised in his \u0026shyminiature world. He has also produced tiny Barack Obama and family, William and Kate , Harry and Meghan and William Shakespeare – complete with the near-invisible painted caption: “To see or not to see.” Willard received a personal letter of thanks from the Queen after he made a replica of the Coronation Crown on top of a pinhead as a private \u0026shycommission for Her Majesty’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations.   Picasso and Matisse paintings stolen from Paris gallery in \u0026pound430million art r  Awarded an MBE in 2007, Willard said: “Being able to beat a machine doing it by hand. That’s the pleasure.” The second of eight kids in a family of first-generation Jamaican \u0026shyimmigrants, he was brought up on a Wolverhampton council estate and produced his first sculpture aged only five. Using his dad’s razor blades he made miniature houses for ants, with furniture and crockery. Willard, suffering undiagnosed dyslexia and Asperger’s, struggled at school. Teachers feared he was illiterate and would amount to nothing in life.  He \u0026shyregularly ran away from school and found solace in his bedroom making art of such minute proportions that it could not be seen with the naked eye. He believed if his work could not be seen then it could not be criticised. He said: “When I was little I believed ants could talk, that there were little \u0026shyfairies and leprechauns in the bottom of our garden. I found my own world.” Spurred on by his mum Zetta, who died aged 63 in 1995, Willard’s works were scaled down millimetre by millimetre.  “Mum would always tell me if you go smaller your name will get \u0026shybigger,” said Willard, who continued working on his creations in the evenings while holding down a day job as a factory worker in Wolverhampton. He had left school at 15 with no qualifications and could not even tell the time until he was 18. Willard said: “It became an obsession, wanting to go smaller.” In 2013 he used a microscopic flake of gold from a chain and a speck of his own stubble to create what was the world’s tiniest \u0026shyhandmade sculpture – a gold \u0026shymotorcycle inside the eye of a needle.

Now from 1 July, the fee that banks pay ATM operators per withdrawal is being reduced - and it is expected more will close or will start charging customers a fee. Link, the shared network of ATMs in the UK, is to cut the fees operators receive from banks when the cashpoints are used. The fee – known as the interchange rate - is currently around 25p and will be reduced by around 1p with the first cut. It will eventually fall to 20p. While this might not seem like much, operators have stated that some machines will no longer be financially viable to run. So this will mean more and more consumers will be charged to get cash out.  Link said the effect was expected to be a modest decline in the number of ATMs in areas where they are heavily concentrated but with no diminution in the overall geographical coverage. This will be reviewed annually. Which?\u0027s study found that almost 1,500 machines closed between November last year and April, which it said was a near six-fold increase from a steady rate of fewer than 50 closures a month since 2015. The investigation found that machines in rural communities were at least as badly hit as urban areas - down 2.1% and 2% respectively - across the UK. Which? said such closures would hit rural communities especially hard at a time when bank branch closures were also gaining pace. It said the closures accelerated as operators began to learn of the plans from Link. It has called on the regulator to urgently intervene and halt the cuts until a thorough analysis of the impact on communities is conducted.

But despite forecasters predicting highs of a sweltering 32C, some very unwelcome weather could also be on the way. Thunderstorms, torrential rain, lightning and hail could batter parts of the country on Sunday, the Met Office warns. A yellow \u0027thunderstorm\u0027 warning is currently in place from 6am until 10pm that day for both South West England and Wales. Up to 30-40 mm of rain in an hour could hit, with the possibility of homes and businesses flooding, the weather service says.  The warning comes as tens of thousands of people are expected to flock to beaches across the UK today and tomorrow to enjoy the hot weather. Forecasters say highs of 32C could be seen over the weekend, with most of the country set to enjoy sunny, warm beach weather. Yesterday\u0027s highest temperature - 32.5C (90.5F) - was recorded in Porthmadog, north-west Wales, according to the Met Office. And today, highs of 30C-31C (86F-87.8F) are expected. This compares with average temperatures for the time of year of 17C (62.6F) in the north and 21C (69.8F) in the south, senior forecaster Marco Petagna said.  There\u0027s a lot of fine weather still to come, he said. There will be low cloud to start the day, especially across central and eastern areas of England and Scotland and possibly in Wales. But that will soon burn away through the morning. However, the Met Office has warned of potential heavy showers and thunderstorms across parts of the UK on Sunday. It says on its website: Heavy showers and thunderstorms may affect parts of South West England during Sunday morning, becoming more widespread and also spreading into South Wales by the afternoon.  Thirty to 40 mm of rain in an hour is possible, though the scattered nature of the showers means it is not certain where these higher totals and any impacts may occur. However where surface water flooding or lightning impacts do occur they are likely to be in only a few places rather than across the whole warning area. The greatest chance of impacts is in the afternoon, with the risk decreasing again on Sunday evening. The whole of Devon and Cornwall is covered by the warning, with residents warned to expect flash flooding and possible road closures. There is a small chance that fast flowing or deep floodwater could cause a danger to life, Devon Live reports. Meanwhile, experts say train and bus cancellations are possible as a result of the bad weather.   Thunderstorms which had been brewing over the sea have already made landfall in Spain and are heading north across the country. Over the next 24 hours, the storm cells are expected to sweep across the bay of Biscay before either skirting west to Cornwall and the edge of Devon or moving east to batter the county head on. The first of the storms is set to strike at 2am on Sunday. It comes as the recent hot spell has put a strain on utility companies, which have been pumping millions of litres into their systems. Water companies have asked customers to conserve supplies by not using hosepipes or water sprinklers as the heatwave continues. The first hosepipe ban began in Northern Ireland at 6pm on Friday, and Severn Trent Water has asked people to be careful with their water.

She also enjoyed a ride on the back of a golf buggy and sat on her mum\u0027s lap to watch some of the action. Mike was playing in the England team for the charity cup against a host of other celebrities including Bradley Walsh, Brian McFadden, Ronan Keating and Gethin Jones. The event, which is sponsored by Bulmers, raises money for the Velindre Cancer Centre, which cares for people in South East Wales and beyond.  The Tindalls weren\u0027t the only ones enjoying a day of sport today, and Prince Harry took part in a charity polo match.  His new wife Meghan Markle was in the crowd cheering him on, looking happy and relaxed in a shirt dress, hat and sunglasses.

David Sewell, a real-life \u0027Walter White\u0027, appeared to live a normal life after moving to Udon Thani, Thailand, several years ago. During the day he would visit Buddhist temples, hand out food to the region\u0027s poor, and look after his family\u0027s pet bulldog. But each night, he would disappear in his unassuming grey Honda Civic. The 60-year-old\u0027s Thai wife, Maen, 47, says she thought her husband was simply out drinking with pals when he vanished in the vehicle.  But as it turns out, Sewell was apparently leading a double life dealing drugs to other expats and pensioners in the country, local police say. Cops became suspicious when they saw him acting strangely while parked up on a roadside on Thursday evening with the door open. They walked over to speak with him, but he is said to have panicked. At the time, the retired businessman allegedly had a large bag of cannabis, 80 methamphetamine pills, five bags of crystal meth and seven bags of cocaine on the front passenger seat. Several police cars gave chase at speed for more than six miles, before Sewell ploughed into the back of an 18-wheel truck on a motorway.  He was rushed to hospital but was later pronounced dead. Officers said the drugs were stashed inside empty smartphone boxes. They believe that the Brit, who ran an importing and exporting business, had been regularly selling them to other expats for several years, mimicking the hit TV show Breaking Bad. Police Lieutenant Colonel Pattanawong Janpon, deputy chief of Udon Thani Provincial Police Station, said: \u0027\u0027We saw a car with the driver\u0027s door open and went over to see if there was a problem. We noticed that the driver was a foreigner.  \u0027\u0027He was very surprised when he saw us and panicked. He slammed the door closed and drove away quickly. We knew then that there was something illegal going on so we called for back-up.\u0027\u0027 Lieutenant Colonel Janpon said that several patrol cars joined the chase, before Sewell smashed into the back of a lorry at around 9pm. The police chief added: \u0027\u0027The crash happened at about 21:00. We immediately called for an ambulance. \u0027\u0027The foreigner was removed from the wreckage but his injuries were life-threatening and he died later in hospital.\u0027\u0027 Police contacted Maen, with whom Sewell had one daughter.

This week the Duke of Cambridge became the first royal ever to travel on official business to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. The 36-year-old father of three was so moved by the stories of those he met – especially the suffering endured by youngsters – he even personally rewrote half an official speech to reflect his own feelings. Now the former military pilot has made it his mission to campaign for a “just and lasting peace”. A highly-placed Palace source told the Sunday Mirror that the Duke is determined to solve the region’s long-simmering mutual hostility – a problem which has stumped a series of world leaders.  Before the visit, unsure of how he would be received, he asked aides to brief him closely on the labyrinthine politics that have doomed previous attempts at peace to failure. And as the trip ended he told them: “This is the start of something new. I will forever honour my commitments to the people I have met.” An insider revealed: “The politicians who affect this younger generation’s lives may only be in office for five, 10 or 20 years – but William knows his duty is for life.” Tradition dictates that royals stay neutral rather than entering the political landscape at home or abroad.  But sources say William wants to play a significant role in bringing “peace and prosperity” to the Middle East and intends to use his global platform as a force for good in the region.  His dedication echoes his mother Princess Diana’s work with causes close to her heart over many years, continuing her legacy of helping “forgotten” people. The Duke’s five-day tour of the Middle East was acclaimed by political and religious leaders on both sides as having real potential to be a game-changer. He is seen as the perfect foil for Donald Trump, whose fiery rhetoric and ill-thought-out decision to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem caused huge political uproar, mass protests and violent deaths. In the wake of rioting and hundreds of casualties, it was William’s own decision to give speeches to both sides in the conflict delivering the same message: “Never has hope and reconciliation been more needed”.  The Duke travelled to the strife-torn region without wife Kate, who is on maternity leave following the birth of Prince Louis in April. He had historic meetings with Israeli president Reuven Rivlin, PM Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara in Jerusalem, where he donned a holy skullcap to pray at the Western Wall. Mr Rivlin sent shockwaves round the world when he asked William to deliver a message of peace to his opposite number, President Mahmoud Abbas, when he crossed over the border into Palestine.  Far from shying away from the challenge of bringing the two sides together, William is understood to have told aides he intends to “do what is right”. A royal source said: “The visit had a profound effect on the Duke. “The places he visited, the people he met and the stories he heard have all moved him very deeply.  “He spoke at length to his advisors of how the young people affected by the region’s troubles need hope in order to be able to look forward to a brighter future.  William is a young, intelligent man who is very in tune with the politics of the world. “No one will forget when he told the Palestinian people they have ‘not been forgotten’. “He has often thought about his mother’s legacy and hopes his efforts will now lead a new chapter for future generations to enjoy.” Diana’s campaigns highlighted a range of causes including marginalised men dying of AIDS in East London, ostracised sufferers of leprosy in India and maimed victims of landmines in Angola. During his visit, William is understood to have been so moved by meeting young people in the Ramallah refugee camps that he sat down and changed the bulk of a speech he had prepared that day. He was also touched by a visit to the West Bank refugee camp of Jalazone, where he went to a school and a health centre as children were being vaccinated. The camp, which holds 15,000, suffers from high unemployment and frequent clashes with a nearby Israeli settlement.  William told locals: “I hope that through my being here and understanding the challenges you face, the links of friendship and mutual respect between the Palestinian and British people will grow stronger.” Palestinians want East Jerusalem, captured by Israel along with the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the 1967 war, as the capital of a state they seek to establish in the two territories. In 2005 Israeli troops and settlers pulled out of Gaza, now ruled by Hamas Islamists. Until now it had been British policy not to make official royal visits to the tinderbox region.  But our source said: “William was happy the subject of politics was brought out into the open, as it allowed him to talk freely about the troubles of the Middle East and the quest for peace in the separate states. “The way he was received on the global stage has been very encouraging for him looking forward.” Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, speaking earlier this week, hailed William as “a figurehead for a younger generation”. And one Middle East expert said: “It’s evident Prince William has the will and desire to lead on this issue. The whole world will be behind him to succeed.” During his trip William also paid a visit to neighbouring Jordan and toured the ancient site of Jerash, where his wife Kate was once pictured as a four-year-old. Flying colours after test on world stage By Mirror\u0027s Russell Myers in Jerusalem Not long ago this would have seemed impossible. A member of the royal family – let alone the future King – wading into the Middle East peace process. For someone relatively inexperienced on the global political stage, would it be a test too far? But the naysayers were wrong – and William’s courageous actions will reverberate around the world for years to come. This was history in the making and I was privileged to have a front row seat. My time with the Duke of Cambridge on his tour of the Middle East, the first time a royal has gone to Israel or Occupied Palestine in an official capacity, is one that will live long in the memory. William seemed to grow in stature with every day that passed, every meeting he successfully navigated and every story he was told.

Fatima Begum’s husband was shot then had his throat cut as merciless soldiers torched a village in Myanmar. But that is just the beginning of her horrifying story. She then reveals how babies and children were slaughtered in state- \u0026shysponsored war crimes so awful they are difficult to comprehend. In hushed tones, wary Fatima, 25, tells me: “They threw babies in the air and then slashed them with long knives and machetes. “I saw a dead baby cut into four and then they threw the body parts on to a fire. I saw this happen right in front of me. I was struck dumb, totally speechless. I could not believe what I was seeing. “I know a lot of women from my village whose children were killed this way. They burned some \u0026shychildren whole too.  “The youngest women, the beautiful and unmarried women, about 20 of them, they killed them when they tried to get away. They were put in a line in a clearing and shot.” I meet Fatima at a refugee camp in Kutupalong, near Cox’s Bazar, on Bangladesh’s southern tip. In stifling heat she waits patiently in the rice queue – solely responsible for giving her children food and shelter following her husband’s death at the hands of government troops last month. Fatima is one of 700,000 persecuted Rohingya to cross into Bangladesh since last summer. And she is prepared to speak out in a bid to prompt Britain and the UN to take action against generals who sanctioned the genocide. She wants politicians to stop looking the other away. Cradling her 14-month-old daughter Hasina, Fatima tells of being forced to run for her life, leaving everything behind as flames engulfed her straw-roofed home.  She says: “While I hid in the forest, my husband ran back to our home to get food for the journey ahead. But soldiers were waiting. “First they shot him and then they cut his throat with a machete. They killed at least 30 other men by covering them in petrol and setting them on fire. It was so awful we just kept running for four days across the mountains, without any food.” Every person I meet in sprawling camps on a strip of land near the river that separates Bangladesh and Myanmar – previously called Burma – has fled unimaginable horrors to seek sanctuary. Every word of every testimony is equally grotesque. They paint a vivid picture of a co-ordinated campaign of ethnic cleansing by the Tatmadaw – \u0026shyMyanmar’s forces.  Mass murder, rape and torture have been used in what has been described as the worst act of \u0026shygenocide this century. The intense bloodshed has provoked the fastest movement of people since more than half a million fled Rwanda in 1994. On the banks of the river we meet four Rohingya families who arrived by raft the day before. The mountains they crossed on the side opposite are tantalisingly close. Nazima, 27, and her three children lie sprawled on the mud floor, exhausted and dehydrated. The mother says her husband is still in Myanmar after being pistol-whipped by lurking troops as he clambered on a raft. Snipers pick off those trying to get out, she tells me.  There are only women in the food queue. Thousands of husbands have died in the mountains beyond. With foreign observers prevented from entering its killing fields, aid agencies can only estimate the death toll. I meet 20-year-old Amina sitting on a child’s plastic chair with her son Mohammed, eight months, and daughter Mahia, 18 months. Their canvas shelter, reinforced with the help of British aid agency CAFOD, is one of nearly 800 squeezed into a patch of uneven ground the size of a football pitch. Amina’s tale is remarkable, given she was more than eight months pregnant when she made her escape. “They were stabbing our children with knives, slashing them wildly,” Amina mutters nervously. “They tortured my husband but he managed to get away. I couldn’t run fast because I was heavily pregnant. “Everyone was panicking... we became separated. I carried on by myself. When I was still in jungle, somewhere near the river, I had contractions and I gave birth, on the ground, alone. I was crying. Girls from a village nearby heard me and came to help. They cut the umbilical cord.  “I had been walking for 12 days. I was exhausted, so they helped me and Mohammed get on a canoe.” Unsurprisingly, little Mohammed has been struck by continual health problems, having spent his life in the camp. A severe skin condition affects his entire body and he has a fever. It was many weeks after getting into Bangladesh that Amina was, miraculously, reunited with daughter Mahia. The camp is filled with widows also grieving the loss of their children. Tearful Nur Begum, 30, tells me how her 12-year-old son was shot dead. Nur, who managed to escape with her other children, says: “While we were all sleeping, they poured oil on the straw roofs of our houses and set them on fire.  “We all ran out, terrified, and then they started shooting. My son fell down in front of me. He was dead. We all just had to keep running though. I had to leave his body there.” Despite mounting evidence, Britain has been accused of not standing up to the Myanmar government as it presses for post-Brexit global trade deals. International trade Secretary Liam Fox addressed a forum in London last October aimed at boosting relationships with countries including Myanmar – just two months after the military onslaught against the Rohingya started. Scottish Secretary David Mundell travelled to Myanmar on a trade mission last year. And Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson met the country’s de-facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi in February, but failed to convince her of the full scale of the atrocities committed.

They really are sorely needed.“There were a couple of concerns raised about the roads being put in, but almost all the feedback I’ve heard has been positive.“I’ve heard a lot of people saying they hoped they would get one.“It will secure the site, too, which is good as it’s been used as a bit of a drinking den for teenagers of late. But I really am delighted.”Abertay has already completed similar developments to the east and north of the site, with the brief of creating an array of attractive and affordable homes in the area.In a report included with the application, the firm said the new homes would be a good fit for the area due to its proximity to Charleston Community Centre and nearby shops and schools.Pupils were relocated from Charleston Primary in 2013, joining those from Lochee Primary at the new Camperdown campus.The building was later demolished at a cost of £150,000.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/SNS-15161584-Dundee-UTD-Train.jpg-838x564.jpg ","title":"dundee is football crazy i want to earn my shirt says new united keeper siegrist","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe mix of ambition and expectation is why Benjamin Siegrist jumped at the chance to up sticks and join Dundee United.The giant Swiss keeper wanted to quit Swiss football for a new challenge and believes the Tangerines tick all the boxes.“Obviously the expectations here are high, but I believe it is good to be part of something when expectations are high,” said the 26-year-old, who was an U/17 World Cup winner with Switzerland.“The gaffer is very ambitious and very focused on details as well. I like that about him.“When I knew I was moving, these things were very important to me and that’s why I came here.“The tradition of the club I know and I’ve heard good things about it as well. It should be in the top division and I want to be part of helping the team to go up.”Siegrist confirmed a chat with his team-mate at last club Vaduz, Thomas Konrad, was a big help in him making up his mind to move to Scotland.Where he does disagree with the former Dundee defender is which is the No 1 outfit in his new home city.“I’ve played alongside Thomas for the last two years, so when I did make contact here I called him and asked him about the city.“It’s always good to get some information. He has told me some nice things about the city and he was very complementary about the place.“He tried to tell me the other team was the big one, so I didn’t listen. Obviously he played for them, but it’s all good.“He told me about some derbies but I believe he got sent off in one and did well in others. That’s him.“He did tell me that everyone is football crazy here and, when I arrived in the city myself, I couldn’t believe the stadiums are literally across the road from each other.“It’s good to be in a city where football is really a big thing.”With Slovakian goalie Matej Rakovan also signing up, Siegrist’s first challenge is to claim the No 1 jersey.It’s something he’s up for and believes having two keepers battling for a place in the team will prove a good thing for both men.“You come into a new club and you have to prove yourself. You’ve got to do all you can to earn the shirt. We’ve got to make it as hard as possible for the gaffer to pick one of us.“It’s his decision at the end of the day but I will be putting everything I can into making sure I play.“Everywhere you go you have to have competition. Especially the goalie position, there is only one who can play and, in every time you go, that’s how it is.“It is good to be on your toes, it’s good to have someone pushing you either way, so it makes you train that little bit harder.“It’s a long, tough pre-season and obviously my ambition is to be the No 1 goalkeeper and that’s Matej’s ambition as well. That’s how it should be.”Whether he’s between the sticks or on the bench, his focus is already on what every United fan wants to see – the team getting promotion in the coming season.And after a week working with the new-look squad, he’s feeling optimistic about that.“The main focus of the club is promotion. The first few meetings I had with the gaffer, it’s all about getting promotion.“It’s a hard task, obviously it’s a hard league to get out of, but it’s good to be part of an ambitious club that wants to achieve something.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/AB8U9280.jpg-582x564.jpg ","title":"dundee new boy nathan ralph happy to complete switch but wanted his move sooner","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee new boy Nathan Ralph has revealed if he’d had his way he’d have been at Dens Park at the turn of the year.Back in the January window, the Tele reported the Dark Blues were keen on the left-back after being impressed by his performances at National League South outfit Woking.So, too, were several English league outfits but when he heard there could be a chance to head for the Scottish Premiership, the 25-year-old wanted to jump at it immediately.Rather than take the huff when it didn’t materialise, the former Ipswich Town kid, resolved it would happen this summer.“The thing happened in January when Dundee were interested and I said to my manager at the time, look I want to play higher,” he explained.“I don’t think at the time they were keen on me going, so I just thought if I can get a good season under my belt, hopefully, it will still be there at the end of the season. Thankfully, it was and I’m here now.”Over the past week he’s been getting to know his new team-mates in pre-season training.He’s liked what he’s seen of them and is loving the workouts under his new boss Neil McCann.“I’m enjoying it a lot. The training has been very good. Sometimes you feel you are just running and running during pre-season but, to be fair to the manager, he’s had us doing ball work straight away.“With running as well, of course, but it’s been with the ball and match specific stuff so I am really enjoying it.“You can get that hard work when you have the ball as well and it is important because, at the end of the day, we are footballers.“We need to control the ball and things when we are tired in games, so, to me, it makes perfect sense to be training this way.“And I’ve only been here a few days now but already I’ve been impressed with the players. Technically, and in terms of the morale of the squad, they are very good.”While he wouldn’t claim to be an expert on the Scottish Premiership yet, what he’s already realised is that it’s a good place to be right now.With top English Premier League boss Brendan Rodgers already at Celtic and Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard taking the reins at Rangers, he knows it’s a league that’s being noticed.“I don’t know too much about the Premiership up here yet but what I do know is that it’s a good standard and it’s something I’ve been really looking forward to being a part of.“I’m stepping up and it will be a challenge, for sure, but I don’t think I will be out of my depth and I am looking forward to playing in it.“I’ve been told it’s definitely a good time to be coming to this league. There are a lot of good players and a lot of attention with what’s happened at Rangers.“Even without that it is still a good standard and a top league and this has all the makings of a good season for me.”Fans will got their first chance of a first look at Ralph last night when Dundee’s friendly programme kicked off with the short trip up to Brechin.Having finished playing at Woking back in April, he can’t wait to get back to a game situation.“I’m very keen to get started with the games and I’m looking forward to them, that’s what I came here for.“The Betfred Cup is coming soon but I feel with the fitness work we’ve been doing and, with the friendly games coming, we will be ready for them.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b1f819d44b02-423x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people customer base like a little community","story":"\t\t\t\t\tChoosing what to have for lunch in a bustling city centre can be a task, however, Brodie’s Takeaway has you covered.The blue-fronted shop on Bell Street is often the go-to place to grab a whole range of tasty homemade grub and it is all thanks to Cate and Ron Brodie who opened the shop almost 14 years ago.Cate said: “We already owned Brodie’s Coffee Shop in Forfar and we wanted to branch out and open another shop.“The premises we are in were already a takeaway when we took over.”After three years of running both businesses the couple decided to sell the coffee shop and focus on their Dundee business and their two children.Cate said: “We found with running two businesses and having two kids that we were just too widespread between the shops and we decided to sell the coffee shop.“It was a really hard decision to make, but with business you have to either go really big and hire managers or stay small and in control so that is what we have done.“It has also allowed us to get our weekends back to spend with our children.”Now the takeaway is thriving with masses of hungry locals heading in five days a week for the huge range of homemade food on offer.Cate appreciates though that the shop is in an ideal location with the High School of Dundee, Abertay University and the DC Thomson offices in close proximity and full of willing customers.“We have a huge amount of regulars now from all the local businesses.“The shop is now like a meeting point with everyone like a little community and we all know each other.“I also like to introduce people to each other while they are waiting in the queues for their food.“It is a way for them to network and meet new people and it’s also great for me getting to know everyone who comes in.”Now after more than a decade the owner couldn’t imagine not having the takeaway shop.“Although it is very hard work with my days lasting easily 12 hours and starting between 5-6am, I couldn’t imagine myself not having Brodie’s.“People may think it is easy, but there is a lot of work that goes on in the background that customers don’t see.Whatever you fancy to eat Brodie’s is more than likely to have it with an extensive menu ranging from homemade soups, sandwiches and burgers to daily specials including chicken curry and stovies, there is something for everyone.But owner Cate says it wouldn’t be possible without her three employees and her 81-year-old dad, Gordon Bruce.She said: “My dad is basically on call whenever we need him.

Stuart has done both during his time there.”Armstrong added: “Southampton seems a really good fit for me. Watching from afar, I really enjoy the attractive football that they play and I’m very happy to be here.“Every season, I put demands on myself to create and score goals. I hope going forwards from here that it will be the same this term at St Mary’s.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ex dundee united coach ian cathro teams up with former boss at wolves","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Hearts boss Ian Cathro has been appointed first-team coach of Premier League newcomers Wolves.Dundonian Cathro, who spent eight months at Tynecastle, was Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo’s assistant at Rio Ave in 2012 and at Valencia.The pair met on a Scottish Football Association coaching course in 2009.“I am very excited about joining Wolves and looking forward to working with a coach and staff I know, trust and believe in,” said Cathro.“All of us share the same footballing philosophy and that is such an important factor for a successful coaching team.“Wolves is a fantastic club with a rich history and lots of potential, and I can’t wait to get started.”Cathro, who began his coaching career at Dundee United, has also been assistant boss at Newcastle and met the Wolves squad on Wednesday.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b35efb001e13.jpg ","title":"fifty dogs join in fun at local hawaiian beach party","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAloha there!

It was my first real job in coaching and their academy was doing well but the club got relegated to the Conference and couldn’t afford to run their academy.“It’s a big outlay and, unfortunately, it folded and jobs went with it. I would have loved to have stayed, it was a great job and I had an excellent lifestyle.“The job wasn’t there so I came back up the road and there wasn’t much happening. I applied for jobs and I got close to a couple.“I ended up doing a bit of labouring and it was great, it was the best thing for me. I kept myself busy.“I was taking down cabins, near St Andrews funnily enough, and then building. I’d never had any experience of it but enjoyed it. Every day was different and the guys were brilliant. A lot of good people – I still keep in touch.“I always appreciated what I had as a footballer but sometimes you need to go out of it and get back in just to be reminded what you have.“So getting out for a bit was good, it got my appetite back without me realising I’d lost it. And just doing something different, seeing another side of life, meant I learned a lot.”His return to football came at Raith where an excellent record with the youths sparked interest from others.Determined to repay the faith Raith showed in him, he rebuffed the chance of a quick move but when United came calling he admits his affection for the place where his career started made it an offer he couldn’t refuse.“I enjoyed Raith, there were good people, a good club and it was tough to leave but I couldn’t turn this job down.“This is a big responsibility because United have produced some great players over the years. There’s a lot of good players come through and a lot of good people looked after the kids here, so there’s a lot to live up to. I was lucky to work with a lot of those people.”In recent years, the conveyor belt of young talent at Tannadice has slowed but Craig’s confident, along with assistant Scott Robertson, talent will flow.That’s in no small part because the mechanism required to produce players is still in place.“We know how important it is to keep bringing players through at this football club and there is talent here.“There is so much that goes on before us to get it to the stage where we take the players. It’s not about us, it’s about everything that goes before that to get them to the point where Scott and I take them.“Brian Grant (academy head) is on top of that and making it better all the time. It’s about us then doing the extra wee bit to take them to the first team.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b35eff05a3fe-846x564.jpg ","title":"gulls are going nowhere bird expert says dundonians should learn to live with noisy neighbours","story":"\t\t\t\t\tEverywhere you look, our noisy urban neighbours are raking in bins – and even attacking unsuspecting pedestrians in a bid to steal their lunch.But according to one expert, the much-maligned gull is going nowhere in a hurry.Peter Rock, one of the leading authorities on urban gulls in Europe, said there is “no chance” that the gulls will return to less densely populated areas – regardless of any measures Dundee City Council puts in place to reduce their numbers.After studying the species for 38 years, Mr Rock dismissed claims the birds are congregating in the city to gorge on people’s rubbish.And he also said claims they are becoming more aggressive after feasting on human food are untrue.He said: “Despite the fact that so many people hate gulls, you’d be surprised to know how many people are actually feeding them.“Even if you stopped people feeding them, it’s going to make no difference – they are totally adept at finding food.“There are ways of curbing the problem, by removing eggs from nests. I’m sure the local council is aware of this and it would cost thousands of pounds.“This would need to be carried out for at least 10 years and even then, you wouldn’t visibly notice a big drop in the population.“I’m afraid to say you’ve got urban gulls and you’re not going to get rid of them. You may – with a great deal of expense – reduce the population slightly over time. But there is maybe a case to start embracing them.“Down at Bristol City Football Club, the team has celebrated the fact they share the city with their neighbours with a gull painted on one of the stands.”But some residents said many Dundee streets have such a problem with gulls they look like a scene from Jurassic Park.German Doner Kebab manager, Michael Dobson, 29, reckons the problem is largely man-made.He said: “I understand the council needs to look at other measures. There needs to be more awareness to stop feeding them. The residential bins are a nightmare – in the street you see gulls feasting on the rubbish.”Charlene Hutchison, 33, a supervisor at German Doner Kebab, said she is “terrified” to walk down Reform Street.She added: “If I’m on a day off I won’t walk down the street. My niece got attacked when she was only seven.”Heather Davidson, 40, from Broughty Ferry, said in her area the problem is just as bad.She said: “These birds are so big now it’s like a scene from Jurassic Park.”Taffy Barrington, 50, from the city centre, said the gull’s had become “fearless”. He said: “A couple of Saturdays ago I actually saw gulls scrapping over a pizza.“They are completely fearless of cars as well now.”A Dundee City Council spokeswoman said: “We know that gulls can often be a cause for considerable distress and annoyance and we continually pursue tried and tested as well as innovative solutions to the problems that arise from these birds.“We are proactive in improving the waste disposal facilities in and around the city centre. Bins have been provided in many areas where previously waste bags were placed on the footpaths and became magnets for gulls.“Routine monitoring of this situation ensures that problem areas are swiftly identified to enable further action to be taken. We would also ask that people do not feed seagulls as this exacerbates the problem.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b35ef77343e9-375x564.jpg ","title":"its the penguin parade colourful trail goes live across dundee and tayside","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPenguins are popping up across Dundee and Tayside as part of a much-anticipated charity trail.And now, all 80 giant fibreglass birds which make up the Maggie’s Penguin Parade are in place.The colourfully decorated penguin sculptures will be displayed in the city and beyond over the summer, with families being challenged to locate them all.Each 5ft bird has been uniquely designed in aid of cancer charity Maggie’s, by artists who have taken inspiration from topics including footballers and the history of Dundee.The penguin parade is a partnership event between Maggie’s Dundee and Wild in Art.Maggie’s Dundee fundraising manager Annie Long said: “It’s wonderful to have our penguins in place and ready to be enjoyed by people from across the Dundee area and hopefully far beyond.”Famous names such as Judy Murray, Simple Minds and Lorraine Kelly have been involved in designing or sponsoring a penguin.Artist Tom Harris-Ward customised his penguin, located at Verdant Works, by adding a piece of wood from the RRS Discovery.Abertay University students have also been involved in the initiative after collaborating with Maggie’s to develop an app for the “Maggie and Fleur” penguin positioned outside Abertay University Library.Director of Wild in Art, Charlie Langhorne, said: “Maggie’s Penguin Parade is a celebration of creativity and of Dundee.The whole Maggie’s team is to be congratulated on such a fantastic spectacle that will bring a smile to the many thousands of people who will come and enjoy the trail.Now ‘waddle on’ and do the Penguin Parade.”More than 70,000 people took part in the city’s previous trail featuring Oor Wullie, in aid of the Archie Foundation.Funds from the penguin parade will help towards the cost of running the Maggie’s centre based at Ninewells.

However, alongside the honour was a large fee.Hannah said: “The world championships is the highlight of the year.“It was great they offered me the place, but there was a lot of money that I needed to come up with pretty quickly to ensure I could go.”Hannah began to fund- raise and was taken on as the first paracyclist on able-bodied team Storey Racing.It was through the team that a crowd- funding page was created.Hannah’s target was £1,500 with a stretched target of £5,000 if they surpassed the first.They have now reached both, with the extra target allowing Storey Racing to fund other girls in the team if they were ever in the same position.Hannah added: “Cycling is an expression of myself, it makes my life make sense.“It was at university in Dundee when I was completing my undergraduate degree that I fell in love with the sport and it allowed me to move in a way I had never experienced.“I wish it wasn’t about money as I just want to race – that is all I want to do.“I want to say thank you to everyone who has donated to allow me to compete.”Hannah came fifth in both her paralympic races and she will race in the World Road Championships in July.\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"adorable-moment-young-boy-realises-animals-go-into-meat-and-turns-vegetarian","story":"                          THIS adorable video shows the moment a five-year-old boy realises that animals are turned into meat - and instantly turns vegetarian."},{"url":null,"title":"friendsfest-glasgow-first-look-at-the-full-scale-sets","story":"                          THESE images show what Friends fans can expect when the massive UK tour of the hit comedy show hits Glasgow in a month\u0027 time."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7981581.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glasgow-city-council-blasted-for-refusing-to-provide-bottled-water-on-hottest-day-on-record","story":"                          A TRADE union has hit out at Glasgow City Council for failing to provide water for workers in searing heat."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7232701.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"summer-cold-symptoms-and-how-to-treat-them","story":"                          Despite the warm weather many people are suffering summer colds.

special this year because at ARGH\u0027s request the Autistic Pride Day flag was flown at the Scottish Government HQ, St Andrews House in Edinburgh,\" she said.Mrs Brook believes that it is a day of celebration and a chance for autistic people to show they are proud of who they are.She added: \"It\u0027s also a show of defiance to those who would rather we were ashamed, quiet, or forgotten.\"The group were supported by Tesco who provided craft materials, Ashers bakery who provided a celebration cake and Strathspey Railway who donated a family ticket for the quiz prize.Special speakers

care \u0026ndash is being proposed by a newly appointed champion.After months of stinging criticism over its treatment of people with autism NHS Highland has appointed occupational therapist Arlene Johnstone to be its first head of service for learning disabilities and autism.The health board faced a storm of criticism over its decision to withdraw a \u0026pound23,000 grant for the Highland One Stop Shop (HOSS) autism support service last year and it was subsequently criticised by autism expert Dr Sue Fletcher-Watson, of Edinburgh University\u0027s Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, regarding an equality impact document that showed \"total ignorance\".Ms Johnstone says she is now keen to move on from the past, bringing a determinedly inclusive approach to her work.Acting as an advocate within the health service for autistic people and those with learning disabilities has already seen her challenging NHS colleagues drawing up policy in a range of areas to make sure their needs are properly considered.Beyond what is happening internally within the NHS she says she is also keen to reach out to partners in both the third sector and business.\"I think it is easy to say \u0027the NHS has to change\u0027 and there are things we have to change, absolutely, but there is also lots of things that have to change outside of the health service and the social care world,\" she said.Listing banks, bus companies, cafes and shopping centres as the kinds of private organisations she would like to talk to about boosting their autism-friendly credentials she added: \"I think it is crucial, because most people\u0027s quality of life is not about when they visit the GP it is when they go out with their pals socialising.\"A spokeswoman for Autism Rights Group Highland has given a cautious welcome to Ms Johnstone\u0027s appointment, saying the group knows her well and is eager to find out more about her role.Ms Johnstone is happy to hear from anyone with concerns or

Israeli medical technology firm Insightec has had the blessing of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) which advises British health authorities.Essential tremor (ET) and similar conditions impact people\u0027s ability to perform everyday tasks due to uncontrollable shaking.Sufferers treated at St Mary\u0027s Hospital in London have experienced substantial improvement after access to the equipment, according to senior surgeons.The machine enables ultrasound waves to pass through the skull to the part of the brain responsible for the tremor.Due to the incision-less nature of focused ultrasound, there is no risk of infection and patients recover quickly.Mary Ramsay (61), a lifelong ET sufferer, has had to travel 450 miles to Newcastle \u0026ndash but for an alternative and invasive treatment. No other relevant technology was available anywhere in Scotland.Her case sparked a recent debate in the Scottish Parliament in support of her campaign for specialist equipment nearer home.She said: \"I\u0027m highly delighted.

I’m not going to leave anything.“With the budget we’re going to try to spend it and get the best level of players in.”Despite already landing three midfielders in the window McInnes had remained keen to sign Hibs’ Scotland international McGeouch.However, sources indicate Sunderland are confident of bagging McGeouch before they leave for their training camp in Portugal early next week.The 25-year-old travelled to the Stadium of Light for talks last week and the Black Cats are confident of pushing a deal through.It is understood McGeouch is keen on a move south of the border.Rangers, Fulham, QPR, Blackburn and Coventry City were also keen on securing the midfielder.Aberdeen signings Forrester, Gleeson and Ferguson were today set to make their debuts against Cobh Ramblers.Centre-back Mikey Devlin, who signed for the Reds in January, is also set to make his long-awaited debut.Defender Devlin has been ruled out for more than a year having suffered cruciate ligament damage in May 2017.The friendly will be played at the Reds’ Fota Island Resort training complex on the outskirts of Cork, Republic of Ireland.It is the first step in a series of friendlies that will culminate in a clash with West Brom on July 20 before the Battle of Britain with Burnley.McInnes said: “When we were drawn against Siroki Brijeg in the second qualifying round last year I felt we were undercooked a bit.“So this year, even before we drew Burnley, we decided to get more games in.“Now we know we’re playing against a team from the English Premier League, those extra matches are a necessity.”Aberdeen have exited at the third qualifying round stage of the Europa League in four straight seasons.

Now that they are back in I am sure they will feel an obligation and that excitement about it.“It is a competition I wouldn’t imagine Burnley will take lightly.“The Europa League is a competition a lot of English teams think they can do well in as Manchester United won it in 2017 and Arsenal reached the semis this year.“Burnley are a team that have done fantastically well in recent seasons.“For them to finish just outside that big top six in the English Premier League is a fantastic effort.“They will be excited for the European adventure.“Facing an English Premier League team is as tough a game as we could have at this stage.“Burnley were the stand-out team in our pot during the draw and the most difficult one.”European football normally means overseas scouting missions for the Dons to get the lowdown on their opponent.That will not be needed this time although the Reds could yet have someone travel back across to Ireland next week as Burnley face Cork City in a friendly on Friday.Mcinnes said: “Rather than talking about some obscure team and trying to say how good they are we are well aware of the strength of Burnley.“It is different from our European experience of recent years but there is still that excitement nevertheless.“We are very proud that we have qualified for Europe for five years in a row and we want to do well.“It is clear we have a really tough task ahead of us but one we will be ready for.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"artists japan project set to peak interest in cairngorms","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA north-east artist will travel to Japan to compare its famous Mount Fuji with the Cairngorms as part of a project.Julie-Ann Simpson, originally of Sheddocksley, is currently preparing for a two-month residency in Kofu City, where she plans to explore how residents interact with the natural landscape.Through her painting, she hopes to draw potential parallels between Kofu and Aberdeen’s proximity to mountainous regions.The 25-year-old will stay at AIR-Y – Artist in Residence Yamanashi – an artist-run space during her self-funded stay.Julie-Ann, who previously attended Hazlehead Academy before studying at Robert Gordon University’s Gray’s School of Art, hopes to gather research for a wider collection of work based on her time abroad, looking at human experience and nature.She said: “The location of Kofu is interesting to me as it is located in a basin surrounded by mountains, the most iconic of which is Mount Fuji.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This is the same distance Mark averaged every day during his epic cycle round the world in 80 days last year.In other words the team of 80 intrepid cyclists will pedal the equivalent of Mark’s incredible feat – taking them around the world in a day.Participants are asked to raise a minimum of £240 each for the STV Children’s Appeal, which supports children and young people affected by poverty in Scotland, with the hope of raising as much as £80,000 for the charity.Mark said: \u0026#8216This stunning route from Argyll to Aberdeen was my last 16-hour training ride before I set out on the world challenge and it holds fond memories \u0026#8211 but it is very long and very hilly, so I’ll be impressed by everyone who signs up for this epic day of endurance.\u0026#8216The STV Children’s Appeal has gone from strength from strength, supporting so many brilliant charities and causes across Scotland. The last time I crossed Scotland for the appeal I was swimming and running, so cycling has to be easier… right?\u0026#8217He added: \u0026#8216Thanks to everyone who gets involved and I look forward to riding with you.\u0026#8217Mari Slavin of the STV Children’s Appeal said: \u0026#8216Mark is a fantastic ambassador for the Appeal and we are all in awe of the gigantic challenge he’s about to take on, together with cyclists from across the country. STV’s cameras will be there – and trying hard to keep up! – to capture the highs and lows of this incredible marathon venture\u0026#8217After a 4am start in Argyll, Mark’s 240-mile cycle route will pass through Tarbert, Ardrishaig, Lochgilphead, Inveraray, Tyndrum, Crainlarich, Killin, Aberfeldy, Pitlochry, Glenshee, Braemar, Ballater and Peterculter \u0026#8211 among many other towns and villages \u0026#8211 before finishing in Aberdeen.If you think you’re up for this epic feat of endurance, get in touch with Mark on aroundtheworld@thehunterfoundationA corporate offer is also available with four-person relay teams invited to enter for a minimum donation of £5,000.Can’t face the cycle but still want to be involved?

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

Sheryl is a Lochgilphead woman \u0026#8211 middle-aged, celibate without choice and with plummeting self-confidence and a loathing for her body shape. Belly dancing appears to let Sheryl, and Kerrie, rediscover a love of their own body.\u0026#8216You’re using parts of your body, probably out of commission for a while, like the pelvis and it makes a part of the body, you’re maybe not keen on, sexy.\u0026#8217The female characters in the book get up to what loud ladies in a small town would enjoy gossip and drama.\u0026#8216There is an element of bitchiness about it, which I exaggerated in the book. Or maybe it was just me that was bitching.\u0026#8217But two books later in the series, Kerrie is changing direction. Her new book, Rebel Without A Clue, is a sci-fi dystopian novel about a male alien from a female-dominated planet landing in Glasgow.\u0026#8216There’s actually not a lot of sex in my books,\u0026#8217 says Kerrie. \u0026#8216Except maybe nobody having any.\u0026#8217The story starts out as a reversal of The Handmaid’s Tale, with women of this planet no longer needing men to reproduce and evolves, through a plot described as \u0026#8216mad\u0026#8217, into an outsiders perspective of Glasgow.\u0026#8216The male alien Legless goes down to earth and goes around fertilising all these women, and doesn’t understand this world where he’s in charge.\u0026#8216Most of the time I was the only woman living in a culture different from my own. I began to see stories in outsiders.\u0026#8217Being an Australian in Scotland \u0026#8211 and on top of that marrying into a Bangladeshi family \u0026#8211 would give that outlook, of everything being familiar but just off a little. The language is the same, with the accents different. The rural community is the same, only with less terrifying monsters to deal with in Argyll. This is the outlook Legless finds himself in as a dominated man in a world of dominant men.Such an off-the-wall plot with no clear message makes the book an ink blot test \u0026#8211 you take what you’re looking for from it. Maybe you even see something else with another look.Kerrie explained: \u0026#8216Originally I wanted it to be all humour. I suppose I’m driven about power and control and it’s really fascinating when you start to think about it because people dominate in quite small ways.\u0026#8217So maybe the point was to gain the women’s perspective for men to relate to?Kerrie is currently working on her fifth book, the sequel to her dystopian sci-fi named Rebel Without A Bra, and she will keep belly dancing around Lochgilphead.\u0026#8216At the beginning you just write, and you just open up your mind and stuff comes out and you’ll find that all this stuff comes out that you didn’t realise you were thinking about.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"its gonna be a close shave gavin","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 29/06/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIt\u0026#8217s been eight months in the making, but it\u0026#8217s getting hairy now.The razors, however, will soon sort that out for Gavin Allan.He has been growing his flowing locks and bushy beard since October last year, but Gavin will be shorn for charity on Saturday June 30.Gavin\u0026#8217s head and beard shave is being carried out in aid of Motor Neurone Disease (MND) research and the Doddie Weir Foundation.Former Scottish rugby international lock forward Doddie Weir revealed in June 2017 he was suffering from MND, a degenerative condition affecting the nerves in the brain and spinal cord that tell your muscles what to do.

Would you know who most at risk is, how to protect the area or whether you should remove the helmet of a downed rider?Following the success of the Biker Down courses last year in Oban Community Fire Station, new dates have been set for this summerTwo free sessions will be held in Inveraray Community Fire Station on July 8 and August 26 .As many bikers ride in pairs or in groups, it is often the case that the first person on scene following a collision involving a motorcycle will be a fellow biker.Actions taken in the first few moments after an accident can be crucial in minimising injuries and can make a real difference to the lives of those involved. But there can be some uncertainty about what to do in these situations.Training motorcyclists in how to deal with a casualty can save lives and Biker Down courses include ways of keeping the scene safe, first aid appropriate to common types of injury and the issues of safely removing a helmet.The course \u0026#8211 aimed at motorcyclists of all ages and experience \u0026#8211 uses the expertise of the emergency services to prepare motorcyclists should the worst happen on the roads. Biker Down is not about lecturing riders on the consequences of things going wrong – it is about equipping them to make a difference if they encounter an emergency.The course will show you:How to manage the scene of a bike crash, using the same principles the Fire Service uses. We will show you how to protect yourself and others, how to prioritise your actions, how to collect information for the emergency services and how to make use of the resources you have available to you, including other people.Ways of taking care of a casualty, including basic life support and the why, when and how of removing a crash helmet.What may work (or not work) when it comes to making yourself more visible to other road users. You will also learn about how people look for and recognise objects and how you can help to make sure that other road users see you.Scottish Fire and Rescue Service’s group manager for Argyll and Bute, Stuart McLean said: \u0026#8216Firefighters are frequently called to the scene of collisions and when a report comes through of one involving a biker there’s always great concern.

Road users will be sent on the usual lengthy diversion via the A819, A85 and the A82, though access will be maintained  for emergency vehicles.Following completion of the surfacing, further minor construction works to complete the project will take place ahead of the A83 opening to both lanes again later in July.Eddie Ross, of trunk road management company BEAR Scotland, said: \u0026#8216We thank motorists and the local community for their continued patience while teams work to complete the project.\u0026#8217\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"council pays formal tribute to islays ww100 group","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 2:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowArgyll and Bute Council has formally recognised Islay’s ambitious programme of events commemorating two World War One tragedies off the coast of the island.Council members thanked Islay\u0026#8217s WW100 committee for providing an inspirational programme of events to commemorate the centenary of the sinking of SS Tuscania and the collision of HMS Otranto, which took place off the shores of Islay during the Great War.At a meeting of the full council this week members paid tribute to the group for their part in organising the national remembrance events, honouring those who lost their lives in the incidents, and providing a lasting legacy for the local community.Provost of Argyll and Bute, Len Scoullar said: \u0026#8216The WW100 group both national and local must be congratulated for arranging such a well-organised series of events to honour and pay respect to those who lost their lives in these tragedies, and commemorate the people of Islay who were involved in the response to the incidents.\u0026#8216The island really came together, engaging young and old, showcasing resilience, compassion and kindness.

In the Hampshire Down show ring Janet took second with her two shear senior stock ram. There were two third places \u0026#8211 for an aged ewe and a ewe lamb \u0026#8211 and a sixth for a gimmer. The star of the show for Brian and Janet, however, was a home-bred ewe which took first prize in her class and was reserve female champion.Campbeltown\u0026#8217s John MacLachlan was there showing Blue Faced Leicester sheep for J\u0026ampM Turner, Killdalloig with the help of Gavin Semple and Scott Thomason.He came home with a first place and reserve male champion rosette for his tup lamb, sired by Mossvale Masterplan (AI) from a mother out of a Hazelwood ewe.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s the first time out for this lamb, said John, and this is the first time I\u0026#8217ve won with a male at the Highland Show, it\u0026#8217s normally females we do well with.\u0026#8217Kildalloig also secured sixth places for their tup and ewe lamb and fourth for a shearling tup.In the coloured Bluefaced Leicester ring, Lochgoilhead\u0026#8217s Andrew Campbell came second with a tup lamb and sixth with his ewe. Andrew also secured a fourth prize in the Scotch Mules with his ewe.From Heylipol on Tiree, Alasdair MacLean did well in the Beltex section, taking home to the island second prizes for his shearling tup, shearling ewe and ewe lamb.Among the cattle lines, R\u0026ampP McAlister from Bute were handed a third place rosette with Langalbuinoch Kojack in the beef shorthorn class for bulls born in 2016.The Highland cattle classes have been an area where Argyll breeders have historically done well at the show. This year Queenie Strickland\u0026#8217s Cladich fold from the banks of Loch Awe \u0026#8211 brought out by farm manager Stuart Campbell \u0026#8211  took home a second prize with one-year-old heifer Princess Mairi 4th of Cladich.

Their three-year-old heifer Kirsty 2 of Gartocharn, by Brogach 1 of Balmoral and out of Kirsty Morag of Ubhaidh, won her class and also secured the reserve overall female title. The McKechnies also took home a second for a home-bred cow and her February-born calf.Catherine said afterwards: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s satisfying when you come to the show with two beasts and they go home with red and blue tickets \u0026#8211 and a reserve female champion \u0026#8211 so we can\u0026#8217t ask for much more.\u0026#8217The majestic heavy horse classes are a sight to behold, and there was a prize for a Clydesdale which has won both Kintyre and Mid Argyll shows in recent years.

Collapsing ceilings and water leakage have led to a further deterioration in the fabric of the Victorian pile.  Now it is understood South Ayrshire Council bosses want to step in before it is too late. It is believed a last minute paper may go before councillors at full council in County Buildings on Thursday. The paper would ask politicians to approve the repair work. The council slapped a Dangerous Building Notice on the hotel in March, which gave the owners 21 days to respond. There are fears Ayr train station could end up shut if no action is taken. And it has been slammed a risk to the public. The Post revealed earlier this month how the hotel has been bought by new Malaysian owners from Eng Huat Ung.  Station Hotel Action Group founder Esther Clark believes the hotel could be turned into a community centre and accomodation. She said it should be “split up and dispersed” but must generate an income. She has uncovered research, which reveals the hotel was built to a “high standard” with luxurious materials. One idea mooted by Ayr Renaissance is for a part of the building to be demolished and a new train station built. Others folk have called for the council to adopt the landmark for offices. It was hoped a big hotel group would step in and carry out refurbishment but it has failed to attract interest so far. Network Rail carried out scaffolding work on the building to safeguard the operation of the station and line in 2015. The hotel, a Grade 2 listed building, has remained shut since it closed suddenly in 2013. Glasgow and South-Western Railway Company built the hotel, designed in the style of a French chateau, at a cost of \u0026pound50,000.

It is the latest diversification at Corton Farm, just outside Ayr. Customers can buy a litre glass bottle for \u0026pound2 and use it again and again at the milk machine. And farmer Alison Kerr said: “You cannot get any fresher. “We’re really hoping it catches on so we can sell more and more directly to local people.” The Kerrs – five generations at Corton since 1925 – have constructed The Milk Hoose and the Milkbot vending machines providing “untampered, non-homogenised” milk from the Corton herd.  Customers on Friday gushed praise on the creamy taste, saying it is nothing like mass-produced products. The Kerrs are charging \u0026pound1.50 per litre and say it cuts out plastic waste from supermarket bottles. Although it is more expensive than supermarket pricing, they say their milk compares favourably to speciality gold top products. Willie and Alison, both 46, have been joined working the farm by son David,19, and are being helped by daughter Joanne,16, when she is not at Belmont Academy. Willie said: “It would be a dream to sell every litre we produce right here. “But we have had a great start and it has been so well received.” The farm produces between 5000 and 6000 litres of milk a day, depending on the time of year.  That is courtesy of the 220 Friesian-Holstein milkers. The Kerrs own 260 acres and rent another 250. Fourteen years ago they expanded into the Corton Plants nursery and 14 months ago the Coo Shed coffee shop. But Alison said: “The Milkbot really completes the story of selling your own product. “We siphon off what we need into churns to be pasteurised and it is put into the Milkbot. “I guarantee it tastes completely different as all the fats and proteins have not been stripped out. “It is non-homogenised and the cream settles on top like the the old-fashioned milk.” At the moment it is thought only three farms in Scotland are selling direct via a vending machine.  Alison added: “People now are so detached from where the food comes from and I think supermarkets are to blame for that. “Some kids think milk comes from a bottle in a supermarket. “Plastic has just become a huge issue and it has been good timing for us. “People are loving our branded glass bottles.” Peak time for the new vended milk is between 5pm and 7pm and there can be 20 cars in the car park at a time with people leaving work keen to top up their supply. Alison added: “Hopefully this continues to grow. Milk is sold too cheaply in supermarkets and farmers have been down-trodden for a long time. “We have just had to take what we can get and be paid sub-30p a litre. At the moment the Milkbot is doing a couple of hundred litres a day so we have a long way to go to reach 5000 a day.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"holiday goer caused ruckus prestwick","story":"NewsHoliday-goer caused ruckus at Prestwick AirportIan Graham acted in an aggressive and intimidating manner towards Steven Ringtoul, and made threats of violence in the presence of children.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post16:00, 28 JUN 2018NewsAyr Sheriff Court (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA holidaygoer who caused a ruckus at Prestwick Airport has been fined.

And one glance around a packed Troon Town Hall said everything about the young woman Vanessa Riddle had become. Her impact was deep, her reach was far. “Vanessa would wonder why everyone was here for her,” said dad Chris. “That’s just the kind of person she was.” Friends, family, school pals and members of the community all touched by Vanessa’s courage joined for the special service.  Her battle with neuroblastoma had been one that ensured she will never be forgotten by all lucky enough to know her. Speaking to more than 400 people at her memorial service, Chris said: “She lit up our world. “And in her short life, she packed in so much happiness. “Vanessa was a thrillseeker with a soft side – great with old and young alike. “She had the Midas touch.” And he added: “No words can describe how utterly proud we are to have been your father, mother and sister.  “This is not the end for you, you have now moved on to something new.” The emotional speech came as the Town Hall paid tribute to Vanessa, of Loans, who lost her brave battle just days short of her 18th birthday. Some of Vanessa’s closest childhood friends took their feet to recount memories of happy times of the girl with a smile for everyone. And Vanessa’s infamous parking skills and ability to make everyone laugh were just two of the themes to strike a chord. Graham Hobson, deputy head at Marr College, was another to speak warmly of an immensely popular pupil. Chris said afterwards: “I thought the speeches were great, especially Vanessa’s friends, who at only 18 spoke so eloquently and passionately about Vanessa - they belied their age doing this.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"united-front-to-boost-the-borderlands","story":"HUNDREDS of stakeholders had their say on proposals to transform the Borderlands economy at a special conference in Dumfries on Monday.\nLeader of Dumfries and Galloway Council, Elaine Murray, welcomed more than 370 business representatives, public sector organisations and individuals to the first Borderlands conference.\nShe said: \u0026ldquoI am delighted that so many people attended on the day, this shows what an important project the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal is.\n\"One attendee described the conference as an \u0026lsquoIlluminating and fantastic event\u0026rsquo, which reflected the enthusiasm I perceived on the day, that this is a once in a generation opportunity which must be seized.\nFive local authorities from north and south of the border are working in partnership to put together a proposal that should have huge implications for those who live, work and visit the area.\nIt was the first opportunity for interested parties to hear about the themes that are being developed to underpin the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal \u0026ndash and to give their views on the major projects they believe would kickstart transformation.\nThe conference was held at a key time for the partnership, made up of Carlisle City, Cumbria County, Dumfries and Galloway, Northumberland County and Scottish Borders Councils.\nResponses from the conference will help the partnership to build a case to present to both the UK and Scottish Governments later this year.

Before that, in December 1828, Peebles Town Council had agreed that if a gas company was set up, it would be allowed to open up and lay pipes in the streets and if that proved successful, it would then have the street lamps lit by gas.\nInitially a site for a gasworks on the Old Town Green (now Greenside) was chosen, but it proved to be unsuitable. A site was found on the area of ground lying to the west of the Parish Church. Today the site is still visible and forms part of the parkland and walkways close to the modern swimming pool.\nOne of the factors which made the development of a gasworks feasible was the great improvement in major roads serving the town following the Turnpike Acts. That allowed coking coal to be brought to the town from the coalfields of Lanarkshire and Midlothian.\nTo begin with gas was produced for only ten months of the year and the street lights were lit for only about a third of the year, during the darkest winter months.\nBy the end of the 19th century, the demand for gas had greatly increased and as well as street lighting, was beginning to be used for household appliances such as gas cookers. In 1898 the assets of the Peebles Gas Company were acquired by the Town Council. Within a few years demand was outstripping supply and in 1905 it was decided to build a new gas works at Eshiels as the existing site, which also served as the council yard, was too restricted to allow for expansion. By then the existence of railways made it possible to import coal directly to the Eshiels site.\nIn 1948 the Town Council starting converting all street lighting to electricity. The gas works at Eshiels became part of the national system and continued in operation until the advent of North Sea gas in the late 1960s.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"were-so-proud-of-him-parents-of-galashiels-scout-with-adhd-hope-to-inspire-others-to-join-group","story":"THE parents of a Galashiels Scout with ADHD hope others will be inspired after the youngster won a prestigious award.\nAfter weeks of working hard to complete an array of challenges and tasks, Blair Valentine took home the Reiver Award at the Gala Scout Group annual general meeting last month.\nThe 10-year-old, who attends St Peter\u0026rsquos Primary School in Galashiels, received the award in recognition of his hard work after being nominated by numerous members of the Scouts.\nProud parents Dave and Mandy now hope their son\u0026rsquos success story will inspire other parents of children with ADHD.\nThe youngster was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in July 2013 at the age of six.\nBlair\u0026rsquos mum Mandy told the Border : \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore so proud of him, Blair has worked very hard to get where he is, and we want others to know that just because a child has ADHD, it shouldn\u0026rsquot hold them back from going on to do great things.\n\u0026ldquoBlair gets especially inspired when hearing that celebrities have the same condition as him.\n\u0026ldquoUntil we looked into it, we had no idea just how many well-known people were also affected by it.

SS took his portion of fish after his family were fed and satisfied.\nLater that same day, SS returned with more fish and he was certainly making up for lost time.\nHe began to feed the youngsters himself while Mrs O was preening.

It was as if they had won the World Cup.\u0026#8216Whole families were out on the streets enjoying the party atmosphere, grannies, parents with their young children, young people who can\u0026#8217t remember a World Cup with Peru in it.\u0026#8216That shows how proud they are to be there.’Despite the countries 1-0 defeat to Denmark in Saransk, Russia, \u0026#8211 in front of 40,000 travelling Peruvian fans, making them one of the best-supported nations at the tournament \u0026#8211 those back home were still kept in good spirits.Michael added: ‘No matter the result the massive street parties were going to continue.It was only 1pm local time and the football was finished, but there were marching bands, thousands of people chanting songs and TV cameras everywhere.‘Peru have at least two more matches to come (against France, at the time of writing, and Australia) and everyone will be back on the streets supporting the national team.‘Deep down the people know this might be a once-in-a-generation experience so they are determined to enjoy it as sport fans, and as proud Peruvians.’Michael Fee, farthest right, girlfriend Carla, second from right, and friends enjoy Peru’s World Cup party.

As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution.

Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"haddington-pub-seeking-new-owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

Across the primary stages, children are committed to and proud of being part of their school community  - The committed staff team, led by the headteacher, work well together in their goal to secure positive outcomes for children. Wellbeing is central to the whole school community and staff provide a nurturing learning environment where children receive effective support.  Areas for improvement were identified and discussed with the headteacher and a representative from East Lothian Council.  They were:  - Increasing the opportunities for children to be more active and independent in their learning  - Continuing to improve attainment, ensuring that the pace and challenge of learning meets the needs of all children  - Continuing to develop the opportunities for leadership at all levels to support the school improvement.

Brave Ruth Quilietti-Bird \u0026ndash who at one point was the most ill person \u0026ldquoin the whole of the UK, according to her husband \u0026ndash moved hospital several times to receive specialist treatment for multiple organ failure, spending her 40th birthday in intensive care rather than on a planned holiday.  She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.

North Berwick\u0026rsquos Law Primary School P6 pupils were looking forward to the trip to Yellowcraig, by Dirleton, where one class was due to camp out tonight (Wednesday) and another tomorrow (Thursday).  Two of the school\u0026rsquos four P6 classes had already taken part in the one-night camp last month.  In total, 54 youngsters were expected to camp out this week.  However, Jill Wareham, the school\u0026rsquos headteacher, contacted parents on Monday to say that a decision had been taken to cancel the overnight stays after \u0026ldquoa group of people camped near the field they use.  The school is still going ahead with the daytime activities planned as part of the camp but asked parents to pick up their children from Yellowcraig at 7pm.  Mrs Wareham told parents in an email: \u0026ldquoYou may be aware that there is a group of people camped near the field at Yellowcraig where we usually hold our camp out. This has various implications for our risk assessments for the trip and, having taken advice from a number of sources, we have decided not to stay overnight at the site this week.  \u0026ldquoWe realise this will be disappointing news and apologise for any inconvenience, but we will look into the possibility of the pupils having a night in tents at another venue after the summer.  The camping trip is usually held in a field on the left of the road leading into the car parks at Yellowcraig.  An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWhile the pupils will be taking part in all of the planned activities, arrangements are being made for them to be picked up at 7pm instead of camping overnight.  \u0026ldquoThis decision has been taken as the school understands there may be a number of people already using the area.

A study is being launched to examine how the six secondary schools could work together to ensure they all start and end at the same time and follow a common timetable.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos cabinet heard that high schools had historically been given considerable autonomy in planning their school days and \u0026ldquocurricular arrangements. But this had resulted in \u0026ldquosix different structures, length of the school day and different levels of access in terms of experience and opportunity. And there was \u0026ldquosignificant variation throughout East Lothian in the range of Advanced Higher and Higher courses offered and the number of qualifications available in S4.  The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes. It\u0026rsquos important that we listen to the views of staff, pupils, parents, carers and other stakeholders.

The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.

It has been confirmed that the much-loved facility for older people will continue as it is in its High Street home.  Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7959839.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"phonebox-removed-from-centre-of-haddington","story":"              A TRADITIONAL red phonebox has been removed from the centre of Haddington after it was used just once in a year.

Residents such as Seona Mason-Chadburn, who lives in Dunbar town centre, contacted the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and Tarmac, which operates Dunbar Cement Plant to the south-east of the town, about the discharge.  She told the Courier how she had attempted to use her window wipers to clear her front windscreen, only to discover the dust.  She said her windscreen felt like \u0026ldquosandpaper and compared the dust to the \u0026ldquobloom on a black grape.

Councillor McMillan said it had been a great honour to be joined by veterans from East Lothian at the flag-raising ceremony which took place on Monday morning.  He told those in attendance: \"Today is an opportunity to recognise the enormous contribution made by service personnel - past and present - and pay tribute to those who very sadly paid the ultimate sacrifice.  \"This November marks a century since the end of the First World War.

He said: \"Women played a significant role in the war effort, taking on work such as farming, transport and munition production, and the perseverance of Suffrage activity subsequently led to women being given the right to vote.  \"For a number of years now women have deservedly been playing a full and active role in our Armed Forces \u0026ndash reflective of the increasingly inclusive society in which we all live and are so keen to protect.\"  Veterans who attended the ceremony on Monday were invited to enjoy refreshments after the event."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7979931.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"scotlands-best-black-pudding-made-in-east-lothian","story":"              A NORTH Berwick-based butcher is celebrating after it was judged the makers of Scotland\u0026rsquos finest black pudding.

The debate during Health Question Time at Holyrood last Wednesday followed a recent public meeting which was organised by East Lothian MP Martin Whitfield and Lothian MSP Kezia Dugdale (both Labour) at the Fisherrow Centre, which attracted more than 200 people.  Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"              VIKTOR Krum, Percy Weasley and Malfoy\u0027s sidekick Goyle are all heading to Musselburgh this summer to join in the fun asHarry Potter\u0027s \u0026lsquoSchool of Witchcraft \u0026amp Wizardry\u0026rsquo arrives in the town.

John told the Courier: \u0026ldquoI have done three previous charity treks for Maggie\u0026rsquos Centres taking me to the Sahara Desert, Peru and the Himalayan Mountain Trek, raising over \u0026pound12,500 for Maggie\u0026rsquos.  \u0026ldquoThis time I am doing it in memory of my mum Sheila Reynolds.  \u0026ldquoMum was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), which causes progressive scarring of the lungs, in 2011 and by the time she was diagnosed the disease had progressed and she was unable to receive medication to slow it down, so was provided with oxygen therapy instead.  \u0026ldquoThe disease progressed quite quickly and Christmas Day 2013 was the last day mum left her home.  \u0026ldquoShe was cared for at home by her family, with close friends, district nurses and Macmillan nurses supporting her as well.  \u0026ldquoHer sister Maisie travelled back and forth from Banbury to spend time and help with caring duties.  \u0026ldquoSince then, Maisie has also been diagnosed with the same illness.  \u0026ldquoOn April, 4, 2014, mum sadly passed away, succumbing to this horrible disease.  \u0026ldquoI am cycling to raise money in her honour to help find a cure for this disease.  The Cuba challenge takes place over six days in October and riders will spend six hours a day on their bicycles as they battle the heat and terrain.  John, of the town\u0026rsquos Gavin\u0026rsquos Lee, has a shirt for each day sponsored by a different local group or business for his adventure.  And he has a charity show in the Store Club in Tranent on Sunday, September 16, hosted by Radio Saltire\u0026rsquos Davie Martin from 1pm to 6pm.  Sponsors signed up for his daily cycling shirts are the Walk with Scott Foundation, Forever Kerry (Kerry Taylor), Ross High Rugby Club, Chris Miller Cleaning Services and Logan Roofing \u0026amp Builders (Tam Logan).  John said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom really grateful for all the support I have received from everyone and hope I can help to raise as much as possible to help this charity and fund vital research.

Sheila Cavers, 60, an English teacher, has spent her entire teaching career of 39 years at the school, having joined the staff in 1979.  Stephen Gellaitry, 61, a modern language teacher, is calling it a day to travel the world after 35 years in the classroom.  Mrs Cavers is principal guidance teacher with Moray house and Mr Gellaitry is principal guidance teacher at Grange house.  The pair were honoured at a celebratory lunch in the school which was attended by colleagues.  In his speech, headteacher Colin Gerrie thanked both for their \u0026ldquolong and committed service to the school and wished them every happiness in their retirement.  Mrs Cavers, who is originally from Kirkcudbright but now lives in East Lothian, said that her 39 years at Musselburgh Grammar were a great example to pupils of \u0026ldquosticking in at school.  She is planning to travel and spend more time in her garden.  Mr Gellaitry, from Edinburgh, added: \u0026ldquoHaving taught at least two generations at Musselburgh, I feel that it is time to move on.  A speaker of nine different languages, he is hoping to travel the world now he has more leisure time.  Each guidance teacher at Musselburgh Grammar cares for about 200 pupils.  Their work involves teaching classes on internet safety, substance abuse, anti-bullying, sexual health, giving assistance to pupils on college and job applications, motivating pupils, showing commitment to pastoral care and welfare of pupils, and liaising with parents over concerns."},{"url":null,"title":"budding-provosts-receive-praise","story":"              YOUNGSTERS from across East Lothian were recognised for their entries to the \u0027If I Were Provost\u0027 competition run by East Lothian Council.  The competition, which asked young people what they would do if they were \u0026lsquoin charge\u0026rsquo, was run by the council as part of the Year of Young People.  About 200 entries were judged by Paralympic star Maria Lyle Celia Hodson, founder of Hey Girls Callum Mark, general manager at Foxlake Adventures Provost John McMillan and Councillor Shamin Akhtar, spokesperson for education and children\u0026rsquos services.  Tranent resident Ilma Ali was the winner of the 8-13-year-old category, while 15-year-old Louise Allan from Haddington won the 14-18-year-old category.  They were announced as the winners at a prizegiving ceremony in Haddington last Friday, where 16 other shortlisted entrants received prizes.  Provost John McMillan said: \u0026ldquoWe were hugely impressed with the quality and range of entries that we received, which ranged from drawings to poems, comic strips to letters.  \"It was clear that everyone had really taken the challenge to heart, and had put a lot of thought and care into their entries.  \u0026ldquoThe judging panel really enjoyed the judging process, even though the task of choosing our winners was a difficult one.  \"I want to thank each and every entrant for taking part and sharing with us your ideas \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos clear that we can all play our part in improving life in East Lothian.

WE ALL know that tadpoles turn into frogs. Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7842455.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"mexicans-set-to-vote-in-countrys-largest-ever-election","story":"              Mexicans are heading to the ballot box in a potentially transformative election that could put in power a firebrand vowing to end business as usual in a country weary of spiralling violence, unchecked corruption and scandal-plagued politicians.  But his rivals warn that a victory by leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador could set the country back decades with an interventionist economic policy and are also promising to fight corruption and bring change to Mexico.  All the candidates are lambasting US president Donald Trump\u0026rsquos policies against migrants and Mexico.  Sunday\u0026rsquos elections for posts at every level of government are Mexico\u0026rsquos largest ever and have become a referendum on corruption and other tricks used to divert taxpayer money to officials\u0026rsquo pockets and empty those of the country\u0026rsquos poor.  It is Mr Lopez Obrador\u0026rsquos third bid for the presidency and some see it as his best shot after 12 years of near-permanent campaigning.  His railing against the \u0026ldquomafia of power that has long ruled Mexico and in favour of the poor appears to be falling on receptive ears with polls showing him with a wide lead over three rivals who have failed to ignite voters\u0026rsquo interest.  \u0026ldquoThe corrupt regime is coming to its end, Mr Lopez Obrador, a 64-year-old commonly known as AMLO, said at his final campaign event on Wednesday. \u0026ldquoWe represent modernity forged from below.  Much of the popular ire has been aimed at unpopular president Enrique Pena Nieto\u0026rsquos Institutional Revolutionary Party.  Its candidate, Jose Antonio Meade, failed to gain traction with voters who would not give him the benefit of the doubt in spite of his ample resume in government and being an outsider to the ruling party.  Ricardo Anaya is the candidate of a right-left coalition. He has tried to harness the youth vote with an emphasis on technology and new ideas, but he divided his own conservative party to take its candidacy and it is unclear if his new allies in the leftist Democratic Revolution Party will actually turn out for someone from the other end of the ideological spectrum.  Juan Carlos Enriquez, 30, said he supports Mr Lopez Obrador but warned him that he better not steal.  \u0026ldquoOf course, I want him to win. But it has to be made clear that he has to deliver what he promises and not become like the rest, he said.  Hovering over the election is the spectre of vote fraud, though electoral officials deny it is a possibility with the modern balloting technology and institutions now in place.  In both of Mr Lopez Obrador\u0026rsquos previous two presidential losses he alleged fraud. In his first loss \u0026mdash by a mere 0.56% to conservative Felipe Calderon in 2006 \u0026mdash his supporters held months-long protests in Mexico City and he referred to himself as \u0026ldquothe legitimate president.  His allies are warning even before Sunday\u0026rsquos presidential vote that there better not be any funny business.  \u0026ldquoThey shouldn\u0026rsquot dare commit a fraud, because if they do they will meet the devil, said Yeidckol Polevnsky, president of Mr Lopez Obrador\u0026rsquos Morena party. \u0026ldquoWe will not accept it."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6511581.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"castlemilk-singing-sensation-gerry-cinnamon-announces-four-glasgow-gig-dates","story":"              CASTLEMILK singing sensation Gerry Cinnamon has announced four Glasgow gig dates.

On Thursday, Glasgow recorded its hottest day since records began as another sweltering day saw the temperature peak at 31.9C (89.4F).  The city beat Wednesday\u0026rsquos high of 31.3C (88.3F) in Aviemore in the Highlands, and came close to matching the hottest June day ever recorded in Scotland - 32.2C (89.9F) at Ochtertyre in Perth and Kinross in 1893.  As tens of thousands of music lovers flock to Glasgow for TRNSMT at Glasgow Green and Fiesta x Fold in Kelvingrove Park, revellers are being urged to stock up on sunscreen and water.  Temperatures in the city will dip slightly, but it will still be warm for the week ahead with plenty of sunshine and temperatures around the 25C mark.  The first hosepipe ban is likely to come into place in Northern Ireland this weekend.  Northern Ireland Water said demand is outstripping supply, leaving them with no option but to bring in the ban in order to save water.  Scottish Water said it is managing supplies across the country and will continue to monitor the situation closely.  Only two localised areas in Scotland have been issued with advice to \u0026ldquouse water wisely - parts of Moray and the Stornoway area of Lewis.  Other parts of the UK have urged water consumers to take simple steps to reduce the amount they use.  Top tips include taking a shorter shower, not leaving the taps running and re-using paddling pool water for plants in the garden.  Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge said: \u0026ldquoWe are going to see a continuation of the current warm spell, but the temperatures over the next few days are not likely to be the warmest of the year so far.  \u0026ldquoI think, for now, temperatures have peaked and we are not expecting to see any records today.  \u0026ldquoWe will begin to have a slightly fresher feel, bringing the temperatures down, not by much, by one or two degrees.  Gritters have been deployed in some areas, spreading crushed rock dust onto melting roads to create a non-stick layer between the surface and vehicles.  Motorists have been advised to use warm soapy water to wash sticky tar from their vehicles.  Some railway tracks have soared to nearly 50C (122F), leading them to expand and bend.  ScotRail customers have seen massive disruption across the Glasgow network for three days now as the railway lines buckle in the hot weather, with many speed restriction in place for train drivers.  The Met Office\u0026rsquos heat-health watch alert has remained at level two all week, meaning social and healthcare services are at the ready to reduce harm from a potential heatwave.  This week is the first time since 2013 all four nations in the UK have seen temperatures of 30C or above, the Met Office said.  The rising temperatures have also come with warnings to be careful near water and in the countryside, where fire crews have been tackling wildfires, including one in Bathgate.  The heat has already claimed casualties.  The family of 13-year-old Ryan Evans, whose body was recovered on Wednesday, two days after he got into difficulty at Westport Lake in Stoke-on-Trent, warned of the dangers of playing and swimming in open water.  They said: \u0026ldquoWe just cannot emphasise enough the dangers of swimming in open water, especially where young children are concerned.  \u0026ldquoOur message is simple: please don\u0027t do it.  A 17-year-old boy was found dead in the River Aire in Leeds in the early hours of Wednesday morning following a search and rescue operation.  It is believed he got into difficulties while swimming on Tuesday evening.  The body of a man was also recovered from a lake in Nutfield, Surrey, on Monday.  The RNLI has urged those heading to the seaside to seek out beaches with a lifeguard.  There is bad news for farmers growing crops and the firefighters and soldiers battling the ongoing incident on Saddleworth Moor in north-west England as no significant rainfall is forecast in the coming days.  Parts of the Moor have been alight for six days, with firefighters saying it could take weeks to extinguish.  A new moorland blaze - on Winter Hill, near Rivington, Lancashire - broke out on Thursday with huge plumes of smoke visible from the area surrounding the moorland.  Firefighters are also still fighting a 500-metre long gorse fire on the Glenshane Pass in County Londonderry, more than 48 hours after it first broke out.

Picking a favourite Scottish album from such a packed field was always going to be a tough task, and so it proved when we asked readers to do just that.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  We were inundated with hundreds of votes from across Scotland, the UK and as far afield as the Netherlands, Sweden and the US, and our quest got folk talking and reminiscing in offices, pubs and on social media, revisiting and celebrating the music that has been the soundtrack to their lives.  So, here we have it: Scotland\u0026rsquos top 10 favourite albums.  10 \u0026ndash Raintown, Deacon Blue, 1987    The band\u0026rsquos debut is packed to the rafters with sheer quality and from beginning to end simply never lets up. Dundonian singer-songwriter Ricky Ross showcased his talent, intent and also a keen political and social awareness across 13 songs, among them Scotland\u0026rsquos other national anthem, Dignity.  9 \u0026ndash High Land, Hard Rain, Aztec Camera, 1983    Could Roddy Frame really only have been 18 when he recorded Oblivious, Walk Out to Winter and We Could Send Letters? East Kilbride\u0026rsquos boy wonder emerges fully formed on this astonishing debut album from 1983, having soaked up the pop, soul and punk influences of his prodigious musical youth and reimagined them as perfectly-crafted jangle-pop. The sound of young Scotland has rarely sounded this fresh.  8 \u0026ndash Strange Kind of Love, Love and Money, 1988    Though Love and Money\u0026rsquos particular brand of literate, glossy soul-pop looked to America for inspiration, lyrics about \u0026ldquoraining on Jocelyn Square were resolutely, affectionately Glaswegian. In another place, another time, Love and Money could have been the biggest band in the world.  7 \u0026ndash If You\u0026rsquore Feeling Sinister, Belle and Sebastian, 1996    Second albums are supposed to be difficult but Belle and Sebastian arguably never surpassed the stunning collection of songs that comprised their sophomore effort, giving a masterclass in how to mix melody, melancholy, nostalgia and humour.  6 \u0026ndash Bandwagonesque, Teenage Fanclub, 1991    The album that thrust Teenage Fanclub into the indie big league. From opening track The Concept to the closing echoes of Is This Music?, it is jam-packed with all the qualities fans have come to love about Bellshill\u0026rsquos finest four-piece: Byrds-influenced, melody-rich songs delivered in an endearing, gently shambolic fashion.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  5 \u0026ndash Heaven Or Las Vegas, The Cocteau Twins, 1990    Elizabeth Fraser\u0026rsquos otherworldly voice set over Robin Guthrie\u0026rsquos ethereal soundtrack is one of Scotland\u0026rsquos greatest musical pleasures and treasures, and this most accessible of Cocteau\u0026rsquos albums is simply awash with blissed-out grandeur. Could they really have been from Grangemouth? Oh yes.  4 \u0026ndash A Walk Across the Rooftops, The Blue Nile, 1984    Sounding nothing like anything else that came out of Scotland, the UK or indeed anywhere else in 1984, this debut fused spare synth precision with exuberant vocal sincerity to stunning effect. Tinseltown in the Rain, that bittersweet slice of cinematic perfection, remains the ultimate ode to Glasgow.  3 \u0026ndash The Midnight Organ Fight, Frightened Rabbit, 2008    Since Scott Hutchison\u0026rsquos untimely death in May, listening to the music he and his bandmates created has been a particularly sad and difficult task. But this album is simply too good to stop listening to. Revisiting is painful but cathartic, and like all of the \u0026nbspHutchison\u0026rsquos work, it makes you feel like it\u0026rsquos okay to be sad.\u0026nbsp  2 \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything, The Trashcan Sinatras, 1993    From post-Smiths jangleism on their debut the Ayrshire gang blossomed to reveal an emotionally rich and enduring marriage of musicality and lyrical nous never before seen within spitting distance of Irvine or anywhere else, crowned by flawless performances by one of Scottish pop\u0026rsquos most devastating singers, Eddi Reader\u0026rsquos younger brother Frank.  1 \u0026ndash Hats, The Blue Nile, 1989    Only seven songs in length, Hats is a masterpiece of love, loss and redemption writ large over a lush, soulful and at times overwhelmingly beautiful soundscape, inseparable from the city of its birth, Glasgow. For more than 25 years it has offered endless inspiration and comfort. \u0026ldquoWhen all the rainy pavements lead to you, sings a heartbroken Paul Buchanan on From a Late Night Train. The rainy pavements of Glasgow will always lead to Hats.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  Here\u0027s what you said about Hats:  Christine Gardner, Rotterdam: Head and shoulders above the rest. A magnificent album that I continue to listen to regularly after almost 30 years. It is quite simply a masterpiece. It continues to draw you in, delight your senses, touch your emotions and somehow mirror your own very personal experiences. And yet it is also essentially Scottish \u0026ndash maybe something to do with our collective psyche, despite all our individual differences.  Martin McCarthy: Hats has so many layers, from dreamy songs like Over the Hillside and Let\u0026rsquos Go Out Tonight to more upbeat songs like Headlights on the Parade and \u0026ldquoThe Downtown Lights.  Saturday Night is just a sublime song, I love the pitch perfect bass, the stunning keyboards and Paul Buchanan\u0027s emotional voice. This was played at our wedding to a full dancefloor and will always be so special. The songs on Hats convey love, beauty, pain and loss, and can push me to tears of utter joy and euphoria.  Alex Watkins: It\u0026rsquos the album I always return to just something about the memories and emotions it always conjures up.  Kevin Jackson: Hats is the best album ever recorded anywhere by anyone. It touches you in a way that others must stand back in awe and adoration of. It is a thing of perfection. When some of the finest innovative talents of our time see it as one of the greatest albums ever, it is because it has no peers.  Peter Morgan: I\u0027m going to plump for Hats, that lush, aching, bruised and battered homage to love and loss.  John Reader: I listen to a lot of music, including lots of new stuff but always have Hats on at some point every week. Still hooks me in with its lush simplicity. I remember saying to someone more than 25 years ago that of all the music around at that time I reckoned I\u0027d be listening to Hats for the rest of my life. Not wrong so far.  Colin Lunn: I love A Walk Across the Rooftops, the best first album by any group, not only in Scotland but worldwide. However, Hats was probably a better, more perfect album although it didn\u0026rsquot have the same influence. Tough, tough choice but I\u0026rsquoll go for Hats by a very, very fine margin.  Here\u0026rsquos what you had to say about some of the other music on the list:  Kyle Wallace: I\u0027ve Seen Everything by the Trashcan Sinatras is part of the soundtrack to my life. Listened to it through my dad\u0027s death and the college years. So many great songs associated with great memories.  John Richards: This was a very difficult choice. Scottish groups (I\u0027m Welsh) have a disproportionately large place in my music collection \u0026ndash particularly those who came to prominence in the 1980s. My top 20 regularly features the work of the Blue Nile, Danny Wilson, Aztec Camera, Deacon Blue and Love \u0026amp Money. However, it\u0027s got to be an album from the year I turned 19, when I went to university and the myriad possibilities that life had to offer opened up before me. The song (and album) that soundtracked that life-changing period is still my favourite Scottish album: Strange Kind of Love by Love \u0026amp Money.  Stuart Duncan: My vote is for The Midnight Organ Fight by Frightened Rabbit. An album that, as your writer said, \u0026ldquomakes it feel it\u0026rsquos OK to be sad. The lyrics hit home more than any album I\u0026rsquove ever listened to. Scott Hutchison gave me a feeling that everything was going to be OK, that I would get through things. I\u0026rsquod say he helped changed me as a person. It still hasn\u0026rsquot stuck in that he\u0026rsquos no longer here [Hutchsion took his own life in May] but my vote would be the same regardless of the circumstances.  Danny Tennyson: My favourite album by a Scottish band \u0026ndash or any other band for that matter \u0026ndash has to High Land Hard Rain, by Aztec Camera. The fact that Roddy was probably only 15 or 16 when he wrote most of the tracks for the album makes it all the more remarkable. He continues to be a genius to this day.  Shane Brown, Illinois: Why is it that I live in the centre boring part of America (the states you fly over to get somewhere else interesting), and should by location and birthright be a huge fan of Slipknot, but instead find myself with a vast collection of Scottish indiepop? From the Cocteaus to the Fannies, Belle \u0026amp Sebastian to Teen Canteen, Scottish indiepop has been the soundtrack to my life. How and why the music of your land speaks to me, I\u0027ll never know, but no album speaks to my soul more than Cake by the Trashcan Sinatras \u0026ndash a record I find as comforting as a cup of coffee on a cold winter morning. I really, really love it to this day, and why those lads aren\u0027t universally revered as musical genius is beyond me to this day. I\u0027ve travelled hundreds of miles to see them live and I\u0027ll continue to do so as long as they grace us with the occasional American tour.  John Jauchler, Connecticut: Lots of good stuff on your list, but my vote goes to the Trashcan Sinatras\u0026rsquo I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything. Outstanding musicians and really nice guys as well. Their music has made a difference in my life.

It will replace the existing Meadowbank, which was originally constructed for the 1970 Commonwealth Games and closed in December.  Building work could start before the end of the year, with planners also agreeing \u0026ldquoin principle to the wider development of the site. The new Meadowbank will include a 3G football pitch in the centre of the running track, an indoor athletics track and an outdoor throws area.  It will also offer badminton courts, a gymnastics hall, a gym, studios, a cafe and offices.  But the plans have sparked controversy.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspThousands sign petition against redevelopment of Meadowbank stadium in Edinburgh  Earlier this week it was reported that campaigners against the redevelopment would hand in a petition with more than 3,000 signatures.  The Save Meadowbank group is objecting to plans for a new sports centre to replace the current stadium, as well as proposals for hundreds of homes on much of the surrounding site.  Campaigners protested outside City Chambers in Edinburgh before the planning meeting on Friday\u0026nbspand said they were disappointed at the outcome.

Mrs Foster said there was \u0026ldquogrowing support for the idea as she addressed an Orange parade in Fife.  She was the main speaker at the Cowdenbeath event, organised by the Grand Orange Lodge of Scotland.  The DUP proposed a feasibility study into building a bridge to Scotland in 2015.  \u0026ldquoThe connection between our two countries has always been special, she said.  \u0026ldquoWhat better way to cement that relationship than through a bridge?  \u0026ldquoAmongst all the nasty and abusive comments made about the Orange wouldn\u0026rsquot it be great to become an actual bridge builder between Northern Ireland and Scotland?  \u0026ldquoWhilst some foolishly attempt to use Brexit to build a border between Scotland and Northern Ireland, we are more progressive, we want to build a bridge.  Speaking before the event, Mrs Foster made a plea for certainty on Brexit.  \u0026ldquoI think most people want to see that now. We\u0026rsquore two years after the referendum, she said.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos important that we get that certainty soon.  \u0026ldquoIt takes two to tango and we need the European Union to step up to the plate and to recognise that Brexit is happening, so let\u0026rsquos make it a good Brexit for us, and a good Brexit for the European Union as well.  Earlier this month, Labour and the Liberal Democrats in Scotland criticised Mrs Foster\u0026rsquos decision to attend the parade, stating her time would be better spent in Northern Ireland, where there is no devolved government in place following its collapse more than a year ago.  The DUP leader \u0026ndash who addressed the parade but did not participate in the march through Cowdenbeath \u0026ndash said: \u0026ldquoI am the last in a long line of unionist leaders coming along here.  \u0026ldquoI am not really sure why people would object to me coming here today.

In 2017 a total of 12,994 Britons acquired the nationality of one of the 17 member states, highlighted in new findings.  This compares with 5,025 in 2016 and only 1,800 in 2015.  German citizenship was the most frequently sought after, with a sharp rise in cases from just 594 in 2015 to 7,493 in 2017 for Germany.  The dramatic increase is thought to be caused by eligible UK citizens who can meet the criteria seeking to keep their legal rights attached to EU membership, and the 2017 figure is about seven times the 2015 level.  France was the second most popular nationality, jumping from 320 instances in 2015 to 1,518 last year.  Belgium was in third place and saw an increase from 127 to 1,381.  The number for Ireland rose from 54 in 2015 to 529 in 2017.  However, that did not include new Irish passport applications from a much larger number of people who already had entitlement to Irish citizenship, due to being born in Northern Ireland.  The findings do not show individuals leaving the UK for other EU nations, but show that an increasing amount of people with European family links are taking up dual citizenship to enjoy the rights of EU citizenship before Brexit in March 2019.  Those with new nationalities will retain the right to travel, live and work throughout the EU after the UK\u0027s departure, and may be able to pass these on to their children.  In most cases those involved have also retained their British citizenship and so have become dual nationals.  The surge in Britons obtaining EU citizenship was revealed in data obtained by the BBC from 17 out of 27 member states.  Only a limited number of UK citizens would qualify for citizenship of another EU state.  The increase was revealed amid reports of bitter cabinet splits over the future shape of Brexit.  Arch Brexiteer Michael Gove is said to have physically ripped up a report on Prime Minister Theresa May\u0027s preferred option for a new customs partnership with the EU.  Gove was reported to have been \"livid\" as he felt the government document wrongly suggested his Brexit working group had agreed the plan was viable.  The Tory environment secretary\u0027s spokesman said he felt it downplayed his objections to the proposed customs relationship.  The Government has talked publicly about two potential options for its customs relationship with the EU after Brexit.  One, a customs partnership, would mean the UK applies the EU\u0027s own tariffs and rules of origin to all goods arriving in the country, intended for the EU.  The other, known as maximum facilitation or max-fac, aims to employ new technology to remove the need for physical customs checks where possible.  Two groups of cabinet members were looking at each of the plans.  The document in question, prepared by civil servants, was supposed to represent the views of a group of Cabinet members looking at the customs partnership, including Gove.  Gove was reported to have \"physically ripped it up to show he wasn\u0027t prepared to accept the document as a summary of their discussions\".  Meanwhile, in a separate row, top diplomatic sources claimed Donald Trump said that the EU, Nato and the World Trade Organisation are bad for the US.  European Council president Donald Tusk told EU leaders that Trump posed a serious threat to western unity and it would be a mistake to dismiss the American President as stupid.  \u0026ldquoHe has a method and is serious in his mission against an international rules-based order, Tusk told the leaders, according to a senior diplomatic source.  \u0026ldquoHe is on a mission against what we stand for.  The dramatic developments came as Austria took over the rotating presidency of the EU with a pledge to better secure the 28-nation bloc\u0026rsquos external borders."},{"url":null,"title":"salmond-insists-the-vow-did-swing-indyref-result","story":"              ALEX Salmond has challenged a claim that the pledge of new powers for Scotland in the closing stages of the 2014 independence referendum did not clinch victory for the No campaign.  The Vow, signed by the then Prime Minister David Cameron, Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg and Labour leader Ed Miliband, appeared on the front page of the Daily Record two days ahead of the historic vote  However, the then Daily Record editor Murray Foote, says his motivation for publishing the pledge was to ensure the politicians kept to their word.  He added there was no evidence it lost the campaign for Yes which he believed failed because the economic case for independence was not strong enough.  Salmond hailed Foote, who stood down as editor of the Record in March, as \u0026ldquoa new recruit to the independence cause.  Foote came out in support of an independent Scotland this month.  However, Salmond said he disagreed with Foote about the impact of The Vow.  Salmond said: \"I warmly welcome Murray Foote as a new recruit to the independence cause but he heavily underrates the significance of the Vow which was a journalistic masterpiece but politically disabled Scotland at a crucial moment.  \u0026ldquoIt presented a No campaign then in total disarray with a rallying point in the final week of the 2014 referendum.  \u0026ldquoThe Daily Record provided an infinitely more credible vehicle than George Osborne and the Tory Government who first wanted to proffer the panicked promise of more powers."},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-rocking-as-music-festivals-take-weekend-by-storm","story":"              SCOTLAND was rocking this weekend as music festivals kicked off in both Glasgow and Dumfries, including the high profile TRNSMT at Glasgow Green.

The sands around Scotland are host to a huge and increasing range of leisure pursuits and beach cultures. From espresso-drinking to stone stacking, here\u0027s our guide to how Scots are entertaining themselves during these long, hot days at the seaside.  Sandcastle building  Some seaside cultures come and go, but one activity that\u0026rsquos always to be found on a sandy beach is sandcastle building. Parents pass it on to their children. Kids just seem to have an instinct for doing it anyway. No one is really sure when, back in the mists of time, the first sand castle was built. But we can say castles have been built on Scottish beaches for decades. A Fife Herald article from 1856 declares: \"Let him bathe and puddle in the water - let him build sand castles on the beach. Of course, we can fancy it up. We can hold competitions, like the one that will take place at the Crail festival on July 28. We can call it \u0026ldquosand art. We can try to build the biggest one ever \u0026ndash the world record is held by a 16.84 metre high construction, built in Duisburg, Germany. But proper sand castle building isn\u0026rsquot about all that. It\u0026rsquos simple play \u0026ndash messing about in the mud.  Stone stacking  Is this the new sandcastle building? Or a strange new cult that is overtaking our beaches? The last year has seen these mysterious mini towers of rock increasingly colonise shores up and down the country. Mostly that\u0026rsquos due to the passion of one man, James Craig Page. Last year the artist set up the European Stone Stacking Championships in Dunbar, and the craft has spread like loom bands and fidget spinners since. You can barely throw a stone these days on a beach without it knocking into some piece of quarzite precariously balanced on top of an old fossil. \"It\u0026rsquos like a creative meditation, Craig Page says. \u0026ldquoAs soon as you start to practice this and engage in it, you go into this very meditative state and you don\u0026rsquot think about the future \u0026ndash you\u0026rsquore just totally in the moment. He has even started doing workshops with children in schools. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos been remarkable. A lot of the children that are least attentive in the class, that have been labelled with ADHD seem to get it. My dream is to get this into the national curriculum in Scotland and across Britain.  Paddleboarding  The rise and rise of paddle boarding can be witnessed around the coast of Scotland. This is the mellow water sport, for those who don\u0026rsquot want to get salt up their nose or serious windburn. It\u0026rsquos also possible to do paddleboarding while striking a downward dog or some other yoga positions. In fact, stand up paddle board yoga is a thing. Yoga guru Michaella Robb runs classes in it on the Dundee waterfront. But, if you\u0026rsquore braving the choppy waters of the sea, just standing up might be enough of a challenge.  Beach cleaning  The sea is full of plastic. The beach is a tip \u0026ndash litter on Scottish beaches rose by six per cent last year. Of course, we can spend our time moaning about it while we lie on our beach mat sipping from a plastic bottle, but it\u0026rsquos also possible to do something \u0026ndash and many are. Beach cleaning is, very nearly, a form of beach leisure activity, and most who do it find fun as well as virtuous. Surfers Against Sewage earlier this year organised the Big Spring Beach Clean which resulted in volunteers around the UK removing 64,000 tonnes of marine plastic pollution from our coastlines. Marine Conservation Society Scotland coordinates regular beach cleans. Catherine Gemmell, the young campaigner who plans them, says interest in ocean plastics has \"skyrocketed\" in the past few years. \"This September we are running our 25th Great British Beach Clean \u0026ndash can we make it the biggest one yet?\" Gemmell observes that beach cleans are often surprisingly competitive. \"The friendly competition sets in pretty quickly, from who found the most, the heaviest, the weirdest or the smallest items.\"  Hut posing  Sitting in front of your \u0026pound25,000 beach hut \u0026ndash the reported price of, for instance, huts in Findhorn Bay - is a very nice activity for those who have the wherewithal to indulge in it. If, as it happens, you don\u0026rsquot, one alternative is to set your deckchair, or some other fancy-looking beach prop, up in front of someone else\u0026rsquos hut, which does not appear to be in use for the day. That said Scottish beach huts are really a snip by comparison with those you get in some parts of England, where you can pay up to \u0026pound295,000 for a hut in Dorset with no electricity or running water, but enough room to sleep six.  Lying down on the sand and doing nothing  One of the most popular and enduring of beach pursuits. This can, of course, be done on a beach towel, or scratchy rug, but, for full luxury, it\u0026rsquos necessary to get out that sun-lounger \u0026ndash begged, borrowed or stolen \u0026ndash that hasn\u0026rsquot seen the light of day since the hottest day of 2017 and lug it all the way down to the sand. By the time you\u0026rsquove got there you\u0026rsquoll be dripping sweat all you\u0026rsquoll want to do is collapse there for the next few hours \u0026ndash preferably with a cold beer. You will also need a nice book, to use as a nose shade once you\u0026rsquove read a sentence or two.  Beach barbecuing  A beach outing is incomplete without the smell of smoke and the sizzle of sausages over charcoal. Because, of course, though it\u0026rsquos hot, for us Scots it is clearly is not hot enough. A beach day requires at least some sauna-style sweating over a grill. Given this, once the sun is out, the rush is on. If you\u0026rsquove not got a barbecue yet, you may need to brawl your way out of the shop with the last one. But which one? The gas barbie? The charcoal bucket? Or one of those trendy, schmancy Lotus Grills? The choice can be paralysing. One thing however is clear \u0026ndash which one you shouldn\u0026rsquot get. That would be the disposable barbie that just creates waste and is also a hazard on the beach, if left there \u0026ndash and has, as news stories testify, accounted for more than a few child foot burns.  Taps aff  There is a difference between sunbathing and taps aff. The former involves sensible amounts of sun cream, a relaxed attitude and some relatively sober lounging. The latter is all about a disregard for all decorum and a sticking two fingers up to body fascism, as well as the nanny state who would have you protect yourself from skin cancer. Taps aff can also be done while there is not really enough sun for sun bathing. While it can be done on the beach, it\u0026rsquos not strictly a beach activity, and actually has much greater impact when done on the high street or outside a pub. On a sizzling day, taps aff is like saying to the sun, \u0026ldquoOy, you up there, pal! Aye, you, sun. I can take you.  Surfing  We have, in Scotland, some of the best surfing beaches in Europe. The only problem is they\u0026rsquore at their best in the colder months, from September through to May, when the sea is glacial. But still, you can catch a good wave in Scotland, even in the summer. Thurso may be where people go for World Class surfing, but a surf scene is developing in many other parts, from Pease Bay to the beaches of Tiree or Islay. As Iona Larg, who runs Blackmountain Watersports on Tiree points out, there\u0026rsquos a nice family surf culture developing on the island. Youngsters are growing up learning to surf at their \u0026ldquowee surf club, families are coming for their holidays \u0026ndash her son, Ben, is even a champion surfer. \u0026ldquoIn some other places like Bali, she says, \u0026ldquosurfing is ultra-cool. It\u0026rsquos the beautiful people. But here in Scotland you\u0026rsquove got to wear a 5mm wetsuit and it can be Baltic, so it\u0026rsquos not about that. The result is the culture is super inclusive and we\u0026rsquore always happy to see other people.  Wild swimming  There\u0026rsquos been a lot of talk about \u0026ldquowild swimming in recent years \u0026ndash in Scotland, virtually, any swimming in the sea, or even paddling above thigh-level, is what most would call wild. Scots have become so spoilt by their Mediterranean holidays that it\u0026rsquos now hard to imagine our idea of fun might have been a dip in one of those now crumbled tidal swimming pools that dot the coast. But proper warm, swimming days do come, and we\u0026rsquove had some of them recently. In any case, when they are not here, there are always hardcore wild swimmers who are willing to take on the chill, come sun or snow, like the Wild Ones, a group dedicated to sea swimming in Portobello.  Beach baristas and feral foodies  Wherever you go in today\u0026rsquos world, you\u0026rsquore rarely more than a short walk away from a cup of artisan coffee \u0026ndash even when you\u0026rsquore on a beach. It used to be you would be lucky if your favourite beach was honoured by a visit from a Mr Whippy selling van \u0026ndash even luckier if it had blood sauce. But these days, beaches are turning into foodie and coffee paradises. If your local beach hasn\u0026rsquot got a trendy new beach caf\u0026eacute \u0026ndash like the in an old at Cramond \u0026ndash or shack, then it had better be served regularly by some sort of gourmet-mobile. Vans like the Little Green Van, often stationed at Portobello, Chantilly Bleu in Elie, and Coffee at the Kings on Cullen beach, are supplying those of us who can\u0026rsquot go anywhere without craving a mellow roast. Meanwhile, foodie heaven is to be found by the sands, when vans like The Cheesy Toast Shack (at Kingsbarns, Fife) pull up. The flask of instant is dead. The world is one big coffee shop.  Beachspotting  Your guide to human beach life and the habitats in which it is found  Elie  This picturesque Fife fishing village is where puff-breasted Edinburgh New Towners and other wealthy city birds migrate in the sunny months, and can be found paddleboarding and eating delicious crepes and pizzas from Chantilly Bleu, a blue van parked by the breakwater. Poorer holidaymakers may visit, but Elie is more the natural habitat of the rich. Next door to the Earlsferry Links golf club is the most expensive street outside the top three cities, in Scotland.  Dunbar  In commuting distance of the capital, you may be lucky enough to spot the crested stone stacker, or possibly evidence of their presence in the form of towering constructions of pebbles dotted along the shoreline. Mostly artists, and other creative types. This species is now increasingly to be found on many other beaches across Scotland.  Troon  One of the most phenomenal beach migrations is that of the Buckfast Teen to this Ayrshire beach during particularly hot days. They arrive in their hordes on trains bringing beer and other alcoholic beverages, leading to scenes of drunkenness and chaos. Mainly these are youngsters, teenagers and young adults, and crowds can reach as many as 1,500. This is somewhat of a regular feature that the police are used to \u0026ndash happening several times a year depending on the weather patterns \u0026ndash and has earned Troon the nickname \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos Magaluf. Luckily, for these migrators, Troon is much closer than Magaluf.  Sands Of Morar  The Digital detoxer is often to be found during summer holidays on this uncrowded beach, perched over a pile of gathered sticks trying to light a fire with a flint, while berating themselves for not having charged their phone, and mourning the fact that there will be no picture of this serene scene to post on Facebook.  Thurso East  That magnificent beast, the Surfcatcher is sometimes to be spotted among the huge breakers that crash onto the shore at Thurso East. They are drawn here by its reputation as one of the best, but coldest, surf spots in Europe. Also to be found at Pease Bay and on Tiree and Islay."},{"url":null,"title":"dup-leaders-calls-for-northern-ireland-scotland-bridge-dismissed-by-scots-political-parties-after-orange-walk-event","story":"              SCOTS political parties have dismissed calls made by DUP leader Arlene Foster at an Orange Walk in Cowdenbeath yesterday for a bridge to be built between Northern Ireland and Scotland.  Speaking to the Sunday Herald before giving a speech ahead of yesterday\u0026rsquos march, Foster said she wanted to see a bridge built between Northern Ireland and Scotland to boost the economies in both places post-Brexit.  She admitted the bridge she envisioned had not been costed, but insisted she was \u0026ldquoserious about it. The DUP leader added that she was \u0026ldquonot like Trump and didn\u0026rsquot expect others to pay for it.  However, in response, the SNP and Scottish Labour urged Foster to focus on rebuilding the power sharing agreement in Northern Ireland, which collapsed last year.  An SNP spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoWith the Northern Ireland Assembly suspended, Arlene Foster\u0026rsquos priority should be getting Stormont back up and running.  A Scottish Labour spokesman added: \u0026ldquoGiven the shambles her Tory allies are making of Brexit, not to mention the lack of leadership at Stormont, Arlene Foster would do better to focus on more pressing issues.  During her speech, Foster said she hoped to be able to drive to Scotland in future, and asked the Orange Order to get behind a campaign for a road link.  \u0026ldquoAmongst all the nasty and abusive comments made about the Orange wouldn\u0026rsquot it be great to become an actual bridge builder between Northern Ireland and Scotland? she said.  When asked how the bridge would be paid for, Foster told the Sunday Herald: \u0026ldquoWell, I\u0026rsquom not like Trump. I\u0026rsquom not saying we\u0026rsquoll build a bridge and you\u0026rsquoll pay for it. I think we\u0026rsquoll find ways to do it.  A spokesman for the DUP later told this newspaper that they would expect \u0026lsquoa contribution\u0026rsquo from the UK Government.  Standing in the local high school grounds, Foster went on to give the crowd a history lesson on William of Orange, insisting there is a \u0026ldquolack of appreciation about his life.  She added: \u0026ldquoWe need to be like William and build alliances for the good of all the country. This country needs to be a shared place where people are able to live free from intolerance and hatred. Such bigotry was not part of King William\u0026rsquos mind-set and it should not be part of ours.  However, politicians in Scotland took aim at the record of the DUP \u0026ndash which opposes same-sex marriage \u0026ndash on equality issues.  Scottish Greens MSP Mark Ruskell, who represents the Mid Scotland and Fife region at the Scottish Parliament, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a shame Ms Foster didn\u0026rsquot choose to visit at the beginning of July when she could have enjoyed a far more colourful procession at Fife Pride.  CLOSED DOORS AND GRAFFITI WARS: HOW COWDENBEATH LOCALS RESPONDED TO THE ORANGE ORDER AND ARLENE FOSTER  THERE were as many people leaving Cowdenbeath yesterday as were arriving for the Orange Walk.  As coach loads of people rolled in, cars full of families drove in the opposite direction before the main road out of the town was closed by police.  One father of two, who asked not to be named, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom taking the kids away for the day. I don\u0026rsquot want them to see this.  A homeowner who lives near the school also said he would be leaving town for the day but he asked not to be named. \u0026ldquoI won\u0026rsquot be back until tonight, he said.  Outside his house was freshly daubed graffiti which read: \u0026ldquoF**k the DUP, \u0026ldquoOrange b******s, and \u0026ldquoIRA.  Many people who had arrived in Cowdenbeath took pictures of the graffiti and shook their heads.  One said: \u0026ldquoThe police should do something about this. Someone must have seen something.  Another added: \u0026ldquoI see the Taigs have been busy. Taigs is a derogatory term for a Catholic or Irish nationalist.  When the Sunday Herald told Arlene Foster about the graffiti, she said: \u0026lsquoThat is very sad. People should be allowed to celebrate their culture and heritage ... there is nothing here that should offend anybody.\u0026rsquo  Ahead of the event, business owners spoke of their concerns that it could affect trade.  The town\u0026rsquos optometrist cancelled a clinic when every appointment was rescheduled by customers.  Natalie McHale, who is the manager of Ferrier and Mackinnon Optometrists, said: \u0026ldquoThe minute it starts the shutters are going down.  Another business owner, who asked not to be named, said she would also shut up shop.  \u0026ldquoI think it\u0026rsquos scandalous, she said. \u0026ldquoMy view has nothing to do with religion - I\u0026rsquom a Protestant and I married a Catholic - this is about businesses struggling to survive. This event is another nail in the coffin for this high street.  \u0026ldquoI can\u0026rsquot even give you my name because I can\u0026rsquot afford to lose any more customers.  Another local business owner, who also asked not to be named because he is afraid he\u0026rsquoll lose customers, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a nightmare. I\u0026rsquom trying to arrange delivery of stock but the drivers are refusing to come near Cowdenbeath because all the roads are closed.  However, Ruby Ramsay, who runs Bits and Bobs, was more pragmatic. She said: \u0026ldquoWe need a turn in Cowdenbeath and I\u0026rsquom hoping this event will give us that. It\u0026rsquos not the right kind of business but we\u0026rsquoll take it.  Newly elected chairwoman of local charity Fife Migrants Forum, Violeta Ilendo, said she had \u0026ldquodeep concerns about the Orange walk visit: \u0026ldquoMigrant communities in Fife feel disappointed that the permission was granted for the march. It is adding pressure to the public spend. Public money would be better spent on community integration and cohesion.  More than 100 police officers were reported to have been drafted in to oversee the Orange Walk.  A spokeswoman for Fife Council defended the decision to allow the Orange Order to use school property as part of its events, saying: \u0026ldquoThe council has no right to say who is or isn\u0026rsquot allowed to hold an event."},{"url":null,"title":"stephen-house-made-120000-consultancy-bid-from-snp-government-weeks-after-resigning","story":"              A FORMER Police Scotland chief constable pitched for \u0026pound120,000 of consultancy work from the Scottish Government weeks after announcing his resignation.  Sarantium Solutions, owned by Sir Stephen House, made the funding bid to provide six months of counter terrorism advice, but the Government declined to pursue the opportunity.  Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur said: \"Bearing in mind the circumstances of Stephen House\u0027s resignation, it is extraordinary to learn that the Scottish Government was even considering his returning to the scene in the form of consultancy work just months later.\"  House was chief constable of Strathclyde Police before taking the top job at the single force, but his time in post was marred by a host of policing scandals.  The Glasgow-born police chief was criticised after it emerged that beat officers were responding to routine incidents while carrying firearms.  He also faced sustained media, political and academic scrutiny over the decision to roll out Strathclyde\u0026rsquos industrial use of stop and search to the rest of Scotland.  Hundreds of thousands of searches were recorded in one year, but the figure was widely believed to be false as officers were registering bogus frisks in a desperate bid to meet targets.  House defended the policy, but it was eventually reformed out of all recognition and search rates tumbled.  He also felt strong political pressure after police failed to attend an M9 crash site for three days, an incident that had left two people dead.  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the tragedy was her lowest moment in office and described the lengthy delay in responding to the call as a \u0026ldquodreadful failure.  House was also criticised over his force\u0026rsquos discredited Counter Corruption Unit after an illegal spying operation was launched to flush out the sources on a newspaper investigation.  Under pressure, House announced in autumn 2015 that he would be standing down later in the year. He then formed consultancy firm Sarantium Solutions.  Weeks after announcing his departure, the Scottish Government invited House to submit a proposal on the country\u0026rsquos readiness in relation to counter-terrorism.  In November 2015, House contacted senior civil servant Paul Johnston with his thoughts on an \u0026ldquoin depth analysis and review.  His pitch stated: \u0026ldquoThe opportunity exists to utilise this unique experience and expertise in a study that can now offer fresh thinking and \u0027think the unthinkable\u0027, unfettered by recent command responsibilities.  House also promised his work would contain a \u0026ldquospecial reference to the role of the Scottish Government - specifically the First Minister and Cabinet Member - in the event of a terrorist attack.  The cash bid concluded: \u0026ldquoSir Stephen brings unrivalled experience and expertise as well as an unbeatable network of international contacts to the study, combined with a deep knowledge of Scotland\u0026rsquos capabilities and needs.  Days later, House emailed the same civil servant with an updated proposal and wrote: \u0026ldquoYou will note that the price has gone up.  The first contract option was a \u0026ldquosingle block of six months work, which came in at \u0026pound120,000, while the cheaper alternative was a two-phase project worth \u0026pound110,000. The Government did not award the contract.  House was this year appointed as an assistant commissioner in the politan Police.  Scottish Tory MSP Liam Kerr said: \u0026ldquoGiven the cloud under which Sir Stephen House left, people would have expected the Scottish Government to cut ties altogether. Instead, ministers couldn\u0026rsquot wait to have him back in. It\u0026rsquos just a relief that his proposed rates were so unreasonable, even the SNP government couldn\u0026rsquot agree to them.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoSet against the backdrop of recent attacks in Europe throughout 2015, the Scottish Government considered undertaking some work on its readiness. As such, the Scottish Government invited Sir Stephen House, as outgoing chief constable of Police Scotland, to submit a project proposal. However, as has been stated \u0026hellip the need for these services did not arise, so a contract was not awarded and no payment was made.  House could not be reached for comment."},{"url":null,"title":"union-calls-on-scottish-secretary-david-mundell-to-intervene-to-secure-jobs-at-bifab","story":"              SCOTTISH Secretary David Mundell is facing calls to intervene to safeguard jobs at the troubled BiFab engineering firm.  Unions have held talks with Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson at Holyrood about the business.  They want Davidson to use her influence with the UK Government to get ministers to step in to secure the jobs of BiFab workers at yards in Fife and Arnish.  Unions said in February that they had been told that 260 jobs were to go by the end of May, with the yards facing full closure a month later.  A takeover by a Canadian engineering firm was later brokered by the Scottish Government, which said the deal with JV Driver and DF Barnes would allow the yards to seek new fabrication and construction work in the marine, renewables and energy sectors.  However, the GMB union says the UK Government must also intervene in light of a new threat to jobs.  The union says no new work has been secured by the contractor, DF Barnes, and the remaining workforce would be cut again to just a small team handling basic maintenance.  GMB Scotland secretary Gary Smith urged Mundell must use his role as Scottish Secretary to deliver a fresh rescue package, and said he should consider subsidies for the yards in Fife and Arnish, which have completed renewable energy projects such as the \u0026pound2.6 billion Beatrice Offshore Windfarm.  He said: \"We want to know what the UK Government is going to do to support manufacturing jobs in the sector and what pressure Ruth Davidson can put on her Tory colleagues at Westminster.  \"We are disappointed in the lack of support from David Mundell and hope that Ruth Davidson can get him to focus on what support could be available.  \"The renewables industry depends on subsidies.  \"We need this to focus on what support we can get for the manufacturing sector for firms like BiFab.\"  The union leader met Davidson at Holyrood last week for talks about the future of the BiFab.  Smith said Mundell has failed to take any significant action over the firm.  In response, a UK Government spokesman said: \u0026ldquoWe are committed to supporting a thriving renewables sector and are investing more than \u0026pound2.5bn in low carbon innovation by 2021, helping deliver opportunities for companies such as BiFab and others in the supply chain.  \u0026ldquoIn the clean growth strategy we reaffirmed our support for offshore wind by working with industry as they develop an ambitious plan which could result in 10 gigawatts of new capacity in the 2020s.  \u0026ldquoWe are making up to \u0026pound557 million of annual support available for innovative offshore wind projects, providing industry with the certainty they need to invest in such schemes.  A Scottish Tory spokesman added: \u0026ldquoRuth Davidson met with BiFab this week and fully intends to help them in any way she can."},{"url":null,"title":"the-big-read-what-love-island-really-says-about-the-world-we-live-in","story":"              WELCOME to Paradise. Here the sun always shines, the men have six packs, the women have curves in all the right places and the only thing you need to worry about is how much grafting (to use the show\u0027s lingo) you have to put into attracting the opposite sex.  Unless you\u0027ve been living in deep freeze, it\u0027s hard to escape the cultural phenomenon that is the Bafta-winning, dating reality TV show, Love Island. It revolves around a dizzying array of \u0026ldquosexy singles who purport to be looking for true love, along with the \u0026pound50,000 prize money (or, let\u0027s be honest, a launch pad for a celeb career), and spend up to eight weeks in a luxury villa in Mallorca trying to convince audiences that they\u0027ve found the man, or woman, of their dreams. It\u0027s knowingly narrated for laughs by Scottish comedian Iain Stirling and hosted by reality TV veteran Caroline Flack.  Whether or not it\u0027s working out for contestants, Love Island\u0027s fourth series is certainly pulling in the audiences of ITV2\u0027s dreams. An average 2.9 million people tuned in for the launch episode on June 4, more than double that of the first episode in 2017. Last week it was the highest-rating TV show at 9pm, with audiences \u0026ndash more than half of whom are in the 16-34 age range (the holy grail of TV producers) \u0026ndash peaking at 3.4million viewers. It has an overall audience share of 16 percent, that rises to almost 50 percent of younger viewers, and a whole range of merch.  Even if it sounds closer to your version of hell than paradise, there is no denying its widespread influence. But it\u0027s only a daft game show, right? As with any mainstream hit there\u0027s been plenty of sneering, about those who watch as much as those on-screen. In some ways you can see why.  In a month in which Donald Trump\u0027s immigration policies at the US border saw toddlers ripped from their mothers\u0027 arms and children kept in cages, while others were bombed in Yemen, could we really feel justified in worrying about whether Wes Nelson would be best off sticking with 29-year-old air hostess Laura Anderson or cracking on with surgically enhanced Megan Barton-Hanson? As Brexit negotiations continued to hurtle towards the cliff-edge, dragging us all towards who-knows-what, was it really OK to stuff our fingers in our ears until 9pm when we could relax into wondering if increasingly uptight and awkward A\u0026ampE doctor Alex George would finally convince a girl to fancy him?  Dr Faye Woods, lecturer in film and television at Reading University, dismisses this either/or view. She points out that while audiences of this female-targeted series are met with derision, it\u0027s not just socially acceptable, but actively expected, that men will down tools to watch the World Cup.  \u0026ldquoThis is an event bringing the nation together that isn\u0026rsquot terrible men\u0026rsquos footie, she says. \u0026ldquoLove Island gives us that space to breathe and focus on something else, a little oasis of pleasure amidst our current darkness. We can hold multiple thoughts in our brain simultaneously, and refocusing for a while every night is healthy for our well-being.  Which seems fair enough. And who doesn\u0027t like watching beautiful people? There\u0027s a fascination not just in their symmetrical features and gym-fit bodies, but in the amount of effort that goes into grooming \u0026ndash the carefully layered tans and whitened teeth, shaved chests, perfectly arched brows and painted nails (which mostly happens off camera, as if by magic).  \u0026ldquoIt\u0027s a kind of vicarious pleasure, reckons Gladeana McMahon, a psychological adviser for reality shows such as the early Big Brother series, and the driving force behind the production of the \u0026ldquoEthical Guidelines for Reality TV produced by the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy. \u0026ldquoThis is the gladiatorial pit without the violence.  But as she points out, ITV2 has set out to get big audiences by going for a winning formula, that is, in many ways, nostalgic and safe. While it\u0027s supposedly all about glamour and sexual sizzle \u0026ndash once you\u0027re coupled up with someone you share a double bed in the dorm and see what you can get away with under the duvet \u0026ndash this dream seems in some ways weirdly old-fashioned.  In an age in which woke millennials are seemingly increasingly accepting of gender as a fluid rather than a binary concept, the stereotypes on display \u0026ndash where men talk about treating women like queens, being \u0026ldquogentlemen, and some of the girls play dumb to get the guy \u0026ndash pull progressive views up short.  It\u0027s all about the archetypes. Adam Collard \u0026ndash trading on Garden of Eden associations and looking for temptation \u0026ndash describes himself as tall, dark and handsome, with great abs. What more could anyone want, he wonders aloud? (A little bit of respect and common decency it turns out, but more of that later.)  As Nicola Bishop, a researcher in English and television at Manchester politan University, notes: \u0026ldquoThis is \u0026lsquopin-up\u0026rsquo TV with little diversity of body types. There is a lot of readable anxiety among the male competitors about measuring up against perceived physical ideals of masculinity.  The love on this heteronormative island is not for everyone. There are lots of reality TV shows that have been very positive about representing LGBT contestants \u0026ndash Brian Dowling, winner of Big Brother\u0027s second series, is testament to that. This isn\u0027t one of them. While last year\u0027s Love Island did include a short bisexual romance between two of the women, and host Caroline Flack hinted there may be gay contestants in the future, bosses are clear. It\u0027s a dating show for straight couples and everyone needs to fancy each other. They claim they wouldn\u0027t rule out a standalone show but none is forthcoming so far.  As versions of romance go, despite the bed-swapping, it\u0027s an interestingly traditional one. Several commentators have pointed out that with its claustrophobic sense of ennui, codified courting behaviour and double-crossing, the dream on offer has more than a whiff of Jane Austen about it all.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0027s the Diana story, it\u0027s Cinderella, adds McMahon. Considering the number of people getting married in the UK is at an all-time low, there\u0027s an awful lot of talk about it. Adam claims there\u0027s not a girl in the house that he wouldn\u0027t want as a wife, while Laura hints to 20-year-old Wes, after sharing a bed with him for a few weeks, that she\u0027s on the look-out for a husband.  While in the real world there might be an increasing acceptance of less traditional relationships, or even non-monogamous ones, what\u0027s on offer here is what writer and columnist Laurie Penny refers to as Love TM. This search for Mr or Mrs Right is what she calls \u0026ldquothe narrow romantic fantasy that trumps all other forms of love, which is put on a pedestal as the answer to all our life problems and insecurities and never questioned. As beautiful lawyer Rosie Williams, ditched by Adam, cries to the other girls \u0026ldquoI just want to be enough, you wish she already knew she was.  It is her experience too that shows the darker side of the fairytale \u0026ndash Hans Christian Andersen rather than Disney \u0026ndash with Women\u0027s Aid going as far as issuing a warning about spotting the signs of abuse in response to Adam\u0027s \u0026ldquogaslighting of her (a term used to describe psychological manipulation aimed at making someone question their version of reality). The charity said there were clear warning signs in Adam\u0027s behaviour of emotional abuse and called on viewers to speak out against unhealthy relationships.  Faye Woods claims that though it\u0027s \u0026ldquodistressing emotionally to watch this play out on television, it\u0027s been valuable \u0026ldquoin terms of understanding and awareness of everyday behaviour. She adds: \u0026ldquoI think of all the people who may have dismissed coercive control, but then saw it in practice with Adam and Rosie and then understood it.  Then there\u0027s the issue of race. From the off it was not lost on black women writers and commentators such as Danielle Dash who noticed the way the statuesquely beautiful Samira Mighty \u0026ndash the only black woman in the house \u0026ndash was over-looked by all the boys and ended up with Alex because he\u0027d been usurped in his first choice by another man. On Friday, with another cohort of boys arriving in the villa resolutely uninterested in her, she finally broke down claiming to be \u0026ldquoso confused.  On the outside there is less confusion as people fit the pieces together. There\u0027s the way the public \u0026ldquoforgot to vote for singer Alexandra Burke, who outdanced all her competitors week after week on Strictly Come Dancing and repeatedly ended up in the dance off, the black girls passed over in dating show Take Me Out, the racist incidents in Big Brother House\u0027s gone by. Reality TV, argue many, has form.  Dr Kehinde Andrews, professor of Black Studies at Birmingham City University, hasn\u0027t watched it but isn\u0027t surprised by the concerns. \u0026ldquoReality TV is popular because it resonates with people, he says. \u0026ldquoSo we shouldn\u0027t be surprised when it replicates the racism that we see in society. Actually television often shows a world that is artificially equal. It\u0027s very rare now that something like Midsomer Murders \u0026ndash showing an all-white world \u0026ndash will be commissioned. So we sometimes get a distorted view when in actual fact the country is really segregated. In reality TV we see the reality that society is dominated by ideas of white supremacy.  It\u0027s not just the way the characters interact \u0026ndash it\u0027s also the way it\u0027s cast and edited, he claims. \u0026ldquoIf you look at who made the show, who picked the characters, who commissioned it in the first place, you\u0027ll probably find that it reflects a bias, he adds. \u0026ldquoThey [producers] should be mindful of that, more responsible. But fixing Love Island isn\u0027t going to do anything. It\u0027s a symptom of the problem.  Though unlikely to start viewing now, he admits it\u0027s probably more important than some give it credit for. It\u0027s certainly important to the millions of fans, following contestants\u0027 Instagram accounts in their droves, live-tweeting their own social commentary, or dissecting it with their mates on group chat. On Twitter there\u0027s support for Samira, complaints about Adam and other men\u0027s behaviour towards the women, and of course the inevitable backlash, calling out double standards. Discussion around the \u0026ldquosexual shaming of the women, when contestants were asked to share the number of people they\u0027d slept with, was red hot. On screen Laura\u0027s 30 was initially met with embarrassed silence, while Adam\u0027s 200 with backslapping.  Yet writing in the Times earlier this month Caitlin Moran claimed it is that interaction that makes Love Island an unlikely vehicle for feminism \u0026ldquobecause we live in an era when every one of the classic tactics used by these men \u0026ndash gaslighting, denial, coercion, guilt \u0026ndash is met with a fabulous deconstruction on social media. For the first time we have live, rolling footage of total ledges trying the kind of mindf***y shenanigans that previously have happened in the privacy of bars or the back of cabs ... That smirk! If you see a man smirk like that, leave immediately by the nearest exit, for you are dealing with a human trash-fire.  Online chat is also about spotting who is genuine (ie the loveable Dani Dyer and her boyfriend, stationery salesman Jack Fincham, whose loyalty during separation had hearts melting) and who is faking it. Who is merely playing the game? It\u0027s a rolling audience commentary that underlines the fact that just being young doesn\u0027t make you dumb.  As Faye Woods says: \u0026ldquoReality TV is never real, and all viewers know this. It is non-viewers who attempt to dismiss them as gullible. Reality TV is built for savvy, sophisticated viewers, who are able to pivot effortlessly between awareness of this as constructed process and an emotional immersion.  Paradise, then, might be a great way to switch off. But, it turns out, Paradise deconstructed might have plenty to tell us about our society and youth culture today, as long as we\u0027re ready to listen."},{"url":null,"title":"scots-lgbt-school-assemblies-prompt-more-than-three-quarter-of-children-to-stop-using-homophobic-language","story":"              MORE than three quarters of Scots pupils who\u0026rsquove attended LGBT inclusive assemblies in schools stopped using homophobic language as a direct result, new research has revealed.  Nearly all pupils, 96 per cent, said the events in schools had made them more aware of the impact of homophobic, biphobic and transphobic bullying and attitudes on others, while 92 per cent said they\u0026rsquod since reflected on their own use of language.  Furthermore, of those pupils who said they previously held negative views towards the LGBT community, 86 per cent said their attitudes had changed positively after attending the assemblies.  The figures came from a survey conducted by the TIE Campaign, which is currently lobbying the Scottish Government to introduce statutory LGBT inclusive education across all schools in Scotland. While its parliamentary work has been going on, the group has been conducting assemblies on an invitation basis, across Scotland, in efforts to tackle the use of homophobic language in schools, reduce bullying and offer young people more information.  Recently, TIE has been collecting data from schools in a developing international research partnership with Purdue University in Indiana, USA, and the latest figures are based on a random sample of 1004 pupils from various schools across the country following participation in TIE\u0026rsquos LGBT awareness assemblies.  Liam Stevenson, TIE Campaign co-founder, said: \"This new data confirms that more and more young people are reflecting on their attitudes, their use of language, and their behaviour with regards to homophobia, biphobia, and transphobia.  \"For us, this further proves that LGBT inclusive lessons, workshops, and classroom discussions are the remedy to a long lasting culture of silence regarding the LGBT community in our schools.  \"Our services last one hour - imagine what will be achieved with LGBT history and culture embedded across the curriculum and a whole school approach towards inclusion and equality?\"  The news comes after MSPs celebrated the third anniversary of the campaign on Thursday, just before parliamentary recess began. MSPs, including Scottish Greens co-convener Patrick Harvie and Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard, wore rainbow coloured ties \u0026ndash the campaign\u0026rsquos emblem \u0026ndash as a show of support, while First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wore a campaign badge.  Sturgeon said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government is working with TIE to, and I\u0026rsquom quoting, \u0026lsquopromote an inclusive approach to sex and relationships education\u0026rsquo. This work is being done through the LGBTI inclusive education working group. That working group is chaired by the Association of Directors of Education.  \u0026ldquoIt includes representation from the Scottish Transgender Alliance, LGBT Youth Scotland and Stonewall Scotland, and recommendations from the working group are expected in autumn of this year. At that point I\u0026rsquom sure everybody across the chamber will have an interest \u0026ndash I know the Government, and me as First Minister, will have an interest \u0026ndash in making sure that these recommendations are implemented as quickly as possible.  The TIE Campaign, co-founded by Stevenson and Jordan Daly, hopes to tackle homophobic bullying in schools by weaving LGBT education into the schools curriculum. Previous research carried out by the group revealed that nine out of 10 LGBT people had experienced homophobia, biphobia or transphobia at school, and more than a quarter had attempted suicide at least once as a result. Eighty per cent of teachers felt they had not been adequately trained in how to deal with the issues.  TIE is working with the Scottish Government on developing its proposals, and Daly and Stevenson believe they are close to seeing their aims come to fruition.  CASE STUDY  Chloe Divers, guidance teacher at Brannock High School, Motherwell  When the TIE Campaign tweeted about a training session for teachers I went along and absolutely loved it. Jordan and Liam [TIE Campaign co-founders] were there, and I asked them to come into the school and do assemblies for us. Everything took off from there.  We started an LGBT Alliance group in the school, which lots of kids got involved in. It was only once a week, on a Friday lunch time, but at one point I was having up to 70 kids in my classroom \u0026ndash not all LGBT, a lot them allies as well. There was obviously a real appetite in the school and kids were interested.  Then we had the TIE Campaign come in and hold some whole school assemblies. They were really strong at putting across the message. It was interesting because we found the lower year groups, the first and second years, were really open to it. The seniors were more closed to it but then really opened up after we\u0026rsquod had the TIE Campaign in. Jordan was so honest when talking about his journey. I really noticed there was a significant change in the student body.  From then, we put it out to the pupils, the student council, to find out what they wanted to be taught. We started to get feedback on things like sexual health we had one boy saying that pupils get taught about safe sex, but that it was very male-female dominated and they weren\u0026rsquot taught about safe sex within same-sex relationships.  We\u0026rsquove since been on our LGBT charter award journey with LGBT Youth Scotland and we\u0026rsquove just received silver status on that which we\u0026rsquore delighted about. We\u0026rsquove had a very quick year in this school \u0026ndash we only started this in August and I would say there\u0026rsquos been a real shift in the mindset of the school, and it\u0026rsquos not just the students, it\u0026rsquos the teachers as well.  We found after the assemblies that a lot of teachers were saying how fantastic it was that we\u0026rsquod had TIE in, and that they wanted to support LGBT students but were scared they wouldn\u0026rsquot know how to do it, that they would say the wrong thing or not know the appropriate information to give them. Teachers still have that fear, so we were able to do staff training with TIE as well to help teachers feel more confident in speaking to pupils.  In terms of homophobic bullying and the words we would hear being used \u0026ndash sometimes not even directed at someone who\u0026rsquos gay, but what kids would call \u0026ldquobanter \u0026ndash there\u0026rsquos been a really significant change in that. We\u0026rsquove got a culture now where other pupils are happy to call it out as well, they\u0026rsquore happy to challenge it. There\u0026rsquos a real shift in culture. We know statistically that it\u0026rsquos had an impact because we\u0026rsquove had more events of homophobic bullying being recorded.  An example is one pupil who earlier in the year was experiencing homophobic bullying. He wouldn\u0026rsquot even get out of bed to come to school. The bullying wasn\u0026rsquot within the school gates, it was out in the community, but it involved boys from the school. We tackled that in the school through this education. He was at the point of leaving, but now he\u0026rsquos coming back. He sat exams this year that he otherwise wouldn\u0026rsquot have sat, and he\u0026rsquos already picked his subjects for next year.  We\u0026rsquore also finding the TIE Campaign has helped shift attitudes around gender norms. One of my colleagues, a computing teacher, has found she has more female students signing up when traditionally it was more male. She thinks because we\u0026rsquove tackled this as a whole that we\u0026rsquove challenged stereotypes and broken down gender norms. So we\u0026rsquore finding it\u0026rsquos breaking through into choices now as well.  I think full LGBT inclusive education would make a significant impact on kids. What\u0026rsquos happened with us is that we\u0026rsquove driven it, but I think there\u0026rsquos a lot of schools that aren\u0026rsquot doing that, they\u0026rsquove not changed their courses. It\u0026rsquos time to really wake up and realise LGBT kids are looking for something more specific to them, but we don\u0026rsquot need to exclude each other. Why are we only discussing man and woman? Why are we not discussing two men and two women as well? By discussing it all in the classroom it makes it the norm for every child, and hopefully makes it the norm when they go out into society."},{"url":null,"title":"profile-the-single-finger-salute-from-the-hand-of-god-that-went-around-the-world","story":"              TYPICAL Maradona. It may be many years since he last kicked - or, for England fans with long and unforgiving memories, handled - a ball in anger, but he still has the knack of attracting media attention.  At the World Cup in Russia, he is a mere spectator, but his florid gestures and undignified behaviour - plus, let\u0027s be honest, the fact that he was one of the greatest footballers ever - have generated scores of headlines across the world.  He made a one-finger gesture on both hands after Argentina scored a second goal against Nigeria at Saint Petersburg Stadium. Gary Lineker and Rio Ferdinand publicly indicated their distaste, and Lineker observed: \"There\u0027s a danger he\u0027s becoming a laughing stock, I\u0027m afraid.\"  At another game, Maradona was witnessed pulling his eyes to the side while glancing at South Korean fans. He smoked a cigar in a non-smoking stadium.  In his general exuberance he has leaned so far over balconies that his friends - or perhaps they were security personnel - had to place restraining hands on him to stop him from toppling over. Then there was a reported health scare, and a binge on white wine.  Given that Diego Maradona is a global ambassador for Fifa, and is paid at least \u0026pound10,000 plus expenses for each game he attends in that capacity, you can understand why the ruling body\u0027s generosity has come under scrutiny in recent days.  The USA Today newspaper said midweek that it was clear that the 57 year old is a \"troubled man, whose problems are not helped by having him at front and centre of a global spotlight\", and who, after years of excess, is now a caricature of his former celebrity self yet feels the pressure to live up to it.  The player\u0027s former agent, Jon Smith, told the BBC: \u0026ldquoHe quite enjoys being a parody of himself at times. Diego is a really high-energy guy and has always been that way. His problem at the moment is he doesn\u0026rsquot sleep so he takes these sleeping pills. And if he interacts with other substances during the days, such as alcohol, it has an effect on him. I just hope one day he doesn\u0026rsquot do something stupidly excessive and something silly happens.  Maradona was an outrageously talented football player. What he could do with the ball, sportswriter Marcela Mora y Araujo wrote in  this week, \"was proof if any were needed that football at its best is an art form. His entire being, body and mind, could do with a ball what the greatest composers in history have done with musical notes, the most notable artists with a brush and some paint, the best writers with words, pen and paper. Diego \u0027rewrote the 10 commandments of football\u0027 and performed miracles. His ability to rotate his ankle 360 degrees was matched by his peripheral vision, able to make out detail and movement all around him.\"  In the 1986 World Cup quarter finals in Mexico, Maradona scored twice in the space of a few minutes to enable Argentina to beat England 2-1. The first goal saw him challenge England goalkeeper Peter Shilton for the ball - and fist it home with his self-declared \u0027Hand of God\u0027. The second goal, however, saw him receive the ball in his own half and surge unstoppably towards Shilton, leaving a trail of players in his wake before scoring. \"It was a tremendous effort, and the man is a genius,\" England manager Bobby Robson acknowledged afterwards. Argentina went on to beat West Germany to lift the trophy.  Maradona was raised in a shanty town outside Buenos Aires. Legend has it that he once fell into an open sewer and had to be rescued by an uncle. He was a talented footballer from an early age and he made his debut with Argentinos Juniors, in 1976, shortly before his 16th birthday. In 1981 he signed for Boca Juniors, where he enhanced his reputation. Spanish giants Barcelona paid a then-world record transfer fee to secure his services, a feat repeated when he went to Italian club Napoli two years later. After playing in his native country again until 1997 he managed a number of clubs, and coached the Argentina national team at the 2010 World Cup.  Maradona\u0027s individual brilliance has led to him being declared as the greatest footballer ever. Lionel Messi has been quoted as saying: \u0026ldquoEven if I played for a million years, I\u0027d never come close to Maradona. He\u0027s the greatest there\u0027s ever been.  Maradona chronicled his turbulent life and occasional anarchistic streaks in his gripping 2004 autobiography, El Diego. Much has been made over the years of his health problems and his ballooning weight, his flirtations with Fidel Castro and Venezuela\u0027s Hugo Chavez. In 2004 - obese, and addicted to cocaine - he came close to death.  One Argentinian sports editor now says that many in the country are disappointed with Maradona\u0027s single-finger gesture and believe it does not put Argentina in a good light abroad.  But Maradona is as Maradona does. London-based sportswriter Matt Dickinson, who knows him well, said this week that Maradona has never compromised or played by the rules, and is unlikely to start now. Nor does he give a damn to those who found the sight of him in Russia as sad, boorish or pathetic.  \"To meet him, to experience the charisma first hand,\" writes Dickinson, \"is to be captivated by one of the most compelling figures in the history of sport, with all his greatness, chaos and defiance.\""},{"url":null,"title":"phew-what-a-scorcher-heres-how-scotscorchio-really-affected-scotland","story":"              YES, it\u0026rsquos been hot - but it\u0026rsquos going to get hotter. And windier, wetter, stormier and, yes, colder.  Those are the warnings from climate change experts in the wake of last week\u0026rsquos very high temperatures. The vagaries of the interactions between the world\u0026rsquos complex meteorological system and humanity\u0026rsquos carbon pollution mean that the weather in Scotland in the future will be more chaotic, more extreme and more dangerous, they say.  Last week\u0026rsquos sweltering hot spell caused trains to be cancelled or delayed to prevent rails buckling, forest wildfires, police warnings about leaving pets in hot cars and official pleas to use water wisely. It also caused black goo to melt and dribble down the supposedly weather-proof roof of the Glasgow Science Centre.  But there have also been some upsides. This year\u0026rsquos strawberry and raspberry crops are expected to be exceptionally good, non-polluting solar power has been breaking all records and \u0026ndash apart from those on the east coast shrouded in haar \u0026ndash most people have been enjoying the sun.  According to the Met Office, the hottest place in Scotland on Thursday was Bishopton in Renfrewshire, where the mercury reached 31.9 degrees in the shade. That\u0026rsquos not far off the highest June temperature ever recorded in Scotland, which was 32.2 degrees at Ochtertyre in Perth and Kinross back in 1893.  Several other places recorded temperatures of 30 degrees or over on Thursday, including Tyndrum in Stirling, Aviemore in Highland, Strathallan in Perthshire and Braemar in Aberdeenshire. The lowest maximum on the Scottish mainland was Inverbervie on the north east coast at 20.4 degrees.  It was much cooler however, on the northern isles, with Kirkwall on Orkney only reaching 17.7 degrees, Fair Isle 14.5 degrees and Unst in Shetland 14.3 degrees. The place to register the lowest maximum on Thursday - 11.7 degrees - was Sule Skerry, a tiny island 60 kilometres west of Orkney (see table below).  The Met Office confirmed that June had been unusually hot. Scotland\u0026rsquos average daily maximum temperature up to June 27 was 17 degrees, two degrees higher than the June average since 1910.  It was similarly hot in June 2010, but hotter in June 1970. The highest June temperatures since records began was in 1940, when the average daily maximum reached 18.8 degrees.  Professor James Curran, a certified meteorologist and the former chief executive of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa), has been measuring the temperature in his garden at Uddingston. On Thursday it reached 34.3 degrees.  That would make it the highest ever recorded in Scotland in June - except that it wasn\u0026rsquot an official measurement done in accordance with Met Office protocols.  Curran chairs the government-funded body aiming to prepare for global warming, Climate Ready Clyde.  \u0026ldquoWe have identified heat as an issue we need to prepare for in Scotland, he said.  \u0026ldquoIt can cause wildfires and also seriously disrupt rail travel. Both of those have been experienced in the last few days with a huge moorland fire near Manchester, which also caused heavy air pollution, and cancellation of trains at Glasgow Central Station. There have also been numerous health warnings issued recently.  Climate predictions suggested that summers are likely to be around four degrees hotter in Scotland in the 2080s, Curran pointed out. \u0026ldquoThe hottest days will be even warmer and be around six to eight degrees hotter than now, he said.  \u0026ldquoOver the last 100 years the frequency of heatwaves across Europe has already trebled. We should remember how dangerous extreme heat can be \u0026ndash since around 40,000 people died in the European heat wave of 2003, with more than 2,000 in England.  Curran highlighted how variable the weather was becoming, with Storm Hector bringing unusually high winds earlier in June and a long, cold winter with severe blizzards. \u0026ldquoClimate change could well be driving this variability, he told the Sunday Herald.  Because the Arctic has been warming much faster than elsewhere on the planet, the temperature difference between mid and high latitudes is declining. This causes the jet stream, a powerful high altitude wind that usually brings mild weather, to weaken and meander, he explained.  \u0026ldquoThese meanders allowed the jet stream to drift south in winter \u0026ndash hence we were in the cold air on the northern side and experienced snow and frost. Now it has drifted way north, providing us with extreme heat.  Friends of the Earth Scotland warned that the weather was giving \u0026ldquovery clear signals that our climate is changing. \u0026ldquoAs records tumble we enter new territory and we should be worried, said the environmental group\u0026rsquos director, Dr Richard Dixon.  \u0026ldquoSome extra summer heat is no doubt welcome for many but the bigger picture is of more energy in the global atmosphere leading to bigger storms, more floods and more severe heatwaves.  There have been days of cancellations and delays on on the railway network, with problems with points at Paisley triggering further problems on Friday morning. \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore really sorry to our customers whose journeys have been disrupted over the past few days, said a spokesperson for the Scotrail Alliance.  According to Network Rail, tracks in direct sunshine could heat to as much as 50 degrees, causing expansion and risking buckling. Slowing down trains helps to reduce the pressure of the tracks, and some are painted white to reflect the heat.  Forest Enterprise Scotland reported two wildfires last week. One near Fauldhouse in West Lothian on Wednesday required 50 firefighters and the other was in north Scotland.  Land managers have been warned of a high fire risk due to the dry weather. \u0026ldquoOur advice to people is to use their common sense, and to be particularly careful when out in the forests, said a spokesperson for the government agency.  Scottish Water is monitoring water supplies across Scotland closely. \u0026ldquoWe have issued advice to customers to use water wisely in two localised areas, parts of Moray and the Stornoway area of Lewis, said a spokesperson.  \u0026ldquoThe advice was issued in these areas because of prolonged dry weather and lower than normal levels in the River Spey, from which water in most of Moray is sourced, and lower than normal levels in a loch that supplies Stornoway water treatment works.  Sepa is planning to tour north and north-east Scotland to advise farmers and others how to reduce their use of water from lochs and rivers. \u0026ldquoOur staff are prioritising visits to catchments with lower water levels to assess and mitigate any potential environmental impacts, said the agency\u0026rsquos chief officer, John Kenny.  \u0026ldquoWith further hot weather forecast over the coming week, we continue to monitor the situation with partners across Scotland, and will work closely with water users to ensure that the environment and other water users are not impacted as a result of this dry spell.  The National Farmers Union in Scotland described the prolonged dry spell as \u0026ldquoa welcome relief after 12 months of dreadful weather. \u0026ldquoThe quality of the winter fodder made to date is likely to have been tremendous and early reports on the soft fruit harvest suggests exceptional quality, said NFU Scotland president, Andrew McCornick.  \u0026ldquoI am always wary when discussing the downside of warm weather in Scotland, as it is such a rarity. That being said, many parts will be hoping for a spot of rain in the next wee while.  National Grid, which distributes electricity across the UK, reported that generation from photovoltaic solar cells topped eight gigawatts for eight days in a row from 21-28 June. That\u0026rsquos a record, said a company spokesperson.  Some 533 gigawatt-hours of solar electricity was produced in a week, making up between 10 and 20 per cent of the UK\u0026rsquos electricity demand.  Conservationists urged people to be careful and to help wild animals in the heat. \u0026ldquoWildfires can have a devastating impact on wildlife during their breeding season, particularly ground nesting birds such as skylarks and meadow pipits, said Rory Syme from the Scottish Wildlife Trust.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquod urge people to be vigilant for fires and also to avoid lighting open fires during the current dry spell.  He pointed out that wildlife needed access to water and shelter in hot weather. \u0026ldquoPeople can help by leaving out water for birds and other animals in their gardens, making sure to replacing it every few days so it\u0026rsquos kept clean, he added.  \u0026ldquoShelter can be something as simple as a pile of logs or leaves, and more fastidious gardeners might want to invest in a purpose-built bug hotel. Keeping flowers well watered can help ensure that bees and other insects have access to pollen and nectar.

Cases of younger workers facing pay deductions were highlighted by the Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC).  Some staff are also being employed on \"bogus\" self employed contracts, the STUC said.  Young employees are particularly vulnerable to such employment conditions, it claimed.  In one case, a barista worker in a caf\u0026eacute in Glasgow was handed a contract stating that she was an \u0026lsquoindependent contractor\u0026rsquo and therefore in charge of her own National Insurance and tax payments, the STUC added.

But his rivals warn that a victory by leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador could set the country back decades with an interventionist economic policy and are also promising to fight corruption and bring change to Mexico.  All the candidates are lambasting US president Donald Trump\u0026rsquos policies against migrants and Mexico.  Sunday\u0026rsquos elections for posts at every level of government are Mexico\u0026rsquos largest ever and have become a referendum on corruption and other tricks used to divert taxpayer money to officials\u0026rsquo pockets and empty those of the country\u0026rsquos poor.  It is Mr Lopez Obrador\u0026rsquos third bid for the presidency and some see it as his best shot after 12 years of near-permanent campaigning.  His railing against the \u0026ldquomafia of power that has long ruled Mexico and in favour of the poor appears to be falling on receptive ears with polls showing him with a wide lead over three rivals who have failed to ignite voters\u0026rsquo interest.  \u0026ldquoThe corrupt regime is coming to its end, Mr Lopez Obrador, a 64-year-old commonly known as AMLO, said at his final campaign event on Wednesday. \u0026ldquoWe represent modernity forged from below.  Much of the popular ire has been aimed at unpopular president Enrique Pena Nieto\u0026rsquos Institutional Revolutionary Party.  Its candidate, Jose Antonio Meade, failed to gain traction with voters who would not give him the benefit of the doubt in spite of his ample resume in government and being an outsider to the ruling party.  Ricardo Anaya is the candidate of a right-left coalition. He has tried to harness the youth vote with an emphasis on technology and new ideas, but he divided his own conservative party to take its candidacy and it is unclear if his new allies in the leftist Democratic Revolution Party will actually turn out for someone from the other end of the ideological spectrum.  Juan Carlos Enriquez, 30, said he supports Mr Lopez Obrador but warned him that he better not steal.  \u0026ldquoOf course, I want him to win. But it has to be made clear that he has to deliver what he promises and not become like the rest, he said.  Hovering over the election is the spectre of vote fraud, though electoral officials deny it is a possibility with the modern balloting technology and institutions now in place.

In his first loss \u0026mdash by a mere 0.56% to conservative Felipe Calderon in 2006 \u0026mdash his supporters held months-long protests in Mexico City and he referred to himself as \u0026ldquothe legitimate president.  His allies are warning even before Sunday\u0026rsquos presidential vote that there better not be any funny business.  \u0026ldquoThey shouldn\u0026rsquot dare commit a fraud, because if they do they will meet the devil, said Yeidckol Polevnsky, president of Mr Lopez Obrador\u0026rsquos Morena party. \u0026ldquoWe will not accept it."},{"url":null,"title":"business success for kintore couple","story":"\t\t\t\tDonna and Jason Orton, who have been helped by Business Gateway Aberdeen City \u0026amp Shire, opened the doors to their unique business in Abercrombie Court, Westhill, just over a year ago.

The appeal has already reached £2.2million, with the charity now encouraging community fundraisers to set their targets in £1,000 segments, or ‘bricks’ as part of the Brick by Brick campaign - each £1,000 raised equates to one brick in the new centre. Emma Leiper Finlayson, Capital Appeal Manager for Sue Ryder Dee View Court said: “There’s a desperate need for unified neurological care in Scotland and our waiting list increases all the time.  We urgently need to expand, and our Dee View appeal is the first step in Sue Ryder’s strategy to care for more people who need help to live well and thrive across Scotland.“Since launching the appeal, we have been overwhelmed and delighted with the response from the community. In particular, the Brick by Brick initiative, which has been a fantastic platform to engage local companies and schools in some fun and creative fundraising. By buying a brick for the extension they are quite literally helping us build brighter futures for people in their community.“Of course, our residents have been involved in the appeal too, with one recently taking part in the Aberdeen Kiltwalk with her family, whilst other residents have encouraged their friends and family to undertake challenges, such as the Great Aberdeen Run. We regularly get our residents together to brainstorm fundraising ideas and they have been tracking progress there’s a real buzz each time we reach a new milestone.”                                                                                                        To support the Sue Ryder Dee View Court Appeal visit www.sueryder.org/deeviewappeal or send a cheque made out to ‘Sue Ryder’ to: Sue Ryder Dee View Court, Caiesdykes Road, Kincorth, Aberdeen, AB12 5JY.For more information on how to involved with Brick by Brick, visit: www.sueryder.org/brickbybrick.

During questions in the Commons, he asked the Minister for Universities, Science, Research and Innovation what the UK Government is doing to increase the take-up of STEM subjects - guaranteeing a generation of well-equipped workers.        Scottish Conservative Mr Clark said: “The Oil \u0026amp Gas Technology Centre in Aberdeen is a major promoter of STEM subjects.“Does the Minister agree that it is essential to prioritise the take-up of STEM subjects if we are to have the engineers and technicians that we need for the future?”Sam Gyimah MP said the English school system had welcomed 17% more entrants to STEM A-levels since 2010, adding:“However, there is clearly a lot more to do, which is why we are focused on doing a lot through careers and through the university system.”                                                                                                        The UK Government is investing an additional £406 million in skills, including maths and digital, including an advanced maths premium, and an £84 million programme to improve the teaching of computing.After the session, Mr Clark said Scotland is behind England in science, maths and reading.He added: “There is also a shortage of STEM teachers in Scotland and it risks undermining children’s opportunities, including at Inverurie Academy in my constituency.“We have to catch up with England and re-establish the world-class education system we once had.                                                                                                        “That’s why it’s disappointing the SNP have deprioritised its education Bill.\"                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"encouraging prospects for beef and sheep markets","story":"\t\tThe transformation in the weather since mid-May and the consequent quick growth of grass has given Aberdeen and Northern Marts\u0026#8217 sales of breeding stock a massive boost in recent weeks.\t\t\t\tThe average price of heifers with calves at foot at the latest sale at Thainstone Centre was £150 up on the first seasonal sale at the beginning of May and £350 higher than last year, ANM head of livestock, John Angus reports.                                                    “It is encouraging that we have had more buyers round the ring at the May breeding stock sales and good quality heifers with calves at foot have been making £2,400 to £3,000 a unit,” said Mr Angus.                                                    “We had very little grass growth at the time of the first sale but the situation had completely changed by the time of the next sale three weeks later.”        Mr Angus said the strong trade indicated that confidence was returning to the beef industry and it was good to see herds replacing breeding stock on the back of buoyant prices for store cattle and a measure of stability in the prime cattle market.Highlights included a record price of 13,000gns for a Simmental bull at the spring bull sale at Thainstone and a heifer and calves selling for up to £5,200.“The prospects for the beef market for the second half of the year are looking good, but there are real concerns about the rising cost of fodder and straw due to the diversion of distillery co-products into the energy market and the switch to ryegrass on some farms to feed anaerobic digesters,” he said. “We could do with some rain to make sure silage crops bulk up although some farmers have been cutting grass early for silage out of fear of grass burning up.”Although some older farmers were tending to cut back breeding cow numbers to make life easier for themselves, there were fewer suckler herd dispersals this spring and very few cows and calves have been coming on the market.                                                                                                        Prime and cull cattle manager, Tim McDonald, expects the steady trade for prime cattle to continue and perhaps strengthen in the next few weeks and reports a particularly strong trade for fleshy cull cows. He is looking to England’s involvement in the World Cup in Russia, coupled with the forecast of good weather, to stimulate barbecue parties south of the border and boost the burger market.“The cull cow market has shown a big lift since April when farmers were too busy trying to catch up with drilling and the late spring. Demand for good, fleshy cows for the processing market is particularly strong and we have seen prices hit a top of £1,830,” said Mr McDonald.He also suggests it would be worthwhile for dairy farmers to consider feeding cull dairy cows to put on more flesh rather than marketing them in lean condition at the end of lactation.“The auction system is leading the way in cull cow prices and dairy farmers have the opportunity of making more money from well-fleshed cull dairy cows to supplement their income from milk,” he said.                                                                                                        The first real marker of the new season will be the show and sale of store cattle at Thainstone Centre on Friday, July 13, and as always some of the top suckled calves and stores from the summer shows will be on offer at the annual Spectacular show and sale on August 24.Turning to the sheep market, the phenomenal market for old season lamb continued right through the spring and ANM’s weekly sale at Thainstone Centre was still attracting up to 2,000 head right to the end of May.Prices peaked on April 5 when 4,782 head averaged 284.3p/kg (£126.21/head) with record numbers the following week attracting a massive entry of 7,952 to average 250.5p (£109.72/head).“The strongly rising market saw the auction ring come into its own as prices increased week after week,” said deputy livestock manager, Colin Slessor. “The level of prices achieved would never have been attained without the auction system leading the way and resulting in the strongest spring market for sheep we have seen for many years.“Those hoggs will have been bought in the trough of last autumn’s store trade when prices were down £5/head on the year. Finishers have enjoyed the double benefit of a lower purchase price and a high sale price which will have boosted margins and should augur well for this year’s autumn store lamb sales.”                                                                                                        Trade is being driven by a combination of strong demand, both on the home market and for the export market to Europe, and reduced imports from New Zealand.This season’s prime lamb market has started off on a high with some lambs hitting £130 - £140/head, and the cull ewe trade also rising sharply, peaking at £200 with pure Texels and Suffolks realising £170 - £190/head.The prospects remain encouraging and numbers will start building up from July onwards. Again, the auction system will be a vital element in ensuring producers achieve the best price available on the market.Despite weather problems during lambing, many farms are reporting a good lambing and good lamb numbers. The fantastic weather through May has transformed the performance of lambs as grass growth has taken off and lambs are set to reach the market early and in good order.The availability of grass has also triggered the market for ewes with lambs at foot with prices up around £10/head. Mule hoggs with single lambs have been making up to £140/head.“The strong prime market will hopefully impact positively on store markets which were in the doldrums last autumn,” says Mr Slessor.“The store lamb trade has been buoyant and prices have increased significantly, with finishers achieving good margins on last year’s lambs. Lamb producers in the Highlands and Islands certainly need a lift in price to give them a much needed boost following last year’s disappointing autumn trade.”With more ewe lambs being culled this year, rather than retained for breeding, trade and demand for gimmers is also likely to be stronger.Aberdeen and Northern Marts’ auction staff look forward to meeting customers at the forthcoming summer shows. The mart will have stands at the New Deer, Caithness, Turriff, Black Isle and Keith shows where auctioneers and field staff will be present to discuss the prospects for the autumn trade.

A £1.5bn package of improvements making it easier for people moving onto Universal Credit was announced in the Budget. People applying to Universal Credit can now receive a 100% advance on their first payment and the 7-day waiting period for new claimants was removed earlier this year. Among other improvements, from April 2018 the Government also continues to pay Housing Benefit claimants’ rent for two weeks - which is non-recoverable - when moving onto Universal Credit.Minister for Employment Alok Sharma said: “Universal Credit is central to our commitment to help families improve their lives by moving into work.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin.

The crew also carried out maintenance work on lights and lanterns.As time went by the vessel was employed in the conversion of automated lighthouses to solar panel operation. When this work was completed in 1996, the ship was taken out of service.An initiative was later launched to preserve the vessel as a floating cultural monument.This ship is representative of a type of specialised vessel from a unique period in the history of Norwegian lighthouses and is open to the public today, Wednesday, afternoon 2pm-6pm, the again from 10am-Noon and 2pm \u0026#8211 6pm on Thursday.More details about the visit of the ship in The Orcadian next week.\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

His first order of priority, however, must be the unfinished business of implementing cheaper ferry fares on ferry routes serving Orkney and Shetland.“Having already waited a decade since the government first introduced RET on west coast routes, people in the Northern Isles should not have to wait any longer.“The First Minister promised RET in the first half of 2018. That means Michael Matheson must deliver before parliament rises for the summer recess at the end of this week.”Mr Halcro Johnston says that the Northern Isles have been left in limbo by the RET uncertainties, adding that he has written to Mr Matheson in a bid to see the RET commitment delivered.He said: “The new transport secretary has just days to implement RET for ferry fares to Orkney and Shetland, in line with commitment made by his predecessor and after years of promises from the SNP.“The constant delays we have seen regarding RET have caused real uncertainty in the Northern Isles and have left residents and visitors unable to plan journeys knowing what the eventual costs will be.\u0026#8221\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

All we are now waiting for is confirmation that it’s fully legal and then we can get on with implementing it. Our lawyers have told us that because we are a commercial operation and currently receive no subsidy whatsoever, we have to be 100 per cent sure that this scheme complies otherwise our whole business is at risk. We are not sure why it is taking so long to get simple confirmation.“Although not one penny of the proposed subsidy comes to us, it goes directly to the passenger, we would be forced to pay it all back if it doesn’t comply, that could ruin us and we can’t take that risk. All we are asking for is for the Scottish Government to check that it’s legal with the EU and UK and then we can get on with it. We have written to the new Minister Michael Matheson MSP and invited him to visit the island and meet our staff so we can share our concerns with him directly and hopefully he will visit soon so we can get this unlocked.“We have also today asked for a meeting with our local MSP Liam McArthur to see if he can do anything to get things moving forward on our behalf. This is extremely frustrating but as a family run, fully commercial Orcadian business, employing 70 people and with exciting expansion plans, we cannot put at risk our business until we are certain the Scottish Government’s proposal fully comply.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Blind from the age of seven as the result of smallpox, the legendary Blind Piper was a pupil of the great MacCrimmon of Skye, going on to compose perhaps the finest piobaireachd ever.The aim of the festival is to encourage pipers under the age of 18 to participate in friendly and relaxing competitions.

It also found that 62 per cent of posts are in professional occupations.Eilean Siar, Glasgow and Highland are the three areas with the highest number of jobs in which Gaelic is considered essential, together accounting for 93 per cent of the Scottish total.The study was welcomed by Deputy First Minister, John Swinney, who commented that the growth in desirable and essential jobs making use of Gaelic language would provide young people with a wealth of exciting career choices.\"I hope that this report will encourage more people to consider learning Gaelic,\" he added.As well as looking at the demand for Gaelic language skills, the report looks at Gaelic education, analyses the opportunities and challenges, and suggests future action.Damien Yeates, chief Executive of SDS, said: \"Developing a detailed evidence base of current and future skills demand is essential for all parts of our economy, and the Gaelic language labour market is no exception.\"Last year SDS published the second edition of its Gaelic language plan, and this study was one of the key commitments contained in that plan.\"The evidence will help inform future investment aimed at promoting the Gaelic language and culture.\"Shona MacLennan, chief executive of B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig, commented: \"B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig is clear that growing the number of Gaelic-essential jobs and jobs which use Gaelic is important in ensuring that Gaelic is used more often, by more people and in a wider range of situations.\"The key challenge is to ensure that the flow of people with high quality Gaelic language skills entering the labour market is matched to the demand from employers across the public, private and third sectors, and from across Scotland.\"\u0026nbspFuture actions proposed in the report include forming a national group with responsibility for Gaelic language skills, and increased monitoring and evaluation of the activities supporting the language.Charlotte Wright, Chief Executive of Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), said: \"Gaelic is fundamental to HIE\u0026rsquos unique remit which integrates economic and community development throughout the Highlands and Islands.\"Our support has helped numerous organisations which enable Gaelic to flourish, and we look forward to continuing to work with businesses, social enterprises and community organisations that can add value through using Gaelic to help realise its full potential.\"Sunday 1 Jul 2018 8:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Most damaging of all, Loganair noted, was the announcement by Flybe that it was entering a new franchise agreement with Eastern Airways and would compete head-to-head on six routes.            Despite the turbulence, Loganair booked record turnover of £110.7m, a rise of 7 per cent. Passenger numbers were up 6.2 per cent to an all-time high of 812,541, but the load factor – the percentage of seats filled on scheduled flights – fell from 62.8 per cent to 59.8 per cent, due to the overcapacity on routes with Flybe competition. Just under 78 per cent of flights ran on time.Chairman David Harrison said: “This year’s results bring to an end 17 consecutive years in profit for Loganair, and the fact that we forecast last year that we would be loss-making in 2017/18 makes it no less painful.“The extent of the loss is a direct result of competition on six of our eight largest routes, and from the outset we maintained that the markets on these routes were simply not big enough to sustain the level of seat capacity being introduced. This indeed proved to the case.“However, these costs are non-recurring, and Loganair is now on the front foot and ready for a successful year ahead.”Managing director Jonathan Hinkles added: “In a challenging year, I’m delighted to say that the transition from franchise partner to an airline operating in its own right was completed on schedule.            “In the last 12 months we have transformed our operation with wholesale changes to our reservations, revenue accounting and check-in systems.“We have carried out a full rebrand, repainted our aircraft in tartan livery, introduced new crew and ground staff uniform, brought in a comprehensive system of service improvements for our customers and launched a significant sales and marketing programme.“I’m equally pleased to be able to report that the response from our customers to these developments has been extremely positive.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4754753.1528987528!/image/image.jpg","title":"in pictures how to make your own scottish morning rolls","story":"\t\tMorning rolls are one of Scotland\u0026#8217s best loved foods, Scottish food writer Fraser Wright provides a recipe on how to make your own.\t\t\t\tYou need to start these the night before you want to eat them, however they last well and toast very well too.            What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4762229.1530378449!/image/image.jpg","title":"dani garavelli bring me the head of malcolm tucker dire","story":"\t\tThere was a time, or so I am told, when the SNP was so paranoid about the image it projected that an MSP was given a dressing down for expressing an interest in attending a tongue-in-cheek anti-monarchy event on the day of the 2011 Royal Wedding.\t\t\t\tBack then, the party’s control freakery was often mocked as excessive. But, boy, could it have used a dose of that last week when a long-overdue reshuffle was transformed from a PR opportunity to a PR disaster.            At the epicentre of the disaster was the appointment of Gillian Martin as university minister, only for her to be dumped after a couple of blog posts she wrote back in 2007 re-entered the public domain.             Though the views in those posts were less-than-palatable – one of them referred to “hairy-knuckled, lipstick wearing transgender laydees”, the other suggested black men were poor tippers – I have a degree of sympathy for Martin. Those words were written 11 years ago and people whose judgment I trust say her anti-diversity comments are at odds with the politician they have come to know. She has an impressive track record as an MSP, particularly on period poverty, and would no doubt have been a capable junior minister. But the handling of her appointment – the failure to foresee her blog posts would be problematic because equality and diversity are near the top of the Scottish Government’s agenda, the issuing of the cack-handed apology, and boxing themselves into a position where they had no choice but to drop Martin at the very last minute – suggests something is awry at the heart of the SNP spin machineEven before the Martin debacle, the signs were there. First of all there was John Swinney’s apparent attempt to bury the shelving of his flagship Education Reform Bill by announcing it on the day of the reshuffle. Then, there was an unnecessarily long gap between the announcement of the first departures and the announcement of the first appointments. This allowed the treatment of Keith Brown, who was sacked as economy secretary, despite insisting he could combine the cabinet post with his new role of deputy leader, and Shona Robison, who was either sacked or stood down as health secretary, to dominate the agenda. As the minutes turned into hours, the news vacuum was filled with Labour politicians and spin doctors gloating and picking over the corpses of the newly departed. There was plenty of time for an outpouring of faux concern over Brown’s £30,000-plus drop in salary, a reprisal of all the gory details of Robison’s domestic life and some musing over the toll Nicola Sturgeon’s decision to replace her might take on their long-standing personal friendship.In the end, the reshuffle, which had already been delayed a year by Theresa May’s snap general election, dragged into Wednesday, when the junior ministers were finally announced. It was then that the whole shebang moved from mildly shambolic to bring-me-the-head-of-Malcolm-Tucker dire.            Even if Martin’s blog – called Misssy M Misssives and written while she was a college lecturer – had been stowed at the back of her closet, there would have been little excuse for the party not to be aware of their existence candidates for the role of MSP are supposed to undergo close vetting, where they reveal any information that might prove problematic at a later date. But the existence of the blog posts was not a secret: in fact the one about the “hairy-knuckled laydees” emerged in the run-up to the Holyrood election in 2016 when Liberal Democrat rival Christine Jardine used it to challenge Martin’s suitability as a candidate. So why wasn’t this revelation followed up to see if there was more where it came from? And why wasn’t it all flagged up as an almost inevitable source of embarrassment in advance of the reshuffle? That way, perhaps, if she remained committed to appointing Martin, Sturgeon could have gone in armed with a strategy to counter criticism from opponents, many of whom are no great champions of the transgender community, but are happy enough to pretend they’re “woke” if they spy a scalp ripe for the claiming.No matter how much you want to credit Martin for her work post-election, some of her posts were offensive. Written when she was 39, they cannot be downplayed as a youthful folly.            The one that had already come to public attention is a diatribe which mocks universities for allegedly exploiting students from minority groups, including those who are blind, to gain funds and bolster their right-on credentials. It goes on to suggest transgender students are “the next funding and publicity cash cow” and refers to the EU’s “tranny trove”.Given LGBTI issues are at the heart of the SNP’s policy-making and given transgenderism is currently the most flammable of topics, it is hard to see how the party ever thought Martin’s appointment would pass unremarked.And yet, once the storm broke, it allowed the Aberdeenshire East MSP to issue a hastily penned apology in which she averred: “I expressed myself in a way that did not reflect my view then and certain [sic] does not reflect my view now.” The obvious riposte to that – so obvious it should have been predicted – was: “If you weren’t sincere back then, why should anyone believe you now?”A better approach would surely have been to have talked about Martin’s “journey”. The MSP could have explained how the indyref politicised her how reading up on trans issues had brought her to a greater understanding of the issue (claims, incidentally, many in the party believe to be the truth). Meanwhile, others could have told how she pushed for Women for Independence to be trans-inclusive they could have highlighted the worthwhile issues she has campaigned on.In the hours after the Times story about the blog was published on Thursday morning, the First Minister stuck to her guns it was only at midday – an hour after her office was informed of the “black people don’t tip” comments – that it became clear Martin’s name had been taken off the list. By then, of course, Sturgeon must have known opposition MSPs planned to oppose her appointment when asked to endorse the new ministers .             The furore has serious personal consequences for Martin, who has faced public humiliation, and it has overshadowed some of the better reshuffle news: the appointment of the widely respected Jeane Freeman as health secretary, for example, and the replacement of the underwhelming mental health minister Maureen Watt with Clare Haughey, a psychiatric nurse, who still works on a voluntary basis in her spare time.More seriously, perhaps, because recess has already begun, it means the Scottish Government will spend the summer, the time when students receive their exam results and university admissions are finalised, without a university minister.Though it is possible to argue opposition MSPs behaved cynically, it is nevertheless a political and PR cock-up that you can’t imagine happening just a few years ago. It makes you wonder if it’s not just the cabinet and junior ministers that are in need of a good shake-up."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4762253.1530388812!/image/image.jpg","title":"sturgeon s power vacuum alarms education sector","story":"\t\tNicola Sturgeon has been urged to replace Gillian Martin as a matter of \u0026#8220urgency\u0026#8221 as education experts warned that her sacking had left a vacuum at the heart of government.\t\t\t\tMartin’s unexpected departure as further and higher education minister led to warnings from academics, trade unions and student leaders that leadership was required at a crucial time for the education sector.            Having proposed that Martin should be made a new minister in last week’s reshuffle, Sturgeon was forced to withdraw her nomination when it emerged she had made a series of offensive blog posts.            Her withdrawal has left the post vacant as teenagers are waiting for Higher results and the Scottish Government is supposed to be concentrating on widening access to university for poorer entrants.Professor Lindsay Paterson of Edinburgh University, one of Scotland’s foremost education experts who has advised the Scottish Parliament, said the position that Martin was to have held was a “very important post”.He said the sector was undergoing major changes including moves to widen access, close the attainment gap between rich and poor and a debate about funding for colleges. “I think it would certainly help [if Gillian Martin was replaced soon],” Paterson told Scotland on Sunday. “When people talk about the attainment gap – the social class related attainment gap –  the thing that is probably prominent in most people’s minds is widening access to university, especially to the older universities.             “Some of the initiatives the government has taken are attempting to address that and some of the criticism of the government has said it is not enough. It is absolutely at the heart of the debate and it continues. “One of the most intense periods of debate about this is the summer when the Highers results come out, \u2028and then when new students start arriving at university and the new cycle of university applications starts in the autumn. It is a very good opportunity for a prominent politician to stimulate debate and it would be a pity if there was to be a vacuum there.”Liam McCabe, president of the National Union of Students, Scotland, said a new minister had to be appointed as soon as possible.“It is vital that the government prioritises appointing a new minister as a matter of urgency,” said McCabe. “There are a number of opportunities that require immediate ministerial attention. Universities are falling short of their widening access targets, there’s a growing mental health crisis on our campuses, and we need to see steps taken towards achieving the government’s newly announced ambition to give every student a support package tied to the real living wage.”            Martin’s promotion was reversed on the last day of the Holyrood term after details of a blog mocking trans people and discussing the restaurant tipping habits of “blacks” and “Jews” were publicised.Sturgeon took the decision not to put her nomination before parliament when it became clear it would not secure widespread parliamentary support. With Holyrood now in recess for two months, Martin’s successor cannot be formally approved unless parliament is recalled. In the meantime, the Scottish Government has said a “minister designate” could be appointed. However concerns have been expressed that such an arrangement would see the new appointee lack legal status.Sturgeon’s spokesman said the position would be filled “in due course”. He added: “As Education Secretary, the Deputy First Minister [John Swinney] will be in charge of all of these things in the meantime.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 19 ","story":"Shetland’s young sports competitors retained their hold on the Stuart Cup at the weekend, with the margin of victory, in the end, being fairly comfortable.\nGoing into the last event of the junior inter-county, the netball, Orkney had to win by 32 points to overhaul the visitors’ lead. Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"kia pro ceed ","story":"3dr Kia pro-ceed sr7, 4 year warranty remaining, one owner, full Kia service history, VGC inside \u0026amp out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve. My line-up is: Russia v Portugal, Spain v Uruguay, France v Argentina, Croatia v Denmark, Brazil v Sweden, Belgium v Japan, Germany v Switzerland and Senegal v England.\n: : : : : : : :\nThere has already been a healthy entry for our competition to name Shetland’s greatest football team of the past 60 years, but potential selectors still have a week and a half to make their minds up.\nThe main prize, a return trip for two people with car and cabin courtesy of NorthLink Ferries, is definitely not to be sneezed at. And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above. If the price of a stamp puts you off just email your entry to editorial@shetlandtimes\n: : : : : : : :\nEven those who detest cricket most may have raised a modest eyebrow last week when the Scottish team shocked England with victory in a one-day match at Edinburgh.\nReaders, whether they follow the game or not, may be interested that there was actually a player in the home side’s ranks with Shetland connections.\nA glance at the Scottish team sheet may suggest possible contenders – how about Michael Leask, Mark Watt or even Dylan Budge for instance?\nBut it was none of those. The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"health board in talks for better airport waiting area in aberdeen ","story":"NHS Shetland has been in talks to look at an alternative waiting area for patients flying back from Aberdeen Airport – rather than what has been described by a councillor as \u0026#8220a drafty corridor\u0026#8221.\nHealth board chief executive Ralph Roberts raised the issue during a Zetland Transport Partnership meeting on Tuesday afternoon.\nMr Roberts said there had been discussions with Loganair to look an alternative and he was having more talks about the matter on Friday.\nHe said there had been a suggestion that NHS Shetland should be obliged to pay for a lounge for passengers, but added in his own view it was a matter for all passengers travelling to Shetland.\nMr Roberts argued if the waiting area were adequate for all passengers it would be adequate for patients too.\nZetTrans chairman Ryan Thomson thanked Mr Roberts for bringing it to members\u0026#8217 attention.\nMr Thomson added \u0026#8220it\u0026#8217s a drafty corridor\u0026#8221, the issue had been raised at other transport meetings and Loganair was aware of the issue.\n\n \u0026raquo\nYet again, this is just so typical.

The skipper handled the situation extremely well.”\nThe 40-year-old converted fishing boat, with an all-female crew and female passengers, was heading to Shetland for a diving trip, and will be in the isles for the next few weeks.\n since January last year and has 22 years experience as a power boat instructor, said she called the coastguard as a precaution.\n was [originally] a fishing boat and well able for the conditions.”\nThe problem started when the boat began taking in water from the rudder gland and a deck hatch, she said. The boat was equipped with a three bilge-pump system but one of the pumps had failed, meaning they only had one as back-up. Ms Weaver said: “We try to be two failures away from a problem.” Also, she said, she had to “err on the side of caution” because the boat was carrying 12 passengers.\n was able to proceed “under her own power and pumping under her own power” into Lerwick. She is currently in the small boat harbour.\n and two sunken klondykers.\n is used for various types of dive trips, including recreational and wreck diving in locations in Orkney and Shetland, including Scapa Flow and Fair Isle as well as in northern Scotland and Faroe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}]
